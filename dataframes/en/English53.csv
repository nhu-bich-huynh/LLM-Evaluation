"To conserve resources in response to socio-economic and environmental conditions, further research in the areas of organic farming, extensive agricultural management and, above all, non-food production is essential."
"Developing knowledge in the use of renewables for energy and materials must be pursued as a survival strategy."
"As the report points out, priority should be given to improvements in yield security, quality of life and environmental compatibility."
"On-farm research is an indispensable tool in the integration of nature conservation and agriculture, and above all in the sustainable maintenance and use of organic habitats in the agricultural landscape."
"This report is intended to draw attention to the fact that agriculture research is also important for society and should be given greater priority."
"Again, I welcome this report on behalf of my group."
"At the vote in committee, greater priority was given to biotechnological research than was originally the case in the report, as we took the view at the outset that biotechnological research already has good programmes."
"A well-functioning rural environment is inseparably linked with a well-functioning system of agriculture."
"As a representative of farmers and rural regions, I welcome this report, and it is our genuine hope that these demands will finally be heard in the seventh framework programme for research."
"Mr President, the common agricultural policy is beginning the greatest transformation of its entire history; it would therefore be a serious mistake to keep research within parameters which have become obsolete."
"We must therefore change the approach we have taken so far to agricultural research."
"This is precisely the challenge faced by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in this European Parliament initiative report."
"He deals with it very sensibly in a report which I believe to be excellent."
"He essentially proposes that the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programme for Research should change in accordance with this new situation."
"The Commissioner has told us that the Sixth programme is being applied – and the report says this – but nevertheless I believe that we do have time for the Commissioner to introduce certain modifications relating to the role of women in rural development, as it appears he is going to do."
"It is also very important that the drawing up of this Seventh Framework Programme for Research should reflect this approach, which considers research into sustainable agriculture and rural development."
"Paragraph 2 is fundamental, proposing that at least half of the budget for food technology and agricultural research be dedicated to sustainable and practical research into the various farming systems, and I would therefore be grateful if the Commission could also provide for this allocation of at least half of the budget for this purpose."
"The report supports research intended to improve the quality and safety of foods from farm to table and stresses the importance of small-scale farming and of small- and medium-sized retailers."
"In this way a totally innovative potential is established, because we must remember that, until now, this small-scale agriculture had been completely forgotten."
"Small- and medium-sized retailers had also been forgotten in the intensive agriculture of the past and the immediate future."
"All of this had been relegated within research and is quite rightly what the rapporteur now advocates as a profound change, an approach which reconsiders agricultural research from top to bottom, as is necessary, in other words, reorienting research towards the service of agriculture in harmony with nature."
"For all of these reasons, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and ask the Commissioner to change this approach as soon as possible and allocate the funds requested today by the European Parliament."
"– Mr President, this own-initiative report on agriculture and agricultural research has my full support."
"I too take the view that the right approach has been adopted by addressing future-oriented issues on the basis of an analysis which preceded this own-initiative report."
"I hope, of course, as previous speakers have already said, that the Commission will draw the right conclusions, for the CAP reform in particular has brought about a paradigm shift in European agriculture and I hope that scientific monitoring will be effective here in future too."
"I think it is right, and would like to reiterate here, that the budget for the next framework programme has been set on the basis of proposed projects."
"I am unsure how the 2% is arrived at, but I think it probably conceals projects as well."
"In the settlement of the current programme, it will be very interesting to see exactly what has happened."
"Agricultural research is generally multiannual, and I have been told about projects undertaken within this multiannual research framework that have never entered their final phase due to budget cutbacks."
"The Member States are also very keen on cutting research funding."
"Yet any research that does not produce results is a waste of resources."
"In the previous debate, complex issues relating to more intensive research into income and income generation options were discussed in more detail."
"It will be very interesting to see how this will look in future, who will be dealing with it, and in which areas, under which conditions and with which assumptions."
"I too agree that the complex research areas of food and food safety must be addressed in particular."
"Everything else, however, has been set out so comprehensively in the report that it requires no further comment from me."
"Mr President, recent CAP reform will result in some fundamental changes, particularly at farm level."
"The decoupling of payments from production provides a new freedom to farm with, I hope, new opportunities."
"If we believe, as I do, that the European agricultural model must be multifunctional and sustainable, equally it must be commercially viable and competitive."
"On the basis that the sector is likely to enjoy budget stability until 2013, we must use this time to initiate practical research as to how best to achieve this objective."
"It would be foolish and foolhardy to believe that the current level of budget support for agriculture will continue indefinitely."
"What would happen if this unthinkable scenario became reality?"
"The only insurance is positive planning based on properly focused research."
"Two per cent of the current EU research budget for the entire agricultural sector does not facilitate the achievement of this objective."
"In conclusion, I congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question."
"Thank you very much, Mr Hyland."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0024/2004) by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the Northern hake stock (COM(2003) 374 – C5-0314/2003 – 2003/0137(CNS))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Souchet for producing this comprehensive report on the recovery of the Northern hake stock."
"The Council discussed the recovery plan for hake in December 2003 and accepts some of the proposed amendments set out in the report: firstly, we have now deleted fishing effort from the proposal."
"Secondly, we have reduced the minimum safe level according to the precautionary approach from 143 000 tonnes to 140 000, and the critical limit from 103 000 tonnes to 100 000, as recommended by the scientists."
"Despite these amendments, the objective remains the same."
"The aim is to restore Northern hake stocks to safe biological limits, which entails a number of measures."
"Firstly, we must set a critical limit below which, according to scientific advice, stocks would be at risk of collapse."
"We must also set guidelines on the establishment of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) based on a scientific evaluation."
"The TAC will be set according to the precautionary approach unless it results in a reduction in the biomass in any given year."
"If the size of the stock falls below the minimum level, the Council must reduce the TAC."
"However, the TAC may not vary by more than 15% year on year."
"Finally, the proposal also contains measures for more effective control of vessels catching North Sea hake, as well as provisions for the prior notification of landings."
"Landings of more than two tonnes of hake may only take place at authorised ports and stricter provisions on storage and transport also apply."
"So much for the proposal;"
"I will comment on the proposed amendments in my closing statement."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are delighted to have you with us."
"The Commission proposal establishing a plan for the recovery of the Northern hake stock is made by virtue of the new provisions laid down in the framework regulation reforming the CFP."
"This new legislation, which in principle covers species that are under particular threat, is combined with a new instrument, management by fishing effort, which comes on top of the instruments already in place, in particular the setting of TACs and quotas."
"Following the cod recovery plan, the Northern hake plan is the second of this type to be proposed by the Commission."
"It in fact turns out to be the second link in a long chain because, since it was tabled, two further plans with exactly the same structure have been referred to Parliament, concerning Southern hake, Norway lobster in the Cantabrian Sea and sole in the Bay of Biscay and the Channel, and we are told that further plans are in the pipeline, in respect in particular of Norway lobster and plaice."
"This point should be stressed, all the more so because it would seem that when a fishing undertaking fishes stocks under different recovery plans, it is obliged to comply with the provisions of all of the recovery plans concerned, both for catches from stocks subject to recovery measures and catches from stocks of similar species."
"This is what arises in particular from the written answer dated 9 February that you have just sent me, Commissioner, in response to a question that I had asked you."
"This is a particularly onerous constraint for the industry, especially in areas where the Commission intends to superimpose several recovery plans that apply to practically all of the species fished, and I am thinking in particular of those in the Bay of Biscay."
"Originally, the Commission had planned to deal with cod and Northern hake stocks together, despite the fact that these two species have very different characteristics."
"Fortunately, this unsatisfactory link was subsequently broken."
"Our committee drafted its report after holding in-depth consultations with representatives of the industry concerned, notably at a hearing in Brussels on 25 November that was attended by representatives of the French, Spanish and British trade organisations."
"They expressed particular regret that they had not been properly involved in drafting the recovery plan or in producing the assessment of the state of the stock on which the recovery plan is based, contrary to the provisions of the new framework regulation and contrary to what Parliament had called for, in particular in its opinion on integrating environmental protection requirements into the CFP."
"We were told that the regional workshop organised by the Commission was more like an information session on decisions that had already been taken than a meeting involving genuine consultation prior to any decision."
"The industry representatives also stressed the fundamental imbalance in the Commission proposal."
"This is based purely on considerations of a biological nature and is not accompanied by any impact assessment of the socioeconomic consequences of the proposed plan."
"In fact, it is clear that the drastic reduction in total allowable catches (TACs) planned for the very beginning of the plan is incompatible with the survival of undertakings involved in fishing Northern hake."
"The industry representatives also wished to tell us of their reservations about the effectiveness and practicability of the rule for reducing fishing effort, whether it be by the system of days at sea or kilowatt-days."
"They told us of their fear that superimposing a new management system on the system of TACs and quotas and on the specific management measures already adopted might jeopardise the principle of relative stability and contribute to an increase in discards."
"They also doubt that a system for reducing fishing effort can effectively achieve the desired result in terms of improving stocks."
"In fact, we do not have any scientific evaluation by ICES on this subject such as to guarantee that a reduction in effort really would reduce catches."
"Nor do we have an evaluation of the transitional measures taken to restore stocks under Annex XVII to the regulation setting TACs and quotas for 2003."
"Furthermore, the extremely complex effort reduction formula entails serious problems of equity and predictability for the Member States."
"Moreover, it institutes a uniform and rigid system, transposed practically unchanged from one stock to another, which does not take any account of the specific characteristics of the various Community fleets, particularly their versatility."
"Your Committee on Fisheries considered the multiannual approach that was adopted to address the issue of the management of the Northern hake stock to be perfectly well-founded and appropriate."
"This approach actually sets an essential conservation objective for the long term, while at the same time giving fishermen the visibility and security that they need to guarantee the survival of their businesses, which is no less essential."
"Nevertheless, it seemed to us that establishing a plan for the recovery of the Northern hake stock was a measure that was disproportionate to the state of the stock concerned as revealed by the latest scientific reports and observations of fishermen."
"Although it is clear that we need to remain vigilant, the trend observed over the last two years shows an increase in the level of the resource."
"As the Northern hake stock is not outside safe biological limits, it would not seem appropriate to us to apply a recovery plan to it under Article 5 of the framework regulation."
"In your committee’s view, the Northern hake stock should be covered by a multiannual management plan pursuant to Article 6 of the same regulation."
"This instrument would appear to us to be preferable because it corresponds better to the state of the resource and will better enable us to achieve the twofold objective of the sustainable conservation of the stock and the conservation of our fisheries."
"In making this proposal to substitute a multiannual management plan for the recovery plan advocated by the Commission, we are completely in line with the approach that we have already adopted that recommends that fragile stocks should be managed by adopting simple, flexible rules, that can be constantly adjusted – such as multiannual TACs – rather than uniform and complex systems with uncertain effects, like the arrangements for management via fishing effort, which have not yet been tried and tested."
"Mr President, Commissioner – whose presence we are grateful for – ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Souchet, on the wonderful report he has presented to us, on an issue which was not at all easy – Northern hake."
"Firstly, the Commission presented us with a proposal which, initially, was combined with cod – and which our Parliament rejected, as has been said already."
"Secondly, it made a separate, but very rigid and severe, proposal, which compared Northern hake with cod, with a genuine recovery plan and with fishing effort."
"Our Parliament had been consulted at the same time as the Council, and the negotiations were carried out in parallel, which obliged our rapporteur to be flexible in terms of adopting our draft report."
"Mr Souchet has made a serious study of issues relating to hake – as he has said, our Committee on Fisheries spoke to the sector – and has presented a report which fundamentally changes the Commission's original conceptions, for which he has our full support and thanks."
"I would also like to thank Mr Souchet for having accepted the numerous amendments which we had presented on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – I am truly grateful to him for this – since we have ensured that it is not a recovery plan, but rather a genuine management plan."
"I would like to draw the Commission's attention to this issue: it is a genuine management plan without fisheries effort, in accordance with the sector's request."
"The Souchet report is coherent, solid, reasonable and combines the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing of Northern hake with the social and economic aspects of the fisheries sector."
"The combination of these two aspects is something fundamental which we hope will be taken into account in the future."
"We believe that the future regional advisory councils will have to help us not to take false steps and to present proposals for the management of fisheries resources which have the consensus of both scientists and the sector itself."
"We have also appointed Mr Souchet rapporteur for the future management plan for Southern hake."
"Although it will possibly be the next Parliament established following the June elections which has to deal with this issue, the Committee on Fisheries will have to hold the necessary meetings so that, having heard the advisory councils which are created in this regard, both scientists and the sector can take part in the debates on Southern hake, and this must take place in parallel with the socio-economic measures we have requested and adopted already in the modification of the FIFG."
"And more importantly: in the future, the FIFG will have to provide for socio-economic measures so that, when any recovery or management plan is adopted, it is automatically accompanied by the corresponding socio-economic measures."
"We congratulate Mr Souchet once again and we hope that by means of this report, which we will vote on tomorrow, we will have taken a very important step in terms of supporting sustainable fisheries and the fisheries sector."
"Mr President, on 27 June 2003 the Commission published a new proposal aimed at guaranteeing the sustainable recovery of the Northern hake stock and its reduction within what is considered the safe biological limit, a precautionary level of biomass which is set at 165 000 tonnes."
"The first innovation, which we should be grateful for, is that the Commission has finally decided to separate stocks of hake and cod into two different plans."
"There was no other choice following the clear improvement in hake stocks, a direct result of the management measures applied by the sector over the last two years."
"When we move on to the analysis of the measures proposed, we discover that the Commission is not taking account of the best scientific information available, nor is it dispelling the doubts of the fisheries industry, since once again there has been no dialogue with the scientists and the proposal has been drawn up without the serious participation of professionals."
"The Commission is working on the basis of scientific opinions the content of which it does not specify and which, as the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, quite rightly says in his explanatory statement, has not been revealed to the Committee on Fisheries either, despite our having requested it."
"The precautionary biomass should have been established on the basis of these scientific reports which do not exist."
"Neither does it appear that this biomass is in proportion to the state of the stock affected, since the latest independent scientific reports and observations of professionals demonstrate that it is not below the safe biological limits."
"Neither do we have scientific evaluations from the ICES which guarantee to us that the reduction of fishing effort proposed will lead to an effective reduction in catches, nor an evaluation of the effects of the technical recovery measures – which I referred to earlier – which have been applied for two years and have had such good results."
"Neither does the Commission’s proposal seek a balance between biological recovery and socio-economic repercussions."
"Once again, I must point out that the approach is based on exclusively biological considerations and does not take account of the socio-economic context when recommending the re-establishment of stocks within one year, rather than adopting a progressive approach, based on multi-annual TACs, and this is incompatible with the capacity for survival of the companies in this sector."
"The technical measures, which, as we have said, have produced good results, are completely overlooked."
"What Mr Souchet proposes in his report, namely the replacement of this recovery plan with a multi-annual management plan, is the result not just of the – I believe correct – analysis of the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and of our own debate, but also of the guidelines already defined by the European Parliament itself and Mr Souchet in relation to the management of fragile stocks: the application of simple and flexible rules, such as multi-annual TACs, rather than rigid systems with uncertain effects, such as measures based on the fishing effort."
"Mr President, the Northern hake stock is outside safe biological limits."
"This is basically ICES' way of saying that it is in deep trouble."
"That is why the Commission has been trying for some years to convince the Council of the need for a recovery plan."
"The recovery plan proposed had a number of positive elements, including a formula for setting TACs and a reduction in fishing effort."
"Nonetheless, in its 2003 assessment ICES noted that the reductions indicated in the proposed plan are very far from achieving cuts in fishing mortality that could rebuild the stock in the short term: in other words, ICES is basically saying that even the Commission's proposal was not enough to ensure rapid stock recovery."
"What have the Council and the Committee on Fisheries done?"
"They have seriously weakened what was already a very weak proposal, primarily by removing any vestige of a reduction in fishing effort: the very thing that is most needed."
"Council even went one step further by increasing the TACs for hake by almost a third where the Commission had recommended a reduction."
"In December 2002 it was announced with great ado that the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was a great success and, amongst other things, it was said that recovery plans with effort reduction were to be applied."
"But at the Council meeting in December, the Council set 199 TACs in total."
"As an indication of the seriousness of the situation the Commission recommended cuts of greater than 10% for a quarter of them – that was 49 stocks."
"But the Council rejected much of that advice."
"For 42 stocks it set TACs that were more than 10% higher than the Commission's proposal."
"In some cases it set TACs at double, or even treble, the recommendations."
"For ten stocks they adopted an increase where the Commission had recommended a decrease."
"If this is the way Council and the Fisheries Committee are going to continue they are basically proving correct the cynics and all those who said that the reform of the common fisheries policy was not going to see any achievable result in relation to sustainable fishing."
"Something has to be done."
"The Commission is too soft on this issue and it needs to be more radical."
"The Council needs to take a realistic approach to the situation facing the fisheries industry and listen to the scientists' advice."
"It must listen to ICES' advice to ensure the survival of the fishing industry in Europe, otherwise we are basically voting for its demise."
"It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee could actually reduce what was already an inadequate proposal by the Commission."
"– Mr President, better a whole lie than a half-truth – that is how I would like to paraphrase a well-known proverb, the truth of which I am experiencing first-hand these days."
"It is namely the case that one of my fellow MEPs suggested to the press that the Dutch members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and also of my own group, never reimburse any of their travelling expenses."
"Radio, television and newspapers accepted this piece of information without checking it out properly."
"Since that time, my fellow MEPs and I have been inundated with telephone calls and e-mails asking me why I keep money back."
"This is bizarre; the reason why I do not return any money is that I do not declare any trips that I have not taken."
"I am aware that many fishermen are in a similar situation."
"They do not have to fight a lie but a half-truth."
"The situation of Northern hake may not be full of hope, but it is not so bad that a recovery plan is needed."
"Relying on ill-defined data, the Commission is proposing a drastic reduction in the quantity of fish to be caught."
"Recent information from biologists suggests that the situation surrounding hake is not so bad as to call for drastic action, and so I wholeheartedly support Mrs Souchet’s report and call on the Commission to adjust its plans."
"A control plan for Northern hake with adequate monitoring and enforcement is sufficient in order to offer this fish species a future."
"Insufficient scientific research is already putting fishermen at too much of a disadvantage."
"It is time for sound scientific research to benefit both fish and fishermen."
"Mr President, for a minute I wondered whether Mr van Dam had come to the wrong debate, but I am glad that he turned his attention to Northern hake."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"Mr Souchet is one of the most hard-working members of the Committee on Fisheries and his expertise in this area has earned him the accolade of being appointed rapporteur on the recovery of southern hake, a report which is currently in the pipeline."
"During our deliberations in committee, it was repeatedly stated that the advice we received from ICES – the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas – in respect of stocks of Northern hake was at odds with the advice of fishermen."
"Indeed, the fishermen claimed that hake stocks were not in a state of terminal decline, as stated by the scientists."
"Once again, this divergence of opinion has demonstrated the need for fishermen and scientists to work together in the preparation of management strategies."
"It is also clear that the Commission must be prepared to listen to the advice of fishermen as well as to the dire warnings of scientists."
"In this respect, I am delighted that plans for the creation of Regional Advisory Councils, which Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna mentioned, will bring together fishermen and scientists."
"These plans are well under way and constitute an essential part of the CFP reform package."
"Had an RAC been in place in this instance, I do not think we would have had the original recommendations for drastic cuts in hake TACs combined with severe effort limitation targets which the Commission proposed and which have shocked the members of the Committee on Fisheries."
"Cuts as proposed would have devastated the sector and caused widespread socio-economic hardship."
"I am glad that the Commission has revised these proposals in the wake of strong representations from the sector."
"We all support sustainable fishing."
"We all have an interest in seeing the long-term recovery of Northern hake."
"However, we also have a duty to sustain the livelihood of fishermen and to protect fishing communities."
"A balance therefore has to be struck which links best practice to achievable socio-economic goals."
"So, despite what Mrs McKenna said, I believe that Mr Souchet has sought to achieve that balance and I commend his report to the House."
"Mr President, even though I am not a member of the Committee on Fisheries, I have now and again ventured to intervene in this debate concerning fisheries."
"I am doing so today too."
"I am doing so because I am in such despair about the fact that we shall not be able to bring about a strict recovery plan, not only for hake but also for other species such as cod and other threatened white fish."
"This plan for the Northern hake stock was adopted in December, and the objective was clear: to protect the stocks and obtain an acceptable level of security."
"The truth is that the Council and the Commission together have weakened the original proposal so that it no longer complies with that objective."
"I think that the proposal that has now been negotiated by the Committee on Fisheries is very poor."
"I absolutely cannot vote in favour of it because it would further weaken an already weakened proposal."
"An absolute minimum would be to stick to the Commission’s original proposal, because stricter controls are needed."
"Economics and social problems, which are always referred to, are also important issues but, if we do not apply the precautionary principle when it comes to the biomass and fish stocks, we quite simply do not make it possible for fisheries to continue."
"That is something we should appreciate."
"We have now rejected four or five recovery plans from the Commission."
"It quite simply has to be realised that neither in this House nor in the Council is there any political will to adopt measures that genuinely take account of the precautionary principle and guarantee that we have fisheries in the future too."
"I am very concerned about what this will lead to."
"I should like more people to fall in with my policy when we vote on this matter, for I am now beginning to become extremely impatient and anxious."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his attitude towards the amendments I have proposed."
"The European Commission's initial proposal of introducing a recovery plan for Northern hake was not – or at least did not seem to be – anything more than an unjustified transposition of the measures applied to the recovery of cod to this species."
"Clearly, the executive Committee did not take account of the latest opinions of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), according to which the hake stock will reach a level of total safety if over the next five to eight years the level of mortality from fishing is maintained."
"It will therefore reach a safe biological level, to use the term recently used by the Commissioner."
"According to this information, it is not necessary to implement a drastic recovery plan for Northern hake."
"Rather than a recovery plan, it would be more appropriate to implement a management plan in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, in a manner which is compatible and also consistent with the biological and environmental component, on the one hand, and socio-economic factors on the other, within the context of the new common fisheries policy."
"That is the will expressed by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion: to replace the recovery plan proposed by the Commission, which imposes severe restrictions on the fishing effort and extremely serious social consequences, with a management plan which allows for the establishment of a total allowable catch that is compatible with the maintenance of the reproductive biomass."
"The European Commission recently presented another proposal for the recovery of Southern hake stocks and langoustine stocks, and it has not calculated the socio-economic consequences for the sector of the measures proposed in that case either."
"A scientific study is therefore needed, as well as the opinion of the new regional advisory councils provided for in the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Furthermore, we should also stress – and I will end here, Mr President – that the Council of Ministers for fisheries last December committed itself to consulting the professionals of the sector before drawing up an action plan for these species."
"The involvement and participation of the sector in decision-making should not be forgotten given that these decisions affect the viability of fishing, jobs, living conditions and the very survival of families which live in European regions highly dependent on fisheries policy."
"And I believe that we must insist on this involvement and this participation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the first plan to recover cod stocks, the Commission decided to propose a new initiative, this time on Northern hake."
"There is a further initiative in the pipeline covering Southern hake."
"While the sustainable management of fish stocks clearly justifies the conservation of species deemed under threat, measures aimed at limiting fishing must be properly based on accurate and up-to-date scientific opinions, and must take on board the first-hand observations of fishermen."
"The deficiencies in scientific research are well known."
"Parliament has had the opportunity this week to express its opinion on the matter by means of the Lage report."
"In this context, the Souchet report is excellent, drawing attention to the need to keep data up-to-date, based on information provided by international bodies in the fisheries sector."
"These limitations have had a devastating socio-economic impact on sea professionals, restricting already limited fishing activity still further."
"The figures presented by the Commission for limiting the hake catch are such that if they were implemented they would be socially devastating, economically untenable and commercially unmanageable."
"It appears obvious to state that socio-economic impact should be assessed prior to presenting any recovery plan."
"This, however, did not occur in this case."
"Such measures are therefore only acceptable if strictly commensurate with the aims of sustainable exploitation of stocks and if their economic impact is taken into account."
"Great variations in total allowable catches (TACs) may in some cases lead to companies converting fishing activity from one species to another, thereby indirectly causing imbalances."
"On various occasions, Parliament has drawn the Commission’s attention to the excessive inflexibility of the recovery plans."
"Consequently, a multiannual, flexible and gradual approach would certainly be more suitable, in that it would lead to fishing effort perfectly suited to the state of stocks, which will not be achieved by implementing inflexible plans, with irreversible and socially devastating consequences."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the arguments and problems outlined by the individual Members at this stage and would now like to comment on the amendments on that basis."
"First, I should say that I reject all the proposed amendments which aim to rename this entire project a ‘management plan’ rather than a recovery plan, because it is still a recovery plan."
"I think it would be wrong for us to gloss over the situation, although I gladly admit that the situation for Northern hake is less critical than for Northern cod."
"On Amendment No 2: I must reject this amendment as this recital is already contained in the framework regulation on the common fisheries policy."
"It is not that I reject it on principle; it is quite simply redundant."
"As regards Amendment No 5 and the consultations with the Regional Advisory Councils, or RACs, as they are also called, I am pleased to reassure you that as soon as they have been set up, we will naturally be consulting the RACs regularly on this issue."
"However, we do not need a recital for this purpose, as that is the whole point of the RACs – to be consulted on such matters."
"I reject Amendment No 6 because the hake stock is below the precautionary level and is therefore not yet within safe biological limits."
"The purpose of Amendment No 7 is to show that we need criteria to determine when recovery has been achieved."
"It would be quite inappropriate to determine politically when recovery has been achieved."
"That is a scientific issue."
"I reject Amendments Nos 12 and 27 because the additional control measures are absolutely essential."
"It is the fishermen themselves who frequently complain that control is uneven."
"We really do need these measures."
"I can accept Amendment No 15 in part and I approve of amending the precautionary value for the biomass. I cannot, however, accept Amendment No 16."
"We should not be setting priorities for scientific evaluations here."
"It would be a little too simplistic to say that the practical observations made by fishermen should be given higher priority than systematic monitoring by scientific institutions."
"Of course the fishermen should contribute their data."
"Some of the uncertainties surrounding the scientific evaluations are due precisely to the fact that there is a lack of such data, as fishermen only tend to pass on data which they think will influence the evaluations in line with their own interests."
"I can accept Amendments Nos 19 and 20 in part."
"The TACs are based on a fishing mortality rate of 0.25, and we incorporated this value into the proposal at the Council meeting in December."
"However, I cannot accept Amendment No 21."
"After the Council meeting in December, the proposal was amended so the Council has more scope when setting the TACs."
"The minimum level no longer needs to be reached within one year; instead, the TACs can be set so that this is achieved over a longer period."
"Consequently, I must reject Amendment No 25 as well, as the Council must have the opportunity to reduce the TACs in exceptional cases if this is necessary on biological grounds."
"Unfortunately, I must also reject Amendments Nos 22 and 23, for logically, they would mean that the TACs could be amended by more than 15% year on year, and that is not acceptable."
"We must have the same degree of fluctuation in both directions; otherwise, the rules will be uneven."
"I can accept Amendments Nos 8, 11, 18, 24 and 26 in full."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next item on the agenda was to be the Commission statement on salmon, but at 4.30 p.m. we have the Commission statement on the financial perspective, which will be chaired by the President of Parliament and which is to be attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and it cannot be changed."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, so as not to spoil the statement on salmon, which would have to be stopped after five minutes, we are going to suspend the sitting until 4.30 p.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the broad political framework for the next financial perspective: Making Europe prosper – policy agenda and budgetary means for an enlarged Union 2007-2013."
"I should like to place on the record my appreciation – and that of the House – that the Commission, in response to Parliament's request, adopted this communication this afternoon and has come directly to the House to report."
"President Prodi and Members of the Commission, we thank you for that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down, Western Europe was in the process of creating the great single market, an objective that we set for 1992."
"History decided that the huge expectations linked to integration would in turn be linked to the unexpected hope of unifying the whole of Europe in peace and democracy."
"Since that extraordinary moment, we have taken huge steps forward, and large parts of the democracies born out of the collapse of the Soviet bloc will soon be part of the Union."
"Our economy, despite the problems and uncertainties, is enjoying an unprecedented level of prosperity; in Europe we have a quality of life that is the envy of the world; and, above all, differences in wealth and opportunity between the Member States have been reduced over the years: this is a success that no other political organisation can boast of."
"We cannot, however, say that we are satisfied."
"We cannot because, for some time, doubt has been taking root in the hearts and minds of Europeans."
"This is a reaction to the process of globalisation of the planet with the far-reaching and ever-faster changes that it entails."
"Today, Europe wonders if it will be in a position to keep hold of the levers of change in order to continue to control globalisation, or if it will confine itself to accepting the situation and protecting itself against the dangers."
"We need only to listen to the questions asked by the citizens, questions that are very simple."
"They are asking the following: are the cultural reference points with which we identify going to be eradicated?"
"Why do young people face so much unemployment and precariousness?"
"Questions like this give rise to two opposing attitudes: one part of our society withdraws into itself, searching for an illusory security behind antiquated, and sometimes tribal, slogans, which foment xenophobia and intolerance; but the overwhelming majority of Europeans, however, look to us for positive answers and always ask us what Europe is doing."
"This is a healthy and mature position because it assumes a simple fact: no European country can act alone in the globalised world and no one can, alone, meet the challenges of the rise of the large countries of Asia, the technological challenge of North America or the migratory flows from the South."
"The strength to meet these challenges – our strength – lies solely in our Union."
"Time has proved Monnet, De Gasperi, Adenauer and Schuman right; we must combine what we have in common; we must fight for the common interest because that is the only way in which we can protect the individual’s interests."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 was the culmination of our collective recognition of this situation; in Gothenburg, the project was completed, fully incorporating sustainability as a key component, and this strategy generated energy and enthusiasm; it made the Spring European Council the high point in terms of control, drive and determination."
"Nevertheless, despite everyone’s efforts, this process is faltering."
"Operational decisions are becoming increasingly rare and, often, we are limited to calls for voluntary action."
"Why is this the case?"
"Because, in order to have a real impact, the strategy needs a project that is coherent and verifiable; it needs to organise the necessary instruments, those of the Member States and of the Union, which includes the Union budget."
"We must, in fact, use our resources to increase the prosperity of Europe in line with its values; we need to transform the Union into a dynamic knowledge-based economy; we need to ensure jobs for our citizens and make economic growth socially and environmentally sustainable."
"Before going into the detail of some of today’s decisions, I want to explain the spirit that drives us and the procedures we followed."
"Budgetary planning is about linking resources to needs."
"Since resources are limited, financial decisions must follow priorities and political choices; that is, follow and not precede: this is a fundamental concept."
"I have stated on many occasions that it is unacceptable to plan the future of our finances on the basis of a simple percentage point."
"Some have said – in all seriousness too – that the Union budget must not be more than 1% of European GDP."
"The problem with this position is that it puts figures before the political project: it is like starting to build a house from the roof."
"I understand that countries introducing difficult reforms also want the Union to apply restrictive policies; nevertheless, this approach is incoherent because national expenditure – at the level of each individual state – and Union expenditure – incurred jointly – are not interchangeable as they are different in qualitative terms."
"The Union budget is not unnecessary expenditure that must be reduced to a minimum;"
"Community expenditure funds common policies, that is to say those activities that the Member States have decided to manage together; these are more effective than national initiatives and, in many cases, are unavoidable because they address problems that are by their very nature supranational."
"There are many instances, in the life of the EU, where EUR 25 spent together is worth more than one euro spent in each of 25 countries."
"This is an absolutely essential concept that we should fix in our minds."
"Making savings in the Union’s budget does not increase national public resources, but only undermines the foundations of the house we all live in."
"We must, however, channel the available resources towards the priorities in such a way as to maximise the benefits."
"For all of these reasons, the Commission discussed the new Financial Perspective by first examining what needs to be done – that is to say, starting with the project for the Europe that we want to see – and then, only afterwards by tackling figures and percentages."
"The results do not, however, depend solely on the amount available."
"For example, we have established that the current budgetary structure and certain management rules are too rigid and that this rigidity has often put a brake on the Union’s work to the detriment of the common interest."
"This is not just an issue of the quantity of resources, but also of the way in which they can be managed."
"We are, therefore, also proposing a budgetary structure that can respond more flexibly to new and unforeseen circumstances."
"I would like to make one final, fundamental observation before moving on to the specific aspects of the proposal."
"Every organisation’s financial plan is, as we have said, an expression of its underlying principles."
"Of the Union’s principles, the one that I would like to stress is that of solidarity between the citizens and the Member States, solidarity that sees resources transferred from the richer countries to the poorer countries and regions."
"Our plan is in line with this underlying political decision and develops it in a new way, by placing cohesion policy more clearly at the service of competitiveness and employment than was previously the case."
"There are essentially three reasons behind this decision: it is a choice in favour of coherence, justice and opportunity."
"I say coherence because the key objective of our political policies in future years will be to encourage sustainable development."
"Unbalanced development will spawn rejection and fear of Europe in the most disadvantaged and outermost regions, rather than trust and involvement."
"Furthermore, it is a question of justice because no one can be asked to participate in a joint project without being given the opportunity of keeping in step with growth."
"Finally, it is a question of opportunity, because experience teaches us that balanced and sustainable development, especially in the poorest regions, is itself a source of further prosperity for the richest regions."
"This is the thought underlying the financial plan that I put before you today."
"I will now move on to briefly explain the key points."
"As I have said, there are three major priorities: to encourage sustainable development, to put into practice the idea of European citizenship and to strengthen the role of the Union as a key player on the world stage."
"So: sustainable development, European citizenship and the role of the Union in the world."
"I would like to stress one aspect of the first point."
"Since the internal market is for the most part already in place, we need to incorporate related policies in the broader context of a growth strategy."
"This is a very important proposal, which changes the hierarchy in the Union budget: we are now in a position to promote the competitiveness of European businesses by exploiting the fact that they are already operating in a market with no internal borders."
"I must repeat that there is only one way to increase competitiveness: through quality, technological development, research and innovation; in a broader sense, the absolute priority is investment in human resources."
"This is the unifying point, the major change in this financial proposal."
"It is absolutely essential that we devise a common strategy at European level to link up our research centres and to produce the best scientists and the best academics in the world."
"Europe and the world of education needs to be opened up to life-long learning."
"We have the tradition, we have the ability, we have the infrastructure; it is now up to Europe to invest all the necessary economic and political resources."
"Turning now to the second point, I have often said that, even now, our citizens may sometimes feel that they have split loyalties: to their city, to their nation, to Europe."
"One of our objectives will be to put the principle of European citizenship into practice."
"The Union must work together with the national governments to guarantee the same level of human rights, security, protection and quality of life across its territory."
"This involves the fight against crime and terrorism; it involves the joint management of external borders and of migratory flows that takes into account the human dignity of the immigrants and considers them to be a valuable resource for our economy and our society."
"It involves, finally, developing services of general interest that are the backbone of our social model, such as health, food safety, education, energy and transport."
"Above all, now the Union’s final borders are being outlined, the time has come to picture a real European identity."
"This will be the new frontier in the decades to come. There will probably not be any geographical advances, but there will certainly be progress on the spiritual front."
"We must, therefore, also work to encourage creativity and exchanges in the fields of culture, the arts, literature and methods of mass communication."
"Finally, as regards the role of the European Union in the world, enlargement and the prospect of the complete unification of our continent, Europe will really be able to become a force for stability and a reference point across the world."
"The time has, however, come to shoulder the responsibilities that this entails in a mature way."
"Firstly, we must assume a clear responsibility at regional level by implementing the Commission strategy to develop a circle of friendly countries."
"Over the next few years, we must develop this neighbourhood policy to share projects and policies with our neighbours and to guarantee peace and stability by spreading greater prosperity and our founding principles."
"Our responsibility does, however, go beyond our role at regional level."
"Europe must maintain and increase its contribution to growth, because the gap in opportunities and living conditions between the North and South of the world is incompatible with our political, civil and human traditions."
"This state of affairs is also not in our interests, and it increases the irregular migratory flows that so alarm our citizens."
"The Union must, therefore, continue to encourage dialogue, peaceful solutions and multilateral approaches."
"We must find a single voice on the world stage, with the ultimate objective of having a joint representation in assemblies such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"All over the world there are people that see in us a hope for peace and a wise and balanced force."
"We cannot disappoint these expectations; we must overcome our differences and, together, propose the model that we have fine-tuned in the course of 50 years of the Union’s existence."
"These, ladies and gentlemen, are just some of the many objectives contained in our Communication."
"To achieve them all, as we are constantly being called on to do, we need a far larger budget than that which we have been given up to now."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is realistic, extremely realistic."
"We have worked meticulously for a whole year– involving six groups of Commissioners and all of the College on several occasions in various seminars, and also all the Directorate Generals and every government – and the materials for this huge amount of preparatory work will be published on the Internet, if you want, and are able, to use them to make it possible to have a more detailed debate."
"We have analysed, assessed, taken decisions and arranged for reforms."
"We have decided, not without difficulty, to remain within the current ceiling of the Union’s own resources, in other words 1.24% of European GDP, plus the ACP (EDF) cooperation funds that have to be entered into the budget."
"It is on this basis that we have acted with rigour, determination and clear intent to review expenditure which, by limiting payments to an average of 1.15% of GDP, leaves us sufficient margin to be able to work calmly."
"We are convinced that, even if it is certainly not sufficient to achieve the objectives sought by the Member States – and put to us unanimously by the Member States – it will be possible, with a sum of this size, to achieve specific results."
"Indeed, we are concerned not just with numbers but also with the effectiveness of expenditure."
"We do not confine ourselves to justifying the need for resources, but we are also setting out a new structure to use them in a better and more rational way."
"This means continuing to improve the administrative culture and governance of the European Union."
"If, in fact, we maintain, on the one hand, that, in a large number of cases, action at European level is necessary and more effective, the Commission plans, on the other hand, to involve other bodies to rationalise the implementation of our measures on the ground."
"In particular, the partnership with the Member States is a relationship involving the ever more active mobilisation of the regions and local authorities."
"Finally, we are working on greatly simplifying the instruments that are currently used."
"To give you just one example, we propose to reduce the measures currently used in the field of external relations from more than 100 to six, each one dedicated to a specific political and operational area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Communication that I am presenting to you today is not a technical accounting document; it is a political declaration and I ask you to look at it as such."
"It aims to provide the operational framework for managing the major changes to the Union in future years."
"The Commissioners, the Commission departments and myself have devoted ourselves to the task with energy and enthusiasm, and I am sure that you will not fail to see this energy and enthusiasm fully reflected in the results of our work."
"These pages are, for the Commission, a major expression of renewed trust in Europe and its institutions."
"We now hand them over for Parliament and the Council to analyse, and I would be happy if, for you too, they were also a message full of hope and realism for our future."
". Mr President, I wish to make three comments."
"The first concerns the amounts necessary to meet the aspirations of everyone who wants to see a successful Europe in the future – whether that ceiling should be 1% of GNI, or 1.24%, or somewhere in between – and to remind everyone that today is the start of what will probably be a 12-month process."
"Even though Mr Prodi has made a statement, if we go by past practices I do not expect a conclusion on this for at least a year."
"In December Mr Colom i Naval, who is the rapporteur on the financial perspectives, presented a working document in the Committee on Budgets on the appraisal of the financial perspectives from their inception in 1988 to 2002."
"Over those 15 years, the average budget implementation is, remarkably, 1% of GDP."
"The Council could say that is sufficient, but to get an average of 1% over those years means we have to spend above 1% in certain years."
"In fact, we spent up to the figure mentioned by Mr Prodi – 1.15% – in 1993."
"My point is that this type of flexibility is needed if we are to continue to have a decent average."
"If that average has to be 1%, then there will be years when we will have to exceed 1% quite significantly."
"I am still not sure whether the Council's figure of 1% includes the EDF."
"I do not think it does, but that would therefore make it 1.03% at best."
"I want to make a comment to those Member States which criticised the Stability Pact for being too rigid."
"They should also see that if there is a case for flexibility in the Stability Pact, then we do not need rigidity in the European Union budget by sticking at 1%, as some Member States propose."
"That has been shown in Category 4, where, without the flexibility instrument, we could not have financed the actions in Kosovo, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq or in other areas."
"We need that flexibility in the budget."
"Speaking in a personal capacity, we could manage within the 1% if those same Member States had not already agreed that agricultural expenditure should be set in concrete up to 2013."
"I quote from the Commission's document: 'A ceiling around 1% of GNI would fail to meet the European Councilcommitments on agricultural payments, would undermine the phasing-in of cohesion policy in the ten new Member States and would jeopardise existing levels of other policies.'"
"It goes on to say: 'Alternatively, cuts would be needed across the board and existing agreements would have to be reopened, including the amounts decided at the Brussels European Council of October 2002.'"
"I hope the Council takes cognisance of that fact."
"My second comment is specifically to the Council."
"To get an agreement on the new financial perspectives needs an interinstitutional agreement."
"I just want to remind the Council that we are one of those institutions, and it will need Parliament's agreement to get an interinstitutional agreement."
"We do not care if we do not get it: we will just go back to Article 272 of the Treaty and will still manage the budget without the Council's say-so."
"That is not a threat, it is just a comment to the Council, which it should bear in mind as we go through this procedure."
"My last point is that for almost the past 15 years – all the time I have been in this Parliament and on the Committee on Budgets – the rapporteur for the financial perspectives has been Mr Colom i Naval."
"This will probably be his last plenary session – I am breaking news here."
"He will be offered the job of head of the Court of Auditors in the Catalan Government, and no doubt will be taking it up very shortly."
"I want to pay tribute to his unceasing work; he knows more about this subject than anyone else – dare I say, boringly so!"
"He can quote the interinstitutional agreement chapter and verse, but I have been glad of it on many occasions."
"I want to thank him for all his work over those 15 years, and also wish him well for his new post."
"I hope I express the whole of Parliament's wish in that sentiment."
"Mr Wynn, thank you for your contribution and your announcement in respect of the future of our colleague, Mr Colom i Naval."
"On behalf of the House I should like to congratulate Mr Colom i Naval on the nomination."
"We wish him well, but express regret that as a result of his taking up this appointment we shall lose him before the end of this legislature."
"Mr President, we welcome the debate this afternoon."
"As the Commission President has announced, this is a Commission decision already, and to come first to us in the Parliament is always an agreeable thing so far as budgetary matters are concerned."
"First, from my Group's perspective, we will be taking the view that Mr Wynn has just expressed: we would rather be very prudent about whether we need the financial perspectives at all."
"We had multiannual agreements which keep discipline, which we did not have before the financial perspectives were introduced."
"We do not wish guidelines – which is what financial perspectives are – to become an end in themselves."
"We should recall very clearly as we go through this discussion that we have the right under Article 272 of the existing Treaty – not necessarily under the Constitutional Treaty but the existing Treaty – to be able to continue the budget process, and we shall therefore be very careful to see that parliamentary rights are properly safeguarded in the whole process."
"Secondly, if there is to be a financial perspective, we welcome the ideas that the President has put forward today about better flexibility, categorisation and looking ahead to how money will be properly spent."
"Let us be clear that there will not be any decision in this Parliament about the final nature of this financial perspective."
"We also have to take inspiration from Mr Colom i Naval's advice and knowledge of this."
"You and I, Joan, had a common view about the last financial perspective and I sense it is very clear that we have a shared view on this one, particularly regarding the length of the financial perspective."
"We have made it very clear, in Mr Wynn's resolution and in our own Group documents, that we do not want a financial perspective to go beyond the term of office of the next Commission, because how can one possibly justify in democratic terms that we are deciding for future parliaments and for future Commissions?"
"We should stick to the term of office of the next Commission, which is five years."
"To suggest a date after 2013 is to suggest that an old parliament will be committing a new parliament after 2014; it does not work."
"We will have to come to terms with that fact."
"The last thought is that now we are going to have enlargement – 25 countries – we know the difficulties will be very great in managing a European Union."
"Does this financial perspective address Turkey in any way?"
"Or will that be an additional expenditure?"
"Should you decide in December 2004 to start negotiations?"
"For many in my political group, and maybe across the Parliament, to start full negotiations with a country when you do not even know what your existing financial capacity is – to run a union for 25 countries in this way – would be extraordinarily inept and irresponsible, because we need to know what the basis will be when we are negotiating with a country of that size."
"Therefore, in conclusion, please let us avoid, when we come to decisions on this, a Soviet-style approach to planning which is going to take us too far into the future of our commitments."
"Secondly, let us make sure that it is properly democratic and let us not take decisions which we will regret later because we have taken on countries for which we do not have the financial capacity."
"Mr Colom i Naval, in the light of the announcement by Mr Wynn, I do not know whether this will be your last speech in this House, but in any event, you have four minutes!"
"Mr President, I plead for indulgence."
"Indeed, this probably is my last speech in this House – at least from this seat, as I am in the Chair tomorrow and Thursday."
"Mr President, allow me a few moments to thank the Chairman of the Committee for his kind words and to express my thanks for your kind words and the applause and congratulations I have received from many of my colleagues who came here today knowing that this would probably be my last speech to the Assembly from these benches."
"I must say that for someone who started their political career in the anti-fascist underground, at the age of 18, the opportunity to be here in the European Parliament has been an unforgettable experience."
"I look on my 18 years in the European Parliament as a privilege and I would like to thank all of my colleagues, the Bureau, and in particular my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and all of the officials and co-workers with whom I have worked during this time."
"If you miss me, in any event, my new role does not allow me to be paid, as you know, so I can advise you ‘free of charge’."
"Having said that, allow me to move on to the topic in hand."
"For the last time as rapporteur for the financial perspective, I can say that at last we have the promised Commission communication on one of the key issues affecting the European Union in the years ahead. Until very recently, last Friday in fact, we only knew of it by means of press leaks and rough drafts and had had practically no official notification of it until the tripartite dialogue held in Dublin."
"The Commission’s speeches, and especially that of Mr Prodi, have given us a more positive image than the text we had seen to date, with which I disagreed due to some of its apocalyptic tones."
"In my opinion, we have to have a more positive vision and I think that that must be our approach to addressing the problems and proposals for action in order to ensure economic growth in the Union in the years ahead."
"I am afraid, however, that once again we are beginning to build the house from the roof down or, to be more precise, from the ceiling down."
"We are starting , , from a maximum ceiling for the budget within which we are trying to fit the policies, rather than looking at the policies and the funding they require and determining the extent to which the resources needed to finance them are available."
"As far as I am concerned, the Commission has to some extent fallen into the trap of ‘the gang of six’: the Treasury Ministers who call themselves ‘net contributors’, who have proposed staying within 1% of the ceiling for the financial perspective."
"I believe that the most fundamental negotiating tactic required us to go further than that and to be more ambitious, and not to stay within the limits set by the Commission – itself and the budget authorities – in 1992 to meet the needs of a European Community that at that stage had 12 members."
"That is the percentage they want us to retain."
"I think it shows a lack of ambition."
"We want to increase the competitiveness of the economy, fulfil the Lisbon objectives, maintain the cohesion policy, finance enlargement, and solve the statistical problems concerning the flows to the poorest regions of the current 15 Member States."
"We want to have a foreign policy, a security policy, perhaps a defence policy too, an R[amp]D policy, and so on, but where will the money come from?"
"I feel it is important that at last the proposal to include a European tax has been included, but still…"
"We must ask ourselves whether or not these figures are hiding reductions in the so-called political priorities and – I stress – agriculture and the Structural Funds."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we should all remind the Commission and the Council that because of the Council’s systematic refusal, the perspectives have not been included in the Treaty until now. Therefore, until the Constitution enters into force in the terms approved by the Convention, we are under no obligation to sign this agreement or to approve any package for the financial perspective."
"I hope that the Irish Presidency takes note of this with a view to moving the Constitution forward as quickly as possible."
"I will not go into any further detail regarding the duration, but I would like to raise a couple of technical questions."
"What are the consequences of reducing the number of headings to five but increasing the number of subheadings?"
"What rules govern the transfer of money or appropriations from one subheading to another?"
"If we have a financial perspective, what form will the flexibility mechanism take exactly?"
"Moreover, we have a figure of 1.24% but it is vital to clarify the concepts of payment appropriations, commitment appropriations, and the vague reference to gross domestic product, gross national product and to gross national income."
"These are questions that, I should mention in passing, could mean a difference of EUR 7 000 million."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the progress of European integration in a united and enlarged Europe requires generosity and a broad-minded approach, and it seems that our ambitions far outnumber resources."
"I would ask those who are not leaving this House to become a member of the Court of Auditors in Catalonia to stick to their speaking time!"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, it seems that some of our Member States have been seized by a seven-year itch: it is the irresistible urge to scratch around for the best financial deal for themselves."
"But in their rush to advance their own interests, the Member States are failing to ask what might constitute the best deal for Europe."
"Liberal Democrats and Reformers believe that governments should first, as the admirable Mr Colom i Naval has suggested, take a long, hard look at what they have asked the European Union to do, and then give the institutions the resources they need to do the job."
"Governments should also ruthlessly tackle waste and fraud, most of which occur at national level, and target spending on our priorities to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers."
"Britain, France, Germany and three other states have formed an unholy alliance, united only by their zeal to keep down their budget contributions."
"Even putting aside the wider benefits that the European Union buys, the EU needs a budget consistent with its responsibilities."
"This year we will integrate ten new Member States."
"Europe is charged with important new responsibilities abroad, and with the task of keeping us safe from crime and terrorism at home."
"Reviving growth requires progress on the ambitious reform agenda of Lisbon."
"Do the six states really expect the EU to do all of this on 1% of Europe's gross national income?"
"With spending set to reach 1.11% of GNI in 2006, a ceiling of 1% in 2007 means not recalibration but cuts."
"None of these Member States can tell us where the axe will fall."
"Indeed, I would wager that they cannot even agree among themselves."
"My warning to Europe's citizens would be : buyer beware!"
"These are the same governments who agreed in 2002 to a 1% annual increase in spending on the common agricultural policy."
"If Member States demonstrated a real willingness to reform the CAP further, it would be easier to take seriously their calls for parsimony."
"As it is, we are running this Union on just over 1% of the gross national income of the Member States, when the budget of the Federal Government in the United States is 20% of GNI."
"We must continue to strive for savings where possible, but also equip the Union to meet the objectives we have set ourselves."
"My Group believes that the key to better value lies in a modest budget increase, leaving a safe margin for unforeseen expenditure, linked to reform, less waste and more intelligent investment."
"Not promises of smarter spending from Member States with no will to deliver it."
"– Mr President, I have on several occasions, on behalf of my group, denounced the propensity of the European Council to set new priorities for the European Union while refusing to grant it the commensurate financial resources."
"All too often this short-sighted policy has caused us to abandon an area that is deemed to be crucial one day in favour of another area that is deemed of vital importance the next."
"It is by robbing Peter to pay Paul that we have, on average, survived on a derisory budget."
"In 2004 this reached a historic low, below 1% of GDP, which is 20% less than the ceiling on which the Fifteen had themselves agreed for the period 2000-2006."
"With enlargement on the horizon, this short-term vision of the Union’s responsibilities is now creating a potentially explosive situation."
"If the six Member States that are net contributors to the European budget actually go ahead with their plan to freeze expenditure at current levels from 2007, many fine promises will go up in smoke!"
"The major works projects, rather hastily baptised the ‘growth initiative’, risk being buried once again."
"As for regional and social aid and the appropriations for the Cohesion Fund, they will melt away like snow in the sun for the majority of their current beneficiaries and many of their future recipients."
"Farewell cohesion!"
"Farewell solidarity!"
"On a social level this is known as cynicism; on a political level we call it irresponsibility."
"I might have severe words for the Member States concerned, but this does not mean that I am awarding any plaudits to the Commission."
"Your communication, Mr President of the Commission, is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs."
"Where is your previous ambition, although there is clearly more to responding to the challenge of ensuring the balanced development of an enlarged European Union than just increasing the financial perspective by one or two tenths of a per cent of GDP?"
"I would remind you that by 2007 the Union’s population will have increased by a third."
"The income of our new Members is less than half that of the Fifteen and, from many points of view, I do not think that the famous acquis communautaire is doing them any favours."
"I therefore remain unsatisfied, Mr Prodi."
"I would add that the Commission’s position is not without its contradictions."
"On the one hand, it legitimately expects a number of Member States to increase their net contribution to the Community budget, but on the other it pushes the cult of limiting public expenditure so far as to take the Council of Ministers to court for not respecting the Stability Pact."
"Polite requests or punishment: you have a choice."
"Furthermore, many problems remain outstanding."
"I will mention just one: the regions that in the future will essentially be deprived of benefiting from the Structural Funds, despite the fact that there has been no significant change in their situation."
"Quite simply, the arrival of poorer regions in the Union will automatically – I would say bureaucratically – lower the threshold for becoming eligible for these funds."
"It is understandable that the forthcoming negotiations are giving serious cause for concern more or less everywhere."
"These are all symptoms of what to me is looking increasingly like a crisis in the European project."
"After the split on the war in Iraq, the ‘stupid’ affair of the Stability Pact and the breakdown of the Brussels Summit on the Constitution, we now have the debate on the budget to expose in a new and edifying way just how bad things really are."
"It would appear to be absolutely essential to re-found Europe."
"Faced with the risk of a dangerous wave of disenchantment amongst the public, as I see it our only hope is to be found in the growing call for a new kind of Europe."
"The coming months will be decisive in determining whether a beautiful utopia is waxing or waning."
"– Mr President, I should like to extend my warm thanks to President Prodi for this early presentation of the proposal on the financial perspectives."
"It gives us, as Parliament, as well as the national governments, plenty of opportunity for listing our priorities for the next few years."
"After all, the budget is, logically, the financial translation of the policy that we want – nothing more, nothing less."
"In this respect, I should really like to congratulate the Commission."
"It is trying, in an honest and courageous manner, to point out the cost of the content of the plans made by the European Heads of Government and also of the Commission itself over the past few years."
"In my opinion, the Commission is, in this sense, much more honest than the six net contributors who, last December, said that they would pay not one cent more than they are doing now."
"In that sense, I share in the critical attitude of my fellow MEPs."
"One per cent and not one cent more, irrespective of enlargement, irrespective of the need for Europe to play a more prominent role in the world, irrespective of plans for European border control and irrespective of the promise to turn Europe into the world's most dynamic knowledge economy: plans of this kind are always announced with much pomp and circumstance, but at the end of the day, Member States refuse to accept the implications."
"More tasks for the European Union, certainly a larger European Union, will also require more money."
"I would like to urge you to put your money where your plans are."
"Current expenditure, too, could also, of course, be held up to the light."
"Cutbacks could definitely be made there, and my group would be willing to talk about this."
"The problem, though, is that those very six countries that are fixated on this one per cent also refuse to discuss further reforms with regard to the European budget's biggest debit item, namely agricultural policy."
"It is a policy that is still massively rewarding farmers and is detrimental to animals and the environment."
"The net contributors refuse to talk about this for reasons that are beyond me."
"It is time we started talking not only about the amount involved or about what Mr Prodi said about the roof of the house, but also about a really useful way of spending the citizens' tax money."
"In this respect, I have numerous doubts regarding the Commission's proposal."
"It wants to set aside a great deal of money under the heading of sustainable development, which is fine – it touches my green heart."
"However, what exactly is so sustainable about the proposals you have formulated?"
"The Commission has developed a whole strategy to stimulate research, but why has this not been done for the environment?"
"Why have all the plans to make agriculture greener by stimulating rural development at the expense of intensive agricultural production been abandoned?"
"Why is there not more funding for rural development?"
"The European Union is also very ambitious when it comes to foreign policy."
"The ties with the new neighbouring countries must be strengthened and Europe must play an important role globally."
"My group welcomes this."
"This role also requires an idea about how, for example, future international crises should be paid for, which is what is currently lacking."
"Mr Wynn also made the point that, if there is no flexibility in the European budget, then there is the risk that the bill will always be at the expense of other policy measures."
"Accordingly, the bill will, for example, eventually have to be paid by our new neighbours, while we are, in fact, trying to strengthen those ties."
"More flexibility also with regard to foreign policy is really something that is yet to be incorporated into the Commission’s plans."
"I look forward to hearing more about that."
"I would like to thank Mr Prodi for presenting this programme, which can be seen as important, and it is certainly different from what was suggested by the rumours that were going around beforehand."
"Of course, we cannot, however, claim that it is a great success to have established the same reference figure – 1.24 – that we already had before."
"I would like, however, to thank the President of the Commission for having reached an agreement, albeit an incomplete one."
"That being said, I must, as a young Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, certainly be anxious and express my fears for agriculture, culture, the TEN projects, technology, research, the universities and all the programmes that we launched and announced so enthusiastically."
"I believe that, in view of the imminent enlargement to the East, we cannot definitely say – and, above all, the Council cannot say – that this is a major agreement. We can simply say that it is a watered-down agreement."
"I think that Mr Colom i Naval, whom I thank for his contribution, Mr Wynn and also the President of the Commission will be able to support a young man like myself when I say that I would like to recall the words of a great personality, Ignazio de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. He said that he feared the day when no one fought him any longer."
"Well, I think that we must all fight with this same spirit to see a Europe that is certainly stronger, but one that develops more and is able to have more resources for our projects."
"– Mr President, there is a Dutch saying, '' or, to put it another way ‘grasp all, lose all’."
"This is aimed at Commissioner Schreyer, who wants EU spending to reach up to the ceiling of 1.24% of the Gross National Product."
"This proposal is unrealistic from the outset, given that six net contributors want to restrict the EU budget to 1%."
"The past decades have shown that subsidies for regional policy hardly have any impact, except in Ireland."
"It is therefore surprising that the Commission should propose to increase this item by 23%."
"Has the Commissioner ever heard of subsidy addiction?"
"We propose an automatic restriction of the net revenue of the Member States that enjoy a level of prosperity above 90% of the European average."
"Annually, they should not receive more than 1% net of the Gross Domestic Product."
"This would give the necessary breathing space for the much poorer regions in the acceding countries."
"It is likely that structural policy in those countries is also more effective."
"The fifty-fifty distribution between old and new Member States, as now proposed by Commissioner Barnier, is a stab in the dark."
"Given the narrow margins in national budgets, little political realism is shown by the decision to spend money on tarting up a European institution that will, at best, be a replica of NATO."
"One proposal meets with our approval."
"It concerns the introduction of a general correction mechanism for Member States that contribute excessive amounts to the funding of the European Union."
"For the rest, we would ask the Commissioner for multi-annual budgets that, instead of stating more of the same, offer real priorities and realistic, viable options."
"Mr President, I approve of the Commission proposal – even if it is not very substantial, and I support those who highlighted the fact – not to go lower than what was agreed, which is already an absolute minimum for a Europe that has grown, that will continue to grow and that rightly seeks to enlarge the scope of its political actions outside its institutional confines in order to embrace a wider horizon."
"From this point of view, it is certainly important to support such an approach."
"As others have stressed, however, at this stage in the European debate – where it is so threatened by tendencies always to want to do more as well as to want to scrimp and save – the Commission should have gone a step further."
"Thanks to the Commission and its Sapir report, we know how much we really need to change the priorities of our investments and our budget to be competitive and to give Europe the hopes and objectives that Mr Prodi referred to."
"The Sapir report has, however, remained in a draw because it worries many people and many governments who do not want to hear talk of certain issues."
"So, at a time when the Commission has got into the habit of touching on sensitive issues, as it did with the Stability and Growth Pact, there is, for example, this agreement, which seems to be set in stone and which, while we are discussing the CAP, we are committed to not touching until 2013."
"This issue should, then, have been included in today’s communication."
"Mr President, I agree with the initial analysis made by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, when he referred to the fact that recent years have been marked by a impressive collection of dogmas that have been destroyed, of impossibilities that have become a constant reality and of constant realities, such as the Berlin Wall, that have fallen like the Cedars of Lebanon, as recounted in the classics."
"In my view, that is the context surrounding this Commission communication, in which the next financial perspective must address the new circumstances."
"This Commission communication will have to be supplemented by the own-initiative report to be prepared by Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and adapt to the new circumstances of enlargement; the European elections will produce a new Parliament and there will be a new Commission."
"In any event, we must welcome the Commission’s work and the new budget headings: sustainable development, putting the people at the heart of our project and boosting a more visible and effective foreign policy of the European Union."
"I would also like to highlight very clearly the alternative put to us by President Prodi of choosing between two models of Europe."
"He told us that between the tangible Europe, the definite Europe, and the Europe of the net balance and net beneficiary, he chose a model compatible with the former, which is a higher model, a model of the Europe of values, the Europe of peace, of understanding, of harmony and of solidarity."
"This solidarity must go hand in hand with the Lisbon spirit and strategy."
"Therefore, Mr President, I welcome the strategic choice made by the Commission today to present a communication that is not based on a model of a selfish Europe but on a model that has been capable of making the figures work for the ideals."
"– Mr President, President Prodi, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we are embarking today on a debate whose preparation in recent weeks has already been accompanied by a great deal of shadow-boxing, and I am pleased that the proposals are finally on the table so we can talk about them."
"I am not so lacking in self-confidence that I feel any need to be bound solely by what others are suggesting."
"Nor do I feel any need to be bound solely by the Commission’s proposals, just as I see little reason to take the individual statements from the Council or parts of the Council as a benchmark for myself."
"Instead, as Members of this Parliament, which is one of the institutions to vote on this financial perspective, we will address these issues over the coming weeks and months, and indeed over the coming years – that is how long such difficult discussions can take."
"In doing so, it is not acceptable for one side to say: ‘We have an idea and we want a vast amount of cash to implement it’."
"That cannot be the right approach."
"However, the other side also cannot say: ‘Look, you have a bit of cash in Europe, see how far you get with that’."
"Both of these approaches are wrong."
"Here is what we have to do. We must face up to the challenges that we are already discussing jointly, and then work through them point by point."
"Let me say this: all of us – including those who have been regaling us with grand words today – will have to be flexible on a number of issues."
"We will have to discuss what we want to do in the field of research and development."
"At our last session, we agreed that 3% of gross domestic product should be spent on this policy area in Europe."
"This 3% cannot be accommodated in the budget, for then the 1.24% or 1.0% or whatever would not be worth the paper it is written on."
"We therefore need to talk about budget combinations."
"We must discuss what should be done at national level in the Member States in future, and we must discuss what we can best do jointly at European level."
"We need to do this in all the areas before us."
"That includes foreign policy, for example, where the European Development Fund is currently outside the budget; we will integrate it."
"We will also have to discuss what proportion of international conflict prevention we want to fund from the European budget and what the Member States will cover in future."
"We have adopted a figure of 0.7% of GDP as a guide here."
"As regards justice and home affairs, we will have to discuss whether we want to maintain Europol and Eurojust as small units, as at present, or whether we are aiming for further development here."
"Another question is how much of the fight against organised crime should be funded at European level and what should be funded at local level."
"All these issues will have to be discussed."
"We will also have to talk about what comes under each budget heading and which proportion is paid from which budget."
"I am very flexible here, and I am approaching this debate with an open mind. I believe this is essential, for otherwise – especially given the war-cries now resounding through the corridors – it will be impossible to create the right atmosphere for a substantive joint debate."
"I think we have found some good things in the proposals you have presented. We will be looking at them."
"We will of course be discussing with you why the proposed duration of the financial perspective is seven years."
"It is important to highlight the fact that this may result in a Parliament such as this one – as Mr Elles has said – being excluded completely from the debate about the funding of the European Union’s future."
"A seven-year period could produce that situation."
"We will need to talk about the growth rates that you have taken as a basis for your financial calculations."
"I think I saw at one point that you are assuming economic growth of 4.5% per annum."
"If we achieve that growth rate over the next seven years in Europe, we will have no problem with any aspect of funding."
"We therefore need to discuss which statistics you are taking as a basis for your overall figures."
"We will have to discuss the structure you are proposing, and whether it is transparent, efficient and flexible."
"Our interest in reforming agricultural policy also means that we want to invest in the development of rural regions within the framework of general agricultural policy."
"Is this possible, based on your proposals?"
"Or will we have new hurdles to overcome yet again in a new financial perspective – hurdles which cannot be overcome?"
"We need some measure of flexibility because as several other speakers have said, challenges will arise over a seven-year period which we cannot predict today."
"I am firmly convinced that we, in this House, should engage in this discussion with self-confidence."
"We have our own ideas and we will set out our vision of the Europe we want to achieve."
"We will talk about the resources to be deployed for this purpose."
"I look forward to our discussions with you. I also look forward to the discussions with the Council."
"Both of you will have to deal with a self-confident but serious and solid Parliament."
"– Mr President, the Commission’s proposal for a financial framework for the period 2007-2013 is right in its priorities, and I wish to thank President Romano Prodi for that."
"The EU is lagging behind all our main competitors in the areas of economic growth and competitiveness, and that is why financial investment in the prerequisites for growth is the right and necessary area of focus."
"Research, the encouragement of innovation and the adoption of high technology are promoters of growth."
"So is a high-level infrastructure."
"Investment in transport and energy networks will immediately create new jobs and strengthen business conditions even in remote regions and those where development has fallen behind."
"The EU, including its most peripheral areas, must be taken account of in this work."
"Similarly, investment in the young is crucial."
"Programmes of education and training must be extended and diversified for youth to be able to acclimatise more readily to an international working environment."
"Another problem and priority is Structural and Cohesion policy."
"The new Member States need support for reconstruction and for strengthening their economic environment."
"This cannot be allowed to happen, however, at the expense of the economically frailer regions of the old Member States."
"That is why the provision of funds has to be increased on an equivalent scale."
"If the development promised under the financial framework is to succeed, the administration has to be thoroughly modernised."
"The reform of the Commission carried out this term is only a basis for reforms."
"Power and responsibility have to be devolved both within the bureaucratic machinery and from the Commission to the Member States."
"Mr President, the Community of Europe was born out of a desire to achieve peace and prosperity, a wise and two-fold objective, as it is not possible to achieve one without the other."
"One of its fundamental pillars is social and territorial cohesion, in other words, making all citizens genuinely equal by combating imbalances and inequalities in existing wealth and opportunities."
"In two months’ time the Union is going to be enlarged with the accession of 10 new Member States and some 75 million citizens."
"Its wealth will be far below the current average of the Europe of Fifteen and if we hope to continue to maintain our two-fold Community objective, if we hope to overcome the inequalities suffered by these new Europeans, we cannot contemplate allocating fewer public resources to this end; rather, we should step up our efforts to help."
"In this respect, I must condemn the fact that in recent years there has been a reduction in actual Community expenditure, payment appropriations in relation to the gross national income, while the latter is decreasing in constant terms due to inflation."
"In other words, we are allocating fewer resources to developing the Community, and yet there are some, such as the signatories to the well-known ‘letter of the six’, who want to reduce them even further."
"I support the Commission’s proposal that there should be no reductions in future."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi’s presentation on the EU’s financial perspective allows us to make some brief comments on the economic and social cohesion policy."
"I do not intend at this time to state whether or not the financial perspective proposed here by the Commission represents percentage gains for one country or another."
"This is not the reason for my intervention."
"Besides, in this context, we must not forget that those countries that intend to enjoy Community funds as of 2007 have yet to meet their biggest challenges: they must overcome their structural backwardness and must ensure the economic and social cohesion of their populations."
"I therefore prefer to concentrate on the political significance of the Commission’s proposal."
"If the Commission maintains or, should I say, takes the risk of maintaining, the level of financial resources of the EU at 1.24% of the Community’s gross national product until 2013, it would be making a decisive investment in the European policy of solidarity, as the only means of achieving the homogenous growth of the entire EU, in the wake of the Lisbon strategy."
"At a time when we are integrating ten new countries, this must be a prime objective, to which the benefiting countries, be they old or new, must respond with the ability to carry out the crucial reforms implied and presupposed by European solidarity."
"Parliament has therefore no choice but to offer political support to the Commission’s proposal."
"We must also do all we can to ensure that the proposal of the six wealthiest Member States – to reduce the Community budget from 1.24% to 1% of Europe’s GNP – is not allowed to triumph."
"We must, therefore, criticise in the strongest terms those politicians who utter fine words on Europe and solidarity, but whose real priorities lie in preserving national interests."
"Mr President, the Commission’s campaign is now beginning for transferring EU taxes and more funds from the taxpayers to the EU."
"Instead, the June Movement proposes a halt to European tax and expenditure."
"Not a single penny should be appropriated to Brussels until there is an accounting system through which we can see what the money is being used for."
"For 25 years, I have tried to obtain detailed information about how the EU uses the money we pay in quotas."
"There has still, for example, been no success in tracking down the ‘skimmed milk supremo’ who, for many years, was the biggest recipient of EU subsidies in Denmark."
"We have still not seen statements of account from the secret accounts in the Eurostat scandal."
"We know, however, that the chief accountant, Marta Andreasen, who insisted on correct accounts, has now been suspended for 17 months and is banned from showing herself in the Commission’s buildings, where those who have manifestly been responsible for the fraud can go about freely."
"This state of affairs does not provide the necessary permission for sending funds via Brussels."
"The June Movement instead proposes that the EU focus on the cross-border matters we cannot solve ourselves and keep away from everything else."
"The subsidies to the present EU agricultural systems can be phased out by 20% per year over five years."
"The EU should completely cease giving structural aid to the rich Member States."
"The poor countries and the new Member States should be exempted from paying quotas so that there is real solidarity and not only a redistribution from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poorer countries."
"With such a reform, the net payers will get away with paying less tax, at the same time as the net recipients will be in a significantly better position than at present."
"At the same time, allow details of each appropriation and item of expenditure to be accessible on the Internet."
"In that way, we can avoid waste, excess and fraud, and vigilant journalists and employees in companies and other institutions that receive subsidies will quickly be able to reveal if money is being misused, wasted or misappropriated."
"Finally, just a few round figures."
"Last year, Denmark paid DKK 15 billion in EU quotas."
"Danish agriculture received agricultural subsidies of DKK 10 billion."
"The total net income received by Danish agriculture was only a fraction of the direct EC subsidy."
"Money is flooding out of EU coffers without ending up in the hands of the needy farmers, and this shows, more than any amount of words, the need for a halt to expenditure and tax, including in the EU."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the EU budget will be tough."
"At a time when the net contributors do not have unlimited resources at their disposal and net recipients are keen to protect their vested interests, it will be difficult to achieve a constructive solution."
"As this solution, the Commission is proposing an increase in own resources."
"The idea of granting the EU its own tax competence – the keyword is the ‘Europe tax’ – is being discussed."
"Given the difficult economic situation and massive austerity measures being applied in numerous EU Member States, the letter from the six governments is quite understandable, in my view."
"If savings are being made across the board, then the EU cannot – no, esteemed colleagues – must not shy away from this desire for savings and reform."
"Anything else would damage the future of the EU and would ultimately be impossible to justify to the public."
"In the conflict over the EU’s future finances, there are two options: either to carry on muddling through, repeating the sins of the past and trying to fund everything at once, or – the second option – to see the future framework for the EU budget as an opportunity."
"Ever since the decision to admit ten new Member States, at the latest, it has been clear that reforms are essential."
"Yet so far, no one has been willing to grasp the nettle."
"Is everything just fine in the EU’s subsidy policy, for example?"
"Is it clear why the EU subsidises tobacco cultivation while banning tobacco advertising at the same time?"
"Is it really the clever option to fund the transportation of animals right across our continent and beyond?"
"These are just two minor examples."
"However, one thing is clear: reforms must happen, and this is an opportunity."
"It takes political courage and probably also a political vision of Europe’s future shape, tasks and prospects."
"After all, a budget is merely a set of policies presented in numerical form."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this financial perspective must enable us to live up to the ambitions that we have for Europe, ambitions that require us to seek increased growth and competition."
"To this end, we need to spend less, but spend better."
"Reform is therefore necessary, not to enable us to do everything nor to continue the ‘sprinkling’ approach that we have adopted so far, but to enable us to meet the expectations of the public."
"Meeting the expectations of the public means quite simply, for example in employment policy, not having any more of these policies of providing secondary assistance or patching up the crutches that are already available."
"Because if we want to create 15 million jobs, we will need to innovate under the Lisbon Agenda and implement new policies that are original and dynamic and that foster private initiative."
"We will need to educate, inform the public, pursue these policies that we have started to implement, policies that generate jobs, and in addition accelerate structural reforms."
"We will need to promote investment in infrastructure, in transport, in communications, in human resources and in research, which is still being left out in the cold and whose budget is in my view far from adequate."
"Let us nevertheless bear in mind that all of this should meet an objective of sustainable development, a factor in creating stability."
"And let us refrain from making scapegoats of certain groups of society, such as our poor farmers, because we really do need them and they need us."
"Clearly, we find the proposals that the Commission has made to us reassuring, and I would particularly like to welcome the proposals for the new regional policy put forward by Commissioner Barnier."
"The choice that has been made seems to me to be an excellent one, because it will provide the enlargement countries with the necessary support without isolating the regions in the current Member States that need these funds."
"We must actually continue to meet the needs of the areas covered by the present fifteen Member States, fostering their competitiveness and growth so as to fight against unemployment."
"Were we not to do so then the public would simply not understand."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the European Commission is endeavouring with its proposal to strike a balance between the increased financing requirements of enlargement and the difficulties of the short-term economy and the options of the strong Member States."
"However, sustainable development in the Member States must be supported and the role of the European Union as global partner must be strengthened."
"In addition, the new financial perspective must send out a clear political message about equal treatment and solidarity between the Member States and, if you will allow me to dwell on this point, the needs of the regions which suffer the repercussions of so-called 'statistical convergence'."
"The citizens in these developing regions see political cohesion as the main element in making the idea of the European Union a worthy idea and I do not agree at all with the view heard in this Chamber that there are no beneficial results from this policy."
"At the same time, the citizens in these regions wanted and agreed to the extensive enlargement which will be completed in a few weeks' time."
"Morally and politically, therefore, it is fair for these citizens not to lose so much that they lose the feeling of solidarity which they have had to date, enjoying its fruits."
"Clearly, there must be a smooth withdrawal of Community aid from these regions, with a transitional period in which support is wound down."
"It is vital during this period to safeguard adequate funding."
"Any thoughts of making reductions, especially large reductions, in appropriations which, it can be presumed, would have devolved upon these regions without enlargement, jeopardise the efficacy of the political cohesion which is under way and, consequently, must be treated as harmful to the credibility of the European Union."
"– Mr Prodi, it is difficult not to agree with the situation as you have described it here today."
"I have two doubts, which I am sure you will be able to solve: first of all, I come from a long history of militancy in a party that must surely remind you of something, and during that time I have learned that too much realism in politics often means the start of conflict."
"It seems to me that your request to freeze at 1.24%, that is to say at the current level, the amount of GDP allocated – an allocation which, inter alia, is still based on 12 countries, whereas we are now 25 and will probably continue to expand – is a position lacking not only in ambition but also in courage, and I base that criticism on two facts."
"Firstly, we have just approved a quick start programme for public works designed to relaunch the idea of Europe and the single market, in which we need the Member States to be involved and to provide resources, which is why I find it extremely difficult to understand the position of the six Member States that have called for a reduction in the amount allocated."
"Secondly, in any negotiations, sticking to a position knowing that some of the Member States do not agree with the reference to 1%, appears to me to be quite a complex negotiating position from a tactical point of view."
"The second doubt concerns the timing."
"The current financial situation is programmed up to the end of 2006; the Commission must present a proposal before July 2005 and the agreement must be reached before May 2006."
"So then, why the urgency?"
"So that we can rush things through in a Parliament whose mandate is about to expire?"
"As Mr Wynn correctly pointed out, our Parliament has an extremely important role to play, but that role will be played by the Parliament to be elected on 13 June."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, neither the restriction to 1% nor the Commission’s proposal for an expansion to 1.24%, which amounts to 1.15% in reality, can be the signal we send to Europe’s citizens and taxpayers today."
"Naturally, the letter from the six governments so soon after the collapse of the Summit was a mistake in terms of its timing, tone and content and was therefore quite unacceptable."
"Equally, however, in response to the Commission’s ideas – and you, President Prodi, have presented some interesting keywords, although we will have to discuss them in far more detail – I must say that what is urgently required in the coming months is a critical review of the European Union’s agenda, with a focus on both positive and negative aspects across the board in all policy fields, if we want to identify honest and practical responses for Europe’s citizens."
"Naturally, the outcome of our discussions today cannot be binding on the new Commission, which will still have to be approved by the new Parliament; nor can it be binding in any way on the new Parliament in its capacity as part of the budgetary authority."
"As part of this more critical approach, however, it is essential, first and foremost, to complete the constitutional treaty and define the system of powers, also in line with the subsidiarity principle."
"This also means that if powers are transferred back to the Member States in an enlarged EU, we will need fewer resources for these areas at European level."
"However, it also means that if tasks are transferred to the European level – such as foreign, security and development policy – the Member States will have to look again at the possibility of not only increasing the EU budget but also reducing spending at national level."
"I would like to conclude by raising two points."
"After all, it is not just a matter of freeing up budget funds in order to deal with new objectives, improving competitiveness and growth potential."
"What I think is missing, especially in the light of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy to be discussed next month, is that here, the Commission itself has not established the coherence on many legislative proposals, which is necessary to achieve the binding consolidation that will generate growth potential and entrepreneurial freedoms throughout the European Union."
"If what you are proposing in the budget is flanked by such initiatives, our credibility will be much improved."
"In addition, we see the option of reverting to Article 272 of the Treaty without binding new Parliaments and new institutions as a very exciting one."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Commission communication on the new financial perspective as an interesting debating exercise for the future."
"It will not be this Commission or this Parliament that take the final decisions, but here is the result and we must thank the entire College of Commissioners for having incorporated the various sensibilities."
"We consider this to be a good basis for negotiation."
"A financial perspective that is properly negotiated among the three institutions is a vital element for the rational development of the Union’s expenditure and for ensuring growth, competitiveness, employment, and economic and social cohesion within a framework of budgetary stability."
"That is the financial perspective on which this Parliament would like to vote."
"We would never vote in favour of a financial perspective based simply on accounting calculations or imposed unilaterally by one institution that had not negotiated with the others."
"This Parliament has already set out its position on three aspects of the financial perspective."
"The first of those was its duration, which in principle should coincide where possible with the duration of the mandates of the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Secondly, we have also stated our support for providing greater impetus for the political objectives laid down in Lisbon and Gothenburg."
"This development takes shape through the Union’s annual budgets and it is clear that without sufficient financial resources there can be no credible objectives."
"Indeed, look at the 2005 draft budget and you will see what budget restrictions are."
"Thirdly, we have on many occasions expressed our support for a financial perspective that is capable of fulfilling the objective of cohesion."
"Cohesion is and will continue to be the major inspiration behind the EU’s policies along with growth and stability."
"The 0.45% of gross national income for cohesion measures has been incorporated by this Parliament and forms part of our approach."
"If we cut corners with cohesion policy we will surely fail."
". Mr President, on behalf of the presidency of the Council, I thank President Prodi for the presentation on the policy orientation provided by the European Commission for the Union's next multiannual financial framework: it is an important communication."
"The negotiations ahead will be of fundamental importance for the development of the enlarged Union well into the next decade."
"What is at issue, therefore, is much more than the financial framework for the Union."
"It is also the policies and priorities which can best address the aspirations of your citizens."
"As mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, the negotiations will run well into 2005."
"However, the Irish presidency will begin discussions and give priority to advancing the dossier as effectively as possible."
"The President of the Commission will brief Coreper tomorrow, and on 23 February there will be a first discussion by ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"Our aim as presidency will be to initiate and advance discussions and, in cooperation with succeeding presidencies, to map out how best to process the dossier and lay a solid foundation for our successors."
"We hope in this regard that the spring European Council might be able to agree on the calendar and process for negotiations."
"The Council looks forward to working constructively with Parliament and the Commission in advancing this important dossier."
"With your permission, Mr President, may I finally join with you, Mr Wynn and others in the warm expressions of congratulations and goodwill to Mr Colom i Naval and to wish him all the very best for the future."
". – Mr President, I will say a few words and then Commissioner Schreyer will reply to some of the more technical questions."
"There has been one general criticism running through this debate – a debate for which I am sincerely grateful, because Parliament has genuinely exercised its institutional pride on the issue of the budget and has given us precious advice – criticism made by some important Members of Parliament, beginning with Mr Wynn: a lack of ambition, as Mr Fiori also pointed out, and the assertion that an excess of realism leads to weakness."
"So, I should like to point out that the structure of the budget we are presenting indicates a radical change with the past – not only quantitatively but also qualitatively; it constitutes an ambitious project that will give rise to serious problems and a fierce debate when the time comes for it to be adopted."
"I ask you to consider just a few figures: I have spoken about sustainable development;"
"I did not want to provide analytical data because I believe that we need to consider such data together at some length, but in relation to the Lisbon process funds will increase by 62.8% – from EUR 47 billion in 2006 to EUR 76 billion in 2013 – allowing for a 32% increase in cohesion funds, 300% for funds earmarked for education and training, 200% for research funds, 400% for funds earmarked for competitiveness and networks."
"We have made choices that are coherent, precise and dramatically different from those of Lisbon: we have placed, within the context of an extremely ambitious draft budget, appropriations for the area of justice, which is one of the major areas of the Union – it was not by chance that I referred to it as one of the Union’s three lines of action – that is to say funds are to increase by almost 200% from EUR 1 billion in 2006 to EUR 3.6 billion in 2013."
"These, I repeat, are radical changes."
"Finally, the international situation: funds are to increase by almost 40% from EUR 11 billion in 2006 to EUR 15.7 billion in 2013."
"So then, we have made some stark choices – which I hope will be accepted – in keeping precisely in line with the objectives."
"We did not, ladies and gentlemen, begin building from the roof, but from the foundations, studying the new objectives and analysing what had been decided in previous years with the decisions taken at Lisbon and subsequent decisions."
"On this basis we have constructed a coherent budget so that Europe can relaunch itself, re-establish a united policy on justice and internal affairs and re-establish its voice in the world."
"There are three areas on which we have consolidated and focused our attention, and therefore this is a response which I consider ambitious; realistic and ambitious."
"I say realistic because it is clear that genuine situations, temperaments and even political trends cannot be ignored."
"I assure you that the procession of the six ambassadors who brought me the 1% letter resembled more than anything a funeral cortege, and it is clear that this makes no sense in a Europe that must react, that must go forward, that has enormous responsibilities for everyone."
"So, we have taken a major gamble: stark choices, extremely radical choices, as the detailed line by line analysis of the budget will show."
"In conclusion, a final observation: why have we started so early, Mr Fiori?"
"Out of respect for those who are to come after us."
"The timeframes are extremely long."
"When, at the end of our term of office, we hand over the whole project with its roadmap, when our work is completed, they will need – so it has been said – about twelve months, possibly more: going on past experience, 18 months will be needed to fine-tune the finished product; that means the beginning of 2006, January/February 2006."
"Care must be taken to provide enough time to learn the procedures, prepare the financing procedures and organise the financing structure, which is only just adequate, so that the objectives we have set ourselves can be met."
"The work we have carried out is wide-ranging but absolutely essential."
"It is clear that none of the decisions taken today will become operative under this term, we are well aware of that."
"It will be the new Parliament that will decide but, if we do not place the new Parliament in the position to decide, it will not be possible to make payments at the beginning of 2007."
"We have worked on this, Mr Fiori, because I can assure you of one thing: we never attempt to perform tasks that are not useful or are unnecessary."
"This has involved an enormous amount of work and perhaps we would willingly have avoided it had it not been for the benefit of the Union."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU faces major challenges and we must decide whether – and how – we, as a Community, will respond to these challenges."
"The objectives set jointly by the Member States are indeed very ambitious."
"By 2010, the EU is to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world; it is to become an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Europe is determined to take on more responsibility in the world, and we are about to embark on the historic reunification of the continent and the integration of the new EU Member States."
"The financial perspective establishes an important framework for decisions on the policies and tools that we will deploy to shape the future together."
"In order to achieve the ambitious objectives we have set ourselves and ensure that the Union can fulfil the growing expectations of its Member States and citizens, appropriate resources must be provided to underpin the policies."
"We should not raise expectations and then fail to deliver on the policies."
"That would generate disappointment among citizens."
"However, we should only provide European funding from the public purse for policies if we can state with confidence – as the President of the Commission has already said – that we are creating added value – in other words, if we can achieve greater benefit by spending a euro at European level than by spending it at national level."
"At the same time, Europe must continue to uphold budgetary discipline."
"Budgetary discipline means the own resources ceiling, which is set at 1.24%."
"The Commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period."
"However, the Commission has also clearly stated that the proposal by the six Member States to impose a budget cap at 1% not only conflicts with the objectives but quite simply does not stand up to a reality check."
"The Commission is proposing an average level of appropriations for commitments of 1.22% for the period 2007 – 2013."
"If we also include expenditure for the European Development Fund and the sound new instrument of the Solidarity Fund, the appropriations for commitments stand at 1.26%."
"Commitments for payments will thus average 1.14% of combined economic performance, or GNI, over the period."
"That means that the budget volume that we are proposing can be set at an average of 1.14% of GNI."
"Let me comment on the length of the financial perspective, as this is quite rightly a very important issue for this House."
"The Commission completely agrees that for democratic and institutional reasons, five years would be the right length of time."
"The question is simply this: at which point in time is it most appropriate to commence this cycle?"
"We have discussed this matter in considerable detail."
"On the one hand, given that we have set agricultural spending up to 2013, and since the integration of the new Member States into new programmes is no small matter, and especially also in light of the Structural Funds, and taking account of the question when it is best to start the cycle from an institutional perspective, we are proposing a seven-year period again this time round as a transitional phase, as it were, before commencing the five-year cycle thereafter."
"I would emphasise, yet again, the following points concerning the comparison of figures: this Commission is serious about the proposal to integrate the European Development Fund into the budget."
"It has been stated repeatedly in the past that this would be desirable."
"The measure outlined in our proposal therefore fulfils a demand that this Parliament has quite rightly been voicing for years, for we need an integrated and effective policy for the ACP states, especially for the poorest countries in the world."
"That is why we have put forward this proposal."
"On flexibility, which has been mentioned several times here today: yes, we will need flexibility if we are planning so many years ahead."
"That is why the Commission has said that a revision is always a possible option."
"However, we are also planning new flexibility instruments between the categories in order to be able to adjust priorities in the short term."
"We are also proposing a Growth Adjustment Fund – in other words, a reserve which can be activated additionally if a policy needs to be enhanced for quite specific reasons."
"Let me also emphasise yet again that the Commission is proposing the full integration of the new Member States into the structural and cohesion policies."
"As you are aware, we have based our calculations on a European Union of 27 Member States."
"Throughout this legislative term, which is now drawing to a close, this House, the European Parliament, has argued robustly and with great success in favour of enlargement."
"At the same time, it has championed the cause of deepening and European integration."
"In other words, it has always been in favour of more Europe and an efficient Europe."
"In doing so, you have consistently upheld budgetary discipline and have been successful here as well."
"At the end of this legislative term, you can stand before Europe’s citizens and say, with your hand on your heart, that you have done the very best you could with the European budget and genuinely created a great deal of value-added in Europe out of just 2.3% of total public spending."
"These comments are directed to the Council Presidency in particular."
"You are now working – and I hope this work will be successful – to ensure the adoption of the new constitution. A key issue here is to equip the European Parliament with more budgetary rights, especially codecision rights in respect of the financial perspective."
"In my view, the financial perspective must have the endorsement of the European Parliament."
"Let me take this opportunity to address Mr Colom i Naval."
"I am at a loss to know how the deliberations on the financial perspective can take place without your powerful commitment and your powerful voice."
"I wish you every success in your new position."
"Your region is very fortunate in having secured your services in this key post."
"I would like to close by citing an Irish writer, because we have the Irish Presidency at the moment and also, of course, as a tribute to the President of this Parliament."
"Oscar Wilde once said that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing."
"I think that in the coming months, we will have very intensive arguments over spending."
"However, the key issue is not only expenditure, but also Community policy and the values of the European Union, and I am sure that this House will play a very active and committed role in this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"– Before negotiating the financial perspective for 2007-2013, it is important to have a clear idea of the political backdrop to this issue."
"In this respect, today’s debate is an opportunity for the Commission, as is often the case, to try to win the support of the European Parliament for a relatively high level of annual resources, of 1.24% of gross national income (and that is without the European Development Fund), against the position of the contributing Member States, including France, which would like 1% (as in 2004)."
"This alliance between Parliament and the Commission is an implicit reference to the idea of a gradual expansion of the Union’s remit, which is intended to lead one day to a federal budget."
"I might add that in parallel the Commission is launching a campaign for a European tax."
"We must avoid any drift in this direction, so as not to sustain a new bureaucracy and not to compromise the competitiveness objectives that were set in Lisbon."
"The European Union, which is at the service of the Member States, should not be cornering their tasks, in particular that of redistribution."
"It should simply provide the added value that comes from coordination, which only requires slim administrations and limited resources."
"It should live from the contributions that the nation states vote for and control on an annual basis."
"Under these conditions, the position currently held by the paying Member States seems to us to be entirely justified."
". This debate on the new Financial Perspective shows that there is an enormous gap between promises and reality."
"What we are seeing is, unfortunately, a repeat of Agenda 2000, when what we really needed was to increase funds, bearing in mind the growing needs in terms of social and economic cohesion resulting from enlargement, and to promote sustainable development, high quality jobs, improved social conditions and cooperation and development policies with the least-developed countries."
"What is happening shows the disgraceful nature of the ‘Group of Six’s’ blackmail in placing a ceiling in the Community budget of 1% of GNP, which would lead to what we feel is an unacceptable solution."
"This has also been shown with the Commission’s unacceptable proposal, which does not meet the needs of the acceding countries, growing social inequality, appalling unemployment or the poverty and exclusion that can be seen in current EU countries, such as Portugal."
"Yet the question is not exclusively about finance."
"Of equal importance are the priorities and revision of the objectives and of the instruments of cohesion and budget structure to which they correspond."
"The guiding principle of competitiveness, strategic realignment based on the Lisbon Agenda, the realignment of foreign policy towards actions within the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Spatial Development Perspective, and of internal policy based on questions of immigration policing and border controls, encompass areas that lead European integration down a dangerous path."
"The next item is Question Time, but we will begin with a point of order from Mr Dupuis, who may address the House briefly."
"– Mr President, strange forces are at work in the management of our questions."
"In December I asked a question on Croatia."
"It was held over from the January part-session until this part-session."
"I thought in good faith that it had been held over because Mr Verheugen was to have been with us at this session and other Members had also asked questions about Croatia’s accession."
"Nothing of the sort!"
"Furthermore, not only do I find that my question is at the end of the list and not at the beginning, which would have been logical given that it was withdrawn in January, but also I know that it will not be possible to receive an oral answer."
"And of course I have not been able to ask another question for February."
"I would like the services to take careful note of this fact and for it to be reflected in the Minutes of this sitting, because I really do not think that this is as it should be."
"There are some very dubious goings-on surrounding Croatia’s accession process."
"Some countries are blocking it and I will name them: they are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands."
"We urgently need a debate to clarify all of this."
"Mr Dupuis, the Commission decides which Commissioners attend Question Time and determines the distribution of questions; in any event, we note what you are saying and will pass on your concerns to the Commission."
"The next item on the agenda is Question Time (B5-0007/2004)."
"We will begin with questions to the Commission."
"As the author is not present, Question No 34 lapses."
"Can the Commission inform the House of the measures that it is promoting to support low-cost travel in Europe, taking into account the fact that the vast majority of EU citizens fully support and recognise the importance of low-cost air travel within the European Union?"
". As a result of the liberalisation of air transport in the European Union at the beginning of the 1990s – which was in fact based on legislative proposals from the Commission – we can see the extent to which competition has increased between the various airlines in the European Union and how users are benefiting from lower prices and better supply."
"In this context, a new phenomenon has appeared: that of the so-called low-cost airlines."
"The Commission considers this to be a positive development: it increases supply for passengers, results in greater economic activity and possibilities for consumers, and offers opportunities for lower costs."
"The Commission’s action seeks to ensure that this development continues through the strict application of the rules on competition and State aid."
"To this end, I must point out that our task is not to support one sector or another, but to provide balanced standards that allow for the development of the various types of aviation activities: the traditional companies with their style of business, and the new companies, described as low-cost companies, which have a somewhat different market and which have undoubtedly generated a significant increase in competition, supply and opportunities for users."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her reply and ask a question arising from it."
"In light of the recent investigation by the Commission into the arrangements of Ryanair at Charleroi Airport, is it not now the case that regional airports in Europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take, as well as on their future development?"
". I believe that, on the contrary, the Commission’s solution and response in the case of Ryanair in Charleroi – which relates to the State aid given by Charleroi airport rather than to Ryanair, and that is the problem – opens up new possibilities for the promotion and development of regional airports, which are a driving force for regional development, and for the operation of the so-called ‘budget airlines’ from those airports."
"I believe that the decision taken by the Commission is balanced."
"It has given the green light to most of the aid received by Ryanair throughout this time."
"Though it is true that limits have been imposed, in terms of time and above all in terms of the availability of this aid for any other company which is willing to carry out this type of activity, for the sake of equal treatment of all airlines operating in Europe and of transparency in these types of operation."
"I repeat, however, that I believe the decision on Charleroi favours regional airports and budget airlines."
"We must remember that in the case of Charleroi we have not acted on our own initiative, because the Commission had received complaints and because, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission is obliged to deal with them."
"In fact, there have been complaints in relation to other airports in various countries of Europe."
"We will deal with them in the coming months, when all the facts of each case are clarified."
"I believe that we are thereby helping to clarify the situation, because there are a series of other regional airports which, thanks to the response in the case of Charleroi, are going to be able to provide airlines with similar conditions, which allow them to expand and carry out their activities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has emerged that railway companies are now competing with the cheap tickets offered by the airlines."
"How do you intend to proceed with regard to the state aid that is currently being paid to the railways?"
"Will restrictions on the options apply here as well?"
"In Austria, for example, 7% of the budget is spent on the railways."
"That amounts to around EUR 500 per citizen in subsidies to the railways, which are now competing directly with the privately-owned low-cost airlines."
"This means that there is unfair competition between the cheap tickets offered by the airlines and those offered by the railways."
"I would be very pleased if you took similar action against the railways."
". I would like to remind the honourable Member that we have not yet liberalised passenger transport in the rail sector."
"In each country, therefore, railways operate as the country sees fit and they receive the aid which each country is prepared to give them, in accordance with the criteria of public service and maintenance of companies, amongst others."
"It is therefore currently possible that budget airlines are competing with railways, but the latter are receiving State support in practically every country."
"At a later date, following a discussion on the third railways package, which I hope the honourable Members will shortly receive for discussion, and which I hope the next Parliament and the next Commission can complete, we plan to introduce competition into passenger rail transport on international lines, not on national lines."
"When that time comes, we will have to consider the effects this will have in terms of competition, but – I repeat – the aid we have authorised is limited in terms of time and quantity."
"In no event may it exceed a maximum of 50%, of operating costs and, furthermore, they must be decreasing for a maximum of five years."
"I believe that this is a balanced decision, which allows us to combine support for a regional airport, which – I repeat – provides stimulus and economic activity for a region."
"In the case of Wallonia – an Objective 1 region which is lagging behind the Community average – that is what justifies the support for aid, not whether or not there are cheap tickets."
"The fact that an airline offers people cheap tickets does not justify their receiving public aid."
"The justification for the authorisation of public aid at a particular time, and for Charleroi giving it to Ryanair, is the fact that Charleroi is a regional airport in a depressed region, in order to provide that region with stimulus and activity, which is completely different, and as assistance for launching new routes and new connections."
"We have also agreed on the possibility of granting aid in the air sector when the criterion of public service is fulfilled."
"For example, in the case of the outermost islands and island groups, on grounds of internal public service."
"In this case too, conditions relating to transparency, competition and equal treatment must be fulfilled."
"Would the Commission please detail how or if it plans to issue information and/or advice to Member States on the free movement of labour from accession countries after 1 May 2004?"
". Mr President, the Commission has already taken measures to inform citizens about the transitional arrangements relating to the free movement of workers."
"An electronic guide on the subject of the free movement of workers to the new Member States is already operating and can be found on the Commission's website in 20 languages."
"At the same time, a printed leaflet will soon be available in all the languages."
"As far as the Member States are concerned, we must make it clear that the Treaty makes provision during the first two years after accession for access to job markets to be the subject of bilateral agreements or national decisions by the Member States."
"Again according to the Treaty, the Member States are not obliged to tell the Commission what they intend to do during this stage."
"Of course, for reasons of transparency, the Commission has asked the Member States to notify their position and I should like to inform you that, so far, the United Kingdom and Ireland have stated that they intend to open the job markets fully, while Austria, Germany, Belgium, Finland and Denmark have stated that they will apply national measures for the first two years."
"Austria and Germany have also stated that they intend to cite the saving clause in order to limit access to certain service sectors listed in the Treaty."
"In all events, when we have all the information from all the Member States, we shall notify Parliament."
"In addition, the Commission is in regular contact and cooperation with the services of the Member States, so that we can guarantee the uniform application of these transitional arrangements and can also proceed to issue certain interpretative guidelines which have to date been the subject of cooperation and consultation with the Member States."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that answer."
"Your colleague, Commissioner Vitorino, has also answered this question very comprehensively and skilfully in the past, arguing that the wild numbers predicted for Portugal when it joined the European Union were way off the mark."
"We are now witnessing the same phenomenon with predictions for movement of labour from the accession countries."
"My point is that I would not ask the Commission to give out information which it has no legal requirement to provide."
"I am glad of the cooperation between the Commission and Member States."
"But there is real confusion."
"The noble aim of enlargement has led to confusion among people on the ground – European citizens – who are now anxious about the extreme predictions of the numbers of people who will come."
"I do not agree with these extreme predictions, but the Commission has a role to play in giving out sensible information about what we can expect and what it will mean for free movement and, indeed, for benefits regimes – although this is a matter for Member States."
"That is not coming through collectively."
"On a more positive note, I would ask about movement the other way – people from existing Member States who, for example, would like to retire in Cyprus or work in Poland."
"We are getting enquiries about that positive element of movement."
"Will the Commission provide information?"
". It is easily understandable that in many Member States, particularly those with common borders with the newcomers, public opinion is concerned about the impact on the labour market."
"I have said repeatedly that there are many independent studies concerning the flow of immigrants after day one of enlargement, working on the assumption that ten newcomers will join Europe at the same time."
"The overall conclusion of these analyses is that mobility from the new Member States to the current 15 Member States is likely to remain rather limited."
"As for the questions concerning social rights, let me repeat two things."
"First, from the moment that a worker is a legal worker in a Member State, he or she has all social rights and access to all kinds of benefits and social security systems."
"As far as pension rights are concerned, during the Italian presidency we agreed on a regulation covering the social rights and pension rights of workers not only from the new countries, but also from third countries."
"That regulation provides a concrete answer to the question of pension rights."
"Following on from that question, Commissioner, I should like to raise the issue of derogation and the issue of regulations that are being unilaterally applied by some countries that have not applied for derogation."
"In the case of the UK, it has indicated that it is not going to put any block on the movement of those who wish to come and work in the UK."
"Now, however, late in the day, it is talking about a number of regulations of a domestic nature, in relation to our social security and other systems, that will have a discriminatory effect here."
"Does the Commission have a view on this approach or is it happy to leave it entirely at the disposal of domestic governments to decide how they will deal with the matter within the first two years?"
". Mr President, the first two years, in accordance with the Council decision on the management of transitional periods, are a purely national issue."
"The European Union cannot intervene, irrespective of whether this is done with national arrangements and legislation or with bilateral agreements between the new countries and the existing Member States."
"However, what we need to bear in mind is that any agreements will need to comply with the existing European institutional framework."
"Then there can be no question of discrimination, because one country wants to have different arrangements from another."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, Slovakia has set income tax and corporation tax at a flat rate of 19%."
"As a result, many firms in Austria are now planning to open plants in Slovakia, which means that they will of course be employing their workforce in Slovakia as well."
"Does the Commission have any studies indicating how many workers from the current European Union are likely to migrate to these attractive tax regions as industry is relocated?"
"Will the balance be maintained, or will there even be a clear out-migration of workers from the Member States in the first two years, especially since the opportunity to move from the new Member States to the current EU will only exist thereafter?"
"Thank you."
". Of course there are studies on the movement of companies from the Member States to the new countries, but I would say that the huge wave of company relocations has been completed and today, with the obligation of the new countries to apply European law fully as regards the internal market and the job market, companies do not have the same incentives that they had in the past."
"There is, of course, always the problem of low labour costs, but that is something we know, which is why the strategy on employment focuses on the question of investment in human resources and fundamental change in the orientation of jobs in Europe."
"How successful does the Commission judge that the Union's five-year strategy has been – it runs out during 2004 – given the flood of heroin and other drugs on our streets?"
". The EU drugs strategy 2000-2004 provides a framework for a balanced and integrated approach on all drug-related activities in the European Union."
"It has also been endorsed by the new Member States and the candidate countries who have, in the meantime, set up national drug strategies and improved their capacities for taking action against drugs with the support of the Phare Programme."
"The Union also has a number of drug action plans involving certain regions either producing or serving as transit countries for drugs, such as Latin America, Central Asia and the Balkans."
"Research shows that a link between a particular drug policy line and the drug situation is difficult to establish."
"The availability and careful evaluation of relevant and reliable information are undoubtedly key elements in developing an evidence-based drug policy."
"The work of the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and the work of Europol in this area form part of the basis for the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mid-term evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs."
"This mid-term evaluation was a first step in a larger process."
"By the end of this year we will have the final evaluation."
"Without wanting to pre-empt the results of the final evaluation, the following developments on the EU drugs market can already be observed."
"Heroin seizures have increased since 2001."
"Our assessment is that street prices are generally stable or even decreasing."
"The number of heroin addicts seems to be relatively stable in the European Union, although there are marked differences between the Member States."
"Cannabis remains the most widely-used illicit drug and its use is still increasing in many Member States."
"The use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and the use of cocaine seem to be increasing in certain population groups, although the use of these drugs among the general population remains low."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for a helpful and very informative reply."
"I do not think any blame for the problem lies with you because you do not have many battalions at your disposal!"
"You can only set a lead."
"The price of heroin going down would suggest that the supply of heroin is increasing."
"We know that the crop in Afghanistan is getting bigger and bigger, and with the use of cannabis and synthetic drugs ever growing, clearly we are not winning the battle."
"So my question is: how can we strengthen policing in Europe in the fight against the use and the distribution of drugs?"
". Thank you for recognising that to a certain extent I am like the Pope: I have no legions at all!"
"Indeed you are right, Mr Newton Dunn, the main responsibility in this area lies with the Member States."
"But there is a lot we can do, both in internal policy and external policy."
"When it comes to internal policy, one has to recognise that for years now Europol has been playing a very important coordinating role in detecting the main transit routes."
"When we have detected the transit routes, we try to cooperate with such countries in order to prevent the entry into the European Union of those drugs."
"We have made some progress in the Balkan region thanks to cooperation with the countries in the area."
"Thanks to the support of the Cards Programme, we have been developing specific law enforcement capabilities in those countries to fight against drug trafficking."
"I am less positive in my assessment as regards Afghanistan."
"The figures I have at my disposal demonstrate that the poppies are growing and increasing, and it is quite clear that in Afghanistan the political situation is not stable enough to guarantee close cooperation as far as law enforcement is concerned in order to tackle the issue of drugs trafficking."
"I believe this issue – and I know my colleague Commissioner Patten shares this view – will be at the top of the agenda in our negotiations with the Afghan authorities in the near future."
"Mr President, I wish to address a number of subjects I think are related to the drugs issue."
"One concerns the Lisbon Strategy."
"How does the Commissioner view increased drug use and increased drug misuse in the EU in the light of the fact that, by 2010, the EU is supposed to have the strongest economy in the world, with the highest growth and an ecologically sustainable economy?"
"Is it, as it were, good for the labour market that ever more people are giving themselves over to drug misuse?"
"I also wish to put a follow-up question concerning the projected European Corps of Border Guards."
"What would be its role when it comes to seizing drugs?"
". Thank you for raising that question."
"My answer is very clear: no, it is not good at all."
"Firstly, it is not good for people to become addicted to drugs."
"The European Monitoring Centre in Lisbon is developing five key indicators that will allow us to have more reliable data, so that we can compare that data among the Member States and establish a clearer link between the policy line of Member States and the impact of that policy line on the pattern of consumption."
"These five indicators refer to figures for drugs used among the general population, the problem of drug use connected with infectious diseases, drugs-related deaths and the treatment provided by Member States for those who ask to be treated for drug addiction."
"I hope that the work in progress with these five indicators will give us a clearer picture of the situation in Europe."
"I would just add that my concern today is, above all, the proliferation in the use of synthetic drugs and the upsurge of a new profile of drug addict: the poly-consumption consumer."
"Poly-consumption is a new pattern; it comes from a combination of illicit drugs and licit drugs."
"We need more research and more reliable information in order to be able to fight against this new profile that has arisen in the last few years."
"We shall proceed to the second part of this Question Time, during which Commissioner Barnier will reply."
"Biological purification plants have been constructed in many towns in Greece using Structural Fund resources."
"It is reported that 260 of the 290 biological purification plants built are only partly operational or have been abandoned."
"Will the Commission say how many of the biological purification plants funded by the Structural Funds so far are fully operational and how many have operating problems and for which reasons?"
"What does it intend to do to ensure that the biological purification plants which have received substantial Community funding are fully operational and continue to operate?"
"– Mr President, Mr Alavanos asks an important question on a subject that has, moreover, always been of interest to me because, as he knows, I was minister for the environment in my own country and, as you will see from our proposals for the future cohesion policy that we will be tabling next week, I continue to attach great importance to environmental issues."
"His question concerns the operation of treatment plants in Greece."
"According to my information, 233 treatment plants have now been constructed in Greece, although 600 would need to be built to meet the needs of all of the Greek municipalities."
"Most of the treatment plants that have already been built were completed thanks to Community cofinancing, either from the Cohesion Fund or from the ERDF, under integrated Mediterranean programmes, successive Community support frameworks or Community initiatives."
"According to the legislation in force for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, the Greek authorities have to declare that these plants are operational when they submit each final report marking the end of the subsidy."
"However, this same legislation does not give the Commission the power to check itself, after the closure of the programmes or projects, that the cofinanced infrastructure is being properly used and maintained."
"This task, which is very important and which almost, in my opinion, goes without saying, is the responsibility of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, there is a provision that I can mention today, Article 10 of the Council Directive of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment, that provides that Member States shall ensure, and I quote, that, ‘the … treatment plants are … operated and maintained to ensure sufficient performance under all normal local climatic conditions’."
"Article 15(4) of the same directive authorises the Commission to request information on the functioning of all treatment plants that have been built with help from the Structural Funds."
"I can tell Mr Alavanos that this is what we intend to do."
"If anything is amiss then the Commission will take the necessary steps, including possibly initiating an infringement procedure, to ensure that Community legislation is properly applied."
"Exceptionally, and in particular if treatment plants have been abandoned, the Commission will consider recovering the funds in accordance with current legislation."
"That is the useful and I think precise information that I wanted to give Mr Alavanos."
"Commissioner, I thank you on behalf of my honourable friend, Mr Alavanos."
"I too am extremely interested in this question."
"If I understood correctly, and I should like you to confirm this, so far the Commission has not carried out any inspection based on this article, which gives it the facility to check if these biological purification plants are operational."
"Because I should like to repeat what is said in the question, and I know this from my own experience from travelling round Greece, that most biological plants are either not operational or operate defectively or operate from time to time."
"This is a very important matter."
"Complaints have also been sent to the Commission and reports have been sent to the European Parliament."
"When do you intend to conduct these inspections?"
"You said that you would conduct them."
"When do you intend to conduct them?"
". – The Commission’s role is to ensure that the Member States – in this case, Greece – meet their obligations."
"In addition, I should like to tell you, following on from my first answer, that we have been informed that Greece has recently set up a body of environmental inspectors."
"One of this body’s tasks should be to inspect all of the plants that you and Mr Alavanos mentioned."
"In any case, the Commission does not have a mandate to carry out inspections itself for and on behalf of the Member State concerned; subsidiarity applies here, I believe."
"Nevertheless, as I mentioned myself in my first answer, we are able, in accordance with the Council Directive concerning urban waste water treatment – we have the authority, if I may say so – to request information on the operation of all treatment plants."
"Encouraged by Mr Alavanos’s question, I can confirm that I will be doing this in the course of the next few weeks."
"At the end of December 2003, the Spanish Government submitted an application for funding for the project to divert water from the River Ebro to Spain's eastern seaboard."
"Is the Commission aware that on 14 January 2004, Elvira Rodriguez, the Spanish Minister for the Environment, announced that work on the project would begin in February 2004?"
"What is the Commission's opinion on that decision and what stance will it adopt with respect to it, bearing in mind that it has not taken any decision as regards the viability of the project?"
". – Mr President, Mr Ferrández Lezaun’s question reminds me of the debate that we had recently with Mrs Wallström in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on this major dossier of the Ebro."
"The Spanish authorities have requested Community financing from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds for the project to divert water from the River Ebro."
"The eligibility dates of the expenditure for the various sub-projects are 29 December 2003 and 1 January 2002 respectively."
"The Spanish authorities do not therefore need to wait for the Commission to give its decision before starting these projects, given that beginning the work will in no way prejudice the Commission’s decision on whether to grant Community financing."
"In other words, it is one thing to start the project and it is quite another to receive confirmation of Community financing."
"If, then, after investigating this project as part of an overall process of reflection on the Ebro – as I said the other day before the Committee on the Environment – the Commission were to decide not to support particular parts of the overall project, the Member State alone would have to bear the cost of the expenditure incurred."
"That is my answer to the question."
"Commissioner, I am sorry to return to this issue which is constantly being repeated, but there is currently enormous confusion in Spain."
"The Spanish Government, without going any further, with the famous and recently approved Júcar-Vinalopó project, also created a problem in terms of its identity and where the water from the Ebro could not go, within the Júcar-Vinalopó project, and I had to ask the Commissioner a question – and I am extremely grateful to her for having replied to me."
"In this case, however, we return to the same problem."
"You are aware of the serious problems in Spain of a social and, possibly, environmental nature."
"What would happen if, once the work is finished, you, without considering economic factors or funds, simply do not comply with European legislation?"
"What will we do in that case?"
"Put all the work back to its original state, with all the expense that that would entail?"
"We would therefore like to ask you whether you believe it makes more sense for the Commission to ask the Spanish Government to suspend any actions relating to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, in a precautionary fashion, until the Commission has taken a decision?"
". – Mr Ferrández Lezaun, I quite understand your impatience and your concern to have this clarified."
"We had a fairly frank and constructive debate on this matter the other day in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, with Mrs Wallström’s agreement, I gave a fairly resolute answer."
"In my own view, even though, administratively, several different funding sources are involved, indeed several different programmes – regional programmes in Andalusia, Valencia and Murcia, as well as the Cohesion Fund, which are varied instruments that may all contribute in one way or another to funding the project to divert water from the River Ebro – this is one single project and its strategic importance is such as to warrant being examined as a whole by the Commission."
"This is, I think, a clear answer and is along the lines that you wanted."
"Once again, we are going to consider any request as part of a comprehensive analysis of the project."
"I said just now that there was nothing to stop the Spanish authorities from starting work on various parts of the project if they so wished."
"These parts of the project will have to be carried out in accordance with the environmental legislation."
"We will check that they are, as this is very important."
"The Commission also needs to issue a favourable assessment of the Ebro project if Community funding is to be authorised."
"By starting the work very early, the Spanish authorities are taking the responsibility for any appeals to the Court of Justice for, for example, not respecting current legislation on the environment."
"There is also a risk that, since the Commission will be making its overall assessment of the Ebro project after work has started, the expected funding may not materialise."
"Legally, that is as much as I can say."
"I would simply add that the answer that I gave about the overall assessment that we want to make of the project, which is one single project even though it comprises several parts, is, I think, what you wanted to hear."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner in particular for the clarity with which he has replied, just as he did at the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in response to a similar question from Mr Ferrández."
"I hope that, following this second reply, Mr Ferrández will be fully aware of how things are proceeding here – of what the Commission and the Spanish Government are really doing: in other words, it should be made very clear that the Spanish Government is not doing anything illegal by beginning work at certain points of what will be the Ebro diversion."
"I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for his clarity because ideas are sometimes communicated which lead to confusion amongst the Spanish citizens and I hope that all the doubts which Mr Ferrández is constantly raising have finally been cleared up."
"I would remind the honourable Members that they take the floor especially to put questions."
"Since 15 seconds remain, you may ask a question if you wish, Mrs Avilés."
"We would like Mr Barnier to tell us how long it will take the Commission finally to respond to this demand, which is of genuine concern to the Spanish people, and in Aragón in particular."
". – I do not wish to commit myself by giving you an answer and running the risk of being contradicted later on."
"We should actually be aware that this project is complex and that, as is only proper, we need to examine it from the point of view of Community legislation on the environment, from the point of view of the rules and, finally, from the point of view of this rather original analysis that we wish to conduct of the entire project. I think the Spanish authorities have finally understood our approach, whereas at the beginning it was more a question of gaining approval on a project-by-project basis."
"We want to produce an overall assessment of all of the information that is available to us, in particular of the effectiveness of the project and its cost to consumers."
"Ideally, we would like to be ready to issue this assessment during the course of the summer, at the end of this six-month period."
"We have carried out preliminary studies, internal consultations and economic analyses."
"The Commission’s assessment will cover all of the technical projects themselves but will also include the economic analysis that will be made of them."
"This is, after all, a major ecological project and we are therefore going to proceed responsibly, which should enable us to issue our overall assessment of the Ebro water transfer project during the course of the summer."
"The mistake proposed by this Parliament was made very clear to me at the meeting on the 16th, with Commissioner Wallström and yourself."
"Before moving on to the specific subject of Mr Ferrández’s question and your reply, I will say that I am from Valencia, on the banks of the Júcar River, which today is dying as a result of there not having been a rigorous environmental impact study."
"We all know that work of this magnitude is irreversible once it is built."
"Therefore, the socio-economic effects and the destruction and deterioration of the environment would be less harmful if today this Parliament were to send a note to the Spanish Government telling it to suspend the project as a precaution until it is examined by this Parliament."
". – We obviously need much more time to debate this subject, which is of great importance to the European Parliament and Members of all political hues."
"Mrs Bergaz Conesa, in the two cases that I mentioned just now and that were the subject of the question that I was asked, the Commission does not have the right to order a preventive suspension of the work."
"I am obliged to tell you this."
"We have gone quite a long way already in stating that, given the extent of this project and all of the ecological, socioeconomic and technical questions that it raises, we have decided to carry out an overall assessment."
"Pending the results of this, some of the work can start."
"It will not be finished by June or July."
"Be that as it may, during the course of the summer the Commission will say: we think that this project is realistic and feasible or that it presents risks or problems."
"On this basis decisions will be made, in particular on whether to commit the European funding that has been requested."
"That is all that I can say today and I should like to thank you for your views and comments."
"One of the main elements involved in creating a European area is cross-border cooperation."
"It has often become clear that it is difficult to achieve proper cooperation because of the difficulties inherent in the various laws applicable in neighbouring countries, and also the lack of a Community public law instrument which would make such cooperation possible."
"Will the Commission soon be submitting a proposal for a legal framework which will make cross-border cooperation possible between state, regional and local governments within the EU?"
". Mr President, I am grateful to you for allowing me to reply to Mr Vallvé, as this question is also important."
"Like Mr Vallvé, the Commission believes that cross-border cooperation is a key element to European integration."
"Furthermore, in a different context, namely that of the Convention on the Future of Europe – in which I took part – I have repeatedly proposed that the draft Constitution should provide a sound constitutional platform for cooperation of this kind."
"In any event, if we are to achieve the harmonious and balanced integration of the entire EU, we must support cooperation, especially cross-border cooperation."
"This is precisely what we are doing with the Interreg III Community initiative, which contains a Strand A specifically dedicated to strengthening cross-border cooperation."
"I am also completely aware of the difficulties that authorities at Member State, regional and local level have experienced in putting in place Interreg cross-border cooperation projects."
"These difficulties have mainly to do with the need for partners on either side of a border to respect both national rights and the administrative rules and procedures of their own country."
"I say this, Mr President, with some degree of experience, as I spent seventeen years as the president of a border region in France, where I was in charge of a large number of projects that encountered the very types of difficulty that I have just mentioned, in my specific case with our counterparts in the Valle d'Aosta in Italy."
"We must therefore provide a stable and shared solution to this problem."
"The Commission has called for a study to catalogue the problems faced by the authorities in charge of these programmes, with some suggestions as to how these problems may be solved."
"The results of this study will be made public in the spring, giving the Commission time to propose appropriate legislative measures in the framework of the future regulation applicable to the coming Structural Funds programming period."
"This legislative proposal will, I believe, be presented in June."
"The Members of your House will be aware that the Commission is to adopt next week, on 18 February, the third report on economic and social cohesion, which I shall be presenting to this House."
"The report will contain proposals for a reformed and strengthened cohesion policy after 2006."
"The creation of a legal framework for cross-border cooperation, which Mr Vallvé so fervently wishes to see, must form part of the proposals that the Commission will support in its third report on cohesion."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I shall reply in your language."
"I should like to thank you for your intervention and to say that I hope that we shall have the opportunity to hear you when you present your report on cohesion, which will not only be about social and economic cohesion, but will now, for the first time, also encompass territorial cohesion."
"I also believe that territorial cohesion will not be possible without a genuine instrument to strengthen cross-border cooperation."
"It is clear that the cities and the regions, or in France’s case the , have had difficulty in setting up cross-border cooperation programmes, given the differences in legislation that exist between the countries concerned."
"I therefore feel that it is at European level that we have to design an instrument that makes such cooperation both possible and, hopefully, easy."
"We await a legislative proposal in this regard, which will contribute towards reinforcing the links between the different countries, in order to dismantle what remains of these borders, described by Robert Schuman as scars of Europe’s history."
". Mr Vallvé, rather than asking me a question, you gave me encouragement."
"You will not have long to wait, since, as I said, I shall be presenting the report on cohesion next Wednesday with Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler."
"I also hope that we will be in a position to do this right here or in Brussels during an enlarged Conference of Presidents, but I am not sure of this yet."
"What I can tell you, Mr Vallvé, is that in this report we move in the direction that you wish."
"I will be going into precise detail, as I have done in the report on cohesion; having worked a great deal with my services and the legal services of the Commission, and having enjoyed your support, I hope that in the legislative programme setting out the regulations for future cohesion policy, I will be able to fulfil your wishes by proposing what may be a kind of cross-border authority."
"These are the directions in which we are moving."
"In fact, Mr Barnier was right to say that there was no explicit question;"
"I thought it could be understood as a question, but in any event a bit of help never does any harm."
"That is why this dialogue is always positive."
"Mr Ortuondo Larrea has a supplementary question."
"Commissioner, as you will be aware, there is a priority project, one of those approved at the Essen Council, on the trans-European networks, relating to the high-speed South-Europe rail connection, and one branch of this project is intended to link the French city of Dax with Vitoria: Dax in the region of Aquitaine and Vitoria in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country."
"Both the region of Aquitaine and the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country wish to promote this project and face difficulties in terms of understanding and application on the part of the respective central governments of the French and Spanish States."
"These two regions wish to move it ahead and I am trying to ensure that within the European Union this cross-border cooperation can be accepted."
"I would therefore ask you the following specific question: is this instrument, which you have told us we may possibly have after the summer, going to relate just to European regional policy funds or can it also be extended to European funds for trans-European transport networks and any other type of actions with Community resources?"
". Firstly, Mr Larrea, regional funds and structural funds have been used to finance transport networks."
"Cohesion funds, and possibly funds from ERDF Objective 1, have intervened, are currently intervening and will continue to intervene on certain strategic sections to finance transport networks of various types, and in particular cross-border transport networks."
"I am broadly in favour and moving in the direction that you wish."
"It strikes me that this new instrument on which we are working may serve to mobilise and make use of European funds, and even if European funds are lacking, I shall admit to you that my dream would be that we might propose the status of cross-border territorial authority, which would be created and which would have access to local, national or regional funds."
"It goes without saying that, even though such a status would be feasible without European funds, it would be even more so with them."
"I need a little more time, but I should like to make an announcement in this regard next week, probably in the cohesion report."
"I shall moreover spend a little more time on the legislative instrument, although I shall bear your suggestion in mind."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Barnier."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 41 to 44 will be replied to in writing(1)."
"We will begin with the 20 minutes for Mr Liikanen."
"The World Summit on the Information Society was announced as a major step forward regarding citizen participation."
"In one of the EU Prepcom-documents (WSIS PrepCom1 document 19/06/2002), the summit itself is seen as a model for the future role of civil society."
"After the Geneva Summit, the disappointment of civil society actors can hardly be underestimated."
"In their 'Civil Society Declaration to the WSIS' entitled 'Shaping Information Societies for Human Needs', civil society representatives agreed unanimously upon the following statement: 'At this step of the process, the first phase of the Summit, Geneva, December 2003, our voices and the general interest we collectively expressed are not adequately reflected in the Summit documents'."
"Does the Commission see the participation of civil society at the WSIS as a failure, does it recognise the need to stimulate and increase civil society participation in the next phases of the WSIS and, if so, what initiatives will it take to stimulate an increase in civil society participation in the next phase of the WSIS?"
". Civil society participated in the World Summit on the Information Society preparatory process and in the summit itself, according to the rules of procedure."
"This is largely the result of the European Union's efforts during the preparatory committees."
"Moreover, the summit's executive secretariat set up a civil society bureau organising 23 families in order to facilitate the participation of various civil society constituencies."
"It even held formal meetings with civil society representatives in Geneva on various occasions."
"It has allowed a broad convergence on key themes such as human rights, freedom of access to and communication of information, media or gender issues."
"I personally participated in a number of those."
"Civil society adopted a declaration on the Information Society, which is available on the official summit website."
"Although the Commission has received rather positive feedback, some civil society representatives could estimate that their views have not been fully taken into account in the final documents adopted by the summit."
"Even if the proposals of civil society were not fully taken on board in the final documents, the Commission is convinced that they have played an influential role."
"As was also pointed out by the Conference of Non-governmental Organisations in consultative relations with the United Nations, some common language is emerging between governments and civil society representatives, paving the way for a better understanding and cooperation in the future."
"Nevertheless, we must remember that the World Summit on the Information Society remains an intergovernmental process under United Nations rules, benefiting from the United Nations' legitimacy and United Nations principles of representation."
"In its upcoming communication to the Council and Parliament, the Commission intends to propose to convey to the summit's executive secretariat a clear message in favour of a stronger role for civil society and to relay that position in its participation in the conference bureau as well as in its contributions."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed response."
"Although I gather that he very much appreciates the input of non-governmental organisations, I notice in my dealings with those organisations that there is still some doubt as to their actual influence."
"I note what the Commissioner is now stating in this connection."
"The preparations for the 2005 Tunis Summit are fully underway."
"I should like to invite the Commissioner to continue his dialogue with the non-governmental organisations."
"As the Commissioner is aware, we in the European Parliament have a meeting planned with a number of organisations as early as the beginning of March."
"He has been invited to this but is, unfortunately, unable to attend in person."
"I should like to invite his Cabinet, or members of his Cabinet, or of his staff, to attend this meeting, which will be held in this House on 1 March."
"I would remind the honourable Members that speaking time is for asking questions, not for making statements."
"Mr Harbour has a supplementary question."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question as an MEP who actually attended the summit in Geneva and was therefore able to see the extensive engagement on the floor of the conference by members of civil society, which I thought was very helpful."
"I would also welcome an invitation to Mr Staes' meeting."
"Although I went to the summit, I was entirely unaware of his interest, so maybe we could get together later."
"One of the points I made when we had a debate on this issue, Commissioner, was that I felt that parliamentarians need to be much better engaged in the process."
"We only had a small meeting with the interparliamentary union. Would he work with the European Parliament so that we can get a better engagement, both of European and national parliamentarians, as part of the Tunis agenda and in the run-up to Tunis?"
". Firstly, I thank Mr Harbour for his active participation in the World Summit and also the participation of the other Members of the European Parliament."
"It was very helpful and supportive."
"I am ready to look for all possible ways to improve our cooperation in an informal context and also in the preparation for the Tunis Summit in 2005."
"I should like to say to Mr Staes that whenever I receive an invitation to the European Parliament I always come, if possible."
"In Finland, to name just that example, only a fraction of public sector web pages are currently accessible without difficulty to the disabled and elderly."
"It can probably be assumed that things are not much better in other Member States."
"This situation is very worrying from the point of view of the digital divide, which the Union is endeavouring to combat, at any rate in its documents."
"Could the Commission draw up a Union-wide programme whereby providers of public services would be obliged to use technologies already available at present so as to enable the visually impaired, say, to benefit from the same services as the able-bodied population?"
". Mr President, the Commission shares Mr Paasilinna’s concern that in Europe the number of public sector websites that are currently accessible without difficulty is too limited."
"After the eEurope action plan adopted in 2000 the Commission recommended in its communication that all public websites should follow the web content accessibility guidelines developed in the World Wide Web Consortium’s web accessibility initiative."
"Parliament took a positive view of this, as is evident from Bastiaan Belder’s report and the resolution taken on it."
"In resolutions by the Council and Parliament the Commission was asked to monitor progress in order to obtain comparable data."
"The Commission has followed these recommendations and in the next few weeks will publish a report explaining what has been achieved."
"The Member States and the institutions of the EU are revising systems so that they harmonise with the guidelines."
"This has mainly been agreed within the context of voluntary eEurope cooperation."
"It has nevertheless to be borne in mind that unhindered access to public sector websites will be a long process, as there are a lot of them."
"It is also to be hoped that organisations for people with disabilities will be actively involved in this."
"When the time came for me to give our instructions I received 26 emails on the same day saying that Commissioner Liikanen’s website did not meet the agreed conditions."
"Pressure like this makes it easier to bring about change."
"At the same time the Commission will naturally look into whether Community non-discrimination policy law needs to be expanded in the future."
"As a result, this spring the Commission is to begin a public hearing on a Green Paper on future strategy to combat discrimination."
"The Green Paper will map out the Community’s progress in practising a non-discrimination policy and raise questions to do with policy development."
"They will include addressing the new challenges that enlargement of the Union will bring with it and laying down policy on action to promote equality in the Union for the next five years."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply and I am delighted to hear that so much is going on."
"Would the Green Paper also cover the lot of the socially excluded and any programmes or plans for closing the digital divide?"
". – Mr President, I shall do my best to see to it that this too is given greater prominence when the matter is being dealt with."
"Thank you."
"The European Agency for Network and Information Security (IT Agency) is reportedly to be located on Crete, a good two hours from the nearest airport in a village with no broadband facility."
"The Commission previously gave the impression that a location close to modern communications, infrastructure, research and an IT industry would be best for the Agency and the work it is being set up to do."
"In the light of this information, does the Commission consider it the optimal situation for the Council to be able to take decisions concerning the location of agencies and authorities behind closed doors?"
"Should such decisions not be taken with greater openness so that the factual arguments in favour of the location can be given greater weight?"
"Does the Commission consider that the location of the IT Agency may have a detrimental effect on its work?"
"Will the Agency be able to carry out its work in accordance with the regulation?"
"Furthermore, does the Commission consider that it would be more cost-effective and efficient if EU agencies and authorities came under the Commission for administrative purposes?"
"The Member States' requirement of one representative per country is in danger of creating ineffective decision-making forums."
"Should expertise not weigh more heavily in the balance than national interests in such contexts so that industry and consumer organisations get better representation?"
"Is the Commission satisfied with the current situation in which countries without railways are represented on the Railway Agency and countries without sea are represented on the Maritime Safety Agency?"
". On 13 December, the representatives of the Member States, meeting at Head of State or Government level, decided by common agreement on the seat of certain offices and agencies of the European Union and, in that context, a decision was taken that the 'European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) shall have its seat in Greece, in a location to be determined by the Greek Government.'"
"Due to its specific nature, the Commission considers that the agency’s basic requirements include advanced and highly secure information technology equipment, support and operations, sufficiently protected against hacking and security attacks, of which it will certainly be a target."
"This includes the equipment underpinning normal office tasks, as well as the agency's intranet and databases used to store data necessary to the work of the agency, or database-driven applications and networks required for interaction with any national administrations."
"Furthermore, making information available both to the general public, as well as to the specialised audiences will require a properly designed, hosted, operated and protected website."
"The very recent malicious code attacks have yet again proven the need for increased coordination between Member States to achieve higher levels of security."
"The Commission is convinced that the setting-up of ENISA, with its own legal personality, is the most efficient way to achieve this objective."
"It favours trust and consequently the direct involvement of industry in its work."
"This involvement is seen as crucial to solving the information security problems in Europe."
"I am pleased to assure you that the Commission is committed to launching ENISA’s operational activities as soon as possible."
"Concerning the honourable Member’s questions on the composition and participation of the management board, the Commission, in line with its communication of December 2002 on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies, generally favours a small-scale management board."
"I made this clear in a statement during the Council on 20 November 2003."
"However, because of the specific tasks assigned to ENISA and the pressing need for its establishment, the Commission has not stood in the way of a first-reading agreement between the legislators."
"The Commission has nevertheless pointed out the exceptional nature of the course taken and reaffirms its eagerness to see the general framework applied."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen, for an absolutely excellent reply."
"Everyone who has followed this matter and has heard the demands we have made of the IT Agency perhaps has difficulty appreciating that those demands related directly to Crete."
"We are concerned that the Agency may be ineffective."
"Parliament will therefore, of course, apply pressure in this area."
"We are totally convinced that the Commission can also help us minimise the negative effects of locating the Agency in Crete, which I do not regard as the ideal location."
"The Council is unfortunately defending incomprehensible positions, for example that such decisions should be made without public scrutiny."
"To be honest, that is incomprehensible, given the legislation on transparency we have elsewhere."
"I shall conclude by putting a question, not because I cannot work out what the Commissioner thinks but because I want a clear answer, which I intend to use in the election campaign in relation to the governments."
"Might the IT Agency be more effective with a smaller management or perhaps with a system of rotation?"
"How important is it that the institutions use tax revenue efficiently and thriftily, and how might we bring this about?"
"Mr President, I agree that we should use tax revenue efficiently."
"That is the first answer."
"The second answer is that the Member States usually want to exert influence upon the day-to-day activities of any strong institution they create."
"They all wish to be able to send a representative to the board of management."
"I have already expressed my view in this House."
"The choice is between adopting a rapid solution during this Parliament’s and this Commission’s terms of office or of waiting for a more uncertain future to arrive."
"I chose the more rapid solution, because all the current crises concerning network security have shown that we must take prompt measures."
"We shall take the last question from Commissioner Liikanen."
"More than 50 000 people die and 1.7 million are injured every year in the EU in road accidents."
"This situation is unacceptable."
"Road safety can be improved by building safer vehicles which also operate more safely."
"Information technology can be used to achieve that goal."
"Can the Commission say what stage has been reached with the e-safety programme and what progress has been made in that programme to improve road safety in Europe?"
". Let me first welcome the consistent activity of Mrs Hedkvist Petersen on the issue of road safety, including eSafety."
"She has a real case here, because the number of road accident fatalities in the current European Union of 15 Member States was about 40 000 per year in 2001."
"This figure is unacceptably high and, therefore, we have the ambitious target to halve this number by 2010."
"A wide range of actions are being taken by the EU and the Member States to make this target a reality, with the result that, according to preliminary data, the number of persons killed on Europe’s roads last year amounted to about 35 000 persons."
"The Commission has recognised the great potential of the new information and communication technologies in saving lives by mitigating the consequences of accidents or even completely avoiding them."
"In September last year the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles'."
"It proposes 11 measures that promote the rapid development and deployment of new active safety systems in Europe."
"The work in realising the actions proposed by the Communication is under way."
"We have established, together with the industry, Member States, stakeholders and Members of Parliament, the 'eSafety Forum'."
"Under the forum seven working groups are active on priority eSafety topics."
"The first results are available in the 2003 Summary Report, which is available on our eSafety website."
"We would very much welcome the opinion of the European Parliament, as well as a commitment from Member States."
"The Commission is also considering mandating the installation in commercial vehicles of electronic systems whose effectiveness has been proven in practice, such as electronic stability systems for buses and heavy goods vehicles."
"Furthermore, the Commission is using the Sixth Framework Programme to develop further the technologies for in-vehicle active safety systems."
"An integrated project, 'Prevent' – which has over 50 partners and an overall budget of EUR 60 million, with about EUR 30 million of Community funding – is the most important project in this area."
"Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen, for an absolutely excellent and very interesting answer."
"We see that a very great deal indeed is happening in this area."
"In the future EU, that is to say an EU with 25 Member States, upwards of 50 000 people will die each year on our roads."
"That is equivalent to a medium-sized Swedish town being wiped out every year."
"We cannot go on like this. We have high hopes of IT technology and the eSafety programme."
"It is a very important piece of work that is going on, and it appears to be at an advanced stage."
"I also hope that Parliament will express its opinion on the report mentioned by Mr Liikanen."
"The industry has made great progress, but there are big differences between one EU country and another in terms of IT sophistication."
"Applications such as these require installations both in cars and in the environment."
"I should like to hear Commissioner Liikanen’s assessment of progress in the various Member States and also in the candidate countries."
"Mr President, the issue addressed by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen is a very major one, namely that of our in actual fact needing cooperation between different sectors."
"We need not only safe cars, but also different types of infrastructure that operate together."
"We have made certain progress in cooperation, for example the common telephone number 112, which makes things easier in the event of road accidents."
"It is quite clear that, in this area, we need more pressure from above to organise the cooperation between industry, infrastructure authorities and insurance companies."
"We hope that the work on eSafety will be of help, and perhaps we could also get the Member States to devote more attention to this sector."
"In our first action programme, eEurope 2002, we had a special approach to e-transport, but it was not, unfortunately, able to create sufficient interest among the Member States."
"One positive thing is that, last autumn, we had a big world conference in Madrid with approximately 7 000 participants."
"The Member States too showed more interest on that occasion."
"The Hungarian Government issued invitations to an eSafety Conference in Budapest in May 2004 where we hope for participation not only from IT ministers but also from transport ministers and the authorities responsible for transport infrastructure."
"If technology and infrastructure are not coordinated, we shall not be able to obtain any practical results."
"I also thank the Commissioner and his services for what is an outstanding programme – the eSafety programme."
"I have been privileged to participate in a number of the high-level working meetings."
"I would like to ask two questions specifically, to add to what he has told us already."
"The first relates to his views about the likely development of the eCall technology, which will give automatic location of a vehicle after an accident."
"This seems to me to be one of the most important proposals on the table and the one that is the most feasible."
"It also builds on our work in mobile telephony."
"Secondly, I want to ask for the Commissioner's assurance that his services will consider sympathetically, in looking at the Phase 2 standards for pedestrian protection, the major contribution that accident avoidance technologies will make in that improvement in reducing pedestrian casualties."
"I have just seen results from German tests which indicate that the Phase 2 structural standards may not bring about the sort of improvements that we had been expecting."
". In reply to the honourable Member, let me say that, regarding the first issue of eCall technologies, we have now seen the first real applications in the marketplace, and they work."
"At the Madrid conference we looked at applications developed by the health authorities and car industry, which showed that, when an accident took place, direct contact could be established with the hospital and the ambulance services were able to locate the place of the accident and make direct telephone contact."
"In technological terms the product is now ready."
"The challenge now is to implement it appropriately."
"But the first issue has been solved."
"On the second matter, as far as accident-avoidance measures by IT tools are concerned, progress has been made on the research side based essentially on the use of radars or sensors, which help the driver to identify potential risks in traffic, especially during the early evening, often the most dangerous time."
"We will look at the issue in detail in the context of the feasibility studies to be carried out."
"As we all know, accident prevention is by far the best solution."
"In any case, pedestrian safety is a priority for all of us and we will stick to the commitments we have made."
"Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Liikanen."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 49 and 50 will be replied to in writing(2)."
"We shall proceed to today’s final section: 20 minutes of questions to Commissioner Verheugen."
"On 15 December 2003 the Hungarian Parliament passed a government bill that restricts the ability of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF) to act freely when carrying out its statutory tasks."
"At the same time, action is being taken to intervene in an ongoing court case that could bring politically inconvenient facts to light."
"Commissioner Bolkestein has previously made clear in a letter what standards are to be imposed on a financial watchdog."
"The European Central Bank, like MEPs, has criticised the planned amendments to the law."
"Does the Commission consider, particularly with the correct use of European funds in mind, that an independent financial regulatory authority is still in place?"
"If so, why?"
"If not, what steps does it intend to take to safeguard the financial interests of the EU?"
". Mr Gahler, this has been a familiar issue for some time."
"I would remind you, first of all, that the bill adopted by the Hungarian Parliament on 15 December 2003 regulates the relations between the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF), the Hungarian Parliament and the Ministry of Finance."
"The text of this bill is available to the Commission."
"It states that the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its tasks, which are set out in the bill."
"Nonetheless, the Ministry of Finance does have the right to be informed on a regular basis about the activities of the Authority and may call on the Authority to cease any improper practices if shortcomings do arise."
"In terms of evaluating these two aspects of the bill, I should point out that the explicit provision stating that the Authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its legally defined tasks, but that the Finance Minister has the right to be informed about its activities, is in line with normal standards, including those in place in the Member States of the European Union."
"Quite apart from this, the Commission has been informed that the bill has not come into force."
"The Hungarian President refused to sign it, referring it instead to the Hungarian Constitutional Court for review. This review is not yet complete."
"The need for further amendments cannot be ruled out."
"Since the bill has not yet come into force, the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority is still operating under the existing regulations and the same administrative council."
"The Commission considers this an important matter."
"It is in constant contact with the Hungarian Government on this issue, and given the importance of efficient and proper financial supervision, has requested the Hungarian Government to inform it promptly of all developments in this field."
"One further question: do you not think it is rather unusual that through this amendment to a bill, there has been intervention in a current procedure?"
"Furthermore, even if the outcome is supposedly a European standard, what was the legal position before?"
"Has the Authority’s independence been enhanced, in the Commission’s view, or has it been restricted instead?"
". Mr Gahler, I do not think it is the Commission’s task to give its views on why a future Member State deems it necessary to undertake legislative amendments."
"It is our task to be vigilant in ensuring that the legal provisions in the Member States are in line with the acquis."
"That is what we have done."
"How does the Commission assess the law on restitution in Romania, particularly as regards the German minority, and could this model also be transferred to other candidate countries?"
". Mr Posselt, the regular assessment report on the progress made by Romania, which was published in late 2003, contains a thorough assessment of Romania’s progress in the restitution of assets."
"In the general conclusions it is stated that the legal framework for restitution is now fully functional."
"There is one notable exception: restitutions of churches."
"This is an incredibly sensitive issue in Romania."
"The sensitive nature of the problem, together with the problems within and between certain denominations has resulted in a blocking of the planned legislation."
"The law in Romania applies equally to all Romanian citizens."
"The Commission is not aware of any special provisions for the German minority."
"Your question, Mr Posselt, indicates that you may be better informed than the Commission."
"If there is something the Commission does not know about, I would be grateful if you could let me know."
"Consequently, I am unable to answer your question as to whether this model could be transferred to other candidate countries."
"It is hard for me to assess a law we do not know about."
"The selection of the general model for asset restitutions in Romania is a sovereign matter for Romania, and the sole responsibility of that state."
"As you know, the European Union has no legal authority in this area."
"Nevertheless, the regular Commission report does highlight the fact that the progress made in actual restitutions varies greatly depending on the value of the assets to be returned."
"There has been real progress in restitutions of agricultural and forested land, but the transfer of buildings has only just started."
"Only 3% of the properties in question had been returned by the end of 2003."
"I would classify that as fairly slow implementation of the relevant legislation."
"– Commissioner, firstly I do believe that it is the Commission’s role – and one you fully appreciate – to ensure that the relevant legislation is actually enforced. In essence, that justice and administration in the candidate countries really do work within a reasonable time."
"This is why you were right to address the 3% question."
"Secondly, I believe – during the previous question time, you did state that you are still responsible for minority issues, including in candidate countries – that the Romanian and Hungarian legislation seeks to treat all citizens equally."
"You know that there have been considerable problems with the Czech legislation, for which there is of course an official explanation."
"Announcements were made by Mr Mareš and others regarding initiatives intended to improve the situation."
"Do you know whether anything is being done?"
"Are there perhaps plans to apply these models, or at least to make another move towards reconciliation?"
"There was a lot of talk nine months ago but since then no more has been heard."
". Mr Posselt, I apologise."
"I came prepared for questions on Romania. I am not prepared for incredibly tricky technical questions about the Czech Republic."
"I will ask my services to investigate the matter thoroughly and to contact the relevant Czech authorities, and I will give you an answer in writing."
"On 21 March 2003, the Constitutional Court of Malta, at the request of an injured party, gave a definition of 'residence' (the Cassola Case, Judge Tonio Mallia, Case No 6/2003/1: Harry Vassallo vs the Electoral Commission and John Mary Magro)."
"The definition given by the Malta Constitutional court reads: ‘the word 'residence' does not mean physical presence in the country’."
"Moreover, the new law on European elections in Malta, (Act No XVI of 2003, published in the Malta Government Gazette of 26 November 2003) explicitly states that all Maltese citizens living in the 25 EU countries have a right to vote and stand for election in Malta."
"Is the Commission aware of the fact that, despite the constitutional definition and the existing legislation on European elections, the Malta Labour Party has again applied to have 1 684 Maltese citizens struck off the electoral register?"
"These court cases will begin to be heard by the Maltese courts in the last week of January, and Maltese employees with the EU institutions are amongst those being targeted."
"What does the Commission intend to do against this illegal attempt by the MLP to prevent Maltese citizens taking part in these upcoming European Elections in Malta?"
". Mrs Schroedter, in the Maltese Constitution all fundamental rights and citizen’s rights are recognised."
"The right of Maltese citizens to vote in general elections depends on their nationality, age, and place of residence."
"A short while ago, a Maltese citizen lodged a complaint because one party was disputing his right to vote, and the Constitutional Court found that these requirements do not violate the fundamental rights of Maltese citizens."
"The European Commission has nothing to add to the Maltese Constitutional Court’s decision."
"I would, however, point out that, according to the Maltese Constitutional Court’s definition, the notion of residence does not require a physical presence in the country, and in fact temporary absences from the country are both included and permitted."
"If a political party in Malta disputes a citizen’s right to vote, the relevant Maltese court has to consider the case and the ruling of the Maltese Constitutional Court has to be taken into account."
"The right to question the electoral roll and election results is an integral part of all transparent democratic systems."
"It is certainly not the Commission’s place to intervene in the operation of the Maltese legal system."
"The Commission would also remind you that the recently adopted law on the European elections in Malta states that all Maltese citizens living in any of the 25 Member States have an active and passive right to vote in the elections for the European Parliament in Malta."
"This was possible because the Maltese Constitution covers general elections, but not European elections."
"This is an interesting development, and the Commission has taken good note."
"It shows that Malta’s increased participation in international organisations is having a very constructive influence on domestic developments."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, you have not addressed the real question, namely the request from the Maltese Labour Party to strike 1 684 citizens off the electoral register for the European elections because they currently live in the European Union, and do not work in Malta."
"This is the heart of the matter, and you have not addressed this in any way."
"We are talking about the European elections."
"That is the issue at stake, and yet the same thing happens every time."
"Once again, in this case, 1 684 citizens will be struck off the electoral register."
"My question related to this particular case."
"Please could you give a more detailed response?"
"C I will, Mrs Schroedter, although very reluctantly, because the European Commission really has no say in what any political party in Malta does or does not do."
"You are wrong to say that anyone is being struck off the electoral register."
"In this case, a party has used its right to apply for names to be struck off."
"This is possible under Maltese law, as I explained, and the decision is taken using an objective legal procedure."
"As I see it, it is none of our business whether the Maltese system is particularly pleasant."
"What is important is establishing whether or not the general free and equal voting rights are guaranteed in Malta."
"They are."
"It is certainly not the Commission’s place, however, to pass judgment on the actions of each and every party and I am not going to do so."
"Will the Commission comment on the absence of action in relation to the legal agreements signed by Turkey for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline and Turkey's accession agreements, in the context of its most recent review and despite assurances given?"
"Will the Commission confirm that a number of non-governmental organisations have lodged an application at the European Court of Justice against the Commission's failure to act, and what preliminary comment will the Commission make in response to this application?"
". Mr Howitt, to clarify the situation in which we currently find ourselves, let me start by pointing out that Turkey is not a member of the European Union and that we have not even begun accession negotiations with Turkey."
"This means we have very little opportunity for influencing Turkey, particularly via legal instruments."
"For this reason, I would refer you to my earlier response to the question from Baroness Ludford, Mrs Lambert and you on the same subject and repeat that any negative consequences of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline agreement signed by Turkey or the implementation of that agreement will be assessed according to the Copenhagen political criteria."
"That is all the Commission can do in this case."
"Our role is to assess whether Turkey has met the political criteria necessary for beginning accession talks."
"Obviously, this will also include assessing whether or not Turkey is fully respecting human rights."
"The Commission report to be presented in autumn this year will examine this question, of course."
"The Commission is aware that a number of non-governmental organisations filed complaints with the Court of First Instance in January 2004."
"The Commission has not yet been officially notified of the details of these complaints."
"If asked to do so by the Court, the Commission will submit its comments in line with the relevant procedures."
"I thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"Although there is only a pre-accession agreement with Turkey, he can be assured that the European Parliament is fully aware of Turkey's candidate or non-candidate status and that this has some legal impact."
"I was one of a number of Members who petitioned the Commissioner to include an assessment in his last report, last November, on this specific issue."
"This did not happen, so I very much hope that an in-depth analysis of the human rights, environmental and other impacts of this pipeline will form part of the assessment this year."
"Could the Commissioner help all of us by saying what mechanisms, approach and analysis he is going to take to investigate this?"
"What will he be doing between now and November to answer the questions, so that we can be assured his report is full and fair?"
". Mr Howitt, I can promise you that in the final and conclusive report on whether Turkey meets the political pre-accession requirements we will carefully consider this matter."
"The Commission will investigate this question, as it has investigated all other human rights issues in Turkey."
"The Commission will draw together all information available from its own sources, from Member States, from human rights organisations and international monitoring bodies and also from all public information sources."
"Obviously, the Commission will also ask all those involved to provide relevant information, and will then assess all the data it has gathered."
"If necessary, missions will be sent out to get a first-hand impression of the situation on the ground."
"We attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that our assessments are based on sound, reliable information, and will ensure that applies here."
"Does the Commission share the view that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline is a project of great importance both for the future of European energy supplies and for the economic development of Turkey and other countries in the region?"
"C. To be honest, Mr Van Orden, I have no idea whether the European Commission as an institution has a view on this."
"However, I can tell you that no attentive newspaper reader can fail to be aware of what is at stake."
"I am very happy, therefore, to give you my personal opinion, which is that this is a project of considerable strategic significance, with a huge influence on eastern Mediterranean politics, and implications for many other countries, and is therefore a project which merits a great deal of international attention."
"Thank you very much, Mr Verheugen, for your cooperation with Parliament this evening."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 55 to 85 will be replied to in writing(3)."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"The next item is the Commission statement on problems with salmon."
". Mr President, the study 'Global Assessment of Organic Contaminants in Farmed Salmon', published on 9 January 2004 in magazine, compared the levels of 14 organochlorine contaminants in samples of farmed and wild salmon."
"Besides dioxins and PCBs, the study reports on the presence of residues of organochlorine pesticides, the use of which has long been prohibited in the EU."
"This study does not raise new food safety issues as the levels found are consistent with the results from other surveys and from official controls."
"This does not, however, mean that the presence of these contaminants is not a cause for concern."
"As regards dioxins, strict EU maximum levels were adopted in 2001 for dioxins in feed and food, including fish."
"However, in setting these levels, the Commission had to take into account the reality of the current background contamination of the environment in order not to endanger the food supply."
"I would remind you that worldwide, only the European Union and Korea have adopted maximum levels for dioxins in feed and food."
"These maximum levels are part of a comprehensive strategy adopted by the European Commission in 2001 to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment, in feed and in food."
"The implementation of this strategy would give new impetus to the reduction of the background contamination."
"As a result, it will be possible to lower progressively the maximum levels to follow this downward trend."
"The legislation foresees that, as early as this year, the maximum levels have to be revised to integrate some PCBs with toxicological effects similar to dioxins."
"Furthermore, it is foreseen that by the end of 2006 the maximum levels will be revised, aiming for a significant reduction."
"For the other PCBs, the European Food Safety Authority is currently undertaking a risk assessment."
"The result of this risk assessment is expected to become available by the end of 2004."
"The Commission will thereafter consider the setting of maximum levels also for these PCBs in feed and food."
"The organochlorine pesticides detected in the study published in have long been banned in the European Union."
"However, their continued presence in fish is due to the fact that they are very persistent compounds, which can still be found in the environment."
"The European Union has established maximum levels for these pesticides in animal feed, including fish feed."
"On the basis of updated risk assessments undertaken by the Authority, the Commission will consider whether a revision of the current levels is necessary for the protection of animal and human health."
"The highest levels of two pesticides – toxaphene and dieldrin – found by the study in salmon feed exceed the maximum levels fixed by the EU."
"We have, accordingly, drawn the attention of the Member States to these findings and requested that they submit data from official controls and, if necessary, reinforce those controls."
"Finally, I would stress that the levels of dioxins reported in the study are all below the EU maximum levels."
"Fish – be it farmed or wild – has its place in a well-balanced diet to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from its positive health effects."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I was among those Members who wanted a debate to be held on this issue, given the alarm that had spread among the public."
"Immediately after Christmas and New Year, a number of articles appeared in the French media, mentioning probable dangers."
"An announcement was actually made but was not actively followed up, which left consumers with unanswered questions."
"I remember some years ago, at least five, possibly six years ago, talking with someone who worked with Mr Fischler at the Commission, who told me, when we were in the midst of the BSE crisis, that the second food crisis to hit Europe would be in farmed salmon."
"Those words stayed with me and this is why I was keen for a debate to take place on the matter."
"He was certainly exaggerating somewhat – I hope so anyway – and what the Commissioner has just told us would appear to bear this out."
"Nonetheless, I feel that it was important for us to be able to pass on some answers to our fellow citizens so that they know what they have to do."
"When we established the European Food Authority, we emphasised how important it was that communication should be commensurate with the level of risk."
"In this regard, when the press articles appeared at the end of 2003, I would have liked the Commission to offer us an immediate response, rather than – somewhat regrettably – waiting until mid-February, when Parliament requested the information."
"With problems of this nature, it is wrong to focus on the difficulties faced by one economic sector or another. I put myself in the place of the salmon farmers and of the regions that are – or could have been – affected by information of this kind."
"Such a situation has economic knock-on effects and we are duty bound to bear this in mind."
"Our overriding concern, however, is food safety for our fellow citizens."
"I therefore believe that it is our duty, and this is especially important, to ensure transparency at all times and to communicate answers at the appropriate moment, so as to avoid a vacuum of information that may increase people’s concerns."
"Even so, Commissioner, you tell us that the quality of salmon leaves something to be desired, yet you affirm elsewhere that what could be detected as doses of dioxin was below maximum levels set by the EU, and we are all relieved at that."
"What I should personally like to request from you is not only that controls be implemented, but also that decisions be taken in order to ensure that farmed fish is better monitored and, more importantly, that it reaches appropriate sanitary levels."
"This is what I wanted to say, Commissioner, and what we expect from you is that controls should be put in place and swiftly followed by action, so as to offer complete reassurance to European consumers."
"Mr President, when this debacle began it was with disbelief that many of us watched how a report whose science was questionable could jeopardise one of the most important rural industries in Scotland."
"Scottish salmon farming supports 6 500 jobs, 70% in the Highlands and Islands, injecting GBP 2 million every week into the Scottish economy."
"Scottish salmon accounts for nearly 40% of all Scottish food exports."
"The bias of the press coverage and the lack of quality information led to a food scare based on insubstantial evidence and falsehood."
"I was pleased that the Commission took prompt action to put right the evidence and to speak up for the safety of Scottish salmon."
"So too did the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom."
"The substance of the food scare was based on a highly misleading piece of research published in the American journal PCB and dioxin levels in Scottish salmon are significantly lower than the threshold set by the EU, the Food Standards Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation."
"Professor Hugh Pennington, a leading food expert said: 'The evidence is pretty clear that the officially recommended levels, which are higher than the ones that the scientists are talking about, are actually safe.'"
"The methodology of this research has been called into question."
"The conclusions are based on a controversial risk assessment model that was introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency."
"The risk assessment model is not recognised by international organisations responsible for food safety and public health such as the WHO, which considers it scientifically flawed."
"Additionally, the salmon used in the study were purchased prior to the country of origin labelling regulations, and so the study has not even ensured that the salmon tested were farmed in Scotland or the EU."
"On top of all of this, the research does not contain any new information."
"Even the figures used in the research are questionable, as they differ from UK Government official figures."
"With this in mind, the Food Standards Agency does not accept the research findings and advises people to eat two portions of fish per week, with one portion being oily fish, such as salmon."
"Sadly the American research has ignored all the health benefits of eating salmon, which contains high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids and is proven to reduce the risk of heart attack."
"Sir John Krebs, Chairman of the FSA, backed this up."
"He said that although dioxin levels have decreased dramatically over the past two decades, they remain a consumer concern."
"The known benefits of eating one portion of oily fish outweigh any possible risks."
"On the subject of fish feed, which was also brought into question, the feed of US, Canadian and Chilean producers comes from the same sources as that for the Scottish fish farmers."
"It seems strange that US, Canadian and Chilean samples should be free from levels of the substances under test, compared with those from Scotland."
"To my mind there is something very odd going on, when the basis of a report can be taken as read without thorough investigation."
"In fact, one of the scientists involved in the research – Dr David Carpenter – has confessed that 'There may be some legitimacy in saying the reason they chose to fund this study was that they had another agenda well beyond the health effects.'"
"Scottish Quality Salmon members already undertake measures to ensure the quality of its feed supplies and have in place a testing regime to ensure its standards are met, as well as the rigorous environmental regulation that fish farms adhere to, which has been improving year on year since fish farming began."
"The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has a specific remit and responsibility to regulate salmon farming – 63 pieces of legislation, 43 European directives, 3 European regulations, 12 Commission decisions – that help reassure consumers that the product they are consuming is of the highest quality."
"I do not know if the Commission is in a position to comment on the proposed anti-dumping measures."
"I understand that there were ongoing negotiations this weekend between the Irish presidency and the British Government."
"If you have an opportunity to comment, Commissioner, that may be useful."
"A line needs to be drawn under this episode."
"Damage has been done to the Scottish salmon farming industry, there is no doubt about that."
"However, we have to move on, highlighting the falsehood of the accusations and the importance of eating salmon as part of a balanced, healthy diet."
"It is because of our membership of the EU that we can work together in order to seek solutions."
"The European Commission's immediate response reassured consumers that eating salmon is safe."
"It is only by action at the EU level that we can take action against false food scares and bring reality to bear."
"– Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is satisfied with the Commission’s statement."
"The health risks associated with salmon have quite obviously been exaggerated."
"On the other hand it is obvious that eating farmed salmon is less healthy than eating wild salmon."
"This is one reason why the European Union should aspire to a policy on salmon that keeps as close to nature as possible, although salmon farms will of course still be needed for the production of both rainbow trout and salmon."
"The Baltic Sea has its own migratory salmon stock."
"The rivers flowing into the Baltic have produced young that have migrated to feed on what the sea areas have to offer: shrimp and small fish."
"Contamination and the use of the water systems for floating timber and hydroelectric power production have had an adverse effect on breeding."
"This decline has been partially offset by introducing stocks of salmon into rivers, something which companies that produce hydroelectric power in particular have been obliged to do."
"That, however, has not had much effect."
"It has been estimated that as many as 95% of young salmon introduced in this way perish."
"On the other hand, there has been overfishing of salmon both in the open sea and in coastal waters close to the rivers in which they spawn."
"There have been continual disputes over salmon fishing rights."
"Now that, with enlargement, the Baltic Sea is to become even more obviously an inland sea of the Union, a comprehensive plan should be drawn up to protect salmon stocks and organise fishing activity."
"Salmon breeding must be restored as closely as possible to its original natural state."
"Rivers and streams that make good spawning grounds must be made suitable to permit increases in salmon stocks."
"Fishways should be built on constructed waterways, and the spawning grounds in the rivers should be properly maintained."
"By promoting the natural regeneration of salmon stocks we can open up new opportunities for sport fishing and tourism based on it in all the countries with a Baltic coastline."
"Once the natural reproduction process for salmon is improved, the level of introduced fish stocks can be reduced and in the course of time perhaps abandoned altogether."
"The money saved can be spent on the building of fishways, the upkeep of spawning grounds, and boosting other fish stock levels."
"The fishing of Baltic salmon should start to see the implementation of the ‘spawn state principle’, which has been successfully applied in the North Atlantic within the framework of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation."
"Fishing has to be restricted so that the sustainable and natural renewal of salmon stocks is assured."
"After the enlargement of the Union, the protection of the Baltic Sea, maintenance of its fish stocks and organisation of fishing activity in the region will no longer be matters of multilateral cooperation but a bilateral issue between the EU and Russia."
"I believe that Russia for its own part is prepared to take up the challenge of cooperation; the main responsibility, however, lies with us, the EU and the Member States of the Union."
"Mr President, I was interested to hear Commissioner Byrne say that some of the findings exceed the limits."
"This is because, according to press reports when this scientific study was first published, a statement was issued claiming that a spokesperson from Commissioner Byrne's office had agreed with the assessment made by the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency that the levels of chemicals in our European salmon did not exceed EU limits."
"I welcome the fact that this position has now been revised, because what we are talking about here is about consumers."
"Background levels have to be taken into account."
"The issue needs to be addressed as to why those background levels are there in the first place."
"That is something that also has to be tackled."
"From these studies it has been quite clear that farmed salmon have a significantly higher contaminant burden than wild salmon – that is what the report says – and that farmed salmon from Europe are significantly more contaminated than farmed salmon from South and North America."
"A lot of people have long seen that there is obviously some sort of health risk in relation to farmed fish."
"We are now saying that consumption of farmed salmon should be limited to a certain amount per week, or per month, which raises a question about the threat to consumers."
"It should be clearly labelled so that consumers know what they are eating and have that choice."
"I raised the issue with the President of Parliament, Pat Cox, and asked him to request the European Food Safety Authority to issue a scientific opinion on the problem."
"He agreed to do so."
"Unfortunately, we have still not received the letter which he was going to send."
"It is crucial that this should not be further delayed, because we are not just talking about salmon here."
"An issue which has not been raised at all is that other carnivorous fish species, for example tuna, cod, sea bass, sea bream and trout, are farmed in similar conditions and probably exposed to similar contamination."
"This is an issue which needs to be addressed, not just in relation to farmed salmon but in relation to other farmed fish."
"Finally, I see that the United Kingdom Government has adopted protection principles to safeguard Scottish salmon."
"They should adopt protection methods to safeguard the consumer."
"Mr President, let me say unequivocally that if there are proven problems of a serious health or environmental nature linked to EU-produced salmon, then the matter must be dealt with seriously and swiftly."
"However, there must be accurate, reliable and totally independent scientific advice before any such action can be undertaken."
"It will not surprise the Commission that I am somewhat sceptical, to say the least, in relation to some scientific studies currently doing the rounds and which, I believe, prompted the present crisis."
"I am not interested in who did the study."
"I am, however, interested in who paid for the study."
"I am also interested to know if there are vested interests involved in this work, if there is anyone who stands to gain from this type of so-called scientific research."
"For me, the crisis in the salmon sector is not just environmental; the real crisis is that the EU salmon industry, particularly in my constituency of Connaught-Ulster in the west of Ireland, is under serious threat of extinction."
"The entire Community industry is under threat from cheap imports, or to put it another way, from dumping of farmed salmon from Norway, Chile and the Faroe Islands."
"It is totally unacceptable to me that a growing number of independent Irish and Scottish producers are going into receivership."
"If this continues unchecked, there will be no environmental or health issues to resolve because there will be no EU salmon."
"In recent days, both the Irish and UK Governments made a joint application to the European Commission for new measures to safeguard our salmon-farming industry."
"The application does not concern the Canadian or the American producers; it concerns the EU producers, starting with Irish producers who are fighting for survival."
"In conclusion, I ask the Commission to tell me and the Irish salmon producers, whom I represent, what follow-up or initiative it has taken to date, or intends to take, on the joint Irish-United Kingdom application?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the question of farmed salmon before us today is a genuine case study that is surely destined to be repeated many times over in years to come."
"As politicians we are not armed with scientific knowledge, yet how are we to address a crisis that may have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for entire sectors?"
"How can we solve a problem that has arisen from the publication of a scientific report that casts doubt on the sanitary quality of a food product, that has been published as part of a root and branch reputation review, and that has already been widely covered in the media, thereby raising concerns among consumers?"
"How do we distinguish between what is based on well-founded concerns, calling for the most stringent measures and protocols to be put in place, and what is based on effects that are simply due to defects in the mathematical models used or in the balance of parameters?"
"Having had our fingers severely burnt by previous crises, which had devastating consequences – such as the crises involving mad cow disease, and dioxin in chickens, the case before us today, evidenced by the abnormally high death rate among bees, of the danger of new and extremely powerful neurotoxic molecules, which are used to coat seeds, getting into fats and water – we are being vigilant and must continue to err on the side of vigilance."
"It is only by redoubling the controls, the studies, the research and the analysis that indisputable results will begin to come through to reassure consumers."
"The food safety authorities are there to help us in this aim, but Parliament must also give a ruling."
"I should also like to remind you at this juncture, as a member of the Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA), that we have a novel type of body available to us in the European Parliament, the STOA panel, whose function is to provide Members of this House with aspects of scientific assessment that they may need in order to clarify the positions that our various committees are required to take."
"It is by no means a perfect institution, but I feel that the STOA is capable of offering us invaluable help, such as providing us, in regard to a question such as the one before us this evening, with an overall perspective and a critical analysis of all scientific studies in existence or ongoing."
"We must therefore not overlook this invaluable instrument."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by answering some of the questions posed by Mr Ó Neachtain, because he asked who funded the report which appeared in magazine and caused all the problems."
"Few realise that the research on which the article was founded was commissioned by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts, worth an estimated USD 3.8 billion."
"They are well known for their international campaigns against global pollution and they have recently become influential opponents of the aquaculture industry."
"The magazine article – based on a USD 2.9 million research project carried out by the Institute for Health and the Environment at the State University of New York at Albany – has, as previous speakers have said, proved to be deliberately misleading in the advice it provides on salmon consumption."
"And yet, I think all of us in this Chamber would be astonished at how that article suddenly appeared in newspapers all over the world."
"The reason is that on the day it was published in magazine it was sent out by press release by an international PR company based in New York and simultaneously appeared on the website of the Canadian-based Suzuki Foundation, which campaigns on behalf of Alaskan wild salmon and which, of course, has a vested interest in damaging the European farmed salmon industry."
"In their conclusions about limiting salmon consumption, the study's authors appear, as Mrs Stihler said, to have misapplied an already suspect risk model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency by failing to include any analysis of the health benefits of eating salmon, despite over 5 000 scientific papers attesting to the necessity of eating oil-rich fish as a regular component of a balanced diet."
"The research does not actually contain any new information: the data the research provides is no different from the findings of previous studies that also found dioxin levels in farmed salmon to be well within official safety limits."
"However, the interpretation used in the research paper deliberately exaggerates the health risks."
"Moreover, the PCB levels in all EU farmed salmon are significantly below the level determined to be safe for sale in supermarkets, even by the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as by all other international watchdogs, including our own EU Food Standards Agency and the UK Food Standards Agency."
"The American research is therefore seriously flawed."
"EU fish farms undertake rigorous inspection and quality control regimes to ensure that only the highest possible environmental and welfare standards are met and that the public is provided with an entirely safe, non-toxic and reliable product."
"Mr President, consumers are entitled to know what they are eating, and I fully support that as a public health imperative."
"However, in order to make properly informed choices, it is essential that scientific information be accurate, up-to-date and verifiable."
"In recent times, looking from Scotland, it is perfectly possible to believe that certain campaigners are making it their business to talk down specifically the Scottish salmon-farming industry and talk up specifically, as has been suggested, wild salmon from certain other areas."
"Just publishing an article in a magazine entitled does not automatically verify the accuracy of its contents."
"It is clear, as the Commissioner acknowledged, that there is no new evidence in the particular study published in ."
"It is also clear that the levels of various contaminants were within standards set by the European Commission and the UK and Scottish Food Standards Agencies, which are not bodies that are easy to satisfy in that regard."
"The research totally failed to mention the positive health benefits that can be gained from eating fatty fish such as salmon."
"Organisations such as Scottish Quality Salmon, which has very high standards, should be encouraged."
"They require of their members constant improvement in such things as feed quality."
"It is inexplicable to me to suggest that Scottish and Irish salmon, but not other farmed salmon fed on exactly the same feed, somehow did not come out of this study as measuring up to the same standards."
"The measured approach adopted by the Commissioner is right, and I hope that, as others have said, there will be support for measures to protect this industry, which in Scotland is essential for employment and social cohesion in very fragile areas."
"Mr President, this is clearly a very important subject."
"Salmon farming has often been criticised in the past for its environmental impact, but only recently have potential health impacts been raised."
"It is crucial that these be better understood."
"Health advice given by governments across the EU traditionally highlights the importance of eating more fish."
"Yet, if risk analysis suggests that consumption of farmed Atlantic salmon poses health risks that detract from the beneficial effect of fish consumption, then we need to know more about that."
"We need to understand more about it and we need to act on that knowledge."
"We need to know for certain that farmed salmon has more contaminants than wild fish and that dioxins are among the most toxic chemicals ever created."
"So far the debate has been dominated by arguments over whether the contamination found in the salmon was legal."
"What we should be concentrating on is whether the salmon is genuinely safe."
"That might well mean revisiting the limits that were set for contamination in 2001."
"I want to get away from the arguments for or against Scottish salmon or any other kind of salmon."
"These are not very helpful."
"We should be talking about whether aquaculture itself is providing a viable and environmentally sustainable food for humans, and I would argue that the answer is increasingly looking like 'no'."
"Also associated with aquaculture is a whole range of other problems, including the spread of disease and parasites to wild fish, the use of fish, fishmeal and fish oil as food with impacts on wild fish stocks, pollution of the sea floor from unconsumed food, the impact on predators when they are killed and the antibiotics used to control the disease."
"There are some genuinely important issues here that need to be looked at and yet, perversely, governments continue to support aquaculture when, in many ways, they might well be better off putting their time and resources into rehabilitating the natural habitats of salmon so as to allow the wild stocks to recover."
"This latest health report on salmon should be taken as a wake-up call to change the way we farm fish."
"I look forward to a Commission revision of the standards based on genuine safety measures, not on allowances for background environmental levels, because health cannot and should not be compromised."
". Mr President, I should like to respond very briefly to the issues that have been raised."
"I am happy that it has been acknowledged by Parliament that the Commission responded quickly to this issue and that a clear explanation was given when it first came into the public domain."
"I should like to make a clarification statement and to repeat what I said earlier."
"It would be a mistake to confuse the presence of dioxin and PCBs in the fish, and the presence of pesticides in feed."
"One questioner suggested that the Commission had made a statement earlier that was different from what is being said now."
"That interpretation arises from a confusion of what has been said, which is that the dioxin levels are within EU maximum levels, but the pesticides in food are not, and I gave two instances that were above that."
"That is a question of the levels being above the appropriate levels in the feed rather than in the fish themselves."
"In answer to the question I was asked by Mr Ó Neachtain in relation to the joint report that has been furnished by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities, I have to say that report has not reached my desk, nor has it reached my DG."
"I am, of course, making inquiries about it, but that report may have been on a related issue and sent to a different DG."
"It is something I will look at if it has been sent to me and if it is relevant to my portfolio."
"Finally, on the question of further risk assessments, the European Food Safety Authority is carrying out a risk assessment on the presence of non-dioxin-like PCBs."
"It is quite clear that my services and the European Food Safety Authority are keeping an eye on this issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the crisis in the steel sector."
". Mr President, the European Parliament scheduled this declaration from the Commission only a few days ago when the future of Thyssen Krupp's AST Terni plant was at stake."
"The decision to close magnetic steel production would put 450 jobs directly and larger numbers indirectly at risk."
"Further job losses in the region already affected in the past would be a most unwelcome blow."
"It would be particularly unfortunate, in view of the long tradition of steel making in this region, the quality of the product produced at Terni and the skill levels of the workforce involved."
"Therefore it is with some relief that I heard reports today of an announcement by the Italian Minister of Productive Activities, Mr Marzano, that the deadline of the decision on the future of the AST plant has been postponed to a date yet to be defined."
"It is precisely because of concerns such as these, regarding the social consequences of corporate restructuring, that the Commission has sought to promote a response at Community level to the issue of how corporate restructuring is managed."
"We sought, with the active involvement of the social partners, to develop and promote issues that seem relevant in the present case, investing in people on a permanent basis, developing employability through training and retraining, seeking alternatives to closures and redundancies, redeploying, wherever possible, workers affected by restructuring operations and anticipating market and technological developments."
"I should like to remind you that two years ago the Commission launched a consultation with the social partners, particularly on this issue of restructuring, because unfortunately, there were many problems in many different Member States."
"The Commission presented a report with some proposals."
"We have the response of the social partners in October and we believe that through dialogue and agreed measures, particularly on issues to which I have already referred, everything that supports employability, the social partners can play an important role."
"It is my sincere hope that in the window of opportunity that now appears to have opened all such possibilities will be given full consideration to see what contribution they can make to alleviating the crisis faced by the Terni plant."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Europe cannot remain silent in the face of what is happening in one of the Union’s most important steel-making sites: without any prior notification the Thyssen Krupp Group has decided to halt the production of magnetic steel in the steel plants of Terni."
"This is an unwarranted action and betrays an agreement signed up to in 1994 during privatisation."
"As noted by you, Commissioner, the German company is preparing to sack hundreds of workers because it prefers to protect other European sites and invest outside the Union, in South Korea."
"Thanks to the intervention of the Italian Government – you mentioned, Commissioner, the intervention of Mr Marzano, the Minister for Productive Activities – and the extraordinary extent to which all the local institutions, citizens, parties and workers have mobilised themselves, Thyssen Krupp has decided to put off its decision to close the plant."
"The European Parliament and the Commission cannot, however, raise their voices to help solve a crisis which is not, Mr President, Commissioner, an Italian issue, but involves the whole of Europe."
"That is why we are asking that the Commission, when presenting the third report on economic and social cohesion on 18 February, clearly sets out its own proposals for protecting the industrial sector and, in particular, the iron and steel industry in the context of its new cohesion policy due to commence from 1 January 2007."
"I am also convinced that the Commission’s battle with the US in respect of market shares in steel production must be supported."
"I repeat that the problem does not concern only Italy, nor is it a purely incidental matter, but rather a general problem facing the steel industry in Europe."
"The crisis involves not just one company, but many and it seems to me that the Commission in comparison to the US it giving it its full attention."
"Indeed, we cannot adopt a carefree and superficial approach to such a sensitive issue on which the future of thousands and thousands of jobs, and therefore of thousands and thousands of families, hangs."
"As regards the Italian case of Terni, I am convinced that the Commission must intervene to deal with certain anomalies."
"The steelworks in Terni, in contrast to what was established in December 1994 by the commission for the control of concentrations, are currently owned exclusively by Thyssen Krupp, this being a clear example of a concentration: the group is currently the only producer of magnetic grain-oriented steel in Europe."
"Does not the Commission consider that this is potentially a distortion of competition?"
"Furthermore, because of its activities in Italy, Thyssen Krupp has received Community aid on the grounds that Terni, where the steelworks are located, is a region in industrial decline that comes within Objective 2."
"Does the Commission not therefore consider that it should check whether the Community aid has been employed correctly by Thyssen Krupp?"
"Next, does not the Commission consider that it should check whether Thyssen Krupp has received further State aid in breach of the competition rules?"
"The investment in South Korea, announced yesterday, is a source of concern: I would not want European funds and possible funding provided by the German Government to be used not for boosting European economic growth, employment and development in Europe, but employed in South Korea, in the sole interests of one company which – I repeat – has not upheld the agreements it signed up to with Italy when privatisation took place."
"Thousands of workers are now waiting for the Commission to take action in order to ensure that the Union’s rules are observed."
"A few days ago I heard President Prodi and Commissioner Monti speak and even in what you said, Commissioner, I perceive a desire to move forward, to protect workers’ interests, to resolve a problem which – I repeat – is not limited geographically to Italy."
"I am convinced that the President of the Commission, after listening to the Thyssen Krupp management, will take decisive measures to intervene in the way that I hope so that the Commission may act collectively."
"The President of the Commission and all the Commissioners should continue in their present direction: they can count on Parliament’s support as demonstrated by the desire to reach a unified resolution on this sensitive and important issue, which I think will be adopted unanimously."
"– Mr President, for those who were lucky enough, like me and other Members, to take part in the strike and the demonstration at Terni on Friday 6 February, the deeper meaning of this struggle was very clear: an entire city and an entire region were united and determined to reject not merely a harsh blow against their production plant and their jobs but, above all, an attack on their dignity."
"With many years trade union experience behind me, seldom have I witnessed such tension and such pride."
"The announcement to close the magnetic section of ST by Thyssen Krupp means the loss of 900 highly qualified jobs and internal disruption as a result in the Terni iron and steel plant thereby posing an immediate threat to its plans, its productive capacity and its overall job prospects: we are talking of 4 500 jobs, including those companies affected by the knock-on effects."
"Over and above that, though, this is, I repeat, a slap in the face for regional local government which has worked effectively and is still working, by utilising the structural funds, to create a more favourable climate of production for the company and its investments: infrastructure projects, training and professional retraining, energetic supply measures."
"Up until yesterday everything was fine; then, in September 2003, production for electric motors, that is to say non-grain-oriented steel, was abandoned."
"At that time, and again in November, a solemn commitment was given concerning all the programmes aimed at making Terni a centre of excellence for magnetic steel."
"At the end of January, however, after only two months, there was an about turn: even the production of grain-oriented steel used for transformers was closed down and the closure of the plant was announced with dramatic internal consequences: there was a threat that the plant would be broken up destroying its integrated structure which, given the varied nature of its production, enabled it to balance out market fluctuations and disperse strategic functions such as marketing."
"It also had major external consequences affecting Italy and Europe in general."
"Magnetic steel, which is produced only in Terni, is the only special strategic steel for the energy sector; becoming dependent on Russia and the US will also have a negative knock-on effect for users who are major exporters."
"The news that arrived at the end of the meeting held today in Palazzo Chigi therefore explains why the workers and the inhabitants of the city took to the streets and why they have been able to broaden their network of alliances and support."
"On 18 February genuine negotiations will finally get under way without a gun being held to the trade union’s head."
"The deadline of 27 February has been cancelled, 80 contracts which had expired and which Thyssen Krupp wanted to cancel are being renewed; it is a sign that the multinational feels isolated."
"In response to this preliminary result the pressure must be maintained and the attention of all the institutions must be kept engaged."
"On Thursday this Parliament will make its voice heard with a resolution on this issue which genuinely symbolises the need for new systems of industrial relations and more advanced methods for linking public investment and industrial strategy."
"We are fighting to ensure that there is a clear message that the dispute should end in a positive manner: a decisive dispute to put a stop to the downgrading of production in Italy and the weakening of industrial plant throughout Europe."
"– Mr President, in 1950 Robert Schuman launched the idea of a European Coal and Steel Community open to all States, thereby creating the basis for the complex and difficult journey of European unification, the most recent developments of which we are now experiencing. Even then the importance of steel in the European context was clear."
"I am not surprised therefore that the debate in this Parliament concerning the ‘Terni case’ has aroused so much interest and the opinions expressed have to a large extent not been dependent on political affiliations."
"The European iron and steel sector is currently suffering as a result of the decision taken by the US to impose import duties on steel, principally from the European Union."
"The crisis in Italy is important because it involves other iron and steel centres, like the steel plant in Genoa-Cornigliano."
"In that context, the announcement by Thyssen Krupp, the owner of the Terni iron and steel plant, that it is going to invest in South Korea to produce steel in Asia is of major importance and is causing a good deal of concern."
"As you know, the Terni plant was sold in 1994 as part of the process of privatisation promoted by the Institute for Reconstruction of Industry (IRI), subject to a guarantee that its activities would continue in Italy and that jobs would be protected."
"This is not a company in crisis but a company that produces a leading-edge product used to make thin metal sheets for electronic transformers."
"Furthermore, there are no other factories of this type in Italy."
"The technology used at Terni and the studies and research carried out in recent years are of an extremely high standard."
"Losing skills and know-how is exactly the opposite of the knowledge economy to which President Prodi recently referred in this Parliament."
"It is no coincidence that directors, managers, researchers and local politicians lined up alongside the workforce to fight on behalf of the product and the research associated with it."
"About 900 workers are likely to lose their jobs, not counting the knock-on effects."
"We cannot, therefore, ignore the fact that the German multinational received funds and tax breaks from the European Union when it decided to acquire the Terni plant."
"I also wonder what the significance is, in global terms, of transferring production to Korea, what technological skills workers employed in South-East Asia have, what trade union rights they have and whether those rights will be observed."
"At a meeting last December, some European Union industrial manufacturers in the footwear and textiles sector posed a number of questions concerning those matters to the delegation from China, which is preparing itself to become the factory of the world."
"The replies were extremely evasive and we had no grounds for thinking that elsewhere on the continent – with the exception of Japan – the situation was any better."
"Above all, in a market economy based on competition the rules must …"
"– Mr President, nine hundred jobs lost may be no more than a statistic, but it amounts to more for the lives of the human beings affected."
"The plant in Terni is at the very heart of the city’s fabric; 900 jobs: the lives of young and old workers."
"The steelworks in Terni are the city’s history and pride; they represent the memories of the air raids that took place in the Second World War."
"When the management of Thyssen Krupp announced the closure of the magnetic steel section, the whole city – as Mr Sacconi said – took to the streets with the workers."
"Terni is not an isolated operation: in Europe, Arcelor, Lucchini and Thyssen itself are currently preparing to reorganise production; plants in Belgium, the blast furnaces of Servola in Trieste have already received threats of closure, despite trade union action."
"Massive disinvestment and relocation of valuable products to non-European countries are in fact destroying European production capacity."
"Community funds, which have been considerable over recent decades, have been used to dismantle State controlled iron and steel works."
"The subsidies paid to private entrepreneurs such as Riva, Lucchini, Falk and other foreign groups have been used for the remodernisation of production capacity and the specialisation of the Italian iron and steel industry along profit-making lines."
"The European Social Fund and the structural funds have been used to finance restructuring and retraining programmes and have led to a younger workforce being employed in the sector – in Italy today the average age of iron and steel workers is 30 – but it is precisely this new generation of highly qualified young employees whose existence is under threat."
"In my view, the absence of a coordinated plan in the European Union to relaunch the iron and steel industry has contributed to individual plants in various countries – albeit at the cutting edge – being transferred elsewhere in order to fit in with the industrial plans of individual entrepreneurs."
"The Thyssen plant in Terni, which is currently suffering heavy losses in the magnetic steel sector to the benefit of the Russian company Duferco, is cutting back production and preparing to transfer operations to Mexico, Korea, China and India."
"There is no sign of innovation, new research or competitive challenge: the only thing visible is a dangerous move towards retrenchment which, if not stopped in time, will have repercussions for employment and social cohesion, not just in Italy but throughout Europe."
"Despite the drastic reduction of employment in the sector in Italy, which has fallen from 100 000 jobs in the 1980s to 40 000 today, the steel sector still has an excellent position in the market because it is the second European producer."
"In order to maintain that position, however, requires industrial choices to be made by the Italian Government – which do not appear to be forthcoming – and a clear commitment of intent at European level."
"Steel and electricity are economic indicators of absolute excellence in a country, a measure of economic development."
"It is therefore essential that the European Union introduce systems for tackling pollution and monitoring the environmental impact, which are priorities if the aims of the Kyoto protocol are to be pursued."
"On this basis a new steel industry can be launched."
"We must find solutions in the form of industrial policies geared to protecting quality products, environmental conditions and employment in the iron and steel sector."
"In this sense, in response to threats to employment and gradual social impoverishment, the Commission should give a commitment to review the rules governing the structural funds."
"Granting of those funds in future should be made conditional on a binding commitment being given to invest in a given location for at least ten years, subject to an explicit agreement that the subsidies will be reclaimed in the event that production is moved elsewhere."
"In my view, Directive 98/59 on protection in respect of collective dismissals should also be reviewed so as to consolidate the measures designed to protect employment by making provision not only for information procedures for workers’ representatives, but also requiring a commitment on the part of the social partners to open appropriate and binding negotiations with a view to preventing dismissals or the reorganisation of production to the detriment of employment."
"The jobs in the steelworks at Terni must be saved, as must the jobs in other Italian and European plants and for this reason I believe that a meeting is required between the governments of the Member States concerned, the social partners and, in this specific case, Thyssen Krupp, to draw up a new industrial plan to relaunch the magnetic and inox sectors at European level."
"– Mr President, once again Italy risks being used as a dumping ground."
"Thyssen Krupp is the only case of a multinational that has grown thanks to the work of hundreds of Italian workers and huge funds placed at its disposal, either by the Italian State or the European Union, and then has decided to close, in this case in Terni, in Umbria, with the risk of leaving 900 workers and their families destitute and also wasting a huge resource of professional skills."
"As other Members have mentioned, the announcement of closure took everybody by surprise: no prior notice was given to the workers or the national and local authorities and, above all, no justification was given because today the closure appears to be dictated more by questionable strategic company choices than by specific technical reasons, given that in Italy production costs are lower, the quality is higher and the professionalism of the workforce beyond question: there have been steelworks at Terni for 120 years."
"Would it, I ask myself, be acceptable for Thyssen Krupp to go ahead with the decision to close after taking everything possible from that territory and those people: professionalism, resources and even their hopes for the future?"
"Although I am convinced that large companies – the multinationals – are certainly a source of employment and development for the whole of Europe, a few remarks must be made: to say that we do not agree with some of the behaviour indulged in by European capitalism is neither a secret nor a shock: a capitalism which, in theory, is completely committed to the free market, to pure competition and to the flexibility of the global market but which, in reality, expects to be generously assisted time and again, requiring tax incentives from national governments and all kinds of structures, infrastructures and facilities from local administrations, not to mention the granting of Community funds."
"Meanwhile production has already been moved to India, with an eye on China, where the cost of labour is ridiculous and laws for the protection of workers and the environment non-existent."
"Further, as other Members have already stated, these multinationals often take advantage of the opportunity offered by privatisation – which unfortunately, most of the time, are no more than asset sales – to acquire our family jewels at knock down prices, as was exactly the case with Thyssen Krupp at Terni."
"So, moving beyond these contentious matters, what are we asking of the European Commission?"
"Firstly, we are asking for immediate measures, within its powers, to safeguard the iron and steel centre in Terni and to avert the danger of Thyssen Krupp’s plant being closed; secondly: a commitment to check that European regulations are effectively applied in order to protect workers’ rights; thirdly: a further commitment to make the granting of Community funds conditional on agreements guaranteeing employment and subject to precise conditions and limits on the relocation of plant."
"We also expect a committed development strategy to be set in place for the iron and steel sector throughout Europe."
"Finally, should Thyssen Krupp go ahead with its decision to close the plant, we call on the Commission to check whether all the competition rules have been complied with, in particular as regards any possible abuse of a dominant position."
"In conclusion, Mr President, whilst we are satisfied with the initial positive steps today of the Italian Government, gained as a result of determined action across the board, we consider that that is all the more reason not to lower our guard."
"We believe unreservedly in the free market, but we also believe that there is no free market without democracy and, above all, without respect for workers and nations."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I think it is important to check, in the Thyssen Krupp affair in Terni, whether any infringements have occurred under Community law; whether there is State aid that undermines the German group’s choices of location; whether – as asserted by Mr Angelilli – there is an abuse of a dominant position; whether contracts with the Italian Government or the European institutions have been broken; whether, in other words, commitments given in respect of facilities or funding granted have been observed."
"In my view, this is the task of the European institutions, but I also think that that task should stop there."
"I do not think it is the task of the European Commission, the European Institutions or the Italian Government to criticise the decisions of companies operating in Europe to relocate."
"There is outcry at the scandalous possibility that certain products are to be transferred to India, China or South America."
"Personally, I consider that that is part of the rules of the game which certain countries in the European Union – primarily Italy – have taken advantage of for many years: placing at the disposal of the international economy its own assets, for example the availability of labour."
"This is not intended to be disrespectful to the 450 employees of Thyssen Krupp in Terni who risk losing their jobs; it means also remembering the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who may find work in China and in India; it means also making provision – I refer to Terni which has already absorbed 10 000 surplus jobs in the iron and steel sector in recent years – so that in Italy and Europe, in areas of excellence, it is possible and necessary to produce something else for export to European and international markets."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would make the point that Italy and Europe need the confidence of investors to invest in Terni, just like anywhere else."
"To imagine that politicians can criticise in this way the choices made by investors would not be to render a good service, nor would it serve any real useful purpose for employment."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representing a constituency in the North of France, I have indeed had painful experience of steel industry restructuring in my region."
"In the 1970s and 1980s, brand new factories were closed down."
"I have to tell you once again this evening: twenty years on, that wound is still open and sore."
"I therefore feel the current crises particularly keenly, especially that of Terni, where 900 jobs are under threat."
"While I was preparing this speech, after reading the motion for a resolution, I re-read my report on steel, which Parliament approved in 1996."
"At the time, having observed that successive restructuring had cost over 500 000 jobs in twenty years, I was in a position to state that, and I quote item F, ‘the Community steel industry may these days be regarded as generally cost-competitive and technological effective, even though the problem of overcapacity could emerge again in the event of a new crisis’."
"Two years later, towards the end of 1998, the industry was struck by a devastating crisis following a market crash in Asia."
"Since then, we have seen a succession of crises – some small, some large-scale, the result of local or world level restructuring – leading to a catalogue of redundancies."
"As recently as the beginning of 2003, it was Arcelor and the announcement of thousands of job losses."
"Today it is Terni and the thousand jobs deemed surplus to requirements."
"Without wishing to attribute greater importance to my 1996 report than it deserves, reading it brought back to me the risks that were already bubbling under the surface: unbridled globalisation, American pressure and production at the cost of the social and environmental aspects."
"It also recalled, however, measures that were needed to prevent further crises – measures in terms of social acquis and social rights, conditions of State aid, training for employees, respect for the environment, diversification, research, new products and the penetration of new markets."
"The motion for a resolution before us recalls others, and this proves, unfortunately, that our warnings were not heeded."
"The Terni situation is symptomatic."
"This is why we must rein in the great roaring machine, not only because the workers demand it of us, but also because if we let go, then great swaths of the European iron and steel industry will go by the wayside."
"In this context, despite the efforts and sacrifices of workers in the past, there is a danger that the European Steel Industry will disappear completely, followed swiftly by those industries that use steel products; in the fullness of time, therefore, it will be European industry as a whole that is under threat."
"Further proof that there is no such thing as a good economy without a social element, without training and without respect for the workers."
"In the short-term, some will make a profit, but that is not the issue for us."
"The issue for us is defending the economy, industry and jobs."
". Mr President, as Members said, the relocation of companies to countries with cheaper labour is a permanent phenomenon of economic history."
"I should like to make a few specific comments based on the statements made by the honourable Members on the role and facility for intervention of the European Union."
"First, as far as the international dimension is concerned, it is clear that global negotiations are under way on the question of steel and the European Union wants to achieve an agreement on subsidies because, as we know, there are countries which grant subsidies, especially outside the frameworks of the World Trade Organisation."
"The second point is European social law."
"And I think that here it is very important to know that, of course, the final decision on a company is taken by the company's management, but it is obliged to follow the specific directives on consultation with workers and on information, and prompt information, for them, and Community law on mass redundancies."
"The implementation of these directives in the first stage, because they are national law, concerns every country and, of course, it also concerns the European Union, because they are European law."
"The third point is the Structural Funds, in other words European money for companies."
"Here we can see two categories of intervention by the European Union."
"First, as regards direct subsidies to companies."
"I would remind you that, for several years now, subsidies in the steel sector have not been allowed."
"They are banned on the basis of the ECSC Treaty and continue to be banned but, where state corporations are subsidised, then there are commitments, there are agreements."
"A company cannot take European money and not keep to the terms on which it was granted and, of course, in such cases, the agreements are signed at national level and the national courts have jurisdiction to impose any sanctions."
"The question of subsidies is one aspect of the Structural Funds."
"The second, however, which is also important, is intervention in the matter of addressing the social repercussions."
"And here it is important for us to see that there is experience in many countries of restructuring of the Structural Funds, especially the Social Fund, in order to support workers and, even more importantly, to retrain them."
"The most important weapon in restructuring of companies is continuing training of workers so that they can deal with the problems of their sector and can re-enter the job market at any time."
"So I think that it is important in the negotiations taking place at the moment at trilateral level, between companies, workers and the Italian Government, for account to be taken of this possibility of supporting and assisting the workers via the Social Fund."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be on Thursday."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0003/2004), by Philip Bushill-Matthews and Bartho Pronk on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on demographic trends in the EU."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the House has agreed to debate this important topic."
"I also hope that this is an issue on which the whole House can unite on a cross-party basis."
"The subject is not just about demographic trends in general."
"My oral question specifically asks for more attention to be given to issues associated with ageing."
"Too often, ageing is just seen as a problem; it should also be seen as an opportunity."
"Too often, the elderly are seen as people with disabilities and with needs; they should also be seen as people with abilities and with rights."
"There are many aspects to be reviewed, but in the time available I will just focus on one: the opportunity for the elderly to continue in work if that is their wish."
"I therefore welcome the approach taken by the Employment Task Force chaired by Wim Kok."
"This report refers to one of the Lisbon Council conclusions that is often overlooked, that by 2010 the target is for 50% of 55-64 year-olds to be in employment."
"Currently, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have reached this target."
"Belgium, Italy, France, Luxembourg and Austria have employment rates for older workers of less than 33%."
"Delaying the average age at which people leave the labour force is crucial."
"Luxembourg, Belgium and France among the current Member States, plus Poland, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia among the incoming Member States all have average work exit ages well below the EU average."
"They will be particularly stretched to meet the agreed target and their policies will have to change radically in order to achieve it."
"Will they grasp the challenge?"
"But even the EU as it exists today will miss the 50% target unless it can increase the number of older workers in work by seven million over the next seven years."
"This means that two-thirds of the current 46-55 age group must still be active in the labour market in 2010."
"This means in turn a significant change, because only half of those in this group and in employment in 1991 were still working ten years later."
"This is the reason I tabled this question."
"It is a matter for Member States, but the issue is: will Member States act on these employment task force conclusions within a defined and early timetable?"
"Will the Commission put together an early progress report to present to Parliament, ideally by the end of this year?"
"Finally, will Member States implement all the provisions on age discrimination in the employment directive without further delay?"
"I hope the answer to all of these can be 'yes'."
". Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Pronk, on behalf of the PPE-DE group, have submitted a series of questions to which I shall reply."
"Of course, I too hope that the answer to the last three questions will be yes, which means very close cooperation and decisiveness by the Commission and, more importantly, the Member States."
"Your first question concerns what the Commission intends to do in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Summit, as far as demographic trends are concerned."
"The demographic problem is, at the moment, at the epicentre of our three basic policies, economic policy, especially public finances, the policy on employment and the policy on social cohesion."
"The question of ageing is now, as you will see, the basic element in the general orientations of economic policy and the guidelines of the strategy for employment, with specific targets."
"I particularly want to tell you that this year, in the spring 2004 report, we have set three priorities, one of which is the promotion of active ageing, which essentially means the extension of professional life."
"We have three categories of action."
"One relates to abolishing economic disincentives, which essentially discourage workers from delaying their retirement."
"In many countries, the regime which exists today is that it is more profitable to retire than to remain in work, because you earn less."
"So there is the serious question of disincentives."
"The second is the promotion of access to training for all workers, but especially elderly workers, and here we have set specific quantitative targets."
"The third is improving the quality of work."
"The Commission, within these frameworks of efforts to put demographic ageing at the centre of its policies, is proposing to extend the open method of coordination to modernising the care system and the social protection system."
"Here we have a particular problem, which concerns the increased burden both from the economic point of view and from the workload point of view and, hence, from the point of view of serving very old people since, due to the changes in our society, it would appear that the health systems cannot play the role which they played in the past."
"Your second question concerns flexibility in retirement rules and is particularly topical."
"As you yourself said, we have set specific targets."
"We have set the Lisbon targets, to increase the employment rate of the elderly to 50%, and the Barcelona targets, to increase the average age at which workers leave the job market by five years by 2010."
"These targets are being monitored by the Commission."
"Every year, as you know, we publish indicators and tables and it is clear that the Member States are not making efforts to the same degree to give us results."
"At the moment, we are examining, together with the social protection and employment committees, how social systems obstruct or favour easy retirement."
"The final report is at your disposal, it will be submitted again in 2004, and we can see what the problems are in each system as regards incentives to retire, disability benefits, unemployment benefits, older workers and dependents' pensions, and how the logic of incentives rather than the logic of integrating these people into the job market has also distorted the job market, as well as efforts by people themselves to enter the job market."
"We believe that this report, which will be submitted to the European Council, is also an important tool in the hands of the Member States."
"I must of course tell you that the European Commission has constantly recommended the introduction of flexible retirement systems since 1980 and the response has not been as we expected."
"As far as your third question on the results of the Wim Kok committee is concerned, we consider that they are extremely important, mainly because they go into detailed recommendations for each Member State."
"We have already included the Kok report in the strategy on employment and our recommendations for all the countries will take account of this report."
"I think that it is interesting that, in cooperation with both Mr Kok and the ministries of employment and social partners, we are presenting the conclusions of the committee to the Member States in an effort to achieve greater publicity and galvanise not just the governments but also the social partners into implementing them."
"Mr President, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for her detailed and encouraging answer."
"There has been a substantial rise in awareness of demographic ageing and its impact on the jobs market and social policy in the EU."
"Europe faces an enormous challenge in this area."
"On the one hand, it is confronted with the possibility of failing to meet targets set at the Lisbon Council in the areas of employment, competitiveness and economic growth by 2010."
"At the same time, health care systems must achieve the three-pronged aim of health care access for all, higher levels of quality provided by these services and the financial viability of systems."
"There is, moreover, enormous pressure on Member States’ social security systems to meet and to guarantee, in the future, the provision of pensions to an increasingly aged population."
"The time has come, therefore, to take action."
"We are aware that the complex implications of the ageing of the population, along with low birth rates, cannot be solved on an exclusively national level."
"These problems affect different Community policies, so what is needed is to develop Europe-wide cooperation."
"The first issue that therefore arises is to know in what way the Commission will be able to support Member States to provide adequate responses to the ageing of the population, either at health systems level or at employment policy level."
"The conclusions of the task force chaired by Wim Kok suggest various measures that may be adopted to maintain economic growth and to promote active ageing."
"A legislative and financial framework must be drawn up that might include such key measures as encouraging employers to hire and retain older workers, discouraging people from leaving the labour market early and increasing participation in life-long training."
"In addition to the questions raised by Mr Bushill-Matthews, whom I congratulate for his question to the Commission, I should like to address the question of working women."
"The increase in the contribution of women to the labour market is a further response, but one which requires measures to be adopted that make it easier to reconcile working life and family life."
"I would ask the Commission, and especially Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whether it is in a position to develop the mechanisms required to draw up a framework directive establishing a lowest common denominator on reconciling working life and home life."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I have to say that I do not fully understand why Mr Bushill-Matthews asked this question."
"We are all aware of the problem, and the Commissioner’s reply has also demonstrated that something is being done, and that naturally pressure is also being put on Member States as and where we can."
"I think your points, particularly the three requests, are expressed in too summarised a form to seriously tackle the topic as a whole and all aspects of demographic change."
"Both the Member States and the candidate countries are aware of the challenges."
"Let me refer you to the two reports our committee and Parliament have already approved in 2001 and 2003, which were produced by Mr Cercas and Mr Andersson."
"I think you will find the subject receives much more thorough treatment in those reports."
"We are not only talking about raising the age of retirement, as Mr Bushill-Matthews has reminded us."
"Clearly one issue is the need to remove the incentives for taking early retirement."
"Of course, we also need to get rid of the discrimination older workers still often encounter in our labour market, such as the fact that they are rarely allowed to participate in further training, the way their experience is often under-used, the way they have no chance of any kind of promotion."
"All this forms part of making the labour market attractive and reasonable for older workers."
"There is certainly a lot of catching up to be done, both by the Member States and on our side, which goes far beyond simply increasing the age of retirement."
"Of course, one other element, as Mrs Bastos has said, is to consider how we can promote child-friendly employment conditions in the European Union; how we can support women in combining work and family."
"I think there is a hefty contradiction if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Demcorats have no problem with calling for a 55- or 60-hour working week, as they did yesterday, expects that, and never stops to consider that it completely rules out a child-friendly society."
"I think this is another important point."
"The third and last point is that of course we need to have an unbiased, open and serious discussion about an active immigration policy."
"We should also seriously discuss the immigration strategy mentioned recently in this House by Kofi Annan."
"I think all this belongs to a policy which establishes a balance between the generations and welfare as well as showing intergenerational solidarity, as it is often called here."
"This is more important than simply talking about raising the retirement age."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for this question because our group is permanently very concerned not just about the problem of ageing, but also the combination of ageing and depopulation."
"Europe has an increasingly smaller and older population."
"It will be hard for us to compete if we do not have people suitable for work."
"I believe the time is coming when we must consider the introduction of a new criterion if we want possibilities for the future, a new criterion based on productive population density."
"You are Greek, Commissioner."
"I have been looking at the map of population density in Europe, I have it here in front of me, and it indicates that more than half of your country, more than half of Greece, has a population of less than 50 inhabitants per square kilometre."
"They are areas with low population densities."
"However, what would you think if I told you that, as well as that, half of your population is over 50 years old?"
"So we are facing a situation with practically no future."
"We must start looking into this problem, which is arising in many regions of Europe, in Spain, in Scotland, in France, in certain regions of Italy and also in Greece."
"The time is coming for us to begin to consider this concept of productive population density because it is necessary to competitiveness, because furthermore we are facing a repeated problem in Spain which we call ‘the fish that bites its own tail’."
"We cannot take companies to places where there are no people, where there is no productive workforce, and where the productive workforce does not go because there are no companies."
"We must find a way of breaking this vicious circle."
"I will go further: in our region, in Aragón, we have tried to move immigrants to rural areas: Latin Americans, Rumanians, Eastern Europeans."
"Do you know what is happening?"
"They stay for three, five, six months or a year and then leave, to a city or to the coast."
"We must find some way to break this vicious circle."
"The debate is closed."
"(1)"
"The Commission can accept all those amendments which are part of the compromise package worked out between the three institutions in order to achieve first reading agreement."
"Amendments Nos 1, 5 to 8, 19, 20, 22, 30, 31, 33 and 34, outside the compromise package, are not acceptable to the Commission."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I welcome you, Mr Uribe, President of the Republic of Colombia, to this House today.This is the second occasion during our parliamentary term – the fifth mandate of the European Parliament – on which a President of Colombia has addressed the plenary sitting of our House."
"President Pastrana spoke here in October 1999, and today he is part of your official delegation, Mr President.Mr President, even as the European Union enlarges to the east and to include two new Mediterranean island Member States, we in this Parliament fully believe that EU relations with Latin America must continue to be strengthened."
"It is in that context in particular that we welcome you and your delegation here today."
"We believe that an important step in this regard is the recent conclusion of a political dialogue and cooperation agreement last December with the Andean Community and therefore also with Colombia.Mr President, we know that yours is a state that suffers extremely high emigration, poverty, extraordinary security challenges including assassinations and kidnappings, and the extraordinary challenges of organised crime and narco-terrorism."
"In Colombia you have paid a high price in violence and political instability.This Parliament supports all efforts aimed at reforming and bringing peace to Colombia, however there are fields which still need further action."
"This Parliament believes that in addition to military and security dimensions the prevailing conflict also demands political, social and economic responses."
"We consider it essential, as has been the experience on our old continent, to develop a fully-functioning democratic state, with full and strong democratic institutions respecting human rights and the rule of law."
"In this House we believe that exceptions in respect of human rights are not acceptable.As you know, the European Parliament has demanded the release of all kidnapped persons held by armed groups in Colombia."
"Today again, Mr President, I return to this point and make in our House a special appeal to you to do your utmost to obtain the freedom of hostages, not least Mrs Ingrid Betancourt, who has now been in captivity for almost two years.Mr President, I invite you to address the House."
". Mr President, Members of the Conference of Presidents, Members of the Bureau of Parliament, chairmen of the committees, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen: people who visit Colombia very often say that it is a wonderful country, in complete contrast to the image portrayed by analysts and the media."
"Others say that it is an illegitimate, authoritarian and elitist State."
"With the strengthening of the State, our pluralist democracy has made the transition from formal and rhetorical guarantees to effective and genuine ones."
"The vote proposed by the government and held on 25 October was discussed and approved by the Congress, its text was modified by the opposition and examined and reduced by the Constitutional Court."
"Abstainers and opponents had every opportunity to express their views."
"Nobody could complain of violation of their rights or government hostility."
"The following day, the people elected 30 governors from amongst 133 candidates; 914 Mayors from amongst 3 441 candidates; 398 deputies from 373 lists comprising 2 723 candidates."
"The number of candidates was twice that of previous elections."
"In several cities and departments, candidates from parties other than the traditional parties won, from organisations arising from the former guerrilla groups, from, shall we say, leftist or opposition groupings."
"In the campaign they carried out, the government’s main concern was to give them every possible guarantee."
"And now that they are elected, the government has decided to work with them, within the Constitution, regardless of the political reasons they were elected, transparently, and above all, with the patriotic task of uniting Colombia in its diversity."
"Mayors and governors elected by the people have been victims of pressure and murder from terrorists."
"At the beginning of this government, 416 mayors were threatened by the guerrillas and 216 were not able to carry out their duties in the territory of their jurisdiction."
"The work done on security means that the problem persists in just 14 places."
"For more than a century Colombia discussed the popular election of Mayors, as a fundamental step towards extending democracy."
"The terrorist guerrillas demanded it as a condition for peace."
"It was approved in the 1980s."
"But that is the paradox of terrorism: it is the murderer who destroys the local democracy it calls for."
"Our State is made up of institutions which monitor one another and of the broad participation of public opinion, which means that the citizens are subject to the rule of law and not the whim of the authoritarian governor."
"My government takes a democratic view of security, in order to protect all the citizens regardless of their ideas, of their economic situation, of whether they are employers or workers or whether or not they are supporters of the government."
"Dealing with 30 000 terrorists is not easy."
"We are aware that our challenge is to overcome the terrorist threat transparently, as a starting point for building national unity and sustainable democratic security, which seeks to restore law and order."
"While terrorism is the great violator of human rights, the State and the security forces are devoted to upholding them."
"Last year 76 864 members of the institutional forces were qualified in Human Rights."
"In 2002 the Public Prosecutor received 231 complaints against the security forces for abuses of international humanitarian law."
"The number was reduced to 160 in 2003."
"The monitoring bodies, the justice system and the government share the determination to severely punish any proven violation of human rights."
"Colombia feels gratitude and pride in the courage of its soldiers and policemen."
"The sacrifice they have made in order to bring us peace has been immense: since August 2003, 277 soldiers and policemen have been killed by antipersonnel mines alone, and 854 have been injured, many of them permanently mutilated."
"Our country is open to the vigilance of the international community."
"At our request, we now have an office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Their recommendations are received with respect."
"When the government believes they cannot be complied with, the issue is discussed frankly."
"I recognise the role of human rights NGOs, I value the work of many of them, despite the fact that I express my disagreement with reports which do not correspond to the facts."
"In almost 1 200 000 square kilometres, with more than 400 000 of jungle, for years the State has not been present, replaced by terrorist organisations."
"We have proposed extending the institutional capacity to protect the citizens."
"Of the country's 1 100 municipalities, in 170 there was no police presence."
"Today there is a police presence in all of them, although we will not rest until the last of the urban centres is protected."
"In 450 municipalities we have installed soldiers and marines, known as ‘of My People’, who carry out their military service in their place of residence."
"The results are encouraging, and there is great hope that, following their active period within the security forces, we can count on them as leaders in compliance with the law, forever."
"Between 2002 and 2003, murders were reduced by 20%, kidnappings by 26%, massacres by 33%, attacks on the population by 84%."
"In January 2004 there were 51 kidnappings compared to 186 in January 2003, and murders were reduced by a further 17%."
"The murder of teachers, trade unionists and journalists has reduced and, fortunately, the murderers in several cases are already in jail, as a result of our determination to eliminate impunity."
"I would like to re-state our enthusiasm and commitment to providing protection with particular emphasis on teachers, trade unionists and journalists, because no democracy can allow them to be murdered."
"Violent deaths of indigenous people, indigenous aid workers and environmentalists, cruelly persecuted by terrorist groups, have decreased as a result of State presence in the ancestral territories."
"Internal displacement is one of our great tragedies resulting from terrorism."
"During the last year it was reduced by 53% and 11 140 families have returned to their places of origin."
"Although we have made some progress, the job has hardly begun."
"What country can accept 2 200 kidnappings in one year?"
"We will only claim victory when the massacres and acts of terror are completely eradicated, because every one of them brings pain to the entire nation, such as the car bomb set off by the FARC in the Club El Nogal, exactly a year ago, killing 33 and injuring 173; or the rural worker from La Unión Peneya, who was burnt alive by terrorist guerrillas because he refused to abandon his home and swell the numbers of displaced people; or the peasant woman from Tibú, who lost her leg as a result of a mine while she was out walking with her five-year-old daughter."
"The constitutional reform which introduces anti-terrorist laws was approved by Congress amidst national and international debate."
"The powers given to security forces to capture, intercept and carry out raids in cases of terrorism were subject to the subsequent approval of a statutory law, and also to other guarantees such as the obligation to bring the case before the courts within 36 hours, the immediate dispatch of a report to the Public Prosecutor and periodic scrutiny by Congress."
"The law is less stringent than those in force in many Western democracies."
"I believe that the world must reconsider the idea that this type of power placed in the hands of governments jeopardises human rights, since these must be respected fully and in the same way by both the judiciary and the executive."
"I classify violent groups as terrorists on the basis of the nature of their actions, the democratic context of Colombia, the comparable international legislation, the source of their resources and the results of their activities."
"People who plant antipersonnel mines, kill children, take pleasure in their own cruelty and act treacherously can only be described as terrorists."
"People who attack democracy, by means of violent action, while Colombia is determined to offer guarantees to all expressions of political thought, can only be described as terrorists."
"People who for ideological or other reasons use or threaten violence are defined as terrorists under the legislation of many countries."
"Likewise, anybody who behaves like that in Colombia can only be described as a terrorist."
"People who fund violence through illegal drugs and kidnappings, destroying the dignity, freedom and ecology of the people, can only be described as terrorists."
"People who use poverty and inequality as a way to justify violence and then cause more poverty and more inequality through the exercise of that violence, can only be described as terrorists."
"I am not opposed to a negotiated solution, but it must not be mixed with terrorism."
"An end to hostilities is a requirement, but disarmament and demobilisation require long timescales."
"Colombia has had a generous tradition of negotiated solutions with armed groups."
"My predecessor, President Andrés Pastrana, made a huge effort to negotiate with the FARC."
"His good faith and patriotism were deceived in a cowardly manner by the FARC, which expanded their criminal empire while the nation waited and hoped for a peace agreement."
"I have made democratic security a priority because that will make the armed groups appreciate the need to negotiate seriously, on pain of total annihilation by the institutions."
"Nevertheless, efforts have been made to begin negotiations with them."
"With the help of the Catholic Church, of Cuba, with the intervention of the Group of Friendly Nations and the Group of Facilitator Countries, we have sought dialogue with the ELN."
"There have been no results so far despite our willingness."
"They are afraid of taking steps towards peace without the permission of the FARC."
"The Catholic Church offered to mediate with the illegal vigilantes and I decided to allow it to continue."
"I accepted that the Peace Commissioner should begin dialogue when these organisations declared an end to hostilities."
"It is time to update and monitor this ceasefire, with regard to which the support of the Organisation of American States is extremely useful, and this must quickly lead greater numbers of members of these groups to show a genuine desire for peace."
"When the State and society is attacked violently the legal order is also attacked just as it is when it is claimed that they are being defended through appeals for violence and the action of vigilante groups."
"We must recover the principle of exclusive institutional protection of citizens."
"The demobilisation of vigilantes contributes to achieving this aim."
"The government’s military action has been implacable against the vigilante sectors which have not respected the ceasefire."
"This is demonstrated by the number of demobilisations, which increased by 85% in 2003 compared to 2002, and the number of those captured, which increased by 135% over the same period."
"The draft law on alternative penalisation, which is being discussed widely, seeks to facilitate peace agreements, without impunity, in harmony with justice."
"Although its negotiation coincides with the process which is being put forward with the self-defence groups, it is needed even more for the guerrilla forces, which has more members and a greater level of demobilisation during the current government."
"In that law we must look at the past and anticipate the future."
"The pardoning of horrific crimes in the past is unacceptable today and it would also be unacceptable if tomorrow the law we adopt is modified in accordance with a political predisposition towards other perpetrators of terrorism who want to negotiate."
"During this period of government almost 4 500 members of armed groups have been demobilised, 68% of them members of the FARC guerrilla organisation."
"They have been received with complete generosity and the State has made huge efforts to help them reintegrate into society."
"This number exceeds what has been achieved in peace processes over past decades."
"The FARC are holding more that 1 000 hostages, including congressmen, members of the security forces and the ex-presidential candidate Ingrid Betancur, who has both Colombian and French citizenship."
"I understand the pain of their families and the international interest in a humanitarian agreement."
"Initially I made an end to hostilities and the initiation of dialogue a condition."
"My talks with the Church, the French Government, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the families of the victims, led me to accept the quest for an agreement on the basis of negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations, the release of all hostages, and the commitment on the part of terrorists leaving prison not to return to offending, with effective guarantees, such as their residing in a country which respects the agreement."
"Without the effective guarantees that they will not return to crime, the government cannot release terrorist guerrillas."
"Otherwise, we would be disrespecting the sacrifices of the security forces, discouraging their actions and withering the popular spirit of respecting the law."
"We would be opening the door to constant extortion against the State and society."
"We must bear in mind that on the one hand there are respectable citizens kidnapped by terrorists while on the other there are terrorists who are in jail."
"We must bear in mind that war is one thing but terrorism is quite another."
"In war there are parties whose legitimacy is recognised for the purposes of humanitarian agreements, while with terrorism there is a murderer and a victim which is society, the rights and welfare of which we must protect through institutional arms."
"The authority cannot therefore give up on the rescue of hostages, despite the cruelty of the criminal, as demonstrated by the murders of Gilberto Echeverri, Guillermo Gaviria, Doris Gil, Helmut Bickenback, Chikao Muramatsu, and many members of the security forces."
"Murders of defenceless citizens by the FARC when they thought the authorities were present in the neighbourhood of the captivity."
"No negotiation can be allowed to strengthen the murderer."
"Colombia is a social democracy."
"63% of the country’s budget, excluding debt repayments, is directed towards social protection, education and health, directly and by means of decentralisation."
"Terrorism has increased poverty."
"Building peace requires that we overcome that poverty."
"The government is working on a plan known as ‘The Seven Tools of Equity’, which are: educational revolution, social protection, promoting economic solidarity, social management of the countryside, of public services, a country of owners and quality of urban life."
"Primary and intermediate education coverage reached 86.3%; the State technical education service will achieve its four-year goal of increasing from 1 070 000 students per year to 4 000 000; the various child nutrition programmes benefit 5 000 000 children; the credit for small businesses increased last year by 57%."
"We have many social problems, but we are completely determined to overcome them."
"The economy grew last year by between 3.7% and 4%, when we expected 2%."
"Last year the unemployment rate dropped by three points and the scourge of unemployment stood at 12.3%."
"In Colombia inequality is not due to private enterprise but to the lack of private enterprise."
"Organised private enterprise has top officials to contribute to solidarity with its workers and the rest of the population."
"Our employers pay the majority of fiscal obligations, and the latest fiscal reforms have increased their taxes."
"Terrorism has blocked the expansion of private enterprise and this has added poverty to the lack of business-like practices"
"We enthusiastically promote workers’ companies, cooperatives and the participation of users and workers in the provision of public services."
"We believe in social capitalism."
"In order to combat the concentration points of rural property in the hands of drug traffickers and terrorists combined, we approved a law to speed up the procedures for seizing assets."
"Last year this rose from five definitive judgments to 61."
"The European Union has given us extremely valuable support which I would like to thank you for."
"The London Declaration commits us deeply."
"It has been a great source of democratic commitment, a great sign of European support."
"The funding of the Peace Laboratories is welcomed by the Community."
"We need more cooperation in order to destroy drugs."
"Without drugs there would be no terrorism."
"This is not a time for blaming some people because they produce it and others because they consume it."
"The problem is so great that all permissive countries end up being producer, trafficker and consumer."
"It is time to destroy drugs."
"Our rural workers who cultivate it feel deceived by the terrorists and that their dignity is violated."
"They yearn for alternatives."
"We now have 20 000 forest-guard families to look after the areas free of coca and supervise the recovery of the jungle."
"Each receives around 2 000 dollars per year."
"We need to increase this to 50 000 families."
"Young Europeans must be aware that drugs have destroyed 1 700 000 hectares of tropical jungle in Colombia, right at the access to the Amazon basin, which is seriously threatened by this scourge."
"We in the Andean Community are concerned that the European Union has not decided to negotiate a free trade agreement with our countries, when it has updated it with Mexico and Chile, and proposes to bring it forward with MERCOSUR."
"The imperfections of Andean integration which are used as a reason not to negotiate that treaty would be overcome on the basis of the obligations imposed by an agreement with the European Union."
"We are grateful for the extension of the General System of Preferences and we respectfully request that it be maintained until it is replaced with a permanent agreement."
"I address this Parliament with profound respect, with gratitude for the interest you have shown and your constant assistance for Colombia."
"I am aware that the solutions my government is seeking to my country’s complex problems are controversial."
"I would repeat that I have faith in creative deliberation."
"Deliberation is more constructive than absence."
"Debate is more constructive than withdrawal."
"Constructive polemic produces more than the abandonment of seats."
"You are aware of my intransigence toward terrorism."
"My generation has not seen a single day of peace."
"The country we want for our children and future citizens must be a country of peace and equity."
"Distinguished Members of the European Parliament, I would like to say to you once again that my love for democracy is profound."
"President Uribe, I should like to thank you for your address to the House."
"In your closing remarks you talked about the benefits of dialogue."
"I should like to inform the House that the President will be available this afternoon for bilateral meetings with Group leaders and later this afternoon for dialogue with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Mr President, as a Head of State, this is an unparalleled level of engagement with this House."
"We thank you for the prospect of dialogue with you in the course of the day."
"The next item is the 2003 annual debate on progress in implementing the area of freedom, security and justice, on the basis of oral questions to the Council (B5-0005/2004) and the Commission (B5-0006/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I would remind you that the vote on the motions for resolutions winding up the debate will be held during the second part-session in March."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are approaching the end of the five-year term established in Amsterdam."
"New provisions of the Treaty of Nice will enter into force, and enlargement will expand the territory included in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is therefore time to take stock, to assess the mandate – this first five-year period."
"The annual debate focuses on this area and this will also be the approach of the resolution that we are preparing for the end of March."
"This is the European Parliament’s first message: we want this assessment to be made – not only by us, but also by the Commission and the Council."
"Here we will kick things off and publish our own evaluation in due course."
"We know that the Commission is also preparing its assessment, which we look forward to seeing."
"We would strongly recommend that the Council does the same."
"I ask for the forgiveness of the chairman of our Parliamentary committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, who will probably refer to this again and who had the idea and proposed it in our debate the day before yesterday."
"We argue that the Council should now start preparing seriously a Tampere II, a new European Summit specifically dedicated to the area of Justice and Home Affairs, in which this political assessment is undertaken in a serious and transparent way, without people harbouring reservations. We also call for a new and realistic programme to be defined for the medium term."
"This must be done under the Dutch Presidency, in the second half of this year or, at the latest, under Luxembourg’s Presidency in the first half of 2005."
"And we need this balance-sheet, one drawn up by all three elements of our institutional triangle, primarily so that we can then move ahead with political discernment and with new strategic direction."
"We need a dynamic balance-sheet; one that assesses the current situation and reaches towards the future."
"I would say the first requirement is for a positive assessment of many of the developments already achieved in this five-year period."
"We realise that the area of freedom, security and justice is an entirely new concept and a new direction for the Union’s development."
"It is therefore important to make a clear and positive assessment of the progress that has been made."
"On occasion, the understandable dissatisfaction of many is misunderstood by the general public."
"The wish to have gone further is frequently expressed; it is taken to suggest failure and gives rise to feelings that the situation is in crisis, which do not reflect the true picture."
"We must remember that the general public is one of our greatest allies, and in order to involve it more closely in this process we also have to give this general public knowledge and trust instead of only frustration or utopian ideals."
"Hence, first of all, the future strategic importance that I attach to a more intense policy of providing information in this field."
"If we ask the Council to come up with a Tampere II, however, it is also because we feel that Tampere I, in 1999, was of great value and I therefore wish to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, because I know how much Tampere owes to his efforts."
"It is true that much remains to be done, but the Tampere methodology, if we can call it that, was in itself positive, a framework for this parliamentary term, because without Tampere we would now be much worse off and further behind."
"To give a broad outline and without going into the details of the motion for a resolution that we are working on and without returning to the terms of the oral question – this will certainly be done by my fellow Members of other political hues – a general assessment could be made, ranging from ‘very positive’ as regards the progress made in cooperation in judicial and civil matters, to ‘almost total stagnation’ in the field of police cooperation, with ‘good’ and ‘bad’ or simply ‘tolerable’ in between, applied to the progress and delays in the fields of asylum and immigration and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"There is also very powerful and growing concern about guaranteeing fundamental rights, together with stepping up police and judicial cooperation, and there are growing calls for policies for integration in the field of immigration."
"There is first and foremost, however, a general message that could be sent to the Council and to all governments."
"This is a message that can be drawn clearly from these last five years and in the debates that have taken place: unless, in the remaining areas covered by the intergovernmental method, open and effective cooperation between governments and all the national authorities involved does not progress at the pace that circumstances require, public opinion will exert direct pressure for these competences and fields to be brought gradually within the Community sphere of competence, in some cases for reasons of security, in others for reasons relating to individual freedoms."
"In other words, if governments use their powers not only to fine-tune, adjust, calibrate and incorporate the principle of subsidiarity, but to block and hinder the development of this area of freedom, security and justice, they will be pursuing a very ill-advised approach."
"By waiting for so long, they will ultimately lose everything, because there are few areas in which the citizens exert as much pressure as in this one and in which this pressure makes itself felt so markedly and so powerfully."
"Nor can we compromise by refusing to discharge budgets because, as Romano Prodi, our President, has already said, all Union policies would suffer as a result, starting with the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I wish to say a final word, Mr President, on dialogue with national parliaments, a point already made in last year’s annual report by the then rapporteur, Baroness Ludford."
"Our experience of this five-year period suggests that we in Parliament must also speed up the working processes and I have thus proposed that in the next parliamentary term, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs should adopt a working figurehead, the benefits of which I have seen in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. We must also invite representatives of the national parliaments, of their corresponding committees, to come and participate in our work and discussions."
"In my view, we should do this in three situations: first, regularly once every six months, secondly, when we prepare our annual debate and thirdly, when a debate is held on a legislative matter that is either of particular strategic importance to pushing through the entire area of freedom, security and justice, or which is rooted in its decision-making process and in which it is useful, in order to uproot it, to extend the Trans-European debate."
"Lastly, there is a powerful proactive generic recommendation: everything that has been planned must be implemented."
"We would like everything that has fallen behind the timetables that have been set to be concluded by the end of 2004."
"We believe that, when Tampere II takes place, Tampere I should have already been fully completed."
"Perhaps this is not possible at the moment, but this is the direction we propose in order to remove all doubts from people’s minds."
". Mr President, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to discuss the work of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in 2003."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro for compiling the question on which I will base my comments."
"I want firstly to pay tribute to the work of the Greek and Italian presidencies in advancing the Justice and Home Affairs agenda during 2003."
"Significant progress was made on a whole range of JHA issues, including legislative measures and operational cooperation in compliance with the Tampere European Council Conclusions and the mandate from subsequent European Councils."
"The measure of that progress can be seen in the fact that during that period the Council adopted nine regulations, five directives, three framework decisions, two conventions, several agreements with third countries, more than twenty decisions and more than thirty resolutions and conclusions."
"Although the focus of the debate is on progress during 2003, you have framed your questions in the context of the significant events of this year and I will bear this in mind in my response."
"The Irish presidency is very conscious of the significance of this year for the Union and also for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The key objectives of our presidency are to make progress on the Amsterdam requirements and to take forward work on the extended Tampere programme."
"We will also continue to promote operational cooperation, particularly in relation to police and customs."
"Turning now to asylum and immigration, I would like to mention some of last year’s achievements."
"In the context of asylum, the adoption of the Dublin II Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining Member State responsibility for examining an asylum application, and the directive on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers, were major achievements."
"Progress has also been made on two other key asylum proposals – the procedures directive and the qualifications directive."
"However, despite the best efforts of the Italian and Greek presidencies, it was not possible to reach agreement on these proposals."
"These proposals have been moved forward under successive presidencies and it will now fall to the Irish presidency to attempt to resolve the outstanding issues, in keeping with the requirements of the Tampere and the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We will now make every effort to get agreement on these texts within the timescale specified by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"2003 also saw the adoption of the first legal instruments in the area of legal immigration – the directive on the right to family reunification and the directive on the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents."
"The Council also intends to move forward work on the directives on the condition of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of study, vocational training and voluntary services and for the purposes of research."
"In the area of illegal immigration, the Council reached agreement on the directive on assistance in the case of transit for the purpose of removal by air and the decision on the organisation of joint flights."
"On an operational level, various joint projects were carried out at land, sea and air borders, including the establishment of an ad hoc Centre for Border Guard Training."
"The Council also adopted a programme of measures to combat illegal immigration across maritime borders."
"The strengthening of border controls against illegal immigration will continue to be a Council priority in 2004."
"The Council intends to continue work on the draft regulation establishing the European Agency for Management and Operational Cooperation at External Borders, in keeping with the conclusions on this proposal adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in November."
"I hope that this can be agreed during the Irish presidency."
"I would also mention that readmission agreements were concluded by the Commission with Hong Kong and the agreement between the EU and Macao was signed."
"Negotiations are ongoing in relation to readmission agreements with Morocco, Russia and Ukraine."
"The Tampere European Council made mutual recognition the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters and specified a programme of measures for this purpose."
"There has been steady progress in the area of judicial cooperation in civil law since then and 2003 was no exception."
"Key measures adopted last year include the legal aid directive and the regulation on parental responsibility."
"The Council also established a general approach on the proposed regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims."
"I hope that Council and the European Parliament can work together effectively to enable this proposal to be adopted in the coming months."
"Discussions will continue within the Council framework during 2004 on the proposed Rome II regulations on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, which also comes under the codecision procedure."
"I also understand that the Commission intends to present a proposal for a regulation to establish a European order for payment procedure in the coming weeks."
"Your question also referred to the work of the Hague Conference on Private International Law."
"In recent years, on the basis of negotiating mandates adopted by the Council, the Community has been able to participate actively in the work of the conference where there are matters under discussion which concern its competence."
"In April 2003, on foot of a Council decision, Member States signed the 1996 Hague Protection of Children Convention, both on their own behalf and in the interest of the Community."
"The increased engagement of the Community with the Hague Conference is reflected in the fact that the Council has authorised the Commission to initiate negotiations with the Conference on the possible accession of the Community to that body."
"In the area of criminal judicial cooperation, the Council made progress last year, both on measures aimed at promoting cooperation and measures in the area of mutual recognition."
"Among the measures adopted were the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the framework decision on combating corruption in the private sector and the framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"The JHA Council also agreed the Framework Decision on Drugs."
"A decision to sign the agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters was also agreed last year."
"As far as trafficking in human beings and third countries is concerned, the Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, endorsed by the Council last May, provides the basis for a comprehensive five-year work programme."
"The Irish presidency will continue to support Commission initiatives to combat trafficking in human beings, bearing in mind the contents of that declaration and the work of the expert group on trafficking in human beings, which was established in 2003."
"I understand that the European Arrest Warrant has been implemented by eight Member States."
"The remaining Member States are in the process of preparing the necessary legislation."
"The Accession States will have to apply the framework decision on the European arrest warrant from the date of their accession."
"As regards procedural safeguards, I understand that the Commission will publish its legislative proposals in the course of this session."
"On data protection in the third pillar, I would point out that various instruments already incorporate provisions to ensure the protection of personal data, for example, the Schengen Convention, the Europol Convention and the Eurojust Convention."
"Progress has also taken place in the area of police cooperation."
"All the Member States share the view that Europol has a leading role to play in supporting the law enforcement agencies of the European Union in the fight against international organised crime and terrorism."
"It is a key agency in promoting the effectiveness of, and cooperation between, the European law enforcement agencies."
"The priority areas for Europol agreed by Council are drugs, euro counterfeiting, terrorism, trafficking in human beings – including illegal immigration – and financial crime."
"Moreover, the police of the Member States cooperate closely to fight serious transnational crime on a daily basis."
"Many operational successes have been achieved in recent years, for example, as regards drugs, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and child pornography."
"Europol has regularly been involved in providing support for operations in accordance with the Europol Convention."
"Last November, the JHA Council signed a protocol amending the Europol Convention which included several provisions aimed at improving the functioning of Europol."
"Furthermore the Council adopted several instruments relating to the operational functioning of Europol, including the approval of a number of cooperation agreements between Europol and other states."
"Other measures adopted in the course of the year included a decision on the common use of liaison officers abroad by the law enforcement agencies of the Member States and a decision amending the Schengen Convention to allow for the carrying-out of cross-border surveillance on persons suspected of involvement in a criminal offence."
"The Chief of Police Task Force and Cepol – the European Police College – also continue to play an important role in the development of police cooperation at EU level."
"I would like to say a few words about the last steps to be taken before enlargement becomes a reality."
"The Accession Treaty, which has been ratified by all the parties concerned, provides that, in general, acts relating to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice will be applied to the new Member States from 1 May 2004."
"For the Schengen , however, there is a two-step process."
"The acceding states will participate in Schengen-related measures on the lifting of internal border controls, including participation in the Schengen Information System, at a later stage, after 1 May 2004."
"The Accession Treaty also includes a safeguard clause."
"That provides that appropriate measures can be taken, up to 2007, if there are serious shortcomings or any imminent risks of such shortcomings in the transposition, state of implementation, or the application of legislative measures in certain areas of justice and home affairs."
"I will conclude my comments by briefly addressing your question about making European Union business accessible to its citizens."
"The Council acknowledges the importance of transparency in EU business."
"It is worth noting that the regulation on public access to EU documents, adopted in 2001, promotes transparency and provides for greater participation of EU citizens in the decision-making process."
"There is a high level of full access to legislative documents and partial access to other documents covering the current negotiations."
"At present 55% of the approximately 450 000 documents of the Council document register are directly accessible to the public on the Internet, in all the languages of the EU."
"The conclusions of each JHA Council meeting are available to the public, as are the texts of all adopted measures."
"I hope that my comments have given you an overview of the achievements in the justice and home affairs area during 2003."
"I thank you once again for giving me this opportunity and I look forward to continued cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council in this historic year."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this annual debate is not exactly the same as all the others, because it is taking place at a historically important juncture."
"Ten new Member States will soon be welcomed into the Union, we are in the process of negotiating a new Constitutional Treaty, and we are approaching the end of the European Parliament’s term, as well as the end of the period set by the Treaty of Amsterdam for laying the foundations of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro not only on the rigour and quality of his preparation for this debate, but also on the way in which he has approached it."
"What he has presented is not only a balance-sheet of one year’s developments but also gives a more wide-ranging view of what has been achieved in this parliamentary term."
"The Commission, for its part, regardless of what I say now, will contribute to this balance-sheet by means of a communication that it will present to the Council and to Parliament in June of this year, when we will present an exhaustive assessment of what has and what has not been achieved in accordance with the Tampere programme and the Amsterdam Treaty. In this assessment, we will also set out some ideas on potential bases for a Tampere II programme in the field of Justice and Home Affairs."
"In shall attempt to respect the order in which the honourable Member raised his concerns: in the field of immigration and asylum, the Commission has always sought to weave together the four main strands of this policy, as defined in the Treaty of Amsterdam: regulating the flows of legal immigration, promoting the integration of third-country nationals into European societies, effectively combating illegal immigration and defining a common asylum policy and extending partnership with third countries in order to regulate migration flows."
"As regards legal immigration, the Commission has submitted several proposals to create the necessary legal framework."
"The Council has already approved the proposal for a directive on family reunification and on the legal status of third-country citizens who are long-term residents."
"I hope that by the end of this parliamentary term, we will also be in a position to adopt the proposal on victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the authorities and who, therefore, have the right to a residence permit and also the proposals on allowing third-country students and researchers into the European Union."
"One disappointment that I would want to express concerns the problems in reaching, together with the Member States, a common platform for managing migration flows involving legal immigration, or what is known as ‘admission for work purposes’."
"In this field, there is deadlock in Council, the Commission proposal clearly does not have the support of the Member States and the Commission will return to this issue when we present, at some point in this six-month period, the study we were asked to draw up on the link between legal and illegal immigration."
"In the field of integration, the steps that have been taken following on from Thessaloniki are to be welcomed and we are now implementing preparatory projects for a broader strategy for a specific European programme to integrate immigrants into European societies."
"As regards illegal immigration, the Commission has presented three action plans that have been accepted by the Council and are now being implemented: the first concerns the fight against illegal immigration; the second, the common management of external borders and the third, a Community policy for the return or repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"I am also hopeful that the Agency for monitoring and operational coordination at external borders will soon be approved and the Commission intends to present a new legal instrument, which is the revision of a common Schengen manual on best practice for external border controls."
"At the same time, security issues have assumed considerable importance following the events of 11 September 2001."
"The Commission has already presented proposals on stepping up the security of some fundamental documents, such as visas and residence permits, by introducing biometric data and will, in a month’s time, present its proposal on including biometric data in the passports of EU citizens."
"Steady progress is also being made on developing the visa information system (VIS)."
"With regard to repatriation policy, the Commission is basically proposing, in the short term, actions on two fronts: one involving financial support, which still has to be discussed, and another on an initiative for minimum standards for repatriation procedures."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, important legal instruments have been adopted in the field of asylum: temporary protection, minimum reception standards, the Dublin II regulation and the implementation of the Eurodac system, and the European Refugee Fund, which came to the end of its first phase having mobilised around EUR 146 million in the last four years."
"The Commission is working actively with the United Nations High Commissioner on new ideas for asylum policy, particularly with a view to ensuring the more ordered and organised entry of refugees into the European Union, and the possibility of applying for asylum outside EU territory and also in order to increase protection in the regions in which crises originate."
"There are, however, two fundamental points relating to asylum policy that are missing."
"I am referring to the directive on asylum procedures and to the directive on qualifying for refugee status and harmonising rules on subsidiary protection."
"I am pleased, because I know how committed Mr McDowell is to these two instruments being approved during the Irish Presidency, and, consequently, within the deadline set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that we can end this parliamentary term with all the instruments needed for the first phase of a European-level common asylum policy having been approved."
"The Commission will also present a report in Spring 2004 on the negotiations underway on readmission agreements and we particularly welcome the fact that we have been able to reach agreement with the Council and with Parliament on a financial programme for the period 2004-2008, worth EUR 250 million, to develop a partnership with third countries for the joint management of migration flows."
"On judicial cooperation in civil matters, I fully agree with what the minister, Mr McDowell has just said."
"The Commission’s assessment is broadly satisfactory and, curiously enough, it is probably in the field of civil judicial cooperation, rules on contractual disputes, on extra-contractual obligations, on family relations and on regulating parental power that some of the decisions that this Parliament and this Council take have the greatest influence on the daily life of all European citizens, but the media normally pays these scant attention."
"It is much more newsworthy to talk about crime than about the everyday lives of normal people."
"It is, however, precisely in the everyday lives of normal people that most progress has been made under the Treaty of Amsterdam and under the Tampere programme and I sincerely hope that, by the end of this parliamentary term, we will be able to surmount any difficulties in approving the directive on compensating victims of crime."
"As regards the external dimension, I wish to emphasise the fact that the Commission asked the Council for a mandate that would enable the Community to formally sign up to the Hague Conference on Private International Law, in order better to ensure that the process of including judicial cooperation in civil matters within the Community framework is consistent with what is being done under the Hague Conference conventions."
"Last but not least, the issue of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"I believe that the balance-sheet of this parliamentary term is a positive one. Positive in the sense that, in practical terms, the framework decisions on all types of European crime set out in the Treaty have been approved, with one exception: racism and xenophobia, which is still proving problematic for the Council."
"Once again, however, I wish to emphasise that the Commission has remained true to the principle that the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments, the best example of which is the European arrest and surrender warrant which, like Mr McDowell, I hope is fully established in all fifteen Member States by the end of the first quarter of this year and is in force in the candidate countries as of 1 May of this year."
"The Commission will soon present a framework decision on procedural safeguards and we are convinced that the initiative we will be taking in June this year to present a framework decision on minimum rules for data protection, under the third pillar, will be equally significant."
"Judicial cooperation in criminal matters and strengthening mechanisms for police and judicial cooperation in the fight against crime must, at the same time, be accompanied by rules for minimum procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings in all Member States and for the protection of privacy and personal data in this field."
"It is true, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, that police cooperation involves cooperation more at the operational level than at legislative level, where I believe the Convention on the future of Europe has been proven right to emphasise that the ‘convention’ instruments in this area do not work: the amendments to the Europol Convention are still awaiting ratification by most Member States; the Convention on mutual judicial assistance, signed in May 2000, has still not been ratified by all EU Member States and, consequently, has not entered into force."
"Operational cooperation, however, has improved and it is crucial, if Europol is to be able to perform its duties, that Member State police forces have confidence in Europol and, above all, that information is exchanged on an ongoing basis on the forms of transnational crime."
"Finally, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I fully share your concern that it is crucial to inform the citizens about what is done."
"The Commission has launched awareness-raising campaigns on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on some of the legislative instruments that we have adopted and which might have a more direct impact on citizens’ lives."
"To be quite honest, however, I think the most reliable snapshot will be provided by the elections to the European Parliament, embodied by the Members of this Parliament – and you can pride yourselves on what you have achieved in this parliamentary term in the field of Justice and Home Affairs – since these are the best interpreters of the information that the citizens have the right to know, because they prove that European democracy works and that the issues of concern for the daily lives of the citizens are taken seriously by the bodies of the European Union, starting with their legitimate representatives, the Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, anyone who simply reads the progress report on the last year will be surprised by just how much progress we have made in the area of security, and you, Mr President-in-Office and Mr Vitorino, together with the European Parliament, can be proud of how much things have moved on as regards security."
"I would just like to highlight a few points that strike me as particularly important."
"For one thing, the Eurodac system became operational in January last year."
"That quite simply means that the Dublin Convention is now being effectively applied, that we can establish which country is actually responsible for dealing with an asylum application, and that we have an instrument available to us to successfully halt abuse of the asylum system."
"In order to prevent flows of illegal migration, we have established partnerships with countries of origin and transit countries."
"We have created an overall package of measures for combating illegal immigration which provides in particular for preparation for a new integrated system for securing external borders, with very high standards, to apply at all existing and future external borders of the European Union."
"We have also made preparations for joint repatriation campaigns."
"Something else I regard as being particularly successful is the political commitment to including biometric data in visas and residence permits, as in that way we will be able to ensure that we give people crossing borders documents that cannot be forged."
"Another significant development is the conclusion of the cooperation agreement between Europol and the new Member States or other States such as Romania or Russia, as a means of taking successful action on the ground against international crime and in particular against corruption."
"Lastly, another outstanding success story is the agreement reached for the first time on a standard minimum sentence to combat illegal drug trafficking, and then there are the measures we have taken in the fight against synthetic drugs, or the progress made in civil and criminal law, which I shall not go into in greater detail."
"All in all, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have successfully implemented an excellent package of measures."
"I would, however, also like to make some critical observations and to make certain requests."
"The first thing I would like to say is this: I think it is essential that the current presidency's ambition to implement the status and procedures directive in the first part of this year, that is by April, should be achieved in the interest of a common asylum policy."
"I fear that if we do not manage that we will have enormous problems in actually agreeing upon a common asylum policy, as we would then be without any emergency aid for refugees."
"We would accordingly be left without the instruments needed to move forward in combating abuse."
"You have our full support in this area as President-in-Office."
"My second point is about combating corruption."
"In the interests of stability in the new Member States, it is vital for us to step up the fight against corruption in those states, and we must help them to reach the Schengen standard at the new external borders as quickly as possible. That is in the interests both of the new Member States and of the European Union as a whole."
"It will require investment."
"You have our support on this."
"I would also like to say a word about agencies."
"I do not think we should start constantly inventing new agencies. No, we need to keep the many we already have capable of operating properly."
"We cannot countenance repeatedly extending the management boards – from 15 to 25 – by adding additional experts, and then, if that does not work, setting up an executive board."
"Then there is talk about setting up a coordinating board as well, to ensure that the other two boards operate properly."
"That cannot be the way to go."
"One last point: I would like to see an overall improvement in procedures."
"Otherwise, there is a danger of squandering resources."
"We cannot have a situation in the future in which Commission documents come to this House, and then, while Parliament is doing its work, new documents, new agreements are developed, about which Parliament is not informed, so that we carry on working on the old basis and then have to start all over again."
"I call on you to improve coordination here in the overall interests of procedural efficiency."
"This debate, which comes at the end of a successful year and of a successful parliamentary term, should provide a critical assessment, and should spur us on to build on that success in the interest of the security of the EU's citizens."
"Rest assured that we in the European Parliament will do our utmost to support you, even when it comes to the increase in the budget that will undoubtedly be needed if we are actually to achieve the successes that we wish to see in the interests of security."
"Mr President, it is true that the progress referred to by the rapporteur and the representatives of the Council and the Commission – whom I congratulate – has been made, but it must be admitted that that progress is not sufficient."
"Indeed, the most serious obstacle today to the development of the area of freedom, security and justice is the failure to adopt the draft Constitutional Treaty which, by making the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding in every sector of the Union’s activities and extending the Community method to include judicial, criminal and police cooperation, would have resolved many of the problems that still remain."
"We hope that this is nothing more than a mere delay."
"Meanwhile, steps should be taken to overcome certain paradoxical contradictions which continue to hold back the implementation of the Tampere programme, above all in the field of immigration and criminal and police cooperation."
"In fact, the very governments, which at Tampere approved a reasonable raft of measures, subsequently often fail to adopt them when those measures are proposed by the Commission and requested by Parliament."
"When subsequently, perhaps as the result of some emergency or other, those measures are finally adopted, frequently they are not implemented in the countries in question: such is the case, as an example of the latter, with the arrest warrant and the decision on racism and xenophobia."
"It therefore needs to be constantly borne in mind that dismantling internal borders enhances freedom of movement in the internal market, but also works to the advantage of criminals if the powers to prevent and control crime continue to be delimited by national borders."
"Now is the time, therefore, to relaunch an updated political programme for the harmonious construction of a European legal area, not limited to partial responses to specific emergencies, and we await expectantly the communication promised us by the Commission."
"With regard to the particular case of immigration, as repeatedly demanded by this Parliament, it is essential to lay down a common policy governing the entry, residence and integration of citizens from third countries which is not restricted to stamping out clandestine immigration."
"The delays and inconsistencies, however, which have been most noticeable on the part of the Council and Member States, are those in relation to the promotion and protection of fundamental individual rights."
"Measures are being adopted which, in fact, fail to respect fundamental rights with the result that Parliament is forced to bring such measures before the Court of Justice, the most recent example being family reunification. Common standards in respect of procedural guarantees are not being adopted and, as a result, closer forms of cooperation are being denied because States distrust each other when it comes to respecting those guarantees."
"Finally, the issue of personal data protection is particularly sensitive and serious questions remain to be asked about the conduct of a large number of Member States which allowed the personal data of European citizens to be handed over to US security agencies which provide no guarantee that our citizens’ fundamental right to privacy will be respected."
"In that connection, it must be said that the Commission’s conduct, marked by inaction and complicity, has been deplorable."
"The time has certainly come to adopt more effective measures in order to protect the rights of our citizens."
"Mr President, although this is an annual stocktaking we are close to the five-year assessment of the achievements of the Tampere programme and thought now needs to be given to Tampere II."
"We have to say that the Commission has done its job, but the Council's record is not outstanding."
"Both output and method need improvement."
"Looking first at asylum and immigration, we still do not have all the pieces of the jigsaw in place for common policies."
"Europeans need to have a sense that we are truly acting together to have well-regulated but fair systems in which responsibility is shared."
"But where is the solidarity in the disgraceful way that, one after another, 13 Member States have signalled they will impose restrictions on free movement from new Eastern Member States?"
"States have been more zealous about toughening borders and deporting illegal immigrants and on making sure immigrants are legal and integrated."
"The Council passed a grudging directive on long-term immigrants and one on family reunification."
"However, there has been no rush to implement the 2002 anti-trafficking framework decision to catch the criminal gangs, and recently in the UK 19 Chinese immigrants tragically died."
"It appears they were trafficked, but there is no law in place."
"We have major challenges in Europe in addressing prejudice and discrimination and promoting equality."
"The challenge to integrate the Roma looms large on our agenda."
"I am delighted President Prodi is holding a seminar on anti-Semitism next week, but why has the Council failed to agree the framework decision on making racial harassment and racial attacks criminal offences?"
"We need to enhance our understanding of what integration means as opposed to assimilation."
"Yesterday the French National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to ban the and other overt religious symbols."
"We in Britain, where policewomen can wear the , look on this with cross-Channel bewilderment."
"In the area of anti-terrorism and law enforcement, there has been much useful activity, but a lack of balance in concern for civil liberties, democratic accountability and transparency."
"I am delighted the European Police College will be located in England, but less impressed that the UK Government, with 12 citizens and residents in Guantanamo Bay – half the total of Europeans there – has failed to take the lead in getting a common position and joint action by the European Union to persuade the US to apply international law and uphold prisoners' rights there."
"The Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement that was signed with the US, over our objections, stressed the rule of law, but does not seem to have borne any fruit."
"Now we are taking too many steps invading personal privacy – agreeing to let the US access sensitive air passenger data and to put biometric data on visas and passports – while making no efforts to get an instrument for data protection in the third pillar."
"This shows an extraordinarily cavalier attitude to individual rights."
"In the future we will need to make more of an effort to raise the quality of our observance of justice systems through a process of mutual surveillance and peer review."
"That is going to involve some interesting questions about where the balance lies between European common action and intervention in national systems."
"But we have to reinforce our efforts, because the quality of what we are doing on freedom, security and justice is not yet adequate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we examine the so-called progress made in implementing the area of freedom, security and justice, the picture is pretty devastating."
"I say 'so-called' progress, because it is primarily all about sealing off Europe from the rest of the world to an ever greater extent."
"The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was recently very frank and clear about this policy, or rather this apology for a European policy, during his address to this House when he was awarded the Sakharov Prize."
"The UN Secretary-General did not greet us with polite and hackneyed words of thanks, no, he really read the riot act to Europe over its immigration policy."
"Let me remind you what he said."
"He said, and I quote, 'Migrants need Europe. But Europe also needs migrants'."
"And Annan added that welcoming and integrating migrants was not just a moral and legal obligation but part of the solution to Europe's economic problems."
"He fiercely criticised the EU's fortress Europe policy."
"He believed that a restrictive asylum and immigration policy drove many people into the hands of criminal gangs of people smugglers or even to their death, suffocating in trucks, or perishing in the undercarriage of aircraft, and Annan said that 'this silent human rights crisis shames our world'."
"There are people who bear responsibility for this silent human rights crisis."
"It is not because of some anonymous restriction that hundreds of people die every year on the borders of the European Union."
"But what do we get from the Council and the Commission?"
"Reports about common lists of safe countries of origin, about cooperation on deportation, about border protection agencies for stronger land and sea border controls, about the signing of readmission agreements, and so on. If all these proposals are given force of law, the only way to have any chance of applying for asylum in the European Union will be to jump from a plane over the EU with a parachute."
"At the same time, the EU and its Member States are actively responsible for giving rise to refugees from countries in the so-called Third World because of their failure to adequately combat poverty or by exporting arms to crisis regions."
"Instead of taking countermeasures here, however, we are now to spend millions of euros on pilot projects on deportation in Europe."
"As a German Member of the European Parliament, I also know that up to now any halfway progressive proposal on EU asylum and immigration policy will be blocked by my country's government in the Council of Ministers."
"All the special German arrangements designed to scare off and harass asylum-seekers are to be preserved."
"To name just one example, there is the residence obligation for refugees, which is unique in Europe."
"Only in Germany are refugees penalised if they leave their or rural district."
"As long as there is no change in the fundamental direction of this policy, huge numbers of immigrants and refugees will continue to die at our borders."
"A few crocodile tears may occasionally be shed about the tragic fate of a few individuals, but nothing will change."
"We must finally have the courage to tell people the unvarnished truth and say that Europe needs immigration."
"Without immigration, by 2050 the population of the enlarged Union will have fallen from 450 million to just 400 million."
"Unless there is a change of course, Germany's population alone will have fallen by a quarter."
"The many human rights organisations in civil society are right in rejecting the EU's fortress Europe policy."
"Proposals for an EU asylum and immigration policy founded on a high level of respect for human rights are on the table, but they need to be accepted before we can have a genuine debate on progress here."
"What we need in Europe is a right of asylum in accordance with the Geneva Convention, including recognition of gender-specific and non-State persecution as grounds for granting refugee status, together with recognition of desertion and conscientious objection to military service as grounds."
"We need free access to European asylum rights and procedures."
"We need a judicial framework permitting legal immigration into the EU."
"We need a European legal area for campaigns to legalise the status of people without papers, and last but not least we also need a right to freedom of movement for all people living in the European Union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you have said, despite all our efforts the Tampere agenda will not be complied with, especially on the matter of immigration and asylum."
"But we will only find an effective answer to these questions, be it in Sangatte or Algeciras, by having a genuine Community policy that respects basic rights, not by always being repressive."
"A lot of Commission proposals are currently pending in the Council."
"The few measures that have been taken are constantly criticised and the directive on family reunification is the subject of an action by our Parliament before the Court of Justice."
"On this question of emigration, I would simply ask you to follow the train of thought developed before our Parliament by Kofi Annan."
"Not only does our old continent need these workers, but the only way we will have credibility in the world is by affirming an open, pluralist Europe that shows solidarity."
"Immigration is an opportunity for Europe’s future and at a time when racism and xenophobia are swooping down on us we need to say that strongly and forcefully."
"We are convinced that freedom of movement together with a positive policy of legal immigration will enable us to apply the brake to trafficking, especially trafficking in human beings."
"We will then be better placed to devote ourselves to building a citizenship in which all who live on our continent will be able to participate fully, with equal rights respected – not to mention the fact that such a voluntarist policy will also alleviate the burden on us as regards both asylum systems and fighting illegal immigration."
"It will not yet be possible to adopt the two asylum directives, on the status of refugees and asylum procedures, despite the December deadline that was set and has now passed."
"But we know it is essential that they should be adopted to round off the first phase of the Tampere programme."
"Having said that, those two directives must also and in particular bring an added value capable of guaranteeing asylum seekers a better level of protection."
"So far as police and judicial cooperation is concerned, I would like to dwell on just one point, that of personal data, biometric data in particular."
"In a communication on the transfer of data, published by the Commission on 16 December and forwarded to the Council and the Parliament, concerning the agreement concluded between the United States and ourselves, we find a security gaffe under the cover of the fight against terrorism and crime."
"The agreement would in fact allow the data fields transferred to include date of birth, number of persons travelling together, credit card details, racial or ethnic origin and political, religious or philosophical beliefs."
"But that is a serious attack on the protection of private life."
"What can be done about it?"
"When we know that such information can be used as a means of discrimination, that provision also affects our basic freedoms, especially since we do not know exactly who will have access to the data."
"We can only be concerned about the uses to which it will be put."
"In this connection, did you know that, under pressure from the United States, in particular threats to ban flights, airlines are already transferring personal data to the US authorities without the consent of the persons concerned?"
"Such action is contrary to European law and the Commission is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties."
"Such measures affect both Europeans and third country nationals, as you said, Mr Vitorino."
"That agreement was nevertheless concluded without any prior democratic debate."
"It is therefore democracy and the rule of law that are threatened by the conclusion of such agreements."
"Should a genuinely independent European control body not be set up as a matter of urgency to prevent such data being abused?"
"And do you not think that the Court of Justice should also be asked to rule on the legality of that agreement?"
"We must be vigilant because security is taking precedence over respect for our rights and our freedoms."
"Finally and to conclude, how are we going to be able to guarantee respect for our fundamental rights if we sign an agreement with a country like the United States, which is constantly showing its desire for hegemony, conducts a unilateral policy and puts itself above the law, including above international law, as in the situation of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay?"
"I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would exercise the utmost vigilance with regard to all these treaties."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to welcome to this House the Irish Minister for Justice and Home Affairs."
"Secondly, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to my colleague and friend, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, for the presentation he made here this morning."
"The European Union is soon to become a political body comprising 25 Member States with a population of nearly 500 million people."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that all Member States in the European Union cooperate more closely to combat the threat of international terrorism and organised crime."
"With common European borders in existence and with the free movement of people within the Union, we too must cooperate more closely in an effort to stop drug imports into Europe and to combat the evil of human trafficking."
"We cannot defeat drug trafficking and those who engage in the heinous crime of human trafficking unless our European police forces work closely together."
"This challenge becomes even greater as enlargement takes place, and Europol will have to play a more pivotal role in coordinating the European Union's response to these rising crimes."
"No country can defeat international terrorism on its own."
"If Europe requires more resources to face up to this new challenge, then more resources must be made available."
"In recent times we have seen the tragic deaths of many people who have fallen foul of the scourge of international human trafficking."
"It is estimated that 600 000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union every year."
"That is why a comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration must remain a key priority of our Union."
"EU financial assistance for the return action programme must be maintained and we must all support the work of the Union."
"The borders agency is putting in place a coordinated approach by EU Member States to combat illegal immigration."
"I too support the implementation of a common EU asylum policy, and we must resolve the outstanding issues concerning asylum qualifications and procedures directives."
"We must also support the better management of the entry of persons into the European Union who are in need of international protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention."
"With regard to the issue of legal migration, the new EU legislation governing the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purposes of study and vocational training within the Union must be promoted."
"Finally, the issues of putting in place common policies to combat illegal immigration are best addressed at European Union level."
"We now live in an internal market where there is free movement of persons across the territories of the EU, and we must take collective action together in an effort to deal with these issues effectively."
"– Mr President, on the scoreboard covering both the first and second half of 2003, the Commission demonstrates that it has made progress, and the European Council too, at Thessaloniki, has provided fresh impulses to stimulate progress in this area of policy."
"I should like to extend my congratulations to both."
"The Council of Ministers is being pointed out as being the main culprit for leaving a number of asylum and immigration dossiers untouched."
"According to the Commission, Member States must abandon their reservations before the five-year period specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam has lapsed, by which time, according to the Commission, these measures should be adopted."
"Although this is correct, a five-year period for measures in this area was very short indeed."
"Widely supported legislation established over a longer period of time is more useful than swift measures that are subsequently not implemented due to political unwillingness."
"The European arrest warrant is a case in point."
"I was surprised at the Commission proposals with regard to the admission of immigrants to the European Union."
"Surely that was not one of the obligations enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam?"
"It is a topic that requires another extensive debate."
"Partly as a result of incidents of this nature, I am not in favour of fully implementing the vote by qualified majority in the Council about European action in the fields of justice and home affairs."
"These matters should be considered on an individual basis."
"Finally, I noticed that the Commission wishes to increase the budget for justice and home affairs considerably so as to be able to take measures in the area of illegal immigration and organised crime."
"Could Commissioner Vitorino elaborate on this?"
"Mr President, I accept Commissioner Vitorino’s call for citizens to be informed."
"The problem is what information are we to give?"
"We heard the President-in-Office of the Council give us some amazing statistics in relation to the transparency of the Council’s work, tens of thousands of documents."
"It is a pity that there is one statistic missing from those documents and that is the position of individual Member States, which is not a statistic of any note but it is an essential one in terms of the democratic process."
"It is not by chance that it is then stated – somewhat light-heartedly, in my opinion – that the European arrest warrant has already been approved by eight Member States."
"How, though?"
"A document approved unanimously during a lunch break, without debate, not yet implemented, subsequently comes to be taken almost for granted, as if it were already part of the de facto procedures of this Institution."
"There is absolutely no reference whatsoever to , although for six months the Italian Presidency has reminded us that in the field of judicial cooperation the concept of is a pillar on which citizens can rely."
"Not one word!"
"Next, as regards Europol, the Presidency affirms that the protocol is a step forward: but that protocol denies what Parliament has been requesting for years, that is to say democratic control."
"In addition, the French and British Members are currently opposed to such a Community position on Europol."
"Confronted with all this we should like to inform citizens."
"Yes, but about what?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the historical factors that have brought us to this juncture, so well explained by Commissioner Vitorino, clearly justify this debate."
"It would indeed be hard to understand if, in the last debate evaluating the area of freedom, security and justice in this mandate, we should confine ourselves to holding what is merely an annual debate."
"It therefore makes perfect sense that we should take stock of the mandate and I congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro on the superb report he has presented to us, with which we broadly agree."
"We must indeed acknowledge that even though substantial progress has been made on legislative measures, on measures for operational cooperation and on measures for institutional structures, some of the progress made has been unable to meet the deadlines set at Tampere and, what is worse, other aims that have been defined have also not been met."
"I should like to highlight ten areas in which concrete measures must be adopted: firstly, legislation must be enacted in the field of data protection under the third pillar, providing guarantees equivalent to those set out in Directive 95/46/EC under the first pillar; secondly, a common integrated management policy for the Member States’ external borders must be created, with Community funding; thirdly, the Council must adopt the two remaining proposals for directives that are needed to be able to complete the first phase of the common European asylum system; fourthly, the Council must approve the proposals that are currently blocked and which are intended to establish a common policy in the field of immigration; my fifth point is that a tangible proposal must be submitted on developing the visa information system (VIS); sixthly, we must be presented with a proposal for a framework decision on procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in EU criminal proceedings; seven: because bringing the Schengen into the sphere of Community competencehas enabled greater coordination to take place between the police and judicial services of the Member States in their fight against organised crime, it is now crucial that we move ahead, as swiftly as possible, on creating the new SIS II; my eighth point is that progress on police cooperation must be promoted, by means of a legal process, as Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, that is less complex and cumbersome than the Europol Convention, involving Union-level judicial and democratic scrutiny; my ninth point is that we must continue to conclude stabilisation and association agreements with the States in the Western Balkans region in the fields of combating organised crime, the power of the judiciary, the war on drugs, border management and immigration; my tenth and last point is that there must be supervision of the Community ’ implementation in the enlargement countries especially as regards the field of justice and home affairs, and the implementation of the Schengen mechanism and the covering external border controls."
"I welcome the fact that, in its work programme, the Irish Presidency considers developing this area to be its top priority and I hope that we will be able to develop fruitful interinstitutional cooperation."
"I acknowledge that the task we have set ourselves is enormous and extremely ambitious, but unless the pace picks up and the Council’s decision-making ability is increased, we will reach the end of this five-year period having failed to meet the objectives set out in Tampere."
"I therefore hope that by the end of 2004, we will have adopted all the measures on which we are lagging behind and which are included in the objectives and timetables that have been set."
"Lastly, Mr President, we must deplore the initiative adopted by some Member States to send a letter to the Commission to persuade it to impose a substantial reduction of the Community budget in the financial perspectives for the period 2007-2013."
"As President Prodi has already stated, in other essential areas, particularly in the sphere of economic and social cohesion, this would prevent the Commission from carrying out its work in the field of Justice and Home Affairs."
"– Mr President, Mr Ribeiro certainly deserves to be congratulated. He has tabled an ambitious and comprehensive draft resolution at this critical juncture."
"I endorse everything Mrs Paciotti has already said concerning human rights, and would like to focus on two issues in this draft resolution."
"My comments are addressed mainly to the Council. In my view, the arrest warrant is a most significant development."
"It enshrines the essence of the principle of mutual recognition and ought to have been implemented in all Member States by now. The warrant has implications for the fight against terrorism and also for the fight against criminal activity."
"I believe we should be much more actively engaged in follow-up measures such as the exchange of evidence. There is no way of convincing the citizens that this cannot be done in order to improve security as we Europeans would like it improved, namely by increased cooperation rather than increased repression."
"In addition, I think it is important to make an effort to ensure the framework decision on court rights is adopted. This is particularly relevant within the context of the current discussions on enlargement."
"In my view, it is the other side of the coin of judicial and police cooperation and mutual recognition in the context of cooperation in the field of criminal judicial cooperation. No delays should be countenanced."
"The Commissioner referred to the four Tampere principles in connection with asylum and immigration policy. I firmly believe these principles are valid."
"I am also convinced that the Commission’s proposals go some way to setting the right course for them. Nonetheless, I have the distinct impression that a degree of confusion still prevails five years on and almost at the end of the Tampere mandate."
"The expression ‘flow management’ should refer to legal entry to work and reside in the European Union. In Council jargon, it is now used to refer to the fight against illegal immigration."
"The concept of management of legal flows has ceased to exist."
"At present, the Council is not even in a position to engage in debate on entry and residence for work purposes, though this is the crux of the issue."
"If this continues, and the notion of combating continues to be associated with the words immigration and illegal, the result will inevitably be more frustration for the citizens. It is essential to demonstrate the ability to lay down consistent guidelines for the management of immigration in its broadest sense in the twenty-first century."
"Such a relationship should not centre on readmission to the exclusion of all else. Rather, it should consist of a broad set of measures designed to ensure that immigration has a beneficial outcome for both the countries of origin and the host countries."
"Mr President, I too am pleased about the progress we have made in 2003 in crucial areas such as the control of external borders, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime."
"As a Liberal politician with a fundamental belief in the basic freedoms upon which our democracies are based, I also think that 2003 is the time for some basic reflections upon the initiatives that have already been implemented and, especially, that are being planned under the overall heading of security."
"I fully acknowledge that the terrorist attacks of 2001 are cause for revising and upgrading our security."
"As I see it, the attacks of 2001 were above all attacks on the democratic values and fundamental freedoms that we cherish."
"It is therefore crucial that terrorism should not cause us to compromise in relation to these fundamental values."
"More specifically, I am thinking, for example, of third countries being permitted direct access to personal data in central reservation systems for air passengers, the introduction of armed marshals on aircraft and the introduction of biometric data into the travel documents of third-country citizens and into the passports of all EU citizens."
"Quite a few of these initiatives involve very extensive intrusions into the sanctity of private life, raising as yet unsolved issues in relation to current legislation on data safety and the risks of data being misused."
"I think, in actual fact, that it is time we now did some reflecting upon whether or not these security arrangements are out of proportion."
"In other words, do the initiatives comply with the basic criteria governing the fundamental freedoms that we, of course, specifically cherish in the European Union?"
"Are the benefits of the initiatives proportionate to their cost?"
"In this area, I am concerned that the Commission was not even in a position to inform me, as rapporteur, about the biometric data required of third-country citizens and about the precise numbers of visa applicants, falsified travel documents etc."
"The question I should therefore like to put to the Commissioner concerns whether or not the initiatives now being taken with a view to stepping up security are commensurate with a concern not to intrude upon the sanctity of private life and the personal dignity of EU citizens."
"Mr President, for anyone who has worked with legal issues in their professional life, the subject of this debate is very challenging."
"The Treaty’s ideological ambition, namely that of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, is, of course, all but divine."
"‘And God said, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light.’"
"The EU’s ideologues have, for a good many years, tried to imitate the divine creator."
"‘Let there be law’, the programme goes."
"The results reveal, however, a regrettable difference between divine and technocratic power."
"The work done by the EU technocrats over a period of years, aimed at realising the ideology of freedom, security and justice, has proved to bear a striking resemblance to the Tower of Babel."
"The observable and demonstrable results fall into two categories: firstly, the undermining of efficient national legal systems and, secondly, the establishment of an opaque supranational legal system with attendant supranational bodies that are beyond supervision."
"Together, these two categories of results involve huge reductions in legal certainty and, if this development continues, the criterion of success we shall be able, in a few years’ time, to use in characterising the EU project will be the blackly humorous one found in the saying, ‘The operation was a success, but the patient died.’"
"In order to promote justice, monitoring systems have been established that leave the parties involved beyond all supervision."
"That is something of which anyone who has tried to work with the Schengen information systems, Europol registers etc is aware."
"The degree of legal certainty is accurately reflected in the scope of police power and the opportunities to exercise democratic control over such power."
"These opportunities are being reduced day by day."
"Fortress Europe involves neither freedom, nor security nor justice."
"The EU’s ideologues overlook two basic facts in the sociology of law: firstly, that viable and democratic legal systems require something other, and more, than ideological phrases, legislative agreements and technological implementation; and, secondly, that the objectives pursued should be realised through the least far-reaching means."
"The Commission’s comprehensive monitoring report, published in November 2003, offers an ironic warning, observing as it does that the level of corruption is still high, indeed very high, and that this may have repercussions for people’s confidence in public administration and the judicial system."
"You bet!"
"What, then, is the cure?"
"It is that the Commission should exercise special vigilance."
"With the Eurostat affair fresh in the memory, that is no doubt like setting the fox to keep the geese."
"– Mr President, I was hoping that Kofi Annan’s speech, which we heard last week, would provoke an outbreak of democracy on the part of the Commission and the Council in particular, but I see that in the end it has done no such thing."
"You have both referred to Tampere."
"It seems to me that Tampere was very well balanced from the point of view of rights and duties, status and control."
"It is quite clear from the list of the various measures, operations and agreements you have given us today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that those measures are all concerned solely with security; that makes me extremely worried because I see some members of the Council being truly diabolical in their thinking."
"When I hear talk of outsourcing the examination of asylum applications, I really feel that everything has gone wrong."
"What really worries me is that I feel that the decisions being taken today in the Council or more appropriate formats – decisions by 5, or by 5+5, depending, at any rate on formulae that are seldom very clearly democratic – are an attack on democracy and the European project."
"I believe the penalty that can be expected for such an aberration would be quite clear, and Kofi Annan said it himself: tomorrow we will have a Europe that is meaner, poorer, weaker and older."
"I do not see that as a prospect that any of us, or any of the citizens of the European Union or third countries, can relish."
"In asking the Court of Justice to annul the decision on family reunification, the European Parliament is sending you a clear message that the Council is exceeding the bounds of democracy and I think if I were in your shoes I would want to take heed of that very strong warning from the European Parliament."
"I also think that instead of interpreting as it may Council decisions of which it does not really approve, the Commission would do better to interpret them by consulting its NGO partners."
"It would do well, with all associations, European civil society and all parliamentarians who stand up for rights, international conventions and democracy, to really cause that outbreak to happen so that in future all decisions are taken in a spirit of parliamentary co-decision as desired in the draft Constitution."
"– Mr President, it is unfortunate that at present, the area of freedom, security and justice is raising more questions than certainties."
"With the accession of ten new Member States in a few weeks' time, this is a worrying matter."
"Fortress Europe is, unfortunately, nothing but a political fantasy of the Left."
"In recent years, there has been much talk of common immigration and asylum policy, and of cooperation in terms of criminal justice and police, but little concrete has come out of this so far."
"In fact, the word ‘regress’ has been mentioned in certain areas."
"The guarantee of fundamental rights springs to mind."
"At the moment, a great deal of attention is being paid to the way in which the future Member States deal with this, with good reason, while in Belgium, the freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the freedom of association is being curbed."
"The fight against so-called racism is being misused in order to gag Flanders' most significant opposition party and to nip in the bud any criticism of the failing integration policy."
"In a few weeks' time, when all other parties start their election campaigns, the has to contend before a court of law with a government body falling within the Prime Minister's direct remit in order to defend its right to exist."
"We are right to worry when in Russia a candidate for the presidency disappears."
"Soon, in Belgium, the so-called heart of the European Union, an entire party is at risk of disappearing, one that comprises some fifty MPs and which, according to the latest surveys, is backed by 20% of the electorate."
"This is all done under the auspices of a Prime Minister who aspires to become President of the Commission."
"You will appreciate that this kind of Europe will not enjoy the approval of the majority of its citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the current five-year term is drawing to a close."
"As provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam and at the important Tampere Summit for the adoption of measures aimed at the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, a progress review is now due."
"In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to provide an overview of what has been achieved so far, and share with you some thoughts for the future and on how to rise to this ongoing challenge."
"A good deal has been achieved, despite the fact that much of the progress was due solely to crises such as that of 11 September. It is disappointing too that in the specific area of asylum and immigration it has as yet proved impossible for us to come up with satisfactory solutions."
"The sovereignty of Member States is directly affected by all measures related to the development of the area of freedom, security and justice. There is therefore a sense in which misgivings and difficulties are understandable."
"Further to the progress made and in order to sustain it, I propose drawing up a second Tampere programme. The Commissioner’s statement suggests this could be feasible."
"In addition the House appears to be favourably inclined towards the idea."
"As I see it, such a programme should be driven by legitimacy, efficiency and solidarity."
"I shall refer first to the legitimacy of actions taken. In my view, actions must be based solely on the protection and guarantee of the citizens’ rights and freedoms."
"Parliament therefore has a crucial role to play in this regard. I am inclined to doubt whether these principles really have been the driving force behind all the measures adopted so far."
"Rather the opposite appears to have been the case. We seem instead to have witnessed an exercise in the protection of the national interests of Member States."
"Parliament has often been sidelined. On occasion, documents the House needed to take a decision on actually arrived late."
"I am sorry to say that a long hard look at reality will show my misgivings are justified. For instance, I could point to the minor role played by Parliament in key areas such as the agreement on judicial cooperation with the United States."
"The programme to combat terrorism and organised crime is another relevant example. In this case, failure to consult Parliament is evidence of lack of transparency in decision-making."
"Nonetheless, it is only fair to point out that there is one issue on which Parliament, the Commission and the Council have shown great determination and consensus. I refer to the fight against terrorism."
"A day should be set aside to honour the victims of terrorism. 11 September could be an appropriate date for such an international day of remembrance."
"This is the only way of recognising those who have suffered most from this dreadful scourge. Sadly, terrorist incidents are becoming increasingly common."
"They represent an attack on the most basic of all human rights, namely the right to life and physical integrity. I trust my suggestion will be taken up."
"Secondly, careful consideration should be given to the effectiveness of the measures adopted. Clearly, the current decision-making process has resulted in a somewhat schizophrenic situation."
"Member States launch initiatives that are never carried through and overlap with each other. Processes grind to a halt in Council because of the requirement for unanimity."
"This is the case for the development of regulations for the asylum process. Most serious of all are the unacceptable delays in transposing Community regulations into the legislation of Member States."
"The European arrest warrant is a prime example. Hence the importance of the changes contained in the draft European Constitution, aimed at avoiding such situations in the future."
"Lastly, I would like to refer to solidarity. At present, this is particularly conspicuous by its absence across the majority of Member States."
"It is abundantly clear that governments are more concerned about internal public opinion or their national budgets than about achieving European objectives. I have no doubt that this is what actually happens in Councils of Ministers when it comes to tackling the serious problems resulting from the proliferation of requests for asylum."
"The same is true of the problems posed by uncontrolled and sporadic economic migration. Several Member States are having to cope with the tragic consequences of these phenomena."
"The worst thing about this strategy is that it takes no account of the real state of affairs."
"In an area of freedom, security and justice, internal borders no longer exist. There can be no point in doggedly defending strictly national positions against other Member States when the effects of policies adopted by certain countries have a direct impact on the remainder."
"Europe is a common venture."
"The area under debate is a common venture."
"We are called on to move forward together. Only then will we reap the benefits together."
"Mr President, I shall restrict my remarks to the area of legal migration, a subject touched on by both Mr McDowell and Commissioner Vitorino and picked up by several colleagues here."
"I agree with much of what Mrs Kaufmann said earlier in her reference to Kofi Annan's speech to the European Parliament a few days ago."
"Mr McDowell spoke earlier on about family reunification and allowing in migrants for purposes of study and training."
"But that is only part of the issue concerning legal migration."
"Commissioner Vitorino on the other hand has tried over the last few years to push forward a more imaginative agenda with a wider framework."
"I believe very strongly that without a system of legal migration into the European Union – something like the green card system that the United States has in place – we will continue to face the challenge of illegal immigration with all its problems."
"We will continue to face the difficult problems of trafficking gangs and all the crime associated with that, to say nothing of the continuing shortage of labour in key industries, both skilled and unskilled."
"Unless I have missed a key point, I do not believe there is an alternative to planned legal migration."
"But I am also absolutely convinced that this must be done in a manner that is positive both for EU countries and for the countries of origin."
"It is not acceptable just to take skilled workers from less-developed countries, nor is it acceptable for rich EU countries to say they will take migrants to do those unpleasant, dirty jobs that they do not want to do."
"This is why I urge the Commissioner and the Council to press on with this very difficult work in an important area – a structured programme for planned migration for a European Union of 25 countries and more."
"Mr President, in the near future, freedom, security and justice will be particularly crucial areas in view of the different approaches that the new and existing Member States have towards such problems."
"Obstacles will be placed in the way of real operational cooperation between law enforcement agencies at European level."
"A genuine and proper system is needed to defeat criminal organisations and gangs."
"Italian law, which is effectively abolishing international warrants, appears to have been deliberately made for the purpose of preventing those in power being asked questions they find embarrassing, such as the questionable use of tax havens, the unlawful export of capital and involvement in convenient off-shore companies."
"As things stand, the European arrest warrant has not yet been ratified by my country."
"After a period of almost five years, the attempt to streamline the extradition procedures is a long way from achieving any tangible results."
"A closer understanding of the justice problem calls for a preliminary observation concerning the independence of the courts."
"In Italy, today, there is a desire to return to the legal and political culture of the Middle Ages, permanently overcome in the western world by the abolition of immunities and privileges, sanctioned in 1789 by the French States General."
"The separation of powers in the modern State has currently been thrown into question, first by common laws, then by constitutional laws which people are attempting to pass off as common laws, which means they are not subject to qualified majorities and second readings."
"At the heart of this is the destabilising attempt to make the courts subservient to the executive, something we witness the Italian Government doing on a daily basis by means unworthy of a civil State."
"Why am I making such serious allegations in the European Parliament?"
"I believe that democracy cannot be exported but it is something that you can live and the more we live it together the stronger we make it."
"In order that my country may overcome this difficult time, all the European Institutions must keep a close watch over what is happening in Italy. What is happening may set a bad example that can so easily be exported elsewhere."
"– Mr President, as it does every year, today’s debate on questions of freedom of movement, security and justice is taking a very legal turn."
"We list the texts in preparation and, as usual, we regret that the Commission’s ideas are not advancing fast enough."
"I would like to ask the question a different way and return to reality."
"What has been the result on the ground of the measures already taken?"
"Obviously, I am thinking of harmonisation in the loosest sense and the abolition of internal border controls."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, the results of that abolition have been disastrous with both increased illegal immigration and increased trafficking of all kinds, from drugs to procuring."
"The combination of a lack of controls and illegal immigration is making even Europe a breeding ground for terrorism."
"Commissioner Vitorino will no doubt reply that this is the proof that we need to go further with communitisation."
"Well, no, Commissioner, because that communitisation would disconnect the system from the peoples even more and weaken the security imperatives even further."
"In this context, we look forward anxiously to 1 May 2004, which will give new powers to the Commission, relaunch the process of further downward harmonisations and continue putting in place a system that is remote from the people."
"However, some States seem to have been showing a new lucidity recently: they are putting a brake on lax texts, on the status of refugees and subsidiary protection, for example."
"I congratulate them for protecting their citizens this way and encourage them to continue, because the decisions of Amsterdam and Nice in this area were irresponsible."
"We need to change our priorities completely, put a stop to harmonisation where it lowers our defences and give pride of place to security."
"Mr President, it is with great interest that I have followed the debate, which tended to give an assessment not only of this year but of this parliamentary term as a whole as regards the field of freedom, security and justice."
"It is a difficult assessment to make because it has many aspects: there are the political and legal aspects, and then there is the social aspect on which progress must be made."
"The political aspect involves the will of the Member States; the legal aspect is based on the instruments made available by the Treaty; as regards the social aspect, it has no logical basis whatsoever insofar as it is dictated by the continuous development of the framework in which the European area of freedom, security and justice is to be implemented."
"In view of the time available to me, I will deal mainly with the political aspect."
"It is the declared intention of the majority of Member States – unfortunately not all of them – to extend and consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in response to an increasingly explicit desire on the part of European citizens to pave the way to solidarity and extend the areas of cooperation in relation to the reception of new waves of immigrants, smoothing out the inconsistencies that still exist with regard to the recognition of the right to asylum, citizenship and establishment in any EU country."
"I am pleased that this attitude can be traced back to the tremendous incentive provided by the demands contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights for European citizens, which was launched in Nice in 2000 and waiting to be included in the Constitution."
"It is a document that can be compared to good wine: at first it did not make much impression being rather weak and imperfect but, with the passage of time, the intrinsic quality of the text increasingly emerges wherein we find precise reference points for all the choices and measures required of us in this difficult phase of our history."
"A further step forward will be achieved by approval at second reading of the directive on the free movement of Community citizens, their rights and responsibilities, of which I am rapporteur."
"This provides for a raft of urgent measures that must be consolidated in order to be able to deal effectively with the new tasks imposed on us by the increasingly huge and chaotic arrival of citizens from third countries."
"With regard to the report in question, Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has set 18 March as the date for its approval."
"Almost all the political groups have accepted the rapporteur’s request not to table amendments to the text issued by the Council, in which only 50% of Parliament’s requests are included."
"Agreement with the Commission has also been reached on that point."
"We are convinced that this directive, although not perfect, must be implemented during the current term of office, preferring to see the glass half full rather than half empty: in other words, better to have half the requests rather than to refer it back indefinitely."
"We hope the Council is able to appreciate this responsible position so that citizens may be given at least that part of the reforms which are contained in the text and which constitute, in any event, important steps forward to give legal substance and political dignity to the status of European citizen."
"Mr President, Commissioner, without doubt, Tampere was a serious milestone and starting point for creating a European common area of freedom, security and justice."
"As the deadline approaches, we find that the glass is both half full and half empty."
"Without doubt progress has been made under the difficult conditions which the different cultures and approaches of the Member States created in the Council."
"As far as immigration policy is concerned, significant progress was made at the European Council in Thessaloniki, as you too mentioned, Commissioner; nonetheless, the question of recognising rights and the social integration of immigrants does not appear to be very high on our political agenda."
"And this certainly is not in keeping with everything we maintain about a Europe of humanitarian values and respect for human rights."
"The directive on family reunification, as edited by the Council, is essentially prohibitive and I think it important that the European Parliament take recourse to the Court of Justice on the question of the content of the directive."
"As far as asylum is concerned, I should like, Mr McDowell, Commissioner, to send my condolences to the Council for failing to adopt the two directives on the definition of refugees and the procedures for granting and revoking refugee status, which were also issues which the Greek Presidency advanced."
"In the meantime, it is a well-known fact that the Geneva Convention on refugees has been torn to shreds from one side of the European Union to the other."
"As far as combating international organised crime is concerned, I consider that no progress has been made in this sector, when thousands of women and children are shipped into the European Union every day for the purpose of exploiting them sexually."
"I think that this failure is due to the lack of essential operational cooperation between the police authorities in the Member States on combating this phenomenon which is an insult to our civilisation."
"Similarly, efforts by the Irish Presidency to bring to a close the matter of creating a personal database on immigrants with biometric elements, such as fingerprints and a digital photograph, will, I believe, create serious discrepancies in the matter of respect and control of the management of personal data."
"We hope, Commissioner, that new ideas and a new strategy will be put forward for Tampere ΙΙ."
"– Mr President, despite the many measures which the European Union has taken, ranging from Europol's competences to issuing a European arrest warrant, I notice that on the ground, few, if any, results are being achieved in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Statistics show that crime is on the rise in various Member States."
"Moreover, crime is increasingly being characterised by growing aggression, which increases the public perception of the lack of security."
"It is, unfortunately, no longer exceptional for innocent citizens to be killed or seriously injured during assaults."
"Certainly now with enlargement around the corner, anxious citizens are right to question whether the European Union can offer sufficient guarantees in order to safeguard their security."
"It is the very same citizens who have to stand by and watch inadequate police action being taken to tackle this increasingly insolent criminal behaviour."
"It is of the utmost importance that the Commission should propose measures in order to alleviate this particularly painful shortcoming."
"After all, it is the government's principal task to guarantee the security of their citizens under all circumstances."
"Since the EU’s external borders are due to be considerably extended, it is very much a question of whether the new Member States can sufficiently act as buffers against unwanted and illegal immigration."
"It is an ever more burning issue within the EU as a result of which integration policy, which has to be adopted, is being undermined."
"In fact, what are we waiting for before we implement a global action plan with the intention of removing all illegal immigrants from the EU's territory?"
"For as long as we have no firm grip on illegal immigration, there will be no real area of freedom, security and justice."
"– Mr President, the fundamental objectives of the Union include the guarantee of an area of freedom, security and justice for its citizens."
"Unfortunately, we are still a long way from implementing this objective."
"The citizens of the Union must be able to move freely within the EU, and at the same time we have to step up the fight against crime."
"The biggest challenges are the prevention of crime, ensuring the security of the external borders and the full-scale implementation of Schengen. The Schengen Convention is an important step forward in the area of free movement."
"Special attention must be paid to securing the external borders just prior to enlargement."
"As soon as their membership begins, the new Member States will be able to participate in the first stage of the Schengen process, which will prepare them for full Schengen membership."
"During the first stage there will still be internal border checks on the frontiers between the new and the old Member States."
"They cannot be discontinued before controls on the Union’s new external borders reach the required standard."
"The updating of the Schengen information system will have to be expedited so that any possible technical defects in the Union’s information systems do not prevent the new Member States from moving on to stage two."
"There have to be increased levels of cooperation between the authorities in the EU Member States in the prevention of, and fight against, crime."
"Cooperation based on conventions is outdated and a slow process in today’s EU."
"Member States sign and ratify conventions at their own pace, if they do so at all."
"It can take several years for a convention to come into effect from the time it was negotiated."
"In the meantime shortcomings in levels of cooperation and the flow of information between authorities are an obstacle to solving and preventing crime effectively."
"The Union has to develop new legal instruments to meet today’s demands regarding cooperation between Member States more effectively."
"Cooperation between the police, customs and border control authorities has not made progress in the way hoped for."
"We now require initiatives and action from the Member States and the Commission to achieve better levels of coordination."
"The EU in its present form offers the potential for fuller cooperation."
"Together we can do more if there is the will among Member States to combat crime."
"Mr President, in reality, it is the Council alone that should be blamed for the delay in adopting fundamental measures in the field of asylum and immigration."
"We recall the proposal for a directive on granting refugee status, which should have been approved well before the end of 2003, but this is not, unfortunately, an isolated case."
"We must also talk about the general aim of putting the conditions in place for an ordered entry into the European Union for those who are without international protection, but the fact is that another important directive on the procedures that the Member States should implement to grant refugee status ultimately fell by the wayside."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 and 28 November abandoned its quest for a political agreement on these two pieces of legislation that are crucial to the first phase of harmonising the common asylum system, and decided to postpone their adoption until the end of 2004."
"Fortunately, not everything has ended in inertia or deadlock."
"We must praise the attitude of the Commission and the commitment of Commissioner Vitorino, which were demonstrated in the proposal for a regulation establishing a programme of technical and financial assistance to third countries in the field of migration and asylum, an instrument that will enable us to address the needs felt by these countries in their efforts to ensure that migration flows are better managed."
"Nor must we overlook the fact that the Draft Constitution of the European Convention provides for a genuine common European asylum system and an immigration policy, which will enable us to abandon the current system of minimum rules in which Member States retain a large part of their national systems."
"Unfortunately, even this crucial historical area is compromised, and so we can only conclude that 2003 was a year in which there was a keen awareness of the needs, and of providing the appropriate means, areas in which the Commission and Parliament did what was asked of them. It was, however, also a time that suffered from the hypocrisy, hesitation and deadlock that national strategy and ideological prejudice impose on the Council’s decision-making ability."
"Mr President, we have been reminded a number of times this morning that this is the last debate on the area of freedom, security and justice to be held during this term. Further, 1 May is fast approaching."
"Pursuant to the provisions in the Treaty of Nice, certain parts of the Treaty are due to be amended on that date. Ten new countries will join the Union on 1 May too."
"Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is also based on the rule of law, common to all Member States."
"I believe that over and above guaranteeing that the Member States abide by these principles, it is important for the European Union as a whole to act as guarantor of respect for such freedom and of compliance with the rule of law."
"They hope Europe will be more than simply a large market. They want Europe to be safer, freer and more just."
"I come from a country suffering the scourge of terrorism. In my homeland, some of the principles laid down in Article 6 are flouted."
"The terrorist group ETA deprives many of my fellow citizens of freedom of speech, freedom of action, and freedom to engage in politics."
"ETA and its followers restrict our liberty and threaten the rule of law."
"The scourge of terrorism can only be eliminated by working within the rule of law, in cooperation with the judicial authorities and the police."
"In this day and age, terrorism can no longer be deemed a local problem. It is a global threat to us all, the European Union included."
"Clearly, the implementation of the European arrest warrant, the drafting of commonly recognised European lists of terrorist organisations and the definition of the crime of terrorism do represent major achievements. Together, they are helping to build the area of freedom, security and justice, and contributing to the fight against terrorism."
"This fight can only be won through determination, respect and the implementation of the rule of law and of all the mechanisms available under the law."
"Negotiation or ambiguity will not help to defeat terrorism."
"Terrorism is an attack on democracy and can only be repulsed by more democracy."
"Considerable progress has been made in the area of freedom, security and justice where the victims are concerned. In recent years this House awarded a prize to organisations defending victims of terrorism."
"Turning to Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s report, I should first like to congratulate its author. Congratulations are also due to the Commissioner."
"He has made a tremendous effort to contribute to the creation of this area of freedom, security and justice over the last few years. I should like to highlight some of the issues raised in the aforementioned report."
"It is incumbent on all of us to press for framework decisions to be transposed into the legal systems of Member States at the earliest opportunity. As stated in the report, it is unacceptable for differences in the implementation of legal provision in the Member States to result in unequal treatment for European citizens."
"Europol and police cooperation in Europe are another important tool in the fight against terrorism. Greater cooperation is called for in this regard too."
"It is also necessary to increase the number of decisions taken by a qualified majority. In addition, the Commission’s right to take the initiative and the role of the national parliaments must be strengthened, whilst providing for the involvement of this House."
"Unquestionably, the European Union has to guarantee freedom for all its citizens. The fight against terrorism will certainly guarantee that the Union becomes ever more just and free."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, in taking stock of our achievements in 2003, I think it needs to be said, Mr Vitorino, that we owe you a debt of gratitude not only for 2003, but for the whole five years."
"Given that we are discussing that today, and that we will soon be reaching the end of this parliamentary term, it is fair to say that we have achieved a great deal working together with you."
"Not only have we made demands on you as a Commissioner, you have also made demands of us as a Parliament at times."
"For that reason we can say that we have all achieved a great deal together under the existing arrangements, bearing in mind how difficult it is under those arrangements to really achieve something when you have 15 Member States with 15 different viewpoints."
"There are, of course, many problems."
"We have still not really been able to combat people-smuggling."
"We have not succeeded in stopping the Mafia-like gangs operating in this area, and that is why many victims are still dying."
"We certainly need to improve police cooperation still further."
"We need improved international measures in order to be able to deal with this problem more effectively in the countries of origin."
"But of course we also ultimately need a common immigration policy so that there are no loopholes that criminal gangs of people-smugglers can exploit."
"We cannot ignore 11 September 2001."
"Terrorism really is an enormous headache for us."
"In this area in particular we need to consider how we can take more effective action in future using Europol and Eurojust, and to consider what organisational measures need to be taken here as a matter of urgency."
"We should not, however, forget that in all these areas data protection and civil rights achievements should not be overlooked."
"On that note, Commissioner, I would like to express my real gratitude for all you have done up to now."
"Mr President, I would also like to welcome Minister McDowell to the House."
"I would like to pick up on a couple of small points, given that this is the end of the debate and many of the points I wished to raise have already been dealt with."
"Referring to Mr Evans' reference to legal migration, which I totally agree with, I am very proud and happy that Ireland is one of only two countries in Europe not to have raised barriers to the movement of workers from some of the new applicant states coming to work in our country, as many of them are already doing."
"While listening to the Commissioner and to the Minister listing the legislation that has been brought in, particularly in the area of immigration and asylum, I know both men have warm hearts, but in the description of all the legislation that was coming through, the quality of mercy seemed to be lacking in some way."
"The contribution that the visitors who have come to live amongst us have made to life in many of our countries must be recognised and celebrated."
"Indeed, Minister, when I think of this I think of my hairdresser, in your own constituency."
"The quality of service and gaiety and everything else in our little hairdresser's, where we middle-aged ladies go to have our hair done, is considerably enhanced by the young Chinese students who are working there; we all queue up to have them wash our hair."
"While that might seem trivial in the context of the many serious issues here today, it is something we must celebrate."
"It is not all a negative criminal issue; it is also a considerable contribution to the quality of life."
"Mention was made, particularly by the Commissioner, to some of the civil judicial areas that have come through in the last year, many of which contribute considerably to the quality of life of our citizens."
"My own area of particular interest is the protection of children, as well as the question under the Brussels II Convention of access to and custody of children in parental disputes."
"I know it is not done in this House very often, but I cannot but refer to the difficulties I am having with the Federal Republic of Germany in many cases, particularly relating to fathers having access to their children, who have either gone legally or illegally back to live in Germany."
"We have situations where, for example, it appears to be perfectly easy and legal for a custodial parent in Germany to change the name of the children – the children very often bearing the father's name – without any reference to the father."
"Names are being changed legally, which causes considerable distress to the fathers, who in many cases are also denied access to their children, both legally and through the social services."
"Unfortunately, despite great efforts by myself and many others, these fathers are finding it extremely difficult to gain access to their children."
"While the Commissioner thinks that this kind of legislation is not often covered by the press, I have to say that this particular issue is indeed covered by the press; it is something that people genuinely care about and there is an element of justice that has to be recognised in this."
"Commissioner, finally, could you please look into your heart and see if you could not do anything to improve our relationships with the non-Hague Convention countries, to which many children are still being abducted?"
"Mr President, this debate is close to the hearts of the citizens of Europe."
"At the Seville European Council it was stated clearly that the Union needed to make a determined effort to combat illegal immigration. An integrated and balanced approach was advocated."
"The aim was to combat this new form of exploitation of human beings, which affects women and children in particular. Day after day, these individuals appear at the Union’s borders."
"They arrive all along the southeastern flank, right down to the southernmost tip of Europe. Following the Seville Council, Parliament and the Commission have worked hard to structure and develop what should become a common policy on immigration and asylum."
"For some time now, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been emphasising the need for greater cohesion of our aid policies with the countries where these migratory flows originate and within the framework of the Union’s external activity. This would facilitate the development of more effective ways of managing such flows."
"Much more is needed, however, if the desired objectives are to be attained. It is essential to develop a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation with immigrants’ countries of origin."
"Only then can the underlying reasons for the migratory flows be dealt with. Only then will it be possible to increase and improve ways of combating poverty, which is, of course, the real reason for immigration from developing countries."
"The Union must aim to integrate joint management of migratory flows effectively into its relations with third countries. To that end, aid agreements must include a commitment by all parties to discharge their respective responsibilities in the fight against the gangs."
"On both sides of the borders, it is the gangs who profit most from exploiting human beings in this way. Their activities amount to nothing less than a new and sophisticated form of slavery."
"All action taken by the Union should also help to stimulate wealth creation. The latter is a crucial factor in the promotion of codevelopment."
"Illegal trafficking in immigrants is a new kind of slavery. It provides ample opportunity for exploitation in the workplace."
"It is also a breeding ground for corruption and an entry route for individuals who could pose a threat to security. Readmission agreements should become a new feature of the Union’s relationships with third countries."
"Finally, I should like to point out that in the course of this last year, the size of the very substantial financial flows generated by immigrants’ remittances to their home countries has been much in the limelight."
"Handling charges for such remittances are outrageous. In some cases, they amount to outright usury."
"I am aware that this is outside your competence, Commissioner, but I feel bound to say that the Commission ought to be able to put in place appropriate legal instruments to ensure easy and secure transfer of the fruits of immigrants’ labours. These funds could be used to promote codevelopment initiatives in third countries."
"They could also be used to support initiatives designed to strengthen civil society and the private sector in those countries. All this would be very much in line with the conclusions of the Monterrey Conference."
"A few steps in the right direction have indeed been taken during the past year, and I should like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his valuable input. Sadly, however, there is still a long way to go."
". Mr President, I want to thank very sincerely the Members of this House for the honour they have conferred on me in hearing me today and also for the very comprehensive and wide range of opinions that have been expressed here."
"I do not agree with every opinion, but I have listened intently to the debate and am conscious of the fact that if I were to mention all the contributors, the short time available to me for reply would be completely exhausted – that is before I even address the very important issues that many of them raised and the very important themes which recurred in the contributions."
"Firstly, in relation to the issue at the heart of a number of contributions – whether we are looking backwards or forwards – it is the Irish presidency's humble task to accomplish the outstanding agenda items as far as it can."
"It will be for Commissioner Vitorino to come to the June Council with his retrospective look at what has been achieved in the time period contemplated by the Amsterdam Treaty and to set the scene, if he will, for a Tampere II agenda, the starting process for which will be developed under the Netherlands presidency."
"For Ireland and its presidency, on the contrary, it is a matter of addressing the issues that are still outstanding on the agenda and concentrating its efforts in relation to them."
"Mention has been made of the slow progress in relation to the two major Amsterdam imperatives: the directives in relation to asylum."
"It will be a very considerable task to secure the agreement necessary to bring those two measures forward to completion."
"In relation to one of them – the Asylum Procedures Directive – I have to say that even if I have political agreement on that issue before 1 May, my successor will have to come back to the newly elected European Parliament to achieve the necessary codecision."
"Therefore, I do not want to create any unrealistic expectations as to what can be achieved."
"However, in relation to all these measures, a lot of time has elapsed, and I agree with a number of Members who express a sense of frustration that the deadlines set at Amsterdam and Tampere have not been adhered to at political level."
"There is a saying in the English language: 'you can bring a horse to water but you cannot make it drink'."
"This is one of the problems."
"You have to decide whether the political will is there."
"Are people willing to carry out the mandates that, in a burst of enthusiasm, they may adopt at a Council meeting?"
"Are they willing to do the basic political work to achieve the implementation of the agendas they have set themselves?"
"A second point about the area of freedom, security and justice is this: it is not a repressive but an uplifting agenda."
"I want to echo a number of contributions here that remind us that the fight against crime, for instance, is a positive struggle to enhance and vindicate the rights of people who would otherwise be victims of crime."
"Thus, it is not a matter of ministers of the interior or ministers for justice at JHA level combining to think up new repressive measures, but the obverse side of the coin, which is about the rights of individuals and the right to fully enjoy an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I echo what Mr Collins, Mr Beysen and others have said about the importance of practical cooperation."
"Terrorists are not afraid of a framework decision."
"Terrorists are not even afraid of some of the outworkings of decisions on terrorism, such as enhanced penalties for those who are convicted."
"The main thing the European Union can do in relation to terrorism is not at paper level, but in the area of pragmatic, concrete cooperation on a day-to-day basis between the various agencies in the Member States and the European agencies, to make sure that the scourge of terrorism does not destroy the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building."
"So we can never simply consider these matters on a legislative or paper policy basis."
"We have to look at them on a pragmatic, concrete, cooperative basis as well."
"That also has to be said in relation to Europol."
"What is needed is to make that agency function, not to consider endlessly to whom it should be accountable, so that it is the engine of cooperation among the Member States in the fight against terrorism."
"Sometimes there is a danger that we engage in the politics of the Book of Genesis: let there be light – and there is light."
"In my view that approach is appropriate in some areas where it is important to create a political agenda and to create a legal framework for certain areas of progress; but we should also be very conscious that we cannot simply legislate for security, freedom and justice."
"We must act to achieve these outcomes."
"Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Banotti mentioned practical issues to do with civil law and its application to victims of illegal trafficking for sexual purposes, and also family law areas."
"I believe that very substantial progress has been made in these areas so far, but there is a lot more to be done, particularly in relation to the protection of ordinary people's rights: the right not to be exploited sexually or, for instance, the right to have access to one's children."
"In all of those areas we have to ensure that the emerging new European Union is an area which upholds those rights, rather than an area which creates new opportunities for people to avoid those rights."
"Mr Hernández Mollar referred to the issue of terrorism and the commemoration of the victims of terrorism."
"His is a view with which I personally very much sympathise."
"Sometimes we see terrorism purely as a newspaper story, but we must concentrate on upholding the rights of victims and acknowledging the terrible damage that terrorism does."
"I would also like to deal with the migration issue."
"It is fashionable to say that the Justice and Home Affairs Council concentrates on combating illegal immigration and that there is not sufficient emphasis on legal migration and its implications, such as integration and the like."
"I should like to echo the sentiments expressed by Mrs Banotti, which I believe are shared by many people here, that migration – inward migration into the European Union – is not merely inevitable, but desirable."
"Europe needs to be enriched culturally, economically and socially by the possibilities of migration."
"Migration should not be regarded as negative, something to be controlled or discouraged."
"Migration is undoubtedly a phenomenon of the globalised world in which we live."
"Societies that can deal with migration positively and without fear are societies that are, as a consequence, much richer and more just internally."
"There are two outstanding opinions which, for the purposes of getting through our presidency agenda, we look forward to receiving from Parliament."
"I mentioned this in committee last month."
"I should like to emphasise again that I would ask Parliament for its cooperation in this respect."
"As regards the whole issue of the IGC, it is the role of the Irish presidency to attempt to consult, reflect and report to the March Council meeting on possible progress on the IGC."
"I believe that whether such progress is made quickly or slowly, it is a very important task for the Irish presidency to make as much progress as possible in bringing together the Member States behind the drive to implement a new constitutional treaty for the European Union."
"In relation to one aspect of that treaty, many Members have spoken about the need for transparency."
"There has been an undercurrent of concern in this morning's debate about the lack of transparency and a sense of the lack of consultation with and exclusion of Parliament in the Justice and Home Affairs area."
"I have already mentioned the level of consultation that exists at the moment."
"One of the difficulties of getting 15 – shortly to be 25 – Member States to agree on proposals lies in the need to have some elbow room, to negotiate with them and for them to express their positions on paper."
"I ask Parliament to at least understand that all the working papers – some of which reflect the shifting positions of Member States – could, on the one hand, be thrown open to public scrutiny; but on the other hand, the character of those papers would probably be altered if they were to be the subject of constant scrutiny."
"The flexibility and the willingness of Member States to make concessions, once they had established a position on paper, could be significantly impaired if every single action in the deliberative process was to be thrown open to the widest possible scrutiny."
"So I ask Members of this House to understand that there is a balance to be struck between accountability and efficiency in a deliberative process involving 25 Member States."
"I want to thank each and every Member for the very constructive and stimulating debate."
"I know that both the presidency and the Commission intend to take on board all of the contributions that have been made here."
"I thank Parliament for its courtesy in hearing me today."
"Mr President, I had asked to take the floor before Mr McDowell spoke on the Council’s behalf, as I would like to ask him to clarify his position with regard to a prominent subject in today’s debate, namely the idea that the next parliamentary term should also be opened with a Tampere II, and, accordingly, with a reaction, a counterbalance on the part of the Council."
"I gather from his response that he is also in favour of this suggestion, to which the Commissioner immediately agreed."
"I agree with the presidency that the Irish Presidency’s priority until the end of this parliamentary term is to resolve as many outstanding issues as possible."
"I endorse and support this clear priority, but it would also be valuable if the presidency and the Council could give a clear signal to the next presidency, namely the Luxembourg Presidency, that Tampere II is in a position to go ahead."
"I should therefore be interested to know, as far as possible, what Mr McDowell’s exact thoughts are on the matter."
". Mr President, that represents my view entirely."
"The Tampere II agenda must be set in progress."
"I would love to be in a position to apply my mind to that process, but unfortunately the amount of work I have to do in closing out items is huge."
"I wish the Netherlands and the Luxembourg presidencies every good luck and good fortune in establishing a new forward-looking perspective, to create a new and challenging agenda under the broad rubric of Tampere II."
". Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, once again, and all those who have participated in this debate."
"When we discuss asylum and migration on behalf of the Commission, I would like to stress that all our proposals were totally in line with the goals decided upon by the heads of state and government in Tampere."
"It is extremely unfair and pure demagogy to say that the approach of the Commission to this policy area is lax."
"It is not at all."
"All the instruments on the table try to strike the right balance between proactive and positive actions towards migrants and asylum-seekers on the one hand, and on the other hand, guaranteeing the security of the borders and adequate management of migratory flows."
"The Commission has tried to achieve this balance through a very broad set of proposals."
"I recognise before the House that in some cases the degree of the Commission's ambition has not been matched by the Council."
"This is, as you all know much better than I, the normal way of building Europe: a step-by-step approach and an incremental approach."
"If you compare the legally-binding – and that is a very appropriate word – in this area today with the of five years ago, you have to recognise that there has been enormous progress and we should not be self-defeating."
"We should be proactive and voluntarist and try to mobilise citizens to do even more and better in the near future."
"In the field of civil liberties, there is permanent tension between the guarantee of fundamental rights and the guarantee of security."
"It is not a given; it is something that you need to find in each decision taken every day."
"I believe, to be frank, that when we integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the new constitutional treaty, when we discuss procedural guarantees, when we include some procedural guarantees in the framework decisions on approximation of criminal sanctions, we are trying to find the right balance between freedom and security."
"Mr Santini reminded us that one of the greatest achievements of this legislature – I hope it will be possible to conclude the process before the end of the term of this Parliament – is the new legislation on the freedom of movement of our own citizens."
"I remind you of the fact that when we talk about reinforcing our external border security and guaranteeing our internal security, we do it, not in a repressive way, but in the name of freedom."
"It is to preserve the freedom of movement and the abolition of our internal borders that we need to reinforce the security of our external borders."
"It is in the name of freedom that we say we should be more efficient in integrating legal migrants."
"For that purpose, we need to guarantee to our own public that we have the situation under control."
"I cannot give you a different speech, because this is the one I have been making since the very beginning."
"May I invite you to re-read the Commission's communication of November 2000 about immigration policy and compare it with the speech that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan made two weeks ago before Parliament."
"I am sorry if this looks a little presumptuous on my part, but please make the comparison and then we will talk about it."
"My third remark is about data protection."
"To be frank with you, when we talk about introducing biometrics in some travel documents, we need to be very careful in guaranteeing that we are proportionate in the kind of data that we choose, in the types of data storage systems and in the types of control and supervision carried out by the necessary authorities."
"My argument is to draw your attention to the fact that today data protection in the third pillar is under the full authority and responsibility of Member States."
"We are trying to create a level playing field at European level to guarantee that in all 25 Member States there will be the same pattern of protection of personal data when it comes to law enforcement."
"For this purpose, the existing directives based on the first pillar are not sufficient."
"I hope that I will have the possibility to introduce these proposals by June this year and to present them to you."
"My last remark is about the budget."
"I thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mr Coelho for drawing attention to the fact that in order to fulfil our ambitious goals, we need to have the necessary financial tools."
"As you will see in the proposals that the Commission presented yesterday for the new financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the area of freedom, security and justice has been given the adequate financial tools to address our ambitious goals."
"When it comes to Tampere II I endorse what Mr McDowell has just said."
"I hope that during the Netherlands' presidency it will be possible to have a Tampere II European Council."
"What will be the suggestions for that Tampere II?"
"I shall highlight three main issues: first, being fair in assessing the shortcomings and the unfinished business of Tampere I – there will be the heritage from Tampere I that should be taken on board in Tampere II; second, clear objectives are set out in the constitutional treaty – Tampere II should closely follow the agenda that was defined in that treaty; and last but not least, Tampere II should focus more adequately on the quality of the transposition of European legislation in this area at national level, and on monitoring concrete implementation of the in the 25 Member States."
"I look forward to the debate on this subject that has been suggested by Mr Hernández Mollar, and the Commission will come forward with its own ideas in a new communication in June 2004."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in the March II part-session."
"The next item is the joint debate on the oral questions by the PSE, Verts/ALE, ELDR and GUE/NGL political groups, to the Council (B5 0008/2004) and to the Commission (B5 0013/2004), on nuclear disarmament: Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 2005 – EU work for the third NPT preparatory committee (New York, 26 April to 7 May 2004)."
". Mr President, we have asked for this debate because preparations will shortly be underway for a new discussion round within the framework of the UN about the future of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the agreement that is opposed to nuclear proliferation."
"We are pleased that, over the past few months, it has been decided to issue another separate resolution on this subject, on which a vote will be taken during the next plenary sitting."
"We believe it to be important that the European Union should play a significant role, as it has done before, and to take the lead in the discussion on weapons of mass destruction and particularly on the spread of nuclear weapons and the risks with which we have been faced lately. The subject is very topical in the light of everything that is going on with regard to Iraq, Iran, North Korea and, in the past few weeks, Pakistan with the so-called Khan affair."
"As I have already stated, a consultation will also be held at the end of April about the workings of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"To us Social Democrats, there are guiding principles that apply in respect of that discussion: we are in favour of a multilateral approach because there are no unilateral solutions to the problems that face us."
"The recognised nuclear weapons powers, as we call them, should set the right example, and we continue to set great store by a total ban on nuclear trials."
"In addition, we should like to urge those who consider developing new nuclear weapons, the so-called smart nuclear weapons, to discontinue this development."
"It is right that attention should be paid to what we refer to as the welfare states, and I should like to stress in this respect that we are very much in favour of the approach which the EU recently adopted in terms of Iran, namely to persuade the country to adhere to the agreements and inspections of the Atomic Agency by means of economic, political and diplomatic pressure."
"At the same time – and we would appreciate reactions from the Council and Commission on this – when the Non-Proliferation Treaty is being reviewed and assessed, thought should be given to ways of improving the inspection and sanctions arrangement."
"After all, that is the route by means of which we should be able to improve the world situation."
"Attention should also be paid to the possible harmful role of nuclear weapons states that are not recognised but are left alone in terms of the proliferation of expertise and equipment."
"I already mentioned the Khan affair very briefly."
"I should like to have a response to that as well."
"What have the EU countries done so far in order to avoid practices of this kind?"
"The risks appear to be increasing, even in the former Soviet Union."
"Initiatives that have been taken have come off the ground only partly, and I would appreciate reactions from the Council and Commission on that score too."
"Are we simply waiting until something goes wrong, or are we really trying to prevent this?"
"One final question: needless to say, there has been an interesting development in the Middle East, also recently by the opening in respect of Libya."
"We are actually able to conclude that Iran is now more or less adhering to the agreements of the NPT."
"Libya is abandoning its nuclear weapons programme."
"Iraq appeared not to have them."
"Is it not time to look at whether we can start a discussion about a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East?"
"Mr President, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is an agreement by 189 nations to eliminate nuclear weapons."
"However, 34 years after it entered into force, we are in a situation where the United States is willing to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes, where the UK refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in Iraq, where research and development and the testing of nuclear weapons continue, where nuclear weapons are still considered a vital part of Nato defence planning, where new generations of battlefield nuclear weapons are developed and where the nuclearisation of space is well under way."
"In the last review conference in 2000 the 13-step plan was agreed as a way of implementing the NPT and it renewed the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear states to eliminate their weapons."
"The PrepCom in New York is the last chance to implement this programme before the next review conference in 2005."
"Unless we take a strong stand now, the NPT is in danger of becoming meaningless – full of good intentions, but resulting in little political action."
"The European Union has a duty to take a leading role in this and to ensure that real action is taken."
"Nuclear weapons make the world more insecure and dangerous."
"The International Court of Justice ruled in 1996 that their use, or even their threatened use, was unlawful, which makes the strengthening of the NPT all the more urgent."
"We are talking here about real, existing weapons of mass destruction and destroying them in the most effective way by enforcing international agreements."
"We are asking the presidency, the Council and the Commission what exactly is being done in preparation for the PrepCom in New York."
"What progress has been made, for example, on the 13 practical steps and on nuclear-free zones?"
"My country, Wales, declared itself nuclear-free in 1982."
"What is being done to support the pioneering work of the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in mobilising cities throughout the world to work for the total abolition of nuclear weapons?"
"This must be the goal of all of us."
". Mr President, it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the presidency, to respond to the question that has been asked."
"The European Union is committed to the multilateral treaty system, which provides the legal and normative basis for all non-proliferation efforts."
"On 12 December 2003 the European Council adopted an EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"The strategy incorporates and bases itself on the texts adopted by the European Council at Thessaloniki in June 2003."
"The WMD strategy underlines the EU’s particular commitment to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – NPT."
"The EU believes that all our efforts should be aimed at preserving and strengthening this fundamental instrument of international peace and security."
"The EU supports wholeheartedly the objectives laid down in the Treaty and is committed to the effective implementation of the final document of the 2000 NPT review conference and the decisions and resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference."
"The EU has repeatedly stated that the Non-Proliferation Treaty is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament under Article VI of the Treaty."
"The EU statement to last year’s second preparatory committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the NPT, recalled that Member States continue to attach great importance to achieving the universality of, and universal compliance with, the NPT."
"In this regard we welcome the accession to the Treaty by Cuba, in 2002, and by Timor Leste in 2003, which brings it closer to universality."
"However, there are three countries – India, Israel and Pakistan – that remain outside the regime and we continue to call upon them to accede unconditionally to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states."
"On 17 November 2003 the Council adopted a common position on the universalisation and reinforcement of multilateral agreements in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery."
"Article 4 of the common position confirms that achieving universal adherence to the NPT is of crucial importance."
"To this end, the European Union will firstly call on those States not yet parties to the NPT to accede unconditionally to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon states and to place all their nuclear facilities and activities under the provisions of the IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards System."
"Secondly, it will urge those states not yet having entered into safeguards agreements with the IAEA to fulfil their obligations in accordance with Article III of the NPT and to conclude such agreements as a matter of urgency."
"Thirdly, it will promote all the objectives laid down in the NPT."
"Fourthly, it will support the final document of the 2000 NPT review conference and the decisions and resolution adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference."
"Fifthly, it will promote further consideration of security assurances."
"Finally, it will promote measures to ensure that any possible misuse of civilian nuclear programmes for military purposes will be effectively excluded."
"There is no common Council analysis of the progress on the implementation of the 13 steps."
"The European Union is however committed to encouraging the progress made towards systematic and progressive efforts towards disarmament."
"The European Union will continue to encourage all efforts to implement Article VI of the NPT, as well as paragraphs 3 and 4c of the 1995 Declaration on 'Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament' and the practical steps agreed in the 2000 final document."
"The EU’s commitment to the comprehensive test ban treaty is also clear and was reiterated most recently by the EU common position on the universalisation of multilateral instruments adopted in November 2003."
"The EU will continue to promote the early entry into force of the CTBT."
"Pending its entry into force, we urge all states with nuclear capacity to abide by a moratorium on nuclear test explosions or any other nuclear explosions and refrain from any actions which are contrary to the CTBT."
"The EU has acknowledged the importance of nuclear-weapon-free zones, established on the basis of arrangements freely achieved among the member states of the regions concerned."
"They enhance global and regional peace and security."
"We welcome and support both signature and ratification by the nuclear weapon states of the relevant protocols of nuclear-weapon-free zones."
"On the question of verification and safeguards, the EU believes that the safeguards serve as a technical tool in support of the political goal of sustaining an environment in which there can be peaceful use of nuclear energy without the threat of proliferation."
"In this connection we strongly support the verification role of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"The Union also takes the view that adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguard agreements, and additional protocols to them, is a prerequisite in the effective and credible safeguards system."
"The EU also continues to attach great importance to the fight against terrorism and strongly supports all measures that are aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear, biological and chemical weapons."
"The WMD strategy emphasises the EU’s commitment to strengthening export control policies and practices within its borders and beyond, in coordination with partners."
"The EU will work towards improving the existing export control mechanisms."
"It will advocate adherence to effective export control criteria by countries outside the existing regime and arrangements including in the nuclear field."
"As regards the proliferation security initiative, the Council has not adopted a position on this issue."
"Not all Member States participate in the PSI."
"The question of the International Mayors’ Campaign has not been considered by the Council."
"The third preparatory committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which will be held from 26 April to 7 May 2004, will be a pivotal event in terms of disarmament and non-proliferation in 2004."
"As presidency, we will work within the Union and with key partners, to seek agreement on a solid basis for the successful outcome of the review cycle."
"This work will take place in the first instance within the Working Group on Non-Proliferation and in its troika meetings with third countries."
"The work will include the preparation of EU common statements on various aspects of the Treaty for delivery by the presidency at the preparatory committee."
"The presidency will inform the European Parliament on the progress achieved in this field in accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union."
". I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate today although, inevitably, I will traverse some of the ground that has been so ably covered by the presidency."
"Recent revelations on the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea have highlighted the importance of maintaining and strengthening effective controls."
"It is a matter of historic record that the clandestine acquisition of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan in the 1990s and the consequent impact on regional stability gave rise to grave concern."
"North Korea’s withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year was a further dangerous and destabilising step, both for the immediate region and the international community as a whole."
"The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – NPT – which entered into force in 1970, established the international nuclear non-proliferation regime as we know it."
"This regime established the basic norms for behaviour."
"It provides – as the House will know – a legal ban on nuclear proliferation beyond the five nuclear weapons states recognised by the Treaty and makes nuclear proliferation activity illegal in the international community."
"With it came the principle of regulated nuclear trade, the concept of nuclear safeguards and, of course, the International Atomic Energy Authority, whose excellent work underpins the regime."
"Understandably, much of the focus has been on the regime’s failures, but we often underestimate the success."
"In a 1960 presidential debate, John F. Kennedy envisaged a world with perhaps 20 nations with a nuclear capability."
"That his vision was never realised has been due, in large part, to the creation of the NPT."
"South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan and South Korea, for example, have all turned their backs on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, partly because of international pressure, but also as a result of sensible and wise decisions taken in response to domestic debate and opinion."
"We also have positive recent developments with Iran, which has now accepted the Additional Protocol, and Libya."
"Against this background, while recognising the challenges that the NPT faces, particularly on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, we believe the forthcoming third preparatory committee can be approached with some confidence."
"There may well be shortcomings in the non-proliferation regime but they are certainly not terminal and they can, in our judgment, be addressed."
"We must continue to pursue the universal adoption of the NPT by countries that have so far refused to do so, and in particular India, Pakistan and Israel."
"North Korea must return to conformity with the Treaty."
"We must also extend the ratification of the important Additional Protocol to the Treaty."
"This Protocol provides the IAEA with enhanced and tougher powers to perform inspections."
"In this context, the Commission's role is first in assisting the presidency, which sees progress in this area as a high priority, and second in encouraging the maximum degree of EU coordination."
"The last 12 months have seen the EU take enormous strides in strengthening its approach to non-proliferation."
"The European security strategy that was adopted at the December 2003 European Council identifies weapons of mass destruction as one of the most dangerous threats to today’s Europe."
"At the same European Council, the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was approved."
"This strategy is now being followed up by concrete action."
"Work on implementation of the strategy is proceeding in a large number of areas which are too numerous to set out today, but I will highlight a number of important examples."
"The first was last November’s adoption by the General Affairs and External Relations Council of a text aimed at mainstreaming non-proliferation policies into the European Union’s wider relations with third countries, among other things, by introducing a non-proliferation clause in agreements with them."
"This new commitment on non-proliferation is important, because the new EU strategy aims to include provisions on non-proliferation in all agreements with third countries."
"This is now part of ongoing negotiations, for example with Syria, placing non-proliferation on a similar level to human rights and the fight against terrorism."
"The EU Joint Action for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in Russia was established by the Council in 1999 to enhance cooperation with the Russian Federation in the latter’s pursuit of a safe, secure and environmentally sound dismantlement, destruction or conversion of those WMD infrastructures, equipment and materials."
"The projects support chemical destruction and the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium."
"These projects, which are implemented by the Commission in close cooperation with a number of Member States, are a small but important part of the Community’s EUR 1 billion contribution to the G8 Global Partnership, launched at the meeting in 2002 in Canada."
"The Interparliamentary Conference hosted by the Commission under the Non-proliferation and Disarmament Cooperation Initiative on 20 and 21 November 2003, which took place here in Strasbourg, highlighted the considerable future challenges ahead if we are to safely dispose of the dangerous remains of Cold War WMD programmes."
"The conference’s significance was confirmed through its status as an interparliamentary gathering of figures from key national parliaments, including the United States Congress and the Russian Duma."
"For the WMD threat to be removed it must become and remain a high priority issue for national governments, regional organisations and the international community as a whole."
"From a Community perspective, we are grateful for the increased attention given by the European Parliament to the need to adequately fund threat-reduction activities in the next budget cycle."
"The Commission, in cooperation with the European Parliament, is seeking to define future non-proliferation priorities and, thanks to a recent decision by Parliament, will be able shortly to launch a pilot project to further this work."
"I am grateful for the opportunity to have taken part in this short but important debate on a matter of such international significance."
"Mr President, the NPT is not only a non-proliferation treaty."
"It is also the only binding international agreement for nuclear disarmament."
"Non-nuclear powers undertake not to acquire nuclear weapons, and the nuclear powers promise to get rid of their existing ones."
"These commitments may be found in Article 6 of the Treaty, under which the parties undertake to conduct serious negotiations with a view to getting rid of all nuclear weapons."
"This undertaking has been signed by all the nuclear powers."
"At the previous quinquennial meeting, the nuclear states undertook totally to abolish their nuclear arsenals."
"Above all, a unanimous decision was taken concerning a 13-point action programme for implementing complete nuclear disarmament."
"What the EU must do at the forthcoming meeting is, of course, to demand that these commitments be met."
"Ireland has for a long time played an active role in the work for nuclear disarmament, for example in conjunction with my own country, Sweden."
"Will the Council demand, then, that these commitments be complied with?"
"The nuclear powers have certainly reduced their strategic nuclear arsenals."
"The United States has instead developed what are termed mini nuclear weapons, intended to be used directly in war, together with nuclear weapons known as bunker buster weapons that penetrate thick rock."
"These developments undoubtedly breach Article 6 of the NPT Treaty."
"Moreover, the United States has revised its nuclear weapons policy so as to be able to use its nuclear weapons, and not only in war but also for so-called preventive purposes."
"This amounts to a serious breach of international law."
"To engage in war for preventive reasons is a breach of the UN Charter and a return to the law of the jungle, that is to say the right of the strong, applicable before the advent of the United Nations, to intervene for their own purposes."
"It is naturally important for the European Parliament to demand in its resolution that the parties that have signed the NPT should fulfil their commitments."
"They must embark upon serious nuclear disarmament and call a halt to any development of new nuclear weapons."
"In what way will the Commission and the Council give impetus to these demands at the next NPT meeting?"
"– Mr President, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr El Baradei, recently stated that the risk of a nuclear conflict has never been greater than today."
"While Iraq was brought under control, the rest of the world changed into a kind of supermarket of private proliferation, a supermarket in which all countries and, possibly, even terrorists with nuclear ambitions, can seize their chances."
"Despite recent successes with regard to Libya and Iran, there is little cause for optimism."
"The US, Russia and France have all made a start on preparing a new generation of nuclear weapons."
"As tension mounts between it and the US, Saudi Arabia is now also choosing the nuclear option."
"For years, the father of Pakistan’s atomic bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who was trained in Europe, passed on nuclear information to dictators and possibly even terrorists."
"On account of this combination of commercially-minded nuclear experts, immoral businesses and state-owned institutions, the threshold for a nuclear war of destruction has been lowered."
"Today, everyone is agreed that the monitoring system must be updated and tightened up."
"The capacity of the International Atomic Energy Agency must, as a matter of urgency, be reinforced if effective control is to be made possible, but the European Union should have the courage to take political, diplomatic and economic action against countries that ignore, or evade, monitoring in the field of nuclear proliferation."
"Not only do we have to tighten up where monitoring is concerned, we must also be prepared to enforce it collectively."
"I therefore welcome the Council's and Commission's pledge to commit to the further, full implementation of the NPT and to work for ambitious results during the next Prepcom and the Review Conference in 2005."
"Mr President, firstly, we hear a debate in the House concerning an area of freedom, security and justice, and then we hear two vital speeches by Mr Patten and the Irish Presidency."
"We should be pleased and encouraged, but the truth is that things are, in actual fact, heading in all but the wrong direction when it comes to nuclear disarmament and the possibility of obtaining such an area of freedom, security and justice."
"One of the reasons why things are heading in the wrong direction is that there is an unwillingness to comply not just with the words, but also with the spirit, of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"I am thinking, in particular, of Article 6, concerning the abolition of nuclear weapons."
"At the most recent meeting, in the year 2000, it was decided to set up a special committee to deal with nuclear disarmament."
"Since then, nothing has happened."
"If nothing is happening, it is because those countries that should be putting their energy and resources into this issue either do not wish, or are unable, to do so."
"For the moment, it is clear that we cannot expect support from the Americans in this matter."
"They are in the throes of doing almost the opposite of what they have committed themselves to doing."
"They have also emphasised that they do not intend to comply with either the letter or the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. By introducing what are termed mininukes, they have, rather, reduced the nuclear threshold instead of doing what they have, in principle, undertaken to do."
"The EU countries are not much better."
"Instead of making this issue a firmly established part of the transatlantic dialogue, we are rather cautious and obliging."
"We get slightly involved in a war in Iraq and do our bit in a number of other US actions, in Afghanistan etc, without pointing out that, if this problem is not taken seriously and solved, all our talk of areas of freedom, security and justice may at most be used to lull people to sleep with. It cannot in any case be used to create the world we all want to see."
"Surrounded by flames, there is no living in freedom, security and justice, so I should like to see a little more energy behind the very fine words."
"It is always entertaining to hear Mr Patten produce fine words, but I am looking for a little more energy."
"Mr President, the Third Non-Proliferation Treaty PrepCom in New York in a few months' time has to be a success."
"To that end, it is essential that Ireland, as the holder of the presidency, ensures that Member States adopt a common position that will become part of its commitment to the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted in Thessaloniki, because these are the weapons of mass destruction."
"Ireland, as one of the instigators of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, has a major role to play here."
"We would like to know, in relation to the Council Working Group on Nuclear Weapons, what the priorities are for the NPT PrepCom meeting."
"Parliament needs to know which Member States are being cooperative and which are not."
"The Council should prepare regular progress reports on this issue for Parliament, in particular on the issues of the dismantling of nuclear weapons arsenals, nuclear weapon-free zones and the no first-strike option."
"This is in the public interest."
"We need to know how far EU Member States have implemented the action programme of the 13 practical steps agreed in 2002 at the NPT Review Conference."
"It is also very important that the Irish presidency takes a proactive role to ensure that Europe becomes a nuclear-free zone, that the UK and France get rid of their nuclear arsenals and that Nato's first-strike policy is abolished."
"The Council has to prepare a statement on the progress made by the EU since the report in 1995 by this Parliament on the NPT and, indeed, the many resolutions since then."
"I would like to see a proactive position from the Irish presidency, informing this Parliament about what is happening within the Council."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when I listen to you both speaking on behalf of the Council and Commission, I should be reassured, but I am not, because we have been living, ever since Hiroshima, under the threat of an atomic war, and this threat is increasing rather than decreasing."
"We should stop paying lip service to non-proliferation and monitoring."
"Indeed, hypocrisy is quite clearly spreading in this case; after all, since the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the number of countries with nuclear material has risen continually."
"It appears that this has happened with the help of countries of our own Union which have never been punished and never been called to account."
"How did Israel manage to develop an atom bomb?"
"First with the help of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany; everyone has helped create this bomb, and we are now complaining that Israel remains outside of the zone because, of course, the United States does not want to force that country to accept non-proliferation."
"As a result, the Arabs are also continually itching to get hold of nuclear weapons."
"We notice that all the monitoring that is in place was unable to prevent Mr Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb, from doing his own thing, and getting away with it, for thirty years."
"Meanwhile, the material has increasingly become more readily available or available on the black market."
"Over the course of five years, one and a half kilos of fission material has disappeared from Georgia."
"The implosion of the Soviet Union has thrown open a market, a black market, in nuclear material."
"I hope that you will vote for enforceable measures and will take a stand against fine statements that send our people to sleep, because they are wide awake."
"Mr President, I do not share the optimism of either the Council or the Commission on this."
"The fact that two Member States of the European Union possess nuclear weapons undermines the moral authority of the whole of the EU when it comes to the debate on weapons of mass destruction."
"The overwhelming hypocrisy of the British and American governments in demanding the disarmament of others, while simultaneously upgrading their own nuclear capacity, is clear for all to see."
"This is an untenable, hypocritical and very destabilising position."
"We have heard a lot about international law recently, so let me remind Britain and France that, according to the ICJ at The Hague, nuclear weapons are immoral and illegal."
"According to commitments made at the Sixth NPT Review Conference, all nuclear states made an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament."
"That was four years ago, and very little progress has been made since."
"Britain and France should lead by example and unilaterally dismantle their nuclear warheads."
"There should be immediate removal of US nuclear weapons from European soil."
"These are undoubtedly ambitious aims, but if we are serious about the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, this the route we have to take."
"– The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 26 February 2004 in Brussels."
"I would like to greet a delegation of 15 members of the upper and lower houses of parliaments in Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) seated in the gallery."
"The delegation is headed by Mr Alfredo Atanasof, a Member of the Argentinian Parliament and Chairman of the Mercosur Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"Our guests are here to participate in the Sixth Interparliamentary Conference of the European Parliament and the Mercosur Joint Parliamentary Committee. The conference takes place today and tomorrow in Strasbourg."
"As you know, the European Union and Mercosur are negotiating an agreement on economic collaboration, political coordination and cooperation."
"It is my great pleasure to welcome this delegation and wish the Interparliamentary Conference every success."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must also inform you that the debate on the Council declaration concerning the position of the European Union on the hearing in the International Court of Justice on the Israeli wall will be delayed until 3 p.m. so that we can proceed to the votes in the next few minutes."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, the amendment provides for the words ‘adequately qualified’ to be inserted before the word ‘professionals’."
". – Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to table an oral amendment to paragraph 12. The amendment reads as follows in English:"
"'Calls for the revision, with a view to the phasing-out, as soon as possible, of the individual opt-out proved for in Article 18(1)(b) of Directive 93/104/EC; in the meantime, calls on the Commission to identify practical ways of tackling potential or actual abuses of the opt-out provision, including seeking views on how best to strengthen the voluntary nature of the opt-out.'"
"Mr President, some groups also wish to divide up this oral amendment."
"The first part would finish at ‘Directive 93/104/EC’ and the second part would then begin with ‘in the meantime’ and continue to the end."
"Mr President, I, on behalf of the ELDR Group, and the PPE-DE Group jointly tabled an amendment."
"Is it in order that PPE-DE Group can do a complete U-turn and table an oral amendment that is the opposite of its original amendment?"
"At the same time, the Group seems to be are disagreeing completely with its Conservative colleagues – and the shadow rapporteur was a Conservative."
"What state has my amendment …"
"Excuse me, I am sorry to interrupt you."
"We will not have the debate again, but you have a good procedural question."
"I will deal with it."
"If 32 Members object to the oral amendment, it falls."
"Should the oral amendment not be taken after the vote on the amendment, because they are amending the paragraph, rather than the amendment I tabled?"
"If we vote on the oral amendment, the revised Amendment No 15 will fall, because it is incorporated in the oral amendment."
"Now we come to the procedural question."
"Are there any objections to the oral amendment?"
"Mr President, surely, as it aims to delete the text, Amendment No 26S should be taken before you take the oral amendment?"
"The answer to your question is that unless 32 Members object, we will proceed with the oral amendment, which represents a compromise between the political groups."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, I am pleased to announce the presence in the gallery of a delegation of regional representatives from the Lombardia, including my daughter Elisabetta Fatuzzo who, knowing that I was due to speak on the report on agricultural incomes within the European Union, pointed out to me that once there were fruit trees that produced apples, pears, cherries, beautifully sweet cherries, and there were wheat fields and vegetables."
"When will we again have the pleasure of harvesting this produce near our homes like we used to?"
"When will we again be able, like Adam, to receive apples plucked by Eve directly from the tree?"
"Thank you Mr Fatuzzo."
"We welcome your group of visitors from Lombardia, and your daughter, Elisabetta."
". – In the Garot report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union, the European Parliament is by implication beginning to complain about the future consequences of the Fischler reform, even though it agreed to it itself."
"It was in fact Parliament which, in order to please the Commission, assented to plunging agriculture into the world market, decoupling aid from production and aligning product prices downwards."
"Reading the Garot report, it is hard to believe that."
"The Parliament is now realising that preserving farmers’ incomes and maintaining the presence of a healthy agriculture in all the countries of Europe require remunerative prices based on production costs and adequate external protection (paragraph 12)."
"We were more consistent when we rejected the Fischler reform, proposing at the ‘rebuilding an agricultural policy in Europe’ colloquium an agricultural model that was internally less subject to public intervention schemes, which, without export subsidies, was protected from the outside, so that remunerative domestic prices compatible with a sustainable management of nature would be set spontaneously."
"That is the only way to really safeguard Europe’s agricultural future."
". This report rightly denounces certain aspects of this CAP which has served primarily to feed the profits of the big capitalistic farmers and large-scale distributors."
"The rapporteur says he wants to distance himself from that policy and protect farmers, especially small farmers, in every region of the European Union, even the most remote."
"We are not against the smallest of them being protected, and that is the only reason why we did not vote against this report."
"We are, on the other hand, totally against subsidies or aid for agriculture’s capitalists."
"We are also against the protectionist aspects of the policy advocated by this report because protectionism is a direct attack on the incomes of many farmers in third countries, including poor countries, and because it is harmful to consumers."
"We therefore abstained."
". – I voted in favour of Mr Garot’s excellent report and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his work on European agriculture."
"Mr Garot has managed to strike a good balance between those who would like to disengage Europe from agriculture in favour of the world market and those who consider the European budget a ‘milch cow’ making the richest farmers even richer."
". – A sound argument in favour of maintaining European agricultural subsidies is that they enable small farmers to survive falls in their products’ prices and to contribute to preserving a viable countryside."
"This argument is cancelled out if tax money is misused to line the pockets of rich farmers and agricultural multinationals."
"A recent study by the development organisation Oxfam shows that EU agricultural subsidies in Great Britain mainly benefit large landowners."
"For example, it is estimated that the richest of them, the Duke of Westminster, receives some GBP 38 per hour in agricultural subsidies."
"Even the rapporteur, Mr Garot, who, as a Social Democrat, unfortunately considers the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon, now observes that something is amiss where agricultural subsidies are concerned."
"Between 1995 and 2002, agricultural incomes rose by 7%, but at the same time, the number of farms fell by 15.7%."
"The remaining farms increased in size and became more intensive."
"Agricultural support is being distributed unevenly: 20% of the farms receive 73% of the direct support for 59% of the acreage and only 25% of the jobs."
"The rapporteur is, above all, anxious about farms that produce little but do receive support."
"I would be more in favour of a ceiling, a maximum limit of support for each farm."
"Without such a measure, the agricultural funds would become a source of useless bureaucracy and an unjust form of redistribution."
". – I abstained during the vote on Mr Garot's report, despite the fact that it backs development and reform in the direction of agricultural policy with decoupled premiums and strengthened rural policy."
"The report does not, however, take sufficient account of the restrictions that govern the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"Even the financial leeway available impacts on the policy to be adopted."
"I should particularly like to draw your attention to paragraph 25, in which cofinancing for agricultural and rural policy is rejected."
"In my view, compulsory cofinancing is precisely one of the key instruments that can help adopt a common agricultural policy in the future."
". This report focuses on the current crisis in agricultural incomes in a number of Member States."
"The crucial issue here is the extent to which the common agricultural policy is fulfilling the aims established by the Treaty in terms of ensuring a decent standard of living for farmers and inhabitants of rural areas."
"While overall agricultural income increased by 7% between 1995 and 2002, this result was obtained at the cost of an 18% reduction in the number of farms."
"We have seen the social costs of this phenomenon for Portuguese farmers, who have been forced to abandon or to modify the activities that they have always carried out."
"The truth of the matter is that in comparison with other sectors of the economy, agriculture has been lagging behind."
"The overall figures also hide major disparities, such as the fact that 20% of farms receive 73% of CAP aid."
"These farms only account for 59% of the land and 25% of jobs in the sector."
"The situation is politically and socially unacceptable and explains the behaviour of some Member States wishing to maintain their privileges under the CAP."
"By voting in favour, we endorse the wording in the report of the recommendations with regard to the recently strengthened pillar of rural development of the CAP, promoted ..."
". Within the framework of the CAP, the number of farms fell sharply – by 15.7% – between 1995 and 2002, which led to a rise in agricultural incomes across the whole of the EU."
"This rise was in fact due both to this reduction in the number of farms and to the increase in farm size."
"Pluriactivity and diversification have also helped to maintain agricultural incomes."
"Examination of the reality of rural life in Member States, however, reveals, in many cases, that farmers are dependent either on public aid or on the fluctuations of prices and markets, leading to a feeling of insecurity, and, in turn, to low levels of investment in modernisation and in crop diversification."
"Farms are becoming increasingly concentrated, and, unless this trend is combated, it will result in the depopulation of the countryside, thereby endangering all of the external factors supported by the countryside, not all of which are quantifiable."
"The aims of ‘competitiveness’ and ‘multifunctionality’ must be made compatible, thereby ensuring a minimum level of security for those involved in farming, as well as confidence in a fair standard of living and in the stability of income. The outcome of this would be viable Community agriculture that is capable of supporting the highest possible number of farms and jobs throughout the EU."
"I voted in favour."
". – I voted in favour of the Garot report in recognition of the merits of an initiative which for once has enabled us to debate one of the fundamental questions affecting the preservation of our agricultural model: our farmers’ incomes."
"This debate has enabled us to break with the fragmentary and technical approaches normally forced on us when examining the flood of legislative proposals emanating from the Commission."
"I also wanted to mark my full agreement with the review of the fundamental aims of the CAP, the relevance of which the report reaffirms: ‘to promote a territorial approach to agriculture capable of preserving as many farms and jobs as possible throughout the EU’ and ‘to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and stabilise incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the European Union’."
"I can only express my amazement, however, at the contradictory reasoning which, on the one hand, always approves the Commission’s proposals, be they for decoupling or for lowering external protection, while on the other denouncing the risks of total adulteration of the European agricultural model that those same proposals entail."
"My approval therefore clearly does not apply to the references to decoupling and to rural development contained in the Garot report."
"With this report we are still in the field of agriculture."
"So, I should like agricultural research to make progress, progress, progress to the point where a wine can be produced from grapes that does not harm the liver of the person drinking it."
"I should also like this agriculture to produce pears that taste like pears, apples that taste like apples, cherries that taste like cherries and peaches that taste like peaches; but above all, Mr President, I should like mint – which is my favourite flavour – to have, continue to have and have even more of the taste and perfume of mint, which gives me so much pleasure and which I adore."
"I thank you for that earthy contribution."
". – It goes without saying that a large part of agricultural research has up until now been in one way or another directed towards areas from which the agri-food capitalists hoped to derive the greatest profits."
"This report advocates redirecting at least some of that research to sectors that are currently neglected."
"That really would be a good thing. Even if, unlike the rapporteur, we do not think that the development of ‘sustainable’ agriculture and of ‘biological’ agricultural production, which he supports, is necessarily synonymous with a real advantage both to consumers, at least the vast majority of them, and to small family farms."
"We are not, of course, opposed to such a reorientation of agricultural research or to its being financed out of public funds as the rapporteur wishes."
"That request underlines the extent to which the market economy is incapable of funding research if the results do not produce immediate profits."
". Agriculture has a major impact on the climate, on soils, on biodiversity, on the balance of ecosystems and on landscape management; in other words, there is strong environmental interaction."
"It is a vital socio-economic and cultural activity, which ought to ensure high-quality agricultural produce."
"The food and animal-health crises that have befallen the EU have shown the unsustainability of the current agricultural model established under the CAP."
"This model encourages intensified production, at complete variance with the multifunctional face of agriculture."
"In order to develop sustainable farming culture, it is, therefore, important that we develop, implement and fund agricultural research that takes account of the significance of agriculture both for the development of rural areas and for the production of high-quality food."
"The paltry 2% of the Sixth Framework Programme for research is too low a level of funding for research into areas such as more sustainable farming methods, food safety and quality, alternative sources of income in agriculture (non-food uses of agricultural raw materials), the question of gender, new ways of regulating the market and improving organic farming methods."
"Other areas in which research is crucial are GM crops and biotechnology. To be more specific, we must look into questions concerning the coexistence between GM crops and conventional/organic crops, and the potential risks of releasing these crops into the environment and of introducing them into the food chain."
". The report before us points out the need to increase funding for research in the area of agriculture, in light of developments such as the transition towards multifunctionality, the greater importance attached to rural development and the need to make certain specialised agricultural practices, such as organic farming, more commercial."
"The rapporteur therefore calls for the use of funds from the Sixth Framework Programme for research to support projects and initiatives in the general framework of agriculture and rural development, bearing in mind the considerable potential, in the area of food science and the development of produce, to boost local production and local economies."
"We agree entirely that if we are to meet the consumer’s increasingly high expectations in terms of traceability, hygiene control, quality of ingredients, and so forth, considerable investment is required, in order to raise quality levels and maintain competitiveness."
"Given that such investment is not easy to come by at SME level, we must create conditions whereby investment is obtained at industry level, or at regional or national level, through public funding."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
". I share the rapporteur’s view that funding is needed for research in the field of agriculture."
"There is considerable potential, in the areas of food science and the development of products, to boost local production and local economies, which, unfortunately, has not been properly exploited."
"In view of the most recent developments in the sector, such as the transition to multifunctionality, I believe that rural development should be accorded the priority it deserves, and the use of funds from the Sixth Framework Programme for research may help in this regard."
"I feel that the growing demands of consumers, which I welcome and encourage, surely deserve the total support of the European institutions."
"The institutions must contribute not only towards making it increasingly possible to trace a product’s progress ‘from farm to fork’ but also towards making certain specialised agricultural activities, such as organic farming, more commercial."
"In terms of traceability, hygiene control and quality of ingredients, considerable investment is still required in order to raise quality levels and to maintain competitiveness."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Indeed, I voted in favour of this report on the recognition of professional qualifications because its aim is to have doctors who are European doctors – recognised as such throughout Europe – European lawyers, European accountants, European architects."
"We Members, Mr President, are we not already European parliamentarians?"
"Do we not demonstrate that we can succeed at being parliamentarians without having to take additional exams in order to be recognised throughout Europe?"
"We are an example, therefore, of how it is possible in practice to have a single European profession."
"Just as we have succeeded as parliamentarians in carrying out our work effectively, so too may all the professions be able to do likewise."
"Let us hope that it happens soon!"
". We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report because, on the pretext of 'transparency' and 'recognition of professional qualifications', it endeavours to shrink the scientific foundations for qualifications, when developments in science and technology presuppose the upgrading of education."
"As we pointed out during the debate on the report, its objective is to further liberalise the job market for the benefit of big business, it intervenes in the education system of the Member States, imposing an educational model which downgrades higher education, and it harmonises downwards the qualifications needed to access professions protected by law."
"As far as engineers, for example, are concerned, apart from the question of unequal treatment at the expense of qualified engineers who have completed a five-year course at an institute of higher education, whom it equates with graduates of three-year courses, the downgrading of the profession implied by the Directive gives rise to the serious matter of public interest and urgent social and grass-roots requirements in sensitive sectors, such as earthquake protection, construction and upgrading the natural and man-made environment."
"In addition, Plenary voted in favour of the amendments which pave the way for the recognition of imitation diplomas issued by university institutes, the famous Liberal Study Centres linked with foreign universities, equating its graduates with graduates from Greek institutes of higher education, despite the fact that the courses at these centres are not recognised in Greece as higher education courses."
". I welcome the criticisms made in the report of the Commission’s draft, especially with regard to the temporary measures to define the provision of services and to the possibility of avoiding making social security contributions."
"In Portugal, the key element of the regulation and limitation of access to certain professions is Article 47 of Constitutional law."
"Restriction is only possible by means of National Assembly legislation. Access can only be restricted when other fundamental rights are at stake – life, health and the safety of persons and effects – whilst always respecting the criteria of proportionality, of need, and of ensuring that the measure is appropriate."
"The idea of consolidating all professional regulations in one single directive, taking account of the particular characteristics of each of these – doctors, veterinary surgeons, nurses, obstetricians, architects and dentists – is acceptable, since life, health and the safety of persons and effects are at stake."
"It is, however, unacceptable, and indeed incomprehensible, that the Directive does not include other healthcare professionals, who play a vital role in the health and safety of workers, such as health and safety officers at work, biologists, senior health technicians and diagnosis and therapy technicians."
"The draft Directive, by not setting out explicitly that in order to recognise professional qualifications training must be based ..."
". – The report on the recognition of European qualifications extends the possibilities for the provision of services and harmonises qualifications in order to increase the mobility and free movement of labour in Europe."
"It seeks to give a service provider’s customer a guarantee of the quality of the work provided and to enable him to find the person responsible if he is not satisfied with the service and to insure him against risks."
"But there is nothing in this text about the rights conferred by recognised qualifications, nothing about the guarantees offered, nothing about the harmonisation of status and working conditions, nothing about improving the conditions of training."
"We reject a policy that seeks to give every guarantee to undertakings or customers in the case of professional mobility but none to those who work; we reject a policy that encourages social dumping by putting wage earners in brutal competition with one another with no guarantees, thereby undermining their status and social benefit entitlements."
"We are in favour of a harmonisation of qualifications that is indissolubly linked to a definition of status, working conditions and social commitments in terms of wages and social protection, because that would make for a mobility that would encourage improved living and working conditions in all European countries."
"We have therefore voted against the Zappalà report."
". – As submitted to us, the report contains an enormous number of amendments, among which I have concentrated on only one, namely Amendment No 20, which relates to recital 21."
"In fact, my help has been sought by the Architects’ Council of Europe, at the request of the architects and consulting engineers of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg."
"This amendment would introduce the concept of surveyors being able to offer building design services."
"Introducing a reference to surveyors into this directive would confer recognition on a profession which exists only in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, and whose members are not involved in the designing of buildings."
"In these countries, ‘building surveyors’ are occasionally employed in the design of buildings."
"The profession of surveyor not being common in Europe, the versions of the amendment in various languages will introduce confusion as to who is entitled to design buildings."
"The French translation refers to ‘’, who are not part of the same profession."
"This amendment appears to me to be dangerous, and I will be voting against it."
". The People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy is particularly delighted at the fact that the compromise amendments that have been agreed upon are fully in keeping with the European Commission’s initiative to launch a Europass, an Internet system that should promote the comparability of degrees and qualifications in the EU."
"The compromise contains a time-based points system, with quality points being awarded to each training course."
"This system guarantees that in the assessment of a training course, not the length of time, but the quality, is of importance."
"In addition, in a compromise, the rights and duties have been tightened up of those professions that involve extra care duty to protect the consumer, by means of compulsory registration and insurance in the case of a temporary provision of services in another Member State."
"For women too, the same rights remain valid for access to the labour market."
"A discriminating provision providing for the possibility of retaining a qualification only if work had not been interrupted for two out of the last five years, has been deleted."
"The directive is of vital importance in enhancing mobility on the labour market and is an essential precondition for achieving the Lisbon objective."
"A transparent system of qualifications will become more important, particularly in the light of enlargement, which will result in a further increase in intra-Community migration."
". Young people are told that it is becoming increasingly easier for them to work abroad."
"For some, working abroad for a while to gain experience is fun, but it is not if it is a necessity because jobs in their own profession are dying out in their own country, so that they can only be found in far-flung places."
"People are altogether disenchanted if they have to work abroad at lower wages and with no recognition for the qualifications they have gained."
"According to EU propaganda, everyone in every Member State is entitled to work at normal wages that are current in that country, and qualifications are mutually recognised."
"Practice, however, differs a great deal from that ideal image."
"Foreign teachers do not qualify for equivalent work in France and Italy."
"According to petitions recently received, Greece does not recognise university degrees gained abroad by Greeks, and there are also problems in Baden-Württemberg and Scotland."
"I do not get the impression that the proposed amendment of fifteen directives will really solve the problems."
"At best, there will be more freedom to settle on the part of those practising liberal professions, whereby foreigners will no longer need to meet the licensing and registration requirements, but these will remain compulsory for their domestic counterparts."
"According to medical specialists, the equal status for their qualifications has not been regulated very well by the European Commission."
"The complaints are set to persist."
". – I am glad that Mr Zappalà’s report on the recognition of professional qualifications in the European Union has been adopted today."
"With enlargement imminent, the free movement of workers, in particular of doctors, dentists, nurses, veterinary surgeons, midwives, pharmacists and architects, in the EU requires a simplified and harmonised system of professional qualifications."
"It seemed to me important to preserve what we already have and therefore to maintain high standards of qualification, especially for doctors, in a ‘European’ spirit that respects personalised values."
"That is why I voted against Amendment No 155."
"It would in fact have been preferable to have a supple and flexible mechanism that takes account of developments in university degree courses when setting the number of years’ training for specialists."
"Finally, I voted against Amendment No 156, which does not clarify the scope of automatic recognition of professional qualifications and does not leave Member States free to recognise specialisms in the medical profession."
"On these points I am looking for a strong signal from the Council, for it to pay greater heed to professional associations, of doctors in particular, for the greater benefit, in the end, let us not forget, of the patients."
"– I travelled from Milan to Rome by car. I had to go and see my mother whom, as a result of my commitments as an MEP, I have not seen for some time."
"Between Bologna and Florence there was huge traffic congestion, what the French call a ; we could not get through as there was a queue of trucks, articulated lorries and cars at a standstill."
"I saw Mr Gargani, the rapporteur of this report, waiting for me there."
"‘What are you doing here, Mr Gargani?’, I asked him."
"He replied, ‘I am here to show you what would happen if my report on the harmonisation of motor vehicles is not adopted."
"Look, one motor vehicle has turned over."
"So, remember, when you arrive in Parliament tomorrow to vote in favour’."
"It was a dream because I never met Mr Gargani, but in my view it is right to vote in favour, which is what I have in fact done."
". I welcome this report on the Commission’s proposal aimed at completing the single internal market in the automotive sector, by extending the principles and procedures of EU type-approval, which currently only apply to passenger cars, to all motor vehicles."
"In view of the progress made in the automobile sector and given the impending enlargement, it is necessary to bring in a single compulsory system for the type-approval of motor vehicles, to replace national procedures."
"This may bring benefits for the European automobile industry, such as reduced production costs, greater ease of access and expansion in the European market. In addition, there will be gains in terms of road safety and environmental protection."
"I particularly agree with the rapporteur’s view that any benefits that may accrue to small and medium-sized manufacturers are nullified by the conditions the proposal imposes on them for using it."
"The annual production limit required is set at too low a level, which may act as a disincentive for European SMEs to manufacture, thus hindering their potential for development and technological innovation."
"The transitional periods that must precede the system’s entry into force must also be extended, to take into account the adjustments that will need to be made by manufacturers and by all those required to deal with the new procedures."
"I voted in favour."
". The Commission feels that Northern hake stock has suffered biological collapse and has, consequently, drawn up a recovery plan that entails drastically reducing the catch and the fishing effort."
"The rapporteur feels that this measure is disproportionate and suggests only a management plan."
"Both sides justify their positions with scientific advice. This raises four important issues:"
"- firstly, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the recovery plans established in the revision of the common fisheries policy (CFP) in Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of December 2002, as a measure for conserving fisheries resources;"
"- secondly, fishermen must be involved in the process of assessing stocks, which Parliament called for in its opinion on integrating environmental protection requirements into the CFP. It is deplorable that in the case of Northern hake fishermen have not previously been properly involved;"
"- thirdly, given that the sustainability of resources is a key objective for the fisheries sector and for fishermen, stock recovery measures – leading to a reduction in the catch and fishing effort and in some cases to activities being ceased altogether – must be subject to an assessment of their socio-economic impact; financial compensation for losses incurred by those affected, especially fishermen, must also be ensured;"
"- lastly, measures must be commensurate with aims, which requires not only assessing ..."
". I voted against this report today, as I did at the committee stage."
"The original proposal of the Commission was for a cod and hake recovery plan based on scientific advice which was broadly similar in its assessment of the situation in both of these fisheries."
"Intensive lobbying by those whose national interest is in the hake fishery influenced the Commission and Council's decision to separate the two, proceeding first with cod recovery measures, which have emerged as discriminatory against the Scots white fish sector."
"At committee stage this Souchet report was almost completely rewritten by amendments favouring the national interests which target the hake fishery."
"This move further fuels the opinion of many Scots that certain national fishing fleets are being favoured, while Scotland loses out from EU management."
"The major influencing factor in this process is the fact that some Member States have governments which are prepared to make survival of their fishing communities a priority, while Scotland has the misfortune to be represented by the UK government which regularly betray us in EU Fisheries Council negotiations."
". – Cod is an example of how fishery resources are not inexhaustible."
"In order to conserve them, the Commission is constantly flanking our fishing effort with a variety of instruments for managing stocks and boats."
"Withdrawals from stocks are limited by total allowable catches, which are broken down into national quotas."
"The number of boats is constantly being cut by means of the financial instrument for fisheries guidance."
"The Regulation of 20 December 2002 on the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources takes up these instruments, but serves in particular as a basis for a third instrument of management proposed on 27 June 2003, limiting the fishing effort in kilowatt-days."
"If stocks are not to fall below the biomass limit, 100 000 tonnes in the case of Northern hake, for example, the number of days boats are absent from port would be limited on the basis of their power."
"Apart from this tool’s complexity, what is the use of setting our European fishermen aside if the stocks released in that way are overexploited by the Japanese, the Russians and other practitioners of industrial fishing?"
"The Commission’s proposal shows the need for a collection of measures to facilitate the recovery of the hake stock."
"The proposal is based on a report by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)."
"Parliament does not, however, wish to go as far and judges the problems to be less serious."
"Parliament’s amendments are based essentially on the view that the Commission has exaggerated the problems of over-fishing and that a recovery plan is unnecessary."
"I chose to vote against Parliament’s amendments because the original proposal by the Commission attaches greater importance to taking the problems seriously."
"Moreover, continued survival of the fish stock is given priority over the socio-economic effects to which any restriction can, in the worst case, give rise."
"Mr President, I am not certain I can follow the eloquence of Mr Fatuzzo in my explanation of vote."
"First, however, whilst nobody in this House is opposed to the proper control of the working time of all those employed within the European Union, it is equally important that a certain flexibility be allowed."
"The purpose of the amendments that I tabled, and some of the proposals I supported, was to ensure that this flexibility would be there, that there would not necessarily be a renationalisation of the rules regarding working time, but that there would be flexibility within the system to ensure that seasonal workers and other people who chose to work longer hours would be entitled to do so, rather than being regulated against."
"Even though some of those amendments did not get through, I still support the report and congratulate the rapporteur on it."
"On a further procedural point, I think an error was made with regard to allowing the oral amendment to Amendment No 26."
"My Amendment No 26 sought to delete a certain paragraph, whereas the oral amendment related to adding something on to that paragraph from the original text."
"I would ask that you or your services look at that and that it be put on record."
"Whilst I know we cannot change the vote on that issue, it should be put on record that an error was made."
"I note your point and the record will show that."
"However, I dispute your point."
"I will ask the services to communicate with you on the matter."
"The oral amendment would have fallen had it received 32 objections."
"That did not happen and so it became the precedent on which we voted."
"I will ask the services to give you an explanation, even if you should remain unhappy with its contents."
"Mr President, I welcome the Cercas report and congratulate the rapporteur on a very balanced approach."
"In the UK, 4 million people – or 16% of the workforce – currently work more than 40 hours per week."
"At the beginning of the 1990s the figure was 3.3 million people, or 15% of the workforce."
"It beggars belief that more people voluntarily want to work in excess of 40 hours a week now than was the case at the time of the introduction of this directive."
"This calls into question the use of the individual opt-out and whether genuine free choice of workers, as laid out in the directive, is being respected."
"Long hours damage workers' health through stress and burnout; they affect the productivity of industry and harm family life."
"No one should be forced to work more than 40 hours."
"I support flexibility, but there must be genuine free choice, and I am not convinced that free choice currently exists."
"I had a dream, Mr President."
"I dreamt that Mr Berlusconi, President of the Italian Government, had a halo and so I can call him San Berlusconi."
"San Berlusconi said to me, ‘I know that tomorrow you are to vote on the Cercas report concerning working time and it seeks to prevent those who are exempt under the minimum working time directive from working too much."
"Look at me: I work all day, from six in the morning until two the following morning."
"See how young I am, how active I am, how alert and satisfied I am at work!"
"My advice to you therefore is to vote against this Cercas report so that everyone can work as much as me and be as satisfied and as young as I am’."
"At that moment I woke up and realised it was a dream."
"I felt free therefore to vote according to my conscience and so, in fact, I voted in favour of the Cercas report, even though San Berlusconi advised me to vote against."
"Mr Fatuzzo, I thank you for bringing some Mediterranean colour to these otherwise modest debates after our votes."
"You referred to looking young: as we know from the references that you have made, there are many ways to look young, of which working hard may be only one."
". – The Cercas report shows what every worker already knows: the employers and the politicians who serve them, who want a workforce that will do their every bidding, want the employers to be able to set working hours as they wish, with no legal limits."
"Great Britain is the leader here."
"The rapporteur says that ‘there are currently more than four million workers whose working week is longer than 48 hours, almost one million more than before the introduction of the directive."
"There has also been an increase in the number of those working more than 55 hours, which is now over 1.55 million."
"Around 1% of workers in the United Kingdom have a working week longer than 70 hours.’"
"As to the worker’s individual agreement to work those hours, the cynicism of such a provision is underlined by this comment by the rapporteur: ‘it is common for these agreements to be signed at the same time as an individual contract’."
"This general offensive against any labour regulations affording workers even the slightest protection from the omnipotence of the employers is a serious social setback."
". We voted against this report, since, regrettably, proposals by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group were approved that substantially amend the text approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"As a result of the proposals and votes of these groups, some extremely important elements were, consequently, left out of the final text:"
"- the call for temporary measures to prevent a significant number of Member States, such as the United Kingdom, and new Member States, from being able to opt out, which defeats the purpose of the Directive;"
"- the request that the Commission immediately begin action against the United Kingdom for non-compliance, in view of the widespread systematic abuse of the Directive referred to in the Commission’s communication;"
"- the item stating that the Lisbon Agenda sets a target of a 60% employment rate among women by 2010, which will not be achieved if extended working hours continue to be allowed;"
"Our proposals, on the other hand, were not approved, namely those advocating a gradual reduction in working hours and those that put forward alternative models of organising working time in the health care sector and in similar sectors that involve being ‘on call’ to protect workers’ rights as regards maximum working hours."
". – The aim of the Cercas report was to take a hard look at the directive setting the maximum weekly working hours in the countries of the European Union."
"They are set at 48 hours measured over a period of four months."
"However, the directive allows for derogations extending the period of measurement by annualising it, at the same time allowing the rule to be disregarded altogether if employees ‘opt out voluntarily’."
"The report’s explanatory statement acknowledges that such exceptions are becoming the rule in Europe."
"In the United Kingdom in particular, the ‘individual opt-out clause’ has apparently been signed by one third of employees, four million of whom are already working more than 48 hours a week."
"The resolution therefore asked the Commission why it had not undertaken the review of the directive that should have been made in 2003."
"Calling for an improvement in the working conditions and health of employees, women in particular, it sought as far as possible to limit cases in which the 48-hour week was exceeded and in particular to do away with the ‘individual opt-out’ which is obviously being abused."
"Once again, the vast majority of Members have shown their contempt for social questions and their sole concern for profit by voting for amendments that do away with any desire to limit working hours."
"That is why we voted against the amended resolution."
". The Working Time Directive of 1993 protects employees against working weeks in excess of 48 hours, daily rest times of less than 11 hours and holidays shorter than 4 weeks."
"These are all minimum provisions and could easily be tightened up."
"This is, above all, necessary to prevent governments of EU Member States from considering these European minimum provisions as normal and adjusting their national legislation accordingly, as the Dutch Minister De Geus appears to want to do."
"In practice, the directive is being undermined by a concession made at the time to the – then Conservative – British Government. The opt-out clause means that individual British employees, when signing their contract of employment, are asked to waive their rights."
"People who are not prepared to do this often have to make way for people who are."
"An additional problem is that hours on call for fire fighters and medical staff are often not included in their working hours."
"Since this has now been changed by a judgment of the Court of Justice, these people are brought within the scope of the opt-out clause."
"This makes it possible to get people to work for excessively long periods of time."
"By a narrow majority, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has chosen in favour of an infringement procedure against the British Government and of abolishing the individual opt-out."
"Today, this proposal has been scuppered by a Conservative majority"
". The report now before us concerns the review of the Directive on the organisation of working time: reference periods and self-exclusion clauses, better known as ‘opt-out’ clauses."
"In 1993, the United Kingdom negotiated an opt-out clause authorising specific Member States not to implement the 48-hour maximum working week in certain circumstances"
"Although these clauses are not exclusive to the United Kingdom, it is there that they are used most frequently."
"The 1993 Directive does, however, establish a 48-hour maximum working week, thereby according basic protection for most workers, the main exception being managers."
"While there are reservations, the approval of various amendments has limited the most excessive aspects of what the rapporteur proposes. I therefore voted in favour."
"The EU has a long history of devising minimum rules for the organisation of working time."
"The British opt-out in this area has, unfortunately, been ever increasingly turned into almost a principal rule, because 33% of employees in Great Britain have signed agreements to the effect that they are prepared to work more than 48 hours per week."
"There are tendencies for this now to spread to more countries, entailing a risk to employees’ health and undermining safety in the workplace."
"We Christian Democrats do not wish to support such a development."
"It was therefore crucial that I voted in favour of the new wording of paragraph 12, the two parts of which were adopted by, respectively, 275 votes in favour and 229 against (with 9 abstentions) and 335 votes in favour and 155 against (with 21 abstentions)."
"This means that the time limit on the British opt-out is now to be phased out."
"Amendment No 28 involves a long-term solution to the problem of doctors’ hours on call being discussed in the next stage of consultation, something I supported because the result would otherwise be demands for approximately 3 000 new doctors in Sweden and an unsustainable funding situation for the county councils."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(1)"
"The next item is the Council statement on the position of the European Union on the hearing in the International Court of Justice on the Israeli wall."
". Madam President, in addressing the situation in the Middle East, I regret to say that there have been very few developments of a positive nature in the region in recent months."
"I shall have to be frank and say that prospects for progress in the short term are not overly encouraging."
"Nevertheless, the European Union continues to attach great importance to this issue and as presidency we shall play an active role in international peace efforts and in particular as a member of the international Quartet comprising the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, we will be energetic in pursuing this issue."
"The Irish Foreign Minister, in his capacity as President of the Council, visited Israel and Egypt on 14-18 January 2004."
"He met the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Israel and paid a courtesy call to the President of Israel."
"In his meetings, Minister Cowen pointed out that the status quo was not sustainable and that progress must be made on the implementation of the roadmap."
"He suggested that if initial steps envisaged in phase one of the roadmap are proving too great, then perhaps smaller steps might be taken as a means of building confidence in the region."
"The Israeli side showed some interest in these ideas."
"Similar suggestions had been made to the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Dr Nabil Sha'ath, during the course of a visit to Dublin on 9 January."
"These ideas also attracted support from the President and Foreign Minister of Egypt, and the Secretary General of the Arab League."
"The Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr Qurei, visited Dublin last Monday and his discussions with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister included further discussions of these ideas."
"The meetings were conducted in a very cordial atmosphere and the discussions were wide-ranging and frank."
"The Palestinian Prime Minister briefed his Irish interlocutors on the preparations being made for a meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel."
"He said that he is willing to meet Prime Minister Sharon at a mutually convenient time."
"He also announced a number of positive measures which the Palestinian Government is taking, or will shortly take."
"These included the continued return of Palestinian police to the streets; firm action to end incitement; and an unequivocal statement reaffirming the stated Palestinian position on Israel's right to exist in peace and in security."
"Prime Minister Qurei also outlined the work of the Palestinian Elections Commission, which is preparing for elections in the Palestinian Territory in the coming months."
"He also urged that the Quartet have the Israeli Government stop the building of the wall, because continuing construction would lead to the undermining of the roadmap and the two-state solution, in addition to the human catastrophe for the Palestinian people's way of life that the wall entails."
"There can be no doubt that the construction by Israel of a separation wall which extends deep into Palestinian territories is a major obstacle to progress and peace in that region."
"This has been the subject of statements by the European Union and others who have urged Israel to consider the long-term consequences of this construction."
"I need hardly say that the wall figured prominently in the discussions which the President of the Council had in Israel two weeks ago and that the Israeli attitude was regrettably uncompromising."
"On 21 October 2003, the Member States of the European Union and the acceding states co-sponsored a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly."
"That resolution called on Israel to stop and reverse construction of the wall and asked the United Nations Secretary-General to report on Israeli compliance."
"When at the end of November the Secretary-General reported that there was no evidence of Israeli compliance, the General Assembly adopted a resolution asking the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in occupied Palestinian territory."
"This resolution was adopted on 8 December 2003."
"On that occasion the European Union abstained in the vote."
"The decision to abstain was taken after intense consultations and was based on the conviction of many Member States that transferring the matter of the wall to a legal forum would do nothing to advance the political process necessary for peace."
"Abstention did not in any way suggest that the European Union's position that the wall was in contravention of international law had changed – quite the opposite."
"On receiving the resolution of the General Assembly, the Court invited Member States of the United Nations to submit statements or information to the Court which might be of assistance in its deliberations."
"Some Member States of the European Union felt that it would be desirable for a common position to be submitted to the Court."
"Other states had a strong preference for individual national submissions to the Court."
"After considerable discussion – including at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 January – it was agreed that there would be a presidency submission on behalf of the Union and that individual Member States might make national submissions based on established European Union positions."
"The presidency had forwarded the texts of presidency statements to the United Nations General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December."
"These were transmitted to the Registrar of the International Court of Justice in The Hague by the Irish Ambassador on 30 January."
"The written submissions of all interested parties – including the Israelis and the Palestinians – have now been received by the Court."
"It is expected that oral submissions will commence on 23 February and that the Court will deliver its advisory opinion to the General Assembly sometime between late May and late July."
"Amid the gloom prevalent in the region, there have been some small signs of hope."
"The Geneva Initiative promoted by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabo is a welcome indication that rational discussion between senior people on both sides is possible."
"This plan points to some ways in which the difficult final status issues – such as Jerusalem and the right of return of refugees – might be addressed."
"I was pleased to see that the authors were recently in Brussels to brief the European Union's High Representative, Dr Solana."
"Other initiatives among civil society representatives are also in train involving academics, political figures and former military and intelligence officers."
"This will serve to show that dialogue is possible, even on very difficult and emotional issues."
"I am also encouraged by suggestions that the Arab League may move to reiterate its initiative adopted at the Beirut Summit almost two years ago."
"This idea, advanced by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, was that, in return for Israel’s withdrawal to the 1967 boundaries, relations with all Arab neighbours would be normalised."
"Normalisation would involve de jure recognition of Israel by the entire membership of the Arab League, the establishment of diplomatic relations, the establishment of trade links and the opening of possibilities for technical and investment exchanges in all sectors."
"At the time this proposal received insufficient attention in Israel, but with the roadmap on the table this initiative could prove to be complementary."
"It might also serve to reassure Israel as to the wisdom of proceeding towards a peace agreement with its neighbours, Syria and Lebanon."
"I would urge the leaders of the Arab League to use the opportunity of their forthcoming summit meeting to advance the prospect of normalisation to Israel once again."
"They should emphasise their desire for a comprehensive peace, which can only be of benefit to all the countries of the region."
"I would also urge the Israeli leadership to consider carefully the benefits and advantages which they could reap from a normal relationship with their wider neighbourhood and assuming their proper role in their natural economic and political region."
"Finally, I should like to assure this House that the search for a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, based on the well-established positions of the European Union, is a priority of the Irish presidency and that we shall make every attempt to take the roadmap forward and to convince the parties to the conflict to make the necessary efforts to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for the benefit of all the peoples and States of the region."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that when the subject of the security fence or wall between Israel and the Palestinian autonomous regions is broached, emotions soon run very high on the part of everyone involved."
"The European Parliament has on various occasions adopted opinions on this subject – on the political appropriateness of this wall, on its legality, on the new scenario it has created in terms of potential future arrangements on the part of the Israelis, on the hardship that it involves for many Palestinians, and on the illusion of security that the wall creates for Israel."
"We have already made our views clear on all these aspects, and I do not wish to cover the same ground again here."
"The issue we need to resolve today is where we stand as regards the hearing in the International Court of Justice on the Israeli wall."
"I would first like to thank the Irish Presidency for their observations and for clarifying what the EU's position has been, on what occasions and for what reasons."
"Let us look at the United Nations General Assembly resolution for which the legal basis was the 'Uniting for Peace' formula."
"I in fact believe that from a legal point of view this was not an appropriate legal basis, because the Security Council was indeed in a position to deal with this and in fact did so, and I therefore think that it was right for the EU to abstain in the vote on this, no doubt for legal reasons. However, the statement issued by the presidency at that time also had a political flavour."
"If you will permit me, I shall quote the relevant sentence in English: 'The EU believes that the proposed request for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice will not help the efforts of the two parties to relaunch a political dialogue and is therefore inappropriate.'"
"So the consequence was that the EU of 15 abstained. It is my belief that we should not underestimate this issue in this context."
"We should take political steps towards reviving talks between the Israelis and Palestinians and reactivating the roadmap, which is moribund, so that we do not completely lose sight of the consequences of this security wall and also the resolution of the main issue."
"I can see little point in our having a debate on legal issues here if it runs counter to the ruling of the International Court of Justice."
"The ruling of the International Court of Justice is that there can be no trial if a state involved in a dispute before the Court does not accept its jurisdiction."
"And Israel has specifically stated that it does not wish to appear before the International Court of Justice with regard to this."
"I therefore believe that political initiatives are far more important, and that the only way we can get the security wall removed or even, as a first step, make it easier for people to cross, is for us to really put pressure on everyone involved to assume their responsibilities and to honour the commitments which they have after all entered into in writing."
"I support the presidency to the extent that it is holding the line followed by the European Union up to now."
"I welcome the fact that the presidency intends to hold intensive talks and that we – although the European Union has unfortunately not so far really played a leading role or a truly pivotal one – will in practice be able to bring our influence to bear on everyone involved in the process, by adopting a balanced stance, a stance whereby both sides will see us as an honest broker."
"However, if that is not the case, and if we continue to play a merely ancillary role, I believe that the parties will not have the confidence in us that we need if we are in all honesty to play a role here."
"The money that we are making available to the region will not by itself win us influence."
"We need to speak with a single political voice and endeavour to make a contribution in that way."
"Madam President, I have to say that I am not particularly interested in entering into a debate on this wall of shame at the International Court of Justice. Clearly, this barrier is a moral outrage and a political mistake."
"I fear, however, we are running the risk of putting up a different kind of barrier. I feel we are creating a smokescreen by spending our time on this matter instead of exerting the pressure, force and political will required to really push the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward."
"Nevertheless, the existence of the settlements also makes the establishment of a viable state impossible. Further, the absence of any political will to act appropriately represents a far greater impediment to the creation of such a state."
"I would like to take this opportunity to point out that a number of other significant smokescreens are also emerging."
"There is, for example, the recent announcement made by the Bush administration that it is preparing a grand plan to restructure the Arab-Islamic world and to bring it under the umbrella of Western security."
"Now it seems that extreme right-wingers in the US are referring to a great restructured Middle East as their main foreign policy priority. This, they say, will facilitate the ending of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"To be frank, I cannot take seriously a plan claiming to bring about democracy and prosperity from Morocco to Pakistan overnight."
"Rather, I think this plan is another attempt to distract public opinion in the run up to the November presidential elections. This same public opinion has now realised that President Bush’s electoral imperatives take priority over the supposed intentions to advance the Middle East peace process."
"Furthermore, this supposed grand plan for the Middle East could make the Israel-Palestinian conflict appear less central."
"There seems to be a suggestion that the European Union be involved in the plan."
"It should be remembered that the European Union is a key player in the Barcelona process. This process will not succeed, at least not fully, until there is an end to the confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis."
"The other smokescreen is the one currently being created by Prime Minister Sharon. The latter is forever announcing painful concessions he never implements."
"He has proved unable to remove the illegal settlements in the West Bank. I have in mind the small number of caravans scattered across a few hills on the West Bank."
"He is now saying that the Gaza townships will be abandoned. I am quite prepared to give Prime Minister Sharon the benefit of the doubt for the time being."
"It is to be hoped, however, that this grand plan does not turn out to involve relocating the Gaza settlers in the West Bank enclaves. The latter constitute the real impediment to the viability of the Palestinian State the Quartet hopes will be established."
"Madam President, Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is deeply troubling and I would refer in that context to the shooting and subsequent death of my constituent Tom Hurndall."
"But the security threat to Israel is also very serious."
"It is fair to ask why, if the only point of the barrier is to stop suicide bombers, the barrier is not on the 'green line'?"
"Why does it make such incursions into Palestinian territory and create such hardship?"
"I do at least welcome the announcement two days ago that the barrier will be moved closer to the green line."
"I also welcome Prime Minister Sharon's intention to withdraw from the Gaza settlements."
"A senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, Henry Siegman, wrote recently that support for the cause of Palestinian nationhood does not require denial of Jews to live in their own state."
"That is precisely my position: two states side by side, with the right of return of Palestinians largely to a state in the West Bank and Gaza."
"But it must be a viable state."
"Of course the achievement of this does not rest just on Israeli shoulders."
"Palestinians have to want peace and avoid terrorism."
"It is very difficult to contest Israel's right to make itself secure, when Palestinian leaders seem unable to stop suicide bombers."
"There are desperate people, but I am not convinced that desperation is the only basis for suicide bombers – they are also recruited and exploited."
"The Palestinian Authority is in crisis, not only because of Israeli hostility – although that is a strong factor – but also because of corruption and criminal lawlessness."
"I note that 350 activists resigned in protest last weekend from Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement."
"Perhaps this parallels the case taken by Israeli NGOs to the Israeli Supreme Court in protest against the barrier."
"The crucial priority is to get back to political negotiations."
"I am not convinced that the International Court of Justice case helps, because it diverts from that."
"What would help is grassroots democratic pressure, both in Israel and in Palestine."
"– Mr President, I would have liked to have said what Mr Menéndez del Valle said in his analysis but will say something else."
"Sister Dominique runs the Casa di Nostra Signora dei Dolori in Abu Dis, a village near Jerusalem, cut in two by the segregation and annexation wall, as it is known by Palestinians and peaceful Israelis, or by a security fence, as it is called by the Israeli authorities."
"This is Sister Dominique’s message: ‘On 11 January the construction of the new separation wall, nine metres high, was begun."
"It replaces another much lower wall built in August 2002 which people could climb over when they were no longer permitted to go to Jerusalem."
"Thousands of people have climbed over that first wall: children, students, mothers, old people; many have fallen, one person even died."
"Two months ago we had to call an ambulance for a 65 year-old man who fell and banged his head."
"The ambulance arrived much later."
"On the road the army searched the ambulance, made the injured man’s wife get out and on arrival at the hospital it was too late for him."
"The things that happen around this wall are intolerable."
"For months hundreds of people have passed through our property every day to avoid military controls because they do not have the required permits."
"People round about us live in fear of being arrested, beaten and humiliated, as too often happens."
"There is constant tension and living conditions are becoming increasingly miserable."
"Faced with general apathy we feel isolated and helpless."
"We want to speak out on behalf of those people without a voice who every day, for the last two years, have struggled to reach their place of work and their schools or die through lack of medical treatment."
"In attempting to carry out our mission, we have also encountered difficulties with soldiers when we have taken people in because the ambulance was forbidden to pass."
"The same problem arises when somebody dies: the cemetery is on the other side of the wall."
"Even the shops are on the other side."
"Many of our patients are alone, their families are no longer able to visit them."
"We do not know what will happen when the wall is finished."
"The majority of our old people and employees come from the West Bank."
"Only three of our eighteen employees have a Jerusalem identity card; for two years they have had to climb over the wall and change their route in order to avoid the checkpoints because, even with a pass, the soldiers would make them turn back."
"This nine metre high wall will make it necessary for us to sack most of our staff and refuse to accept old people from the West Bank, in other words those who are the poorest."
"We are worried and more isolated than before as a result of the wall and because the surrounding area has been turned into a military zone."
"Help us!’"
"Those are the words of Sister Dominique, but far worse, in fact, is the situation of the inhabitants of Qalqilya who are prevented by the wall even from seeing the sunrise."
"The sole exit from the city has an iron gate, for 50 000 people, which the Israeli army opens and closes as it pleases."
"At 5 p.m. it is locked and nobody can enter or leave the city after that time."
"In addition, what is to be said about the inhabitants of Budrus who have attempted, together with many Israeli pacifists, to use non-violent means to oppose the uprooting of their trees and the destruction of their homes?"
"They have been brutally beaten by soldiers; one Israeli boy is still in hospital."
"The wall and the barriers under construction are, in fact, forcing the Palestinians to live in ghettoes."
"It is for security, says Sharon, it is to prevent terrorist activities, not wanting to understand that security cannot be based on the construction of a wall and camps, but on the Palestinians having the possibility of living in freedom in their State in coexistence with the State of Israel."
"The wall is not merely a prison: it amounts yet again to the confiscation of land, yet again it amounts to annexation."
"It does not follow the 1967 borders but instead penetrates into and divides Palestinian territory."
"Meanwhile, the propaganda to have the wall accepted has intensified."
"Concerned at the negative reaction of the international community, the Israeli authorities are attempting to make the wall appear less monstrous."
"The proposal published in the Israeli daily newspaper , made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ team responsible for public relations, stating that, ‘If the wall were painted in bright colours it would be more aesthetic reducing the damage to public relations’ is unfortunately not a joke."
"Parliament has condemned the construction of the wall calling for building to be halted."
"Walls, as we saw with the Berlin Wall, destroy freedom."
"The UN General Assembly has voted for the International Court of Justice in The Hague to deliver an opinion on its legitimacy."
"The President of the European Council of Ministers has stated, most inopportunely, that he considers the referral of the matter to the International Court of Justice ill-timed."
"Why is it, where the Israeli authorities are concerned, that international law and human rights violations must always be put to one side in the name of negotiations that do not exist, and the Quartet, instead of applying pressure in favour of the roadmap, allow time to pass by and the dying to continue in Palestine and Israel?"
"This smacks of complicity because this wall is not about security; this wall amounts to territorial annexation, colonial conquest."
"The European Union cannot throw international law overboard."
"Let us take diplomatic action, relaunch the roadmap, do our utmost to prevent acts that can kill Israeli civilians, but let us also put economic and political pressure on Israel so that Sharon does not take unilateral action and returns to the negotiating table."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council said, the international community is heeding and giving its backing to the Geneva initiative, non-violent Palestinian resistance against military occupation, soldiers who refuse to carry out bombardments and be the instruments of repression in the occupied territories, the Palestinian and Israeli parents who have had their loved ones killed by the army, by Israeli settlers or by Palestinian assassins/suicide attackers and who reject the idea of vendetta."
"All those things prove that coexistence and security are possible whilst affirming the right of all to live in peace with dignity and justice."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaging in a rather curious debate, and I cannot say that I understand all the various standpoints."
"We are all in favour of putting international relations on a legal footing."
"It is for us to create the international law that we all desire."
"That is why I consider the request to the International Court of Justice to produce a report on how it views the reality of this wall to be justified."
"We basically want a clear statement about what the wall implies."
"One very simple outcome, as I see it – and you do not have to be clairvoyant here – is that the Court could rule that a wall built on the 1967 borders recognised by the UN might not be to our liking, but would be in accordance with international law."
"Whether we like it or not, the Israelis are entitled to build a wall on their own territory."
"We might well regard it as being wrong politically speaking, but the issue of security is not one that we can just brush aside."
"The key factor is that building this wall amounts to annexation."
"Under international law it is an extension of the State of Israel, and an illegal extension at that."
"It has not been negotiated – force has been used to appropriate part of the land."
"That being the case, I believe that it would be appropriate for the International Court of Justice to give its opinion."
"I consider that the European Union, which fought, against the Americans for example, for this court to be established – and we have always said that we want international law – was ill-advised to abstain on this."
"This is not about opposing Israel."
"It is about opposing any state arrogating to itself the right to annex land."
"That is the keystone of international law."
"It is permissible to exchange land by means of negotiations, but not – and this is also at the heart of the UN Charter – to annex land."
"As I see it, the same would apply if an opinion were being sought on the content of the programmes of the Palestinian organisations."
"The programmes of Palestinian organisations that do not recognise the State of Israel are also illegal and should be identified as such."
"The issue of the PLO Charter is a complicated one."
"It would also be possible to determine as a matter of law whether or not it refers to recognition of the State of Israel."
"That means that it would also be possible to examine the constitution of groups and parties that defend the Palestinian state and Palestinian autonomy. The end result would be that it would no longer be possible for one side or the other to claim a right for itself while refusing to recognise the rights of the other side."
"That is the key factor in this conflict."
"The Palestinians have to recognise Israel and any terrorist attacks in Israel contradict that."
"And the Israelis have to recognise the Palestinian State, and this wall amounts to a rejection of the Palestinian State."
"That can be legally established."
"Madam President, last week, the Israeli delegation arranged a meeting concerning the so-called security wall with, among others, Mr Peled, the Israeli foreign ministry’s spokesman."
"He related a short anecdote about an American who, in a Moscow zoo, had, to his great surprise, seen a cage containing a wolf together with a lamb."
"It emerged that a new lamb was taken into the cage for the wolf every day."
"Mr Peled then compared Israel with the lamb and the Palestinians with the wolf, which, from my point of view, was certainly a case of turning matters on their head, because, to my knowledge, it is Israel that has occupied the West Bank and Gaza, that has nuclear weapons and one of the strongest armies in the world and that is backed by the United States."
"Nonetheless, this is very typical of Israelis’ self-image and behaviour."
"If the world does not put the strongest pressure conceivable upon Israel to tear down this completely disastrous wall, whatever the decision arrived at by the International Court, there will never be peace in the Middle East."
"At the same time, Sharon needs to know that he cannot replace the roadmap for peace with his own unilateral delineation of frontiers."
"I was, in actual fact, pleased to hear that Sharon wanted to remove the settlements in Gaza, until the moment it became clear that he only wanted to move them to the West Bank and that this was a stage in his now wanting to abandon the roadmap for peace and, in point of fact, to begin acting unilaterally."
"That is, of course, completely unacceptable."
"The settlements both on the West Bank and in Gaza are illegal and the biggest obstacles of all to peace."
"The allies went to war to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the UN resolutions."
"When has the international community contemplated forcing Sharon to do the same, with his being given a deadline for when all of Israel’s illegal settlements in the occupied territories must be removed?"
"Once that has been done, Israel will, if appropriate, be able to build a protective wall along the Green Line, but, by then, that will be unnecessary because the Palestinian Authority will have been provided with the basis for effectively putting a stop itself to all the suicide bombings."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Sandbæk stated that she wanted to knock down the wall."
"This is an old story: there is a Europe – that of Mrs Sandbæk – which 60 years ago, for substantially the same reasons, wanted to knock down the Maginot Line."
"Reference has been made to the Berlin Wall."
"That infamous wall was constructed and supported by those who today want to knock down the Israeli wall."
"That is what is happening, have no doubt, even if this evening, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you have said some reasonable things."
"It is such a rare occurrence that I will not waste time – yours and mine – responding to your remarks."
"I repeat: my compliments for saying something reasonable!"
"Mr Roche, the thing which interests me most at the moment is a news item that continues to elude us: our fellow MEP, or better, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi, will in the next few hours submit to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union a proposal, discussed again yesterday in Toledo, made specifically by or put forward by Shimon Perez, with the full and total support of the Minister for Palestinian Affairs, Nabil Sha’ath."
"I would ask her to take note of it because only and the have done so."
"It is the news item of today: the Minister for Palestinian Affairs gives his backing to the procedure for Israel’s accession to the European Union so that the Palestinian State may do likewise when it becomes a reality, in the context of a federation of both States, and not that shameful ragbag of a nation State that we are offering the Palestinians in 3004: a small sovereign State, crafted out of lies, thieves, corrupt and violent individuals."
"I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you listen to Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi’s proposal: the proposals that we have been making in this chamber for the last 20 years – to change the historical context – and the proposals yet to be written, roadmap or no roadmap, are a waste of time, suicidal and not worthy of being proposed."
"Consequently, I hope the argument that Israel must become a member of the European Union, supported by a large number of Members, is pursued with the utmost conviction because that is a contribution we can make in response to the events of 1939 in Europe and also in favour of the Palestinians, on whom you want to bestow instead a Middle East that is fascist, Nazi, communist and undemocratic."
"Mr President, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon claims that the construction of his country's controversial wall is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks."
"I abhor terrorism and would support the right of any government to take appropriate measures to defend the lives of its citizens."
"However, the strategy of building this wall is morally wrong, as well as being counter-productive."
"Like many of Mr Sharon's other counter-terrorist strategies, this fails to tackle the root causes of terrorism."
"Palestinian land has been confiscated to build the barrier; thousands of Palestinian farmers and traders are cut off from their land and means of economic survival."
"If the wall is completed, it is estimated that approximately 380 000 Palestinians will be trapped between the wall and Israel's 1967 pre-occupation border, the so-called 'green line'."
"Furthermore, 160 000 of these would be trapped in 'double walled' ghettos or enclaves."
"Palestinian communities would be effectively isolated from one another."
"They would also be cut off, in certain instances, from centres such as Jerusalem, which have been the focus of their economic, social and religious life."
"Recent proposed modifications will not prevent this."
"Furthermore, the restrictions on the freedom of movement of goods and services will intensify the problems for an already weakened Palestinian economy."
"The consequences of this ill-conceived security strategy on the part of the Israeli Government will provide a fertile breeding ground for creating another generation of terrorists rather than effectively tackling the problem."
"The issue of the legality of the wall has now moved centre stage."
"The refusal of Israel to comply with the resolution adopted at the October General Assembly of the United Nations to stop and reverse the construction of the wall led to the General Assembly decision of 8 December to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice."
"Israel should pause and reflect on the consequences of its actions."
"The wall violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, specifically in the two areas of prohibition of the use of collective punishment and prohibition of annexation, which cannot be abrogated by invoking military necessity."
"It also violates the Oslo Agreement in respect of the obligation to preserve the territorial integrity of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the prohibition against restricting freedom of movement."
"When one also considers the continued refusal by Israel to comply with UN resolutions, it begs the question: 'where does Israel think it is going?'."
"Does it want to be a pariah state, regarded in the same light as rogue states that are in constant defiance of their international obligations?"
"Or instead, will it work with the international community to create peace in the Middle East?"
"With progress on the so-called roadmap slow or virtually non-existent, one has to question the merit of imposing such a controversial measure on the Palestinian people."
"If the Israelis are serious about making real progress in the peace process and putting the 'roadmap' back on track, the building work on the security wall should not only stop, it should be reversed."
"The Israelis and the Palestinians should instead be working together to take down barriers and to build confidence between the two communities if an agreed settlement is ever to be reached."
"The recent declaration by Sharon that he plans to dismantle most of the 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip is a step in the right direction."
"However, building yet more security walls and crippling the already impoverished Palestinian economy serves only to make it more difficult to achieve peace in the Middle East."
"Madam President, I have great respect for the President-in-Office, but today he has been forced to demonstrate very dramatically to us just how incapable the European Union is of adopting a clear position on one of the most important issues of the day."
"We did not even have a subdued voice – we had no voice at all."
"What did we do?"
"We abstained on a highly important issue where legality is very much at stake."
"Because it is not – and I totally agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit on this – as if we are talking about a wall running along a clearly defined border."
"That is something you can either support or oppose."
"But you, Mr President-in-Office, have said yourself that the wall has been built deep into Palestinian territory, and the European Union has said the same."
"Just when it comes to such a step, to an annexation of this kind, and when consideration is being given to whether such border fortification can be the subject of a legal judgment, we simply say ‘sorry, we do not have a view, each state can do whatever it likes’."
"So what is the point of working towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy if when it comes to the most important questions we just say that we do not have a view?"
"That is the slogan, the motto if you like, of the Common Foreign and Security Policy on this issue."
"I think it is shameful."
"We are not talking about condemning Israel in a one-sided way."
"Once again, I totally agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit: anyone who condemns and criticises this wall should equally not only condemn any kind of terrorist activity, but also endeavour to combat it."
"We will not, however, achieve anything by adopting a position like this."
"By taking the position of actually not saying anything at all on this important question, we alienate the Palestinians, but that does not mean that in return we will win over the Israelis, because although Israel has of course brought pressure to bear for us not to adopt a position on this, that does not mean that they will involve us more closely in the peace process."
"And I find it sad that Europe's foreign ministers and Heads of State have not recognised that and grasped the implications."
"You were left with no alternative today but to present the situation to us as you have, Mr Roche."
"I have two further questions for you, for the presidency that is."
"The first question relates to Mr Sharon's plans to remove the majority – not all so far, but the majority – of settlements in the Gaza Strip."
"What does that really mean?"
"Removing the settlements – excellent, well done Mr Sharon, I hear you say."
"But does it mean that other areas, particularly in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, will be extended?"
"My question to you, Mr President-in-Office, is this: has the European Union at least adopted a clear position on this?"
"Support for clearing settlements from these areas is fine, but we should in no way be offering our support or agreement if it means that other areas in the West Bank are to be annexed."
"My second question for you relates to the Americans' big talk about a new Middle East plan in the widest sense of the term."
"Joschka Fischer expressed his opinion on this at the NATO security conference in Munich."
"Does the European Union know anything about this plan?"
"Does the European Union have anything to say about this plan, and does it also include concrete measures to tackle the heart of the problem – Israel and Palestine?"
"It would be interesting if the European Union and the Council could say something about that."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, fear is a bad counsellor."
"I can understand Israel’s desire to protect itself, but the wall is inappropriate in this case."
"A UN report last September condemned the wall as illegal and charged Israel with unlawful annexation."
"You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are of the opinion that the hearings and decisions of the International Court of Justice will disturb the peace process."
"I do not share this view."
"Like Mr Cohn-Bendit, I believe it would be useful to verify to what extent international law is being violated here, and that we should not make an exception for Israel, nor, in this context, for Palestine when it makes mistakes."
"At present, we are talking about approximately 21 000 people who live in the area between the wall and Israel and who are being cut off from social amenities, schools and jobs."
"This will lead to renewed hatred and a new generation of refugees."
"How do you explain – I am a member of the Palestine delegation – to a group of people in Qalqilya, which was once known as the West Bank’s fruit basket and which is located near a small loophole in the wall, that everything is being closed off on three sides?"
"That they are being cut off from two major water sources and from all the farms that should provide for the area?"
"The town, with 40 000 inhabitants, is accessible via one single Israeli checkpoint."
"As I see it, something of this nature should be brought before the court."
"I share the view of all those who have said that the conflict between Israel and Palestine should be solved, but tolerating a wall and waiting until the conflict is over is not the right way to go about it."
"Madam President, it is a matter of great regret that the European Council has not supported the examination of the Israeli wall at the International Court of Justice."
"This is a hugely wasted opportunity."
"Opposition to a hearing at the ICJ, because it is a legal – not a political – forum, misses the point."
"The ICJ is probably the last available instrument of pressure on Tel Aviv, and we should be grasping it with both hands."
"Those people who say that instead we should be relying on European pressure on Israel should tell me when European pressure alone on Israel has ever yielded any results – it has not."
"Yet, when there is an international multilateral forum that exists to address this issue, we turn our backs upon it."
"Palestinians rightly point to the inconsistency of our position of urging them to give up violence, while simultaneously denying them the chance to seek redress through international legal institutions."
"A Palestinian negotiator observed that the US, the UK and Germany asked the Palestinians not to have recourse to violence, but when the Palestinians have recourse to diplomacy the door is slammed on them."
"Moreover, there are compelling humanitarian reasons to act."
"I visited the Occupied Territories last month and saw for myself how the wall is destroying thousands of acres of farmland and trees, demolishing homes and shops and leaving thousands of families landless, jobless, hungry and hopeless."
"As a result, according to studies by the World Bank and the UN, the Palestinian people have been reduced to the poverty and malnutrition levels of sub-Saharan Africa."
"The Israeli claim that this is something to do with security is completely undermined by the fact that the wall does not follow the 1967 'green line'."
"Instead, as people have said, it cuts deep into Palestinian land."
"This wall is intolerable, illegal and immoral, and by failing to support the ICJ as a forum to consider it, the Council has been reckless and irresponsible."
"The Council has also not been transparent, and I would like a copy of the letter that contains the presidency's submission to the ICJ to be made widely available."
"– Madam President, I should like to make one thing clear in this debate: without Palestine’s reign of terror, an Israeli security barrier would not be under construction."
"It is to the German Foreign Minister’s credit that he recently sanctioned this last-ditch measure."
"There is no doubt that opinions on the precise course of this division vary, even in Israel itself; hence the present hearings before the Israeli Supreme Court."
"I should also like to make it clear that the general interests of the Palestinian population on the West Bank should not suffer unnecessarily as a result of the extremely contentious security barrier."
"The UN General Assembly is not, however, serving their interests by asking the International Court of Justice to intervene in such a basic political issue as this dividing line between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"This only prejudices the pressing need for the resumption of the political dialogue between the parties involved."
"In short, I endorse in this context the position adopted by my country, the Netherlands, and that of the European Union, which is one of rejection."
"Moreover, with regard to the legal proceedings that have been brought before the International Court of Justice, Palestine’s special observer status – in other words, that of the Palestinian Authority – is extremely odd, and amounts to a clear case of discrimination against the Jewish State."
"These lopsided relations have the opposite effect politically speaking."
"This is just as much a failing of the European Parliament, as next week, the Palestine Prime Minister will be visiting the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, whereas the Israeli Prime Minister will not."
"In the Israeli-Palestine conflict, we should adhere to the tried and tested principle that both sides should be heard."
"– Madam President, in this hearing at the International Court of Justice about the Israeli security wall the question seems to us to be very badly put and therefore likely to be very badly resolved."
"This barrier is in fact only a subsection of a much wider plan called disengagement, which is only an adjunct to an even wider process, which is the roadmap for peace talks."
"All the interconnections between these different levels are very complex."
"It would therefore be inappropriate to want to judge a small subsection separately without attempting to consider the role it plays in the whole process."
"Especially if we are wanting to look at it from a strictly legal angle when it is a component of the whole of a peace process that is obviously political in nature."
"That is why those European countries that were against taking the problem before the International Court of Justice on the grounds that it would hamper the peace efforts were perfectly right."
"We must not look at this problem through the small end of the telescope because that would risk calling into question a peace process that everyone would want to support."
"Finally, we must make the distinction between the principle of the security barrier and the line it takes."
"I believe I have detected some confusion about that in this debate."
"Just as the line of the barrier can be a matter for negotiation and, like any matter for negotiation, subject to change, so its principle is a matter of the sovereign right of a state – and, moreover, a state whose survival is constantly threatened – to ensure the safety of its citizens."
"Madam President, I wish to take a rather personal line in this debate, because I believe that, whatever we say in this House, it may be perceived as offensive on all sides."
"We can make speeches here in the European Parliament that are best suited to satisfying our own electorates at home in Great Britain or France or, as in my own case, in Sweden."
"As the European Union and as the European Parliament, what contribution are we prepared to make to the Middle East issue, to a peaceful future there and to coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians?"
"Two and a half years ago, I visited Nicosia and saw how that city was divided."
"As a 25 year-old, I travelled to Belfast and saw how that city too is divided, with, in more recent times, barricades and barriers now having been built to separate Unionists and Republicans, the two population groups."
"In Ceuta, which is situated in North Africa but belongs to Spain, there is barbed wire to separate this Spanish city of Ceuta from Morocco."
"The United States has built a barrier between itself and Mexico."
"An electric fence is almost complete between Zimbabwe and Botswana."
"Am I saying this in order in some way to excuse what is happening in the Middle East?"
"No, not at all but, rather, to show that similar situations exist in many other places."
"In the year 2000 and with UN approval, Israel constructed a security fence between itself and Lebanon, involving electronic and other surveillance using sensors."
"This was applauded by the European Union and Russia and seen as a clever way for Israel unilaterally to withdraw its troops from Lebanese land in the year 2000."
"I would hope and believe that the wall and the barrier that have been built are interim solutions or measures."
"I would hope and believe that these are not permanent fixtures, and I would hope and believe that it will be possible for the peace talks to begin again."
"I wish to think well of both sides."
"The fact that the Israeli public pressed for the construction of this wall has to do, of course, with the large number of suicide attacks suffered by the Israeli public."
"One hundred and twenty suicide bombers have caused almost 900 deaths and getting on for 6 000 injured Israelis."
"As good Europeans, and as good Swedes, let us try to see this issue from both sides."
"Let us hope that we achieve a peaceful solution in the Middle East."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, listening to speeches by many Members, it is clear that the reaction is almost unanimous and that we all believe that the Council letter, in which the Council suggests to the Court of Justice that a decision on the case of the wall in Palestinian territory be considered inappropriate, is particularly serious and inopportune."
"Well, in any parliamentary democracy, faced with such a vast and firm opinion of Parliament, a government resigns."
"Although the concept of resigning is not provided for in the European institutions, I would ask the Council to take into consideration the opinion given in this House, which is not denouncing the wall because it causes a hazard and slows down the peace process, but is denouncing the wall as such."
"This wall, Mr President – as you well know and as many Members have stressed – is primarily a dividing wall because it does not follow the 1967 green line but it enters into Palestinian territory, dividing the Palestinian community, pupils from schools, children from parents, farmers from fields, ill people from doctors."
"This is a wall that takes territory away from the Palestinian community: it goes up to 25km within the West Bank; the first section, of 150km, has already been constructed and has shut out 50 000 Palestinians from their territory."
"When it is completed, that figure will be 130 000."
"These figures, Mr President, were not made up by this Parliament but they were provided for us by the Israeli civil society and by Israeli non-governmental organisations, which remind us that 670 000 Palestinians risk being seriously affected by the construction of this wall and that 14% of Palestinian territory will be taken away from the Palestinian Authority."
"Faced with this reality, we believe that it is the wall itself that provokes anger, desperation and hatred."
"It is our duty to recognise this, Mr President, and we should not be surprised if this anger, desperation and hatred – God forbid – turns into violence."
"The day when we find ourselves counting the victims and the figures of such violence, we should also remember how much we contributed to the desperation, hatred and anger of these people."
"– Mr President, I believe we can only be pleased that the European Union is abstaining for once and being cautious in the kind of diplomatic jihad against Israel, positions having been so biased and often unjust in the past."
"Mr President, I too would like to see the security barrier come down and, once some of these elements have been repainted, see it end up as souvenirs and trinkets, just like other barriers."
"Let it disappear then, yes, but when it has no more reason to be there – for it is not there on a whim."
"This barrier is a response, a response to kamikaze terrorism."
"Having said that, once again, even if it is justified from the point of view of defence, there are things about it that can be challenged, that is true."
"But nothing is final, it is not a border, it does not signify an annexation."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, you like talking about the 1967 borders, but may I remind you that they were only ever cease-fire lines and they only began to be recognised when they were no longer effective."
"Everything out there is really provisional."
"Do not forget that."
"Of course I want the barrier to disappear, but unlike some barriers which kill, it is a barrier that saves."
"You have to remember the attacks that have not taken place, if I can put it that way."
"Think of the innocent people who would have been killed by the kamikaze attacks that these controls have thwarted."
"The real question about this barrier, Mr President, is this: should we stop it preventing deaths?"
"I think not."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the international protest against the anti-terrorist, or dividing, wall is starting to bear fruit."
"It appears that Israel will be shortening the wall, or partition, so that it does not cut as much into Palestinian territory."
"In that way, Mr Sharon is trying to turn the international tide that is opposed to his policy, but he will try to use the dismantling of the colonies in Gaza as compensation for the colonies within the wall on the West Bank."
"In that way, he can retain the largest settlements there after all and abandon the problematic Gaza Strip."
"He will thus once again foster goodwill in Washington and can quietly carry on with the annexation of the Palestinian territory, even though he thereby undermines the roadmap and makes his own plan the only viable one."
"He does not recognise the Green Line."
"This is unacceptable to the United Nations and, as Kofi Annan stated in November, this is very counterproductive for peace."
"Europe, too, should find this unacceptable, and I regret the Council’s attitude."
"A viable Palestinian state needs the agricultural land and the water sources, which are now being closed off."
"We must therefore maintain our international protest against the wall."
"Besides, Israel has the right to look for protection against terrorism behind the Green Line, but a new iron curtain will provide no answers in the long run."
"Where I come from, anyone who builds a wall has to build it on their own land; if not, the neighbour will call in the justice of the peace."
"This will shortly also happen in The Hague, where the International Court of Justice will rule on this wall’s legitimacy."
"Mr Sharon is now trying to create a smoke screen to mislead the world and make people forget the Geneva peace initiative."
"The question is now whether the International Court of Justice can act as justice of the peace in this case."
"In any event, the problem has now attracted much attention worldwide, and international pressure is being brought to bear – even in Israel, where the Supreme Court is now looking into the case."
"I hope that they will take the right decision."
". Mr President, once again, it has been valuable for the Council to hear the views expressed in today's discussion concerning the wall, as well as the situation in the Middle East more widely."
"Many of the points made correspond with the position of the Council, which I sought to summarise earlier."
"It must be clear from my previous statement that the Irish presidency will strongly hold to the view that the current situation is unacceptable."
"Members of this House know that I come from a small island where we know something about divides and walls and separation."
"We will continue actively to explore with all parties the possibility of resuming forward movement – even if through modest steps at the outset – in a process that has repeatedly stalled."
"I want to refer to a number of the points made during the course of the debate."
"As for the wider approach to the Middle East region, the effort to promote peace, progress and prosperity should in the first place have strong local ownership on the part of those in the region."
"Also, it must have an appropriately strong focus on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"After all, the continuation of the conflict is a central security reality for many people who live in the region."
"The renewed EU focus on the wider region would not bypass or set aside the benefits of existing mechanisms, including the Barcelona process."
"Mr Swoboda suggested that the European Union's voice was not being heard on the illegality of the wall."
"Let me reiterate where the Union stands in relation to the extension of the wall."
"It cannot accept that a fence or wall built on Palestinian land would best serve Israel's long-term security, nor did anything I have said suggest that this would be the case."
"The European Council has expressed its concern about the route envisaged for the security fence and the departure of the route from the green line in the West Bank."
"The appropriation of land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal, it is contrary to international law and it fuels tension."
"Furthermore, the restrictions associated with the security fence have resulted in unnecessary suffering for the Palestinian people and the deterioration of the economy of the Occupied Territories."
"The Union's voice on this has been absolutely clear in all international fora."
"The construction of the fence, or the wall, was also the subject of a United Nations General Assembly resolution on 21 October, which all EU Member States and the accession states co-sponsored."
"Another speaker, Mrs Lucas, called on the presidency to publish the submission to the International Court of Justice."
"She may not be aware, but the rules of procedure of the ICJ specifically preclude our making the submission publicly available."
"Indeed, the Court of Justice itself will not be publishing statements received, for the very same reason."
"Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, speaking recently in the Irish Senate, pointed out that the Israeli people need not live in a fortress, surrounded by hostile neighbours, where they are in danger when walking the streets or driving on the roads; where young soldiers – mere boys or girls – are placed at constant risk; and where a great part of their national resources are consumed by the burden of defence."
"Equally, the people of Palestine need not live in hopelessness and indignity; where young people are encouraged to blow themselves up; where homes are bulldozed and destroyed; where employment is scarce or non-existent; where people are not free to travel around their country; where immigration seems to offer the only escape route."
"We must all help the people of Israel and of Palestine to find the courage and wisdom to build a new peace; the courage to face down those who would reject compromise; the wisdom to understand that putting an end to the insecurity and suffering of their neighbours is in their own long-term interest."
"We can achieve this, and if we do achieve this, the Holy Land may become a land of peace and prosperity."
"Once again, I thank all Members for their constructive support and concern in this matter."
"I believe that the approach adopted by the Council is an appropriate approach."
"No Member of this House need have any concern or doubt as to the interest of this presidency in helping to resolve this issue."
"I come from a small island where we know something of the causes and costs of division."
"– We are obliged to the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"– The next item on the agenda is the statement by the Commission on corporate governance and financial supervision in the Parmalat case."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, speaking for the Commission, has the floor."
". The Commission welcomes this debate and broadly supports the content of various draft resolutions tabled by Parliament."
"Whilst the facts are not yet fully clear, the Parmalat case is deeply worrying."
"It is the latest in a growing list of major financial scandals of various types – in various places – over the last few years."
"The apparent size of this fraud is staggering, and the apparent complicity of a number of people from distinguished, liberal professions together with the failures of regulatory control are equally staggering."
"Scandal upon scandal will cumulatively weaken financial markets like the corrosive drip of a leaking fuel tank. Many sensible investors will pull out."
"Economic growth will be affected because the cost of capital will rise – the Enron affair has already shown that."
"So this matters to all of us."
"My first point is this: the financial services industry had better get its act together, and do so quickly."
"We need some real industry leadership to stand up and take charge, to clear out the crooks, expose their unscrupulous practices and curb excessive greed."
"If industry leaders are not prepared to do this, then regulators will have to do much more than perhaps they or we would like."
"If that is the result, then industry leaders cannot winge about regulation from Brussels."
"They will have brought it upon themselves."
"Industry leadership is lacking at the moment, quite frankly."
"Secondly – we already have a range of policies in hand which will go some way to improving matters in the future: measures in the Financial Services Action Plan – such as the Market Abuse and Prospectus Directives – which should be rapidly implemented; measures such as the new Investment Services Directive, which will help deal with some of the major conflicts of interest in the investment services business; the new international accounting rules which will enhance disclosure, along with the Transparency Directive – which we want adopted before this Parliament breaks for its elections."
"All these directives also enhance the powers of competent authorities to act and also to cooperate much more across borders."
"In my view, that means cooperating as well, in the same way, with foreign regulators – non-European regulators – in particular the SEC in Washington and also the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States."
"Capital markets today – as we all know – are global and regulatory cooperation must be global too to match them."
"Thirdly, in March I shall propose to my colleagues in the Commission a revised Company Law Directive on the statutory audit function."
"It will strengthen controls over the audit profession in the European Union with independent oversight; strengthened inspection; stronger ethical and educational principles and high quality audit standards."
"These four aspects will be contained in the revised Company Law Directive."
"As a result of Parmalat, the revision of the eighth Company Law Directive is likely also to include the following four elements: first, full group auditor responsibility for consolidated accounts of a group of companies; second, obligatory independent audit committees for listed companies – all 7 000 of them in Europe; thirdly, stricter auditor rotation requirements; and fourthly, strengthened sanctions."
"I am accelerating work in three other areas in the Corporate Governance or Company Law areas in order to have proposals ready, if possible, later this year."
"They are the following three areas: the role of non-executive directors; directors' responsibility for company accounts; full disclosure in the company accounts of offshore special purpose vehicles, including the reason why the company uses those offshore structures and a much stricter verification by the group auditor of their content."
"We are also working hard on the issues of conflicts of interest of financial analysts and looking again at credit rating agencies."
"The Katiforis report is of considerable help in that regard."
"Finally, the role and regulatory control of offshore centres need to be tightened."
"We are considering the options, although that is not easy."
"We expect to table in June the third Money Laundering Directive and we expect it to play a significant role."
"To conclude, this is a very important debate."
"We support the main lines of this resolution."
"We are working, resolutely, in that sense."
"We still wish for strong industry leadership and an appropriate dose of ethics."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the Parmalataffair is a systemic crisis because it was made possible by a world network of complicity and omissions, the key players of which were banks, financial institutions and external and internal control bodies, both public and private."
"I believe that the Parmalat affair gives a good indication of the negative aspects of the globalisation of financial markets, the internationalisation of which allows fraudsters to easily conceal and manipulate information."
"This shows how a necessary combination of transparency, efficiency and stability is all too often theoretical and, above all, fragile when faced with perverse desires rooted in a lack of ethics."
"I am sorry to say that the Parmalataffair is similar to far too many financial scandals that have been portrayed in the news recently: and for a start."
"It is unpleasant and difficult to have to admit it, but something in the world balance has gone wrong and has dragged everything into the abyss, including uninformed savers and operators, who were supposed to be on the alert and prevent this from happening."
"We do not want to deal with individual responsibilities, nor should we have to, because this is not our job; our job is instead to undertake to prevent similar cases from happening again."
"It is essential to combat infringements and fraud in such a way that financial analysts will not then find themselves in a situation where they have to advise their own clients to make criminal investments."
"Amongst other things, we have also looked over the Commission communication of May 2003 to the Council and to Parliament on modernisation of company law. In the motion for a resolution that we are presenting there are guidelines, which take into account the impact that the Parmalataffair has had and could have on its workers, savers, banks and the good operation of the financial system."
"It is our task to try to reverse this course, to try to protect the savings of millions of people and to regain the full trust of financial market investors."
"It is essential that we learn from this case and react in an appropriate way by objectively assessing what happened, by making projections in future and by not just hastily looking for scapegoats."
"This is about establishing what did not work, what the inefficiencies of the provisions are, about proposing solutions to them, and providing for new public control powers."
"We can have different political ideas on the aims of the regulation, on the production and distribution of income, but we must all agree on the fact that there must be no defrauding."
"Perhaps the crisis of legality is not just an issue of people but also of institutions, which are, perhaps, unsatisfactory."
"Perhaps the rules need to be looked at, re-thought and reviewed, and to do this we need to cooperate."
"The competent authorities for financial control of the different jurisdictions within the Union must cooperate."
"Cooperation is also called for with third countries; not just Europe but also the United States are part of this plan which is of primary importance."
"I also urge the Commission to monitor any new measure which concerns the role of rating agencies."
"I will take the liberty of again asking the Commission to incorporate into the action plan on corporate governance measures designed to prevent conflicts of interests, whether they be those concerning investments made by banks or other financial institutions in listed companies controlled by internal stakeholders or, rather, those concerning cases of financial analysts who work for investment banks and advise their clients to invest in companies which are provided with profitable services by their bank."
"Furthermore, we need to make shareholders more responsible and more involved."
"Guaranteeing optimum transparency before and after transactions is absolutely necessary for investors in the field of financial instruments."
"It is, therefore, desirable that a European authority is created to – impartially – examine European financial markets and to look into cases with cross-border implications, along the same lines as the recent modernisation of European competition policy."
"Furthermore, I call on the Commission to adopt a decision, as soon as possible, on the compatibility of Italian Government provisions with European provisions as regards the dairy sector in relation to the Parmalatcase."
"Companies in this sector, the historic contributors to the Parmalatgroup have for some time been in a state of extremely serious financial liquidity, which could lead to a crisis for the whole company."
"If the request for help were to be deemed counter to the rules on free competition, it would be the beginning of the end for a sector that boasts tradition and is of undisputed quality at European level."
"The Parmalatcase calls for a great sense of responsibility, above all at our level, at European level."
"There are three areas where we must act."
"I believe that we have drawn up a well-founded report and that the next Parliament will certainly be able to engage in better cooperation with the Commission."
"Mr President, our group appreciates both the speed with which the Commission has intervened on this particularly regrettable issue – especially for the Italian economy – and the sense of responsibility with which the Commissioner illustrated his proposals, which are urgent if the figures that we have to examine are genuine."
"EUR 15 billion represents a financial hole equivalent to 15% of the entire European Union budget. This is also the result of economic deregulation and of financial cynicism which – as Mr Fiori mentioned – many are guilty of."
"For example, major banks that betrayed the trust of their investors; international advisors, who often knowingly certified false accounts; monitoring bodies, which failed to monitor; and – if I may mention this, Commissioner – those governments that tolerate tax havens are also guilty."
"Many of these tax havens are controlled by Member States of the European Union."
"I will quote a few Italian statistics: 25 Italian companies control 400 off-shore companies; of these, 171 are based in Delaware, a small State in the United States of America, and 127 in Luxembourg, the nerve centre of the European Union."
"So then, what are we doing here in Europe?"
"I would like to propose, on behalf of Mr Imbeni too, an initiative to restrict banking secrecy."
"Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stieglitz mentions how the use of banking secrecy is often one of the factors of economic instability, and the European Union is always appropriately preaching transparency."
"I do not, however, want us to bow down to any such idols."
"We could propose that the international community finally bring a moral dimension to globalisation and, therefore, propose a global agreement on banking secrecy, to which we commit ourselves, by seeking to propose a ‘Kyoto for banks’ – if you will allow me to use the metaphor – in the interests of a ‘financial ecology’ and to finally bring some ethics into the global economy."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, you have realised – and you stated this – that the national control instruments are not sufficient: we urgently need global and supranational rules."
"We need to govern the financial markets and avoid conflicts of interest and perverse plots between banks and businesses."
"The European Union must swiftly look again at Community regulations, strengthen sanctions against fraud, intervene against the impunity of tax havens and lay down rules for the absolute independence of auditors."
"Such an urgent and sensitive issue perhaps warrants greater attention from us – from Parliament and the Community institutions – and not a simple communication."
"We are not proposing a Committee of Inquiry but perhaps an investigation promoted by the Conference of Presidents – and therefore with the authoritativeness of a Conference of Presidents’ initiative – an investigation that is entrusted, in an informal and voluntary way, to a group of MEPs and that can continue beyond the end of this parliamentary term."
"Its function would be to investigate and put forward a proposal in order to understand what happened, how it could have happened and what needs to be done so that it does not happen again, to avoid future events similar to that of Parmalat."
"Finally, Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, there are references in the Commission communication to shareholders, to the management, to relations between shareholders and the management, whilst there is little or no talk of the workers, who are the first to pay personally for the repercussions of tragic events such as that of Parmalat."
"We want a strong voice to come out of this Chamber to protect, guarantee and support the thousands of workers – from Parma to Sicily – direct employees and those in allied industries, who today risk losing their jobs and salary."
"I believe that an ethical dimension to the economy, which we were referring to a short while ago by recalling how much responsibility also lies with governments and the European Union, now implies continuing to consider protecting and guaranteeing the right to work as a key problem."
"Mr President, firstly, I want to thank Commissioner Bolkestein very much for his very clear, and clearly worded, speech."
"He could not have put matters better, for what we want to see are industrial leadership and ethical conduct – quite simply, proper behaviour."
"I am therefore very pleased with what we have heard from the Commission."
"I also wish to say thank you for the action plan for corporate governance and company law."
"This had already been presented last year, and it is of course splendid that the Commission was, in this way, ahead of its time. It is also encouraging to hear about all the initiatives discussed by Commissioner Bolkestein today."
"There is a need for that action plan, and there is a need for the Commission to put more resources into implementing it."
"Not only the Commission, but also Parliament and the Council must contribute resources, however."
"The unfortunate fact is that, on average, six to eight years elapse between a proposal’s being put forward by the Commission and its being implemented in all the Member States."
"A great many financial scandals can arise during that period of time, but, in its action plan, the Commission is repeatedly alert to issues of timing."
"Good corporate governance is open, transparent corporate governance."
"Part of this is, of course, good accounting."
"Another important factor is that of board members’ collective responsibility for financial, and important non-financial, decisions."
"Moreover, there must be better rules for scrutinising the various group structures we find among companies."
"Certain companies are constructed in such a way as to cause observers to feel that they have been placed in the middle of a labyrinth, with no red thread to facilitate movement backwards or forwards."
"Such arrangements are untenable."
"One thing we must not forget about is having a correct balance."
"It is no use repeatedly heaping rule upon rule and assuming that rules solve everything."
"The culture surrounding corporate governance is important."
"If the managing director is a scoundrel with criminal intent, rules do not help."
"It is no use putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of all the many honest companies."
"It is therefore important that what we agree upon is balanced and of help to everyone."
"Furthermore, investors must insist upon good corporate governance."
"The best means of implementing everything we are now discussing is, in spite of everything, the market."
"Pressure from investors is often the best incentive for sticking to the straight and narrow."
"All in all, then, we are on the right road. We just need to move up a gear and travel a little more quickly towards our destination."
"This monetarisation is clearly excessive because the production and trade that meet the people’s material needs are drowned in the speculative waters of international high finance. Meanwhile the informal economy flourishes, along with the criminalisation of the economy, in which shady dealing becomes increasingly prominent, to the detriment of social and economic development."
"This scandal is a further example of the pernicious effects of market deregulation and the unbridled movement of capital."
"Parmalat made use of every trick in the book: front organisations in tax havens, the benefits of special offshore regulations, hedge funds and forged documents and bills."
"This is how financial holes were concealed and tracks were covered, using complex structures and involving many subsidiaries, in order to carry out operations in the area of bonds and financial derivatives, with the assistance of international banks, cover-ups on the part of international auditing firms and rating agencies giving positive assessments."
"Thousands of jobs were put at risk, in the thirty-plus countries in which Parmalat operated, creating enormous difficulties for the thousands of milk producers who depended on the company."
"This is no isolated case, however."
"In the past few years alone, a number of financial scandals have taken place – Enron, WorldCom and Merck, in the United States; Crédit Lyonnais, Vivendi, Ahold, Kirch, Marconi and Equitable Life in EU Member States – which have had a devastating social and economic impact."
"Since this is a question of economic models, what is needed is greater stringency and tighter controls on financial derivatives, replacing mechanisms that are a product of, and whose raison d’être is, speculation."
"International efforts need to be stepped up to put an end to tax havens and to limit offshore operations. Financial instruments are needed to monitor the movement of capital, such as introducing effective taxation of stock market profits."
"What is most urgently required, however, is a return to the core values of production and labour."
"However considerable the problems of shareholders are – and they undoubtedly are serious – priority must be given to protecting jobs and to safeguarding workers’ rights and to ensuring their right to information, consultation and participation. In the case of Parmalat, compensation should be immediately considered for those milk producers affected."
"I should like to highlight the negative contribution of the EU in terms of monetarisation, and, specifically, the Financial Services Action Plan, which encourages the deregulation, liberalisation and integration of capital markets together with the dismantling of prudential rules and control mechanisms."
"It worries me, Commissioner, that you say that hasty and poorly thought through legislation may exacerbate, rather than solve, problems of regulation illustrated by large-scale cases, such as Enron and Parmalat."
"In spite of your ideological concerns and your reluctance to take risks, we cannot ignore the evidence staring us in the face, or the urgent need to address these problems effectively."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I do not wish to dwell at length upon the drama of Parmalat – Italy’s eighth largest company – which, according to the latest estimates, is in danger of costing thousands of workers their jobs and the Italian exchequer some ten billion euros."
"Echoing your statement, you have yourself observed that we had a joint resolution from Parliament on this subject."
"In the context of the various initiatives that you are announcing or that are under way, I should like to hear you say more about the responsibility you are going to have to assume as Commissioner and would ask you to tell us whether the proposals for directives you are preparing appear to you to be sufficient and commensurate with what is at stake, particularly on two points."
"First of all, I am keen, in response to my Liberal fellow-MEP, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, to emphasise that rules are necessary because there are fraudsters."
"If everyone were honest, there would be no need for rules."
"Rules are needed, therefore, because of fraudsters, and rules that apply to everyone."
"If we are to use directives as our instrument, we need extremely short transposition periods, and we need to make sure that all the Member States transpose these directives properly."
"At repeated yearly and half-yearly intervals, your own services prepare evaluation reports on the strategy for the internal market and do not fail to note that a good many directives are not transposed."
"I would therefore ask you if, in the case of subjects such as those we are discussing, legal instruments directly applicable to the Member States and without unduly long transposition periods might not be necessary."
"Otherwise, we shall be in danger of finding ourselves in the same type of situation in a year’s, indeed in two years’, time."
"On this matter, I consider that you and the College have direct responsibility when it comes to the choice of tool."
"I now come to my second point, and I have to say that I again deplore the fact that the Council is not present – I do not understand why the Council is present on some occasions and not on others – for I have already questioned the Irish Presidency about what it intended to do in this area."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Finance Minister was very evasive in his reply, saying that if people wanted to commit fraud, it was difficult to stop them, an opinion that I obviously cannot share."
"Where off shore centres are concerned, Commissioner, why not raise the issue of effective international regulation within the context of the WTO negotiations?"
"Indeed, the question has as much to do with world trade as with capital transactions."
"A number of countries are requesting new WTO rules where financial services are concerned."
"Do you not think that the European Union – the Council and the Commission – could take this debate to the WTO, where we have constraints in place?"
"Within the FATF, the OECD and United Nations committees, we have for years been discussing the problem of regulating off shore centres and, not to beat around the bush, of abolishing tax havens."
"Do you not think that it is time to move up a gear, or do we still have to wait for another ten financial scandals?"
"Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying that, in my view, we have here a unique opportunity to show Europeans how useful the European Union is."
"The Parmalat case is genuinely scandalous, as is the fact that the political authorities are not doing more and doing it more quickly, a course of action in which I would therefore encourage you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Parmalatcase, like the case in Italy, the case in the United States, or similar cases in Great Britain and France, is a sign of the crisis that has, for some time, been affecting multinational financial organisations. At the root of this is the huge and terrible gap between the real economy and the speculative bubble: a virtual wealth in paper form that hugely exceeds real wealth, based on production and on investments."
"There is another common thread to the cases referred to: that is to say the lack of, or insufficient, control by the qualified institutions: central banks, stock exchange monitoring commissions, credit institutes, professional inspection bodies."
"It is not a coincidence that when savers and consumer associations place a question mark over these bodies, they always repeat the same refrain. They say that they were not aware of the true situation, that they were in the dark about such illegal rigging."
"Alternatively, these institutions lie or the monitoring rules are so flexible – and, therefore, not very precise – that it is possible to interpret them in such a way that they enable major fraud. In the first instance, this is done by savers/investors, maybe with the compliance of the banks themselves, a matter to which we have, moreover, already referred in several questions on the problem of the speculative bubble."
"Although we spoke about this long before it burst, the European institutions also paid insufficient attention to it on this occasion."
"I am talking about compliance because a further fact that emerges from these cases is the conflict of interest suffered by credit institutes, always to the detriment of investors."
"In the preceding weeks, we had already presented a resolution to the Commission to get around the inadequate rules, in which we called for the initiative to be taken, at European level and for the purpose of protecting savers’ interests, to link all bodies charged with monitoring and controlling relations between businesses and banks and for an assessment to be made of the possibility of harmonising the current regulation in order to guarantee that ethical principles are applied, which means that inspectors must not be paid by those being monitored."
"The notorious cases of illegality that are disastrously affecting the investments of hundreds of thousands of savers give us the opportunity to intervene on behalf of independent professional consultants – whom we have already spoken about in this Parliament – and to urge the Commission to look into the possibility of creating a European register of such professionals."
"On the one hand, to try to resolve the serious issue of the conflict of interest by reducing the banks’ monopoly on advice and, on the other hand, to aim for a high quality professional qualification based on ethics and on proven experience in the sector in question."
"What we call for measures to support all Parmalatworkers and to compensate savers that were defrauded, in some cases, twice – not only by Parmalatbut also by those who advised them to make certain investments. We believe, however, that the Union must seriously face up to other potentially disastrous new consequences of the enormous gap between the real economy and the financial economy."
"Until measures are taken to reduce this gap, the risks will continue to loom."
"Mr President, setting up a Committee of Inquiry, which the European Parliament is calling for, could provide those useful elements that we did not find were sufficiently expressed in the motion for resolution, and give some specific and precise guidelines as to the instruments needed to prevent the reoccurrence of cases such as that of Parmalat."
"We believe that five billion bonds were issued by ParmalatFinance,based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, by a company with a modest capital of just a few thousand euro."
"In actual fact, they were not real bonds, but promissory notes, that some banks – including some very well-known ones – recommended from their counters to their clients – keeping quiet about their true nature which they could not, however, have not known about."
"As regards better informing the signatories, specific rules need to be provided for: the forms should contain a concise description of the product, and our request is that they also contain a report on the risk factor, specifying the characteristics of the bonds, something that is not currently planned for."
"There is still the issue of compensation."
"There is no point crying over spilt milk, we must think about recuperating the misappropriated sums and giving specific guarantees to savers in the case of collapse."
"Why do banks not have to respond directly and straight away when they have advised people, even shortly before a collapse, to buy ‘junk bonds’?"
"In corporate meetings, shareholders can also have a role to play in terms of monitoring but, because this is effective, there must be provision for it to be obligatory to publish the minutes in an information pamphlet on the measure that is the subject of the meeting."
"In the case in question, officials are already reporting huge difficulties in recuperating the sums, for example in US banks, because today US regulations allow US creditors to get preferential treatment."
"Genuine reciprocity therefore needs to be established between Europe and the United States in processes to confiscate assets and capital earned from activities involving financial crime."
"In an economic democracy, which is achieved through worker participation, why not provide for an obligation to have a representation, with a monitoring function too, of workers/shareholders on company boards of listed companies?"
"Mr President, as we have heard, the Parmalat case was a catastrophe for its employees, for investors, for savers, for its creditors, for its customers and indeed for the financial markets."
"It is our duty as legislators and policy-makers to see how we should respond to that and to see what we can do to try and prevent that kind of catastrophe from occurring again."
"How can we ensure that the whistle is blown on this type of criminal conduct before it reaches the catastrophic and disastrous proportions that it reached at Parmalat, before it goes on for years, as it apparently did at Parmalat?"
"I appeal to the House to ensure that our response is proportionate, is measured, and looks at the facts of what happened in a dispassionate way, that we have a thorough analysis of what happened, of what went wrong – if anything – with the regulatory system, and of how we can improve the legal and regulatory framework to try to prevent a Parmalat from happening again."
"We can be proud of the fact that this process started before Parmalat happened because, as people have said, there have been scandals throughout the world."
"Enron is the biggest, but there are others throughout the European Union."
"Few people were foolish enough to say 'well, Enron happened in the USA and we do not have any problems in the European Union'."
"If they said that they are obviously feeling rather foolish about it now, but that was not the general response here and in the Member States to the Enron crisis."
"We looked at what happened and responded to it."
"That will help us because we have prepared the ground to try to tackle a similarly disastrous event within the European Union itself."
"As many people have mentioned, we need to look at the role played by the professionals – the bankers, the auditors, the ratings agencies – that were involved with Parmalat, to see if in the future there is some way of ensuring that they are not taken in, that they are able to assist savers and investors in detecting this kind of fraud, and that they are properly regulated; and to examine whether further regulation would ensure that they are better able to detect this kind of fraud."
"But we should not make the mistake of trying to turn auditors and lawyers and ratings agencies into policemen, because that simply would not work."
"We need also to accept that the kind of obvious criminal and fraudulent conduct that we saw in the Parmalat case is something that can never be eliminated completely."
"No matter how effective and wide-ranging our system of regulation, you are always going to get fraudsters and criminals who will break the rules."
"We must focus on better enforcement of the rules and regulations that we have."
"In many ways, that is a question for Member States."
"They need to devote many more resources to their police forces, particularly those specifically dealing with financial crime."
"That is one of the biggest lessons we can learn from Parmalat."
"We do not necessarily need to introduce a whole range of new regulation, which may in the end just prove to be a burden on those many market participants who are completely honest."
"We need more cooperation between our national regulators, not a single European Union regulator."
"The Member States should devote more resources to fighting financial crime and having a large, effective police force to fulfil that task in the future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Enron affair – and this is one of the points on which I agree with Mrs Villiers – a number of people in Europe thought that this sort of thing was a feature of American, but not of European, capitalism."
"Well, the Parmalat affair demonstrates that wayward developments of a similar kind are not alien to twenty-first century European capitalism."
"We are, in fact, confronting something with implications far beyond those of the Parmalat case and concerning the adjustment of tools that, in reality, we have not basically altered since the nineteenth century, whereas the nature of capitalism has, for its part, changed so much."
"In the nineteenth century, capital and labour were the opposing forces in companies."
"Since then, capital has dispersed and, with great ingenuity, has discovered a thousand and one ways of making its presence felt."
"Meanwhile, there is no European or world market for labour, which continues to rely on its strength alone."
"We are concerned with four major problems: the issue of tax havens, that of the way in which capital is organised, that of the separation between financing and production and, finally, that of the fate of salaried and other employees."
"Nothing less."
"In this regard, I would thank you, Commissioner, for the proposals you are putting forward, for they are a small seed planted on the long road towards regulating world capitalism."
"That being said, I should like to emphasise two or three difficulties arising, in my view, from the proposals you have made."
"I take it that you do not share the view of Mrs Villiers, for whom the regulation of capitalism would require nothing more than having a policeman looking over the shoulders of every banker."
"As for myself, I agree with her on one point: there will always be scoundrels."
"There are, and always will be, scoundrels in the field of marine transport, and so too are there scoundrels in the financial sphere, which will never be rid of them."
"The thing is, not to give them a helping hand."
"At present, modern capitalism operates in such a way as to offer lifelines to the bad boys of the financial world."
"They take the form of tax havens, tax fraud and indecipherable capital structures."
"What we have the task of combating is this indecipherability, which prevents us from arresting those who are guilty."
"That is why we have to conduct a determined struggle against these tax havens by stepping up the pressure through every means at our disposal, whether it be embargoes or boycotts."
"If one country is boycotted because it does not respect human rights, why not boycott another for drawing a veil over fraudulent capitalist wheeler-dealing?"
"It seems to me that this is worth thinking about."
"Moreover, if there is a real desire to achieve transparency, a say must be given to those able to act as a counterbalance."
"Indeed, you cannot have ambitions to improve the way in which the operation of companies is regulated without granting more say to salaried and other employees."
"That applies to the debate we have had on Mr Katiforis’ report on rating agencies, and it also applies to the issue of the takeovers on which our Parliament has deliberated, not forgetting the issue of company boards of directors."
"On the latter point, it seems to me, Commissioner, that the document you have submitted to us, concerned with corporate governance, still falls far short of what we need."
"In conclusion, I wish to point out that the life of companies is too important a matter to be left to financiers alone."
"Mr President, the Parmalatcase is difficult to solve because we have not got to the bottom of the responsibilities and complex and ambiguous mechanisms that allowed it to happen."
"To consider it to be just an Italian scandal is a limited outlook."
"It is, in fact, an international affair of vast proportions, in which internationally important banks are involved."
"The losses that savers have had to endure are, however, very clear to everyone."
"It is them that we must think about and we must look into, and encourage, the application of adequate measures, such as specific types of insurance, able to indemnify small-time savers involved in the collapse."
"Moreover, what has been described as the largest financial and accounting fraud ever registered in Europe dramatically highlighted the serious lack of rigorous and effective rules that are capable of preventing cases of the falsification of company accounts which, in accordance with a recent Italian law, have been decriminalised."
"It is essential that, in a common market such as the European one where the Treaties state that the constitutional principles of free circulation of people, goods, capital and services apply, the Commission intervene in order to give greater protection to citizens against this type of fraud, and that it does so through Community measures that are capable of stepping up the monitoring of accounts audits for Union companies."
"This, however, is not enough. , chaired by Mr Di Pietro and part of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, calls for strict rules to be established at European level to prevent any type of unfair economic or financial assistance at a company or individual level among companies active in the 25 Member States and structures operating tax havens in ‘rogue states’."
"In particular, a strict economic embargo, binding in this sense, would force the whole of the international community, including the USA, to act in an honest manner, so as to be able to prevent the reoccurrence of unfortunate episodes such as those that we have been talking about."
"– Mr President, for years, the boss of Parmalat had to use the same language to his 36 000 employees, scattered among thirty countries, as all bosses use to their workers."
"They had to be told that it was impossible to increase their salaries, that staff numbers had to be reduced and that this was required in the interests of the competitiveness needed."
"Well, the workers of this company have seen how crude these lies were."
"They see they have been duped."
"How many salaries could have been increased with the EUR 14 billion that their boss embezzled?"
"How many supposedly necessary redundancies could have been avoided?"
"The last straw is that all those who have been complicit in these instances of embezzlement – the banks and administrations – will continue as before, while the company’s 36 000 workers are in danger of losing their livelihoods, and thousands of small dairy farmers are affected."
"Among the companies you claim are in the majority in behaving ethically and honestly, how many other Parmalats are there, however, that have still not been unmasked?"
"How, moreover, is it possible to find out?"
"How might people distinguish bosses on the make from those who claim not to be and, alongside the open gangster-style practices of the Parmalat bosses and of very many others, is it not, in reality, all large companies that engage in the hoodlum-like practice – legal in this case – of closing a factory by throwing the workers out on their ear, simply in order to make additional capital gains on the stock exchange?"
"Your laws give bosses and boards of directors dictatorial power over their companies."
"We are in favour of workers, consumers and the population being able to control companies, their accounts, the ways in which they realise their profits and the ways in which they use them."
"The community needs to be able to monitor companies on an ongoing basis and prohibit decisions that are clearly contrary to its interests."
"Tax havens do not exist only in the Bahamas."
"To abolish them here in Europe, banking and commercial secrecy needs to be abolished."
"Mr President, there are some cases where Europe is really needed, when swiftness of action is especially important and crucial in order to establish whether our institutions are really in a position to interpret the needs of citizens."
"This must be done in a visible and decisive manner."
"Of course, we are not the United States, Commissioner Bolkestein; our capacity for action is more limited, since it is restricted by national rivalries and various rights of veto, especially in those sectors that we are currently dealing with."
"We believe, however, that there is room for manoeuvre in the case of Parmalatand the Commission must use this."
"Basically, we need to move in three directions, which have, moreover, already been mentioned."
"Firstly, the Commission must put forward proposals on the behaviour of companies when they operate in tax havens to hide their dirty money."
"We believe that EU legislation can be put in place to attempt to curb and prevent this, because this was indeed one of the fundamental causes of the events at Parmalat."
"This, Commissioner Bolkestein, goes far beyond a proposal on money laundering."
"I am afraid that, in order to genuinely be on the side of consumers and savers, especially in such a politically sensitive period, the Commission should formulate a proposal that visibly supports them and that – I repeat – goes far beyond the proposals that have been presented today."
"Secondly, I would be pleased if Commissioner Bolkestein put forward a proposal to ensure that EU countries controlling these tax havens, that have access to them or that have particularly lax legislation in place on this issue, can be persuaded in some way to change course."
"Thirdly – as my colleague, Mr Jonckheer, has already said – what does Commissioner Bolkestein think of presenting the position of the European Union on these issues to the World Trade Organisation?"
"Mr President, as fellow Members have already said, the financialcollapse of the multinational Parmalat has constituted a very serious episode for Italy and has involved thousands of small Italian savers; it is likely to damage financial credibility and, in future, to create widespread distrust of our country amongst international investors too."
"One of the causes of this financial collapse was, primarily the approval of the false financial statements of the Parmalat Group by one of the major auditing companies, which is alleged to have hidden the real asset situation of the company."
"What is more, it is obvious that the other bodies employed for financial auditing – and – also failed to conduct the necessary inspections adequately and at the right time."
"Several of the most well-known credit institutes in global financial markets – both Italian and European – also appear to be involved in the affair; they issued an uncontrolled amount ofbonds that are no longer redeemable."
"For all these reasons, the Parmalat case has been described as the European , although, in fact, it is more serious than the US scandal, since US GDP is much higher than that of Italy."
"As we all know, the Parmalat collapse is, unfortunately, merely the latest in a long series of similar affairs that have occurred across Europe."
"So what can Italian citizens and European citizens, who are often the victims of this financial adventurism, expect?"
"I think that they expect urgent and tangible measures, both to protect the workers in the Parmalat Group, which is the specific case in point, and – more generally – to safeguard and compensate the savers involved in this collapse."
"Furthermore, they expect instruments to be put in place to prevent operations of this sort occurring in the future and to restrict the maximum exposure of small savers."
"Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to two final points: I think that the time has come to create an establishment for monitoring and control at European level – a sort of European Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – with the right to inspect and impose sanctions, under the direct control of the ECB, and designed to verify the efficiency and transparency of the equity market in order to protect investors as far as possible."
"Lastly, a black list should be established to ensure that tax havens are outlawed."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, I welcome the initiatives that you announced beforehand and those that have been taken recently."
"Credit is due to you for declaring, right in the middle of the affair, that Europe was not immune to that type of scandal."
"I would like to make it clear to everybody that the Parmalat scandal is not about a sound company destroyed by financial wrongdoing; unfortunately for Italy, the Parmalat scandal is a case of a fraudulent and inefficient business that someone tried to save through financial wrongdoing."
"Today, quite rightly, we have been talking at length about controls."
"I think that the issue that needs to be faced is that of the role of central banks in individual States."
"Italy has given its central bank certain powers as regards competition, and therefore antitrust lawsand plays a fundamental role in the running of banking activities and, as a result of those banking activities, in the industrial system as a whole."
"I think that this is an anomaly that needs to be eliminated and that Europe, the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Council must take measures to that effect."
"I also think that we have to act extremely cautiously, in response to the Parmalat scandal, when it comes to balancing controls and sanctions."
"It is all very well to increase controls, but we should not attempt to impose impossible restrictions on the financial market, which is crucial to Europe’s economic development."
"We are also looking at sanctions that, in the same way as controls, will serve to discourage fraudulent behaviour. In particular, we need to give consumers an important tool, class action, on the basis of Article 153 of the Treaty, which would be useful in discouraging fraudulent behaviour in any quarter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first we had Enron and WorldCom. Now, with Parmalat, Europe has caught a cold."
"The simple fact is that there are criminals everywhere."
"There are not only good people, there are also bad people, and we have made laws against bad people."
"Unfortunately, bad people sometimes break laws."
"That is why I do not see any point in reinventing the wheel now and considering yet again if we should perhaps forbid such things yet again."
"They were already forbidden."
"What we need is a rational analysis to establish where there may have been shortcomings in the supervisory system and what scope there is for fine-tuning legislation."
"I am very grateful, especially in the light of the statements made by the Commissioner and the Commission's proposals, which we are already aware of, that unlike America we in Europe do not intend to overreact but that we are instead trying, by means of individual measures, to improve the existing legal position. Our objective is not to totally prevent such things happening in future – that would be impossible – but to make them less likely."
"I believe that the proposals made by the Winter Committee in the Winter II Report aim very much in this direction."
"The Commission's Action Plan on company law has taken on board the essence of the proposals made in the Winter II Report."
"I do not wish to go into detail, for the simple reason that the Commission's Action Plan on company law is being dealt with by means of a special consultation involving a separate report to Parliament."
"I would just like to refer to two points, by way of example."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission is now to bring forward the Eight Directive in the foreseeable future, but I believe that regardless of the many good ideas it contains, we should perhaps consider if certain aspects could not be made a little more consistent."
"I think it is outrageous that it will still be possible for audit companies to both provide consultancy and carry out audits for large quoted companies, in Europe at least."
"I stand by the principle that if you audit you cannot advise, and if you advise you cannot audit."
"It would not in any case affect the market at all, because the cake would remain just as big, it would simply be sliced up differently."
"Against that background I very much welcome the fact that legislative proposals drawn up in America will also have an impact on international audit companies operating over here in Europe."
"In other areas I sometimes doubt whether the Commission's proposals make sense, for example the requirement in the transparency directive for mandatory quarterly reporting by companies throughout Europe."
"On that point I would just like to comment that companies like Enron, WorldCom and others all submitted such quarterly reports."
"Unfortunately, they were all false."
"That is why I do not believe that this instrument is really helpful."
"It is not a question of providing information overload, but one of obtaining the correct information that investors require for decision making."
"I shall conclude on that note and thank you for your attention."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his ‘A Short History of Financial Euphoria’, John Kenneth Galbraith denounced the belief according to which, and I quote, ‘economic success and intelligence go hand in hand’."
"The Parmalat affair is the perfect illustration of this because the founder of Parmalat appeared to have economic success."
"The financial world, the media and political circles were satisfied with the appearance of success, and neither the auditors, nor the bankers, nor the rating agencies, nor even the Italian regulators questioned the accounts published by Parmalat."
"The list of companies that have deployed, above all, their criminal intelligence to deceive euphoric financial markets has become extremely long in recent years."
"From Enron to Parmalat, there is no end of apparently respectable companies that have ended up by massaging their accounts so as not to suffer setbacks on the stock exchange."
"All these financial scandals are the product of the belief, spread by the markets, according to which it is possible, at no risk, to become very rich in a very short space of time."
"Now, large profits are generally the result of taking large risks and, when the risks produce not profits but losses, there is a great temptation temporarily to hide those losses in order quickly to offset them by a profit based on still greater risk-taking."
"By mobilising all the resources of financial engineering, losses are allocated to special vehicles, turnover inflated through phoney operations, such as Parmalat’s phantom sale of milk powder to the Cuban regime, and non-existent profits shown thanks to creative accounting."
"Faced with these scandals, the business world is still affected by the same short-sightedness."
"I was Parliament’s rapporteur for the Directive on market abuse and insider dealing."
"In that role, I asked around in financial circles and received an impressive number of lobbyists."
"Often – in fact, too often – I heard, at that time, that Enron was only an isolated case and a product of the irrational exuberance of the American market, but that Europe was quite different."
"We now know that criminal energy is divided equally between the two sides of the Atlantic."
"There is only one way of preventing financial scandals."
"Europe, the United States, Japan and all the important financial centres must cooperate."
"Transparency is needed, together with a constraining regulatory framework imposed also upon tax havens, offshore centres and other black holes of international finance."
"It is not a question of banning the Caribbean or Pacific islands from playing with the big boys and offering facilities to the business world, but of prohibiting the big American, European and Japanese banks from financing anything through bogus companies situated in unsupervised and unregulated islands, if these banks are unable to guarantee that these operations are lawful."
"The tool for achieving this should consist of new rules governing thecapital adequacy for banks, that is to say what is known in our jargon as the Basel II agreement."
"Conflicts of interest between the various supervisory and auditing functions etc. should also be avoided, but it is not a question of punishing the banks and other financial operators."
"Especially if we want it to have a social dimension, the market economy needs enterprising entrepreneurs and innovative financial circuits to fund them, but everything must be done to manage these markets in such a way as to ensure that employees, subcontractors, suppliers and shareholders do not become the victims of financial crime operating under the cloak of respectability."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the Parmalat collapse and other worrying financial crises before and after it have revealed the limitations of the rules governing our financial markets."
"As happened in the United States, on the crest of the affair, and in the United Kingdom, with its 34 defaulting scandals, in Italy too we immediately realised the need to introduce strict legislation in order to protect savers more effectively and – in a broader sense – to attempt to limit the discredit that would inevitably affect the financial market involved."
"In these cases, though, we have to put aside emotional reactions and, in particular, we should not allow ourselves to be swayed by the appearance, however serious, of what has occurred and by the incentives that may result from it."
"Similarly, I do not support exceptional measures, such as the possibility of a monitoring super-authority, because we would run the risk of creating a new body that would have difficulty in making any additional contribution to an environment that must be restructured."
"The measures in force have to be well implemented and certainly need to be redesigned."
"The bankruptcy law could also play a key role: the principle and the ‘suspect period’ should also play a role in both extraordinary administration and controlled administration."
"Furthermore, the credit system, which is certainly not entirely blameless in the case of Parmalat, would not be the sole arbiter of events. These would, however, be subject to the assessment of a designated judge."
"So, to continue on the subject of far-reaching proposals, we would need to increase the information available on all financial products available to the public, both in prospectuses and in communications and to eliminate the problem of the patchiness of the information on the different financial products available to the public."
"Transparency monitoring must be extended to everything, including banking and insurance products offered to savers, which contain a management input."
"The introduction of stricter areas of incompatibility to protect the independence of inspection bodies will be inevitable."
"In the case of bond-issuing firms, however, more needs to be done: documents binding on the company will need to be issued, stating what the company will do, when it will do it and what investment products will be used."
"Above all, though, in addition to accounts auditors, we will need to put in place a figure that has already existed in the United States for ten years: the ethics officer."
"This figure, who acts as a form of listener, or identifier of signals, must be able to pick up on even weak danger signals that escape the attention of analysts, who focus on evidence."
"When reading the work of the ethics officer, it is possible to identify not only management results, but on the outside the extent of the firm’s reliability."
"Thank you, Mr President. Europe’s Parmalat affair is no less devastating than the WorldCom case, the biggest US financial scandal to date."
"Naturally, I am especially concerned because the Parmalat scandal also involved an Austrian company."
"We have been discussing European audit mechanisms and financial legislation ever since the major scandals started in the US some three years ago."
"Unfortunately, it is still the case that some people want more controls, and others want less."
"On this issue – this objective issue – there is very little middle ground; instead, what we have is, in my view, a farcical political polarisation."
"Only yesterday, we were debating the issue of the ratings agencies."
"As usual in such situations, the conservatives voted against better and more stringent control mechanisms and thus accepted the audit and evaluation oligopoly as it stands, without particular comment."
"How should we view this situation from our perspective? That is a matter of taste."
"We will soon have the opportunity to vote on the directive on cross-border mergers of companies with share capital."
"It is already becoming apparent that there is an intention to steer this directive away from workers’ interests and better control mechanisms."
"Yet the current financial regulations in the EU enable financial systems that lack transparency to pursue fraudulent policies."
"Tax havens continue to be maintained, even though there have for years been calls for us to regulate them."
"It is quite unacceptable for Europe’s regulatory and control mechanisms to have as many holes as a Swiss cheese, opening the door to fraud."
"If we fail to take action now, we will forfeit the confidence of the workers who are now losing their jobs, as well as the investors in the capital markets – confidence that we want to secure."
"Mr President, the Parmalat scandal comprises a series of quite distinct crises."
"Firstly, there has been fraud of gargantuan proportions; secondly, there is a systemic crisis in the market place, and, thirdly, there is a very considerable social disaster in Italy, where most of those affected are living."
"I do not want to make any more remarks about either the fraud or the problems there may be in Italy."
"I would prefer to talk about its effect on the markets."
"We sometimes forget that one of the lessons of the twentieth century was the clear emergence of the evidence to support the view that markets are the best driver of prosperity and the best creator of jobs that we have seen in the world."
"It is therefore clear that the proper working of markets is essential to our collective future wellbeing."
"Those markets must be arranged so that criminality is difficult."
"However, just as it is impossible to organise the City of Strasbourg to make it impossible to be mugged, equally, it is impossible to organise the financial markets to ensure that there is no outside possibility of criminal fraud taking place."
"We should recognise that."
"Secondly, it is important that investors have confidence in the market."
"The claims and evidence that companies produce about themselves should be transparent, and the rules about the way in which that information is put together should be unimpugnable."
"I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks on his review of auditing and auditing standards."
"Equally, the governance of companies in the marketplace should be beyond reproach in terms of the way in which decisions are made."
"Again, I welcome the Commissioner's remarks in his statement."
"Furthermore, the claims that are made in the market and the advice that is given to possible participants in it must be such that there is no suggestion of impropriety."
"I must ask – and perhaps I say this as someone who is not standing in the forthcoming elections – can the same be said about the claims that the political parties are going to make in the forthcoming contest?"
"We must not forget either that even in the case of apparent large-scale losses by banks, it may well be that in a world where private provision of pensions is going to become increasingly the norm, it is the small people who get hurt by these disasters."
"It is the confidence of the small investor – either directly or through pension funds – which is so important for the workings of twenty-first century capitalism."
"Many speakers have mentioned regulation."
"Regulation is the answer, but not over-regulation."
"That must be the lesson that we draw from this crisis."
". I should like to begin by thanking Members of Parliament for their comments on what I said at the start of this debate, as well as for all other remarks made about this important issue."
"I would like to pick up on a few points at the closure of this debate in view of the importance of the subject."
"Firstly, I should like to say something on a truly important aspect of this case: offshore tax havens and special purpose vehicles."
"The full complexity of the situation in the case of Parmalat, as regards the use of offshore financial centres and special purpose vehicles, still has to be clarified."
"It is clear that the time has come to introduce some real order here."
"All these types of special operations ought to be subject to three requirements: firstly, they ought to be listed in company accounts; secondly, the company concerned should explain its purpose – why does that company have these special purpose vehicles? – and thirdly, the group auditor ought to be made responsible for checking that what is supposed to be there really is there."
"There must be greater control over these highly complex corporate structures."
"Along the same lines, the Commission will consider increased disclosure requirements in the context of the amendments to the fourth and seventh company law directives."
"These amendments are due to be adopted by September 2004."
"The question of the transparency of corporate vehicles and other legal arrangements is under consideration by the Commission, both internally within the European Union and also in the wider international context."
"Secondly, I would like to say something on auditing."
"It might well be asked whether there is a systemic failure of the audit function; although I believe that the auditor has an important role to play in ensuring proper financial reporting, it is not the only factor under scrutiny."
"It is important to take a broader picture of the responsibilities for financial reporting and the functioning of capital markets."
"Apart from auditors, we should also question the role of management, of non-executive directors, of corporate governance arrangements, of credit rating agencies – as mentioned this afternoon- and of investment banks."
"With regard to auditors, I believe there is a need for a stronger backbone to resist improper accounting and undue commercial pressure by the audited entities."
"Several measures that the Commission will propose in its forthcoming directive should help auditors keep their backs straight; for example, independence requirements, strong public oversight, communication with audit committees and serious external quality reviews."
"We may also ask whether there is an accounting issue."
"Apparently, the existing legislation in Italy on annual accounts requires neither a cashflow statement, nor much information about financial derivatives and their impact on the financial position."
"The fair value accounting directive, adopted in 2001, has been in force since 1 January 2004."
"That directive requires detailed disclosure about financial instruments such as the fair value of financial instruments, information about their extent and nature, and a table showing the movements in fair value."
"Annual accounts, prepared on the basis of international accounting standards, which require a cashflow statement and also fair values, would have better reflected Parmalat's true financial position and might have prevented fraud, at least on the scale which occurred."
"Then there is the question of corporate governance."
"Paragraph 7 of the resolution states that the political guidelines of the action plan on corporate governance are based mainly on transparency and disclosure."
"That is perfectly true, there are important transparency and disclosure initiatives, but the action plan also contains significant initiatives that are introduced via directives: it suggests appropriate and proportionate binding rules, for example on shareholders' rights and also on directors' liability."
"Regarding independent directors, the action plan announces a recommendation aimed at fostering their role, at least on a comply-or-explain basis."
"It is therefore true that disclosure is key."
"But consultations on the action plan have shown that it is doubtful whether an approach based on binding rules on the composition and role of board committees would make much sense."
"Lastly, to wind up this important debate, I should like to quote Mr Fava, who said that we need 'global rules'."
"I agree."
"It is not so easy to achieve global rules."
"Mention was made of the WTO: that is a possibility."
"The OECD does a lot of work in this area and we should be careful not to get ahead of ourselves."
"I should therefore like to support the OECD as much as possible in its work."
"Mr Jonckheer said that this is a golden opportunity to show citizens what we are here for."
"He is right because, as many participants in this debate have said, it is the small people who get hurt first and who lose their pension rights or their jobs."
"We must make clear that the European Union is taking the necessary steps in order to put a halt to this kind of practice and the forthcoming parliamentary elections perhaps offer a good opportunity to do so."
"Mr Jonckheer also asked whether directors will be up to the task."
"That is a very relevant question."
"Are the measures taken by the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament sufficient?"
"As Mr Lehne and Lord Inglewood have said, one cannot give any guarantees."
"It is impossible to give guarantees that something of this nature will not occur – guarantees only exist for vacuum cleaners!"
"That is something we cannot do, but we can make it very difficult for people with ill intentions seeking to continue their work."
"We are a little bit between the devil and the deep blue sea, on the one hand between Mr Jonckheer, who says we should make sure this sort of thing does not happen any more and, on the other hand, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Lehne and Lord Inglewood, who say it is impossible to completely avoid criminal fraud."
"However, we can make it harder."
"The actions undertaken by the Commission and by the European Union do indeed make it much harder for this sort of thing to happen again."
"I hope that all Members of this Parliament will join the Commission in making clear to the electorate that the Commission is doing its job and that Members of the European Parliament are also doing their jobs in order to prevent this sort of thing from happening again."
"Mr President, it is just a question of clarification."
"Commissioner, at the beginning of your speech, you spoke about offshore banking and you listed some criteria."
"Does this mean that you are going to present legislation on that?"
". Mr President, as I said the key sentence is: 'It is clear that the time has come to put some real order here.'"
"I mentioned three demands to be formulated: the special operations should be listed in company accounts; their purpose should be explained – why the company has them at all; and the group auditor must be responsible for checking."
"We are considering stronger disclosure requirements in amendments to the fourth and seventh Company Law Directives to be adopted in September, but I do not know whether those amendments are sufficient to control the whole business of offshore tax havens and special purpose vehicles."
"However, these three requirements which I have just formulated certainly must be met and we must find a way of doing this."
"To conclude this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions from six political groups.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0007/2004)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"The Commission's proposals concerning the olive oil, cotton and tobacco crops produced in the Mediterranean will, as they stand at present, lead to a drastic shrinkage in production and to the collapse of the associated social and economic fabric in the most disadvantaged Objective 1 regions."
"The problem is made all the more acute by the fact that there are no economic alternatives to those crops which have the same ability to generate employment and prosperity in the production areas."
"Furthermore, the Commission has not put forward any serious proposals with a view to retraining agricultural workers who lose their jobs and it is trying to modify certain COMs which have operated satisfactorily."
"Ever since the EU's structural policies were introduced, copious sums of money have been invested in nurturing this agriculture-based socio-economic fabric, only now for a substantial amount of that painstaking investment simply to be swept away."
"Will the Irish Presidency ensure that approval of the Commission's proposals is made conditional upon the submission of programmes and projects incorporating viable alternatives which will protect jobs and safeguard the existing social fabric?"
". In November 2003 the Council started its examination of the legislative proposals that the Commission had forwarded to it on 18 November 2003, aimed, , at integrating the support schemes for cotton, olive oil and table olives, tobacco and hops into the regulation on general reform of the CAP, which the Council adopted in September 2003."
"An initial general debate was held on these two proposals for regulations at the Agricultural and Fisheries Council on 17 December 2003."
"At that meeting the producer Member States' delegations voiced their misgivings about the impact which the proposed measures would have on the sectors concerned, in the knowledge that it involved crops located, for the most part, in Objective 1 areas with conversion difficulties."
"These discussions are ongoing and it would be premature to prejudge the outcome of the proceedings and discussions to be held in the Council."
"Nonetheless, the Council will pay special attention to the impact of the reform on regions whose agricultural economy relies heavily on crops covered by the reform."
"The Council and the Commission have taken due account of the European Parliament's opinion in the framework of the reconciliation procedure and will endeavour to find a balanced solution, taking into account the various interests at stake."
"– I would like to thank the Council very much for that reply, even though I feel it was not very full."
"I would like to ask the Council whether it would be willing to consider these measures due to be approved in the COMs as provisional, until we have the relevant information relating to the impact on employment in agriculture."
"I conclude from this response that there may be a negative effect on employment in agriculture and that the Council does not want this to come about. I would like to ask whether it would be possible for the Council to class these measures as provisional until their impact is evident."
". I take the point made by the Member."
"I am not sure whether one could attach the term 'provisional'."
"The presidency is aware that these proposals could have an impact on the social fabric, particularly in regions such as Andalusia."
"We are very concerned about that. The presidency is aware of the concerns of producer Member States that, if alternative enterprises are not available for farmers who are in receipt of decoupled or partly-decoupled payments, they could opt out of production altogether and that would leave the area with resulting damage to the rural fabric."
"I believe that is the point of the Member's question."
"The Commission has taken this into consideration in formulating its proposals."
"It proposes that a percentage of the producers' support expenditure be retained as national envelopes to address such problems."
"So there is an element of contingency built into the proposals."
"The Council will look closely at those elements of the Commission's proposals and will try to find a compromise solution that will be acceptable to producer Member States."
"As I have said, the Irish presidency is particularly aware of this type of potentially negative regional impact."
"We are very concerned that it should be minimised."
"Given the fact that much of the funding for the development of the third sector and improving social inclusion in Ireland and other Member States came from the European Union, what priority is the Irish Presidency giving to tackling social exclusion and poverty, and how does the Council intend to promote social inclusion in disadvantaged areas of the Union?"
". It is actually a very interesting and comprehensive question, as I would have expected from Mary Banotti."
"As Mrs Banotti is undoubtedly aware, the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 asked the Member States and the Commission in particular to take steps to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty; the whole Lisbon Agenda was not just focused on enterprise."
"It also agreed that Member States should coordinate their policies to combat poverty and social exclusion on the basis of the open method of coordination, combining common objectives, national action plans and commonly-agreed indicators with the aim of promoting more ambitious and effective policy strategies for social inclusion, together with a Community action programme to run from 2002 to 2006 and designed to encourage cooperation and the sharing of experience and best practice between the Member States."
"That was a rather long-winded sentence, but the proposition was focused in a way that makes sense."
"Following the submission of the second round national action programmes on social inclusion for the period 2003-2005, the Commission adopted its second report on social inclusion in December 2003."
"This report identifies key trends and challenges across the Union."
"It is also interesting in that it identifies group practice and innovative approaches of common interest. That will form the basis of the joint Council and Commission report on social inclusion which will be presented in March at the spring European Council."
"An important feature of the report is the increased attention given to regional and local variations in the levels of poverty and social exclusion, and how the underlying causes of poverty and social exclusion can vary from region to region."
"I suspect that this was an issue that was very much in Mrs Banotti's mind when she framed her question."
"On a regional basis, in particular, declining regions with negative migration, high unemployment and increasing dependency contrast with problems of congested and growing regions where issues of accommodation feature more highly."
"There are differences and regional disparities which feed into the overall picture."
"The issue of marginal rural areas with ageing populations, poor services and higher dependency levels is also highlighted in the study."
"In addition, specific emphasis is being given to the particular concentrations of poverty and multiple deprivation in communities, particularly urban communities, for example amongst migrant populations."
"The point I am making about poverty is that there are regional differences and disparities, as we are all aware."
"This is the background and against this background the report stresses the importance for Member States to develop integrated and coordinated strategies at local and regional level."
"This is particularly important in communities facing multiple disadvantages."
"Such strategies should adapt policies to the local situation, facilitate the mobilisation and involvement of all actors – including the third sector – and ensure more accessible and quality services for the poor and for socially-excluded citizens."
"As far as the Irish presidency is concerned, the presidency will take all necessary steps to ensure that the Union's social inclusion goals are fully reflected during the course of the preparation and in the follow-up to the spring European Council."
"For the first time, for example, in March 2004, the meeting of the Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will forward to the spring Council a key messages paper which will include its views on the issue. It will also report on the Lisbon goals relating to social protection and employment policy, including the goals of combating poverty and fostering social inclusion in Member States."
"Finally, the Irish presidency will take a number of initiatives to assist Member States to develop further policies and programmes to combat poverty and foster social inclusion."
"There will be three specific conferences during the course of the Irish presidency."
"The first of these is to be held on 1 and 2 April in Bundoran in County Donegal, a particularly appropriate location given its regional position."
"It will address reconciling mobility and social inclusion and the role of social and economic policy."
"The second will be held on 13 and 14 May in Dublin: the Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe Conference."
"This will include a discussion on the family as a focus of social inclusion and social cohesion."
"The third will be on 28 and 29 May in Brussels."
"It will be a follow-up to a previous conference."
"It will be a special meeting of people from European Union countries who have experienced poverty."
"The aim of this conference will be to develop further ways to promote the participation, at all levels, of people experienced in poverty and to promote the creation of structural networks to facilitate this."
"I am sure the Member will agree with me that in framing policy, no matter how good policy-makers are, it is only by listening to people who have had the experience on the ground that you really make policies which are focused efficiently and effectively on the needs of families and communities in poverty."
"Mr President, I hardly dared to think that I would get such a long and comprehensive answer to what was in fact a three-line question."
"It was really a trap for the Minister because naturally I am interested in what is happening throughout Europe, but I am particularly interested in what is happening within my own constituency, where there is considerable concern that the Irish government is in fact not fulfilling previous promises to various groups that have put considerable effort into devising programmes and projects under this heading."
"I refer particularly to Dun Laoghaire, Rathdown, which in many cases is recognised as being an affluent area but does, of course, have serious pockets of disadvantage, which local organisations have made a significant effort to address."
"I am very glad to hear that the Irish Government and presidency are as committed as the Minister has said."
"Minister, what are you going to do closer to home to ensure that many of these projects that are extremely well thought-out are actually going to survive?"
". I am sure the honourable Member would not want me to dwell on the excellent policies – in particular the social inclusion policies – that the government of Ireland has recently introduced, but would perhaps want me to make sure that I address this appropriately in a Council dimension."
"In my reply I made the particular point that even in affluent areas – indeed the Member mentioned an area which is generally perceived as very affluent, and quite rightly so – there is poverty and deprivation."
"One of the issues we face in Ireland is that, in many ways – particularly when people produce statistics to support the kind of contention which has just been made – we are the victims of our own success; that is one of the charges which is made."
"I am aware that some of the studies focused on in the honourable Member's question have suggested, for example, that in Ireland a lower proportion of GDP is devoted to social protection than in the rest of the EU."
"The figures often used are 14% or 14.7%, compared with an EU average of 27.5%."
"That is where some of these basic comparisons are made."
"That is, however, a statistical aberration if you look in detail at the statistical base on which the comparisons are made."
"Ireland's GDP, for example, is up to 15% more than its gross national income."
"That is very unusual in a Member State."
"It arises largely because of the nature of our economic development, as the honourable Member will know, and arises predominantly because of repatriation of capital funds."
"Social protection, as a percentage of GDP, would be over 70%, which is a more realistic indicator."
"Rather than get involved in a big statistical debate, the point can, and should, be made that poverty and pockets of poverty will be found in any society, irrespective of how affluent it is."
"That is why anti-poverty programmes must be more strategically focused and based on listening experiences, and we in the Irish presidency are trying to achieve this."
"Poverty is very much a relative issue."
"Any objective observer would say that most Member States – including my own Member State – have done extremely well recently."
"However, one always has to be focused on the specific type of poverty which was addressed in the supplementary question and which I sought to address in my original response."
"Individual pockets will inevitably occur."
"However, to get back to reality, the situation in the place we both hail from is rather better than the prognosis sometimes suggests."
"In September 2001, the Eritrean Government banned independent newspapers."
"Ten journalists, including Dawit Isaac, were imprisoned."
"Dawit Isaac is both a Swedish and an Eritrean citizen and was one of the founders of Setit, Eritrea's first private newspaper."
"The government in Eritrea refuses to say where Dawit and the others are."
"According to the Eritrean Government, he is being held in custody for reasons of national security."
"Dawit Isaac has not yet been allowed to meet representatives of the Swedish authorities and there is growing concern that he is not alive."
"In what way is the Council prepared to exert pressure on the Eritrean Government to ensure that the fate of Dawit Isaac, an EU citizen, is clarified and his family and Swedish authorities are allowed to meet him?"
". I am aware of this case."
"The Council remains deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Eritrea in general, not just this specific case."
"The European Union's relations with the Eritrean Government have progressed over the last two years, after the difficult situation in late 2001, and a dialogue on the internal situation and on the peace process has been re-established. That is very welcome."
"In meetings at local level the heads of mission have expressed, on several occasions, the Union's concern at the imprisonment of a number of people – among them many journalists – and the suppression of the independent press."
"Requests that those arrested be either charged or released have been reiterated."
"In October 2003 the Council welcomed the recent steps taken by the government of Eritrea to restore a climate of general communication and to develop a meaningful political dialogue with the Union."
"The EU also called upon the government to operationalise the dialogue, which is based on democracy, the rule of law and other essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement."
"In this context the Council will continue to raise individual cases, such as the case mentioned, with the government of Eritrea."
"I reiterate that the issue of detainees has been formally raised within the framework of political dialogue."
"The Italian presidency specifically raised cases such as that of Mr Dawit Isaac – who is of dual nationality – directly with the Eritrean authorities."
"The Irish presidency will do everything that it can to support the hard work of the Swedish authorities who have been attempting to secure information on – and, more importantly, access to – Mr Isaac."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the Irish Presidency for its answer and also sincerely welcome Ireland as the new country holding the Presidency of the European Union."
"Specifically within the area of human rights, the EU can do significantly more than can be done by the governments of the individual Member States, for example those of Ireland or Sweden."
"I am therefore pleased about your commitment to human rights in Eritrea."
"From the Irish Presidency’s answer, I understand that no new information has appeared."
"I would appeal to you, before your Presidency ends at the beginning of the summer, not to spare any effort whatsoever when it comes to obtaining more details concerning the Swedish-Eritrean journalist, Dawit Isaacs."
"We have warranted, and increasingly deep, concern regarding his fate and fear that he may no longer be alive."
"I would appeal to you to do everything you can to ensure that Dawit Isaacs returns to Sweden alive."
". I can well understand the concerns here."
"It has been some time since we have had news of Mr Isaac."
"All I can do is reiterate the point I made: the Council reaffirms very much the European Union's commitment to and respect for human rights."
"In fact, as the Member mentioned, human rights are not determined geographically; they are a universal fact of life, and every state with which this Union has any contact must be aware of our concerns in this regard, particularly where a person holds dual nationality which involves them being a citizen of an EU Member State."
"I can well appreciate and support the Member's comments."
"Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on how the Council sees EU relations with South Africa developing during 2004?"
"Does the Council consider that the EU and South Africa can constructively work together to mobilise and coordinate EU and international support for the Great Lakes Conference on Peace, Security, Democracy and Development, the convening of which the UN Security Council first supported as long ago as October 1994?"
". I would like to thank Mr Collins, who has a long-held and active interest in all matters relating to Africa, and indeed a very distinguished record in this particular regard."
"The European Union sees South Africa as a major partner in its relations with Africa, not only in bilateral terms but also because of its role in SADC, in the African Union and in general in conflict resolution in Africa."
"South Africa has successfully organised and chaired conferences to solve the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Burundi, and this month the EU paid tribute to South Africa's decisive contribution in the conclusion of the political agreement with the Comoros."
"South Africa has also contributed peace-keeping troops within UNAC-mandated missions to such an extent that the country has become the largest contributor to peace-keeping operations in Africa, and that by any standards is an extraordinarily distinguished record."
"The European Union has recognised these activities through public statements and has helped South Africa to finance its deployment with the African mission in Burundi, since it is a considerable financial drain on a country like South Africa, which still faces significant internal challenges – poverty, unemployment and of course the HIV/AIDS pandemic."
"South Africa has played a very helpful and positive role in getting the EU-Africa dialogue back on track after the planned summit in Lisbon was postponed."
"South Africa is also a key supporter of the NEPAD initiative."
"In the coming months under the Irish presidency of the Council, we will provide a number of occasions to deepen the dialogue with South Africa."
"Following the political dialogue meeting in the margins of the fourth meeting of the EU-South Africa Cooperation Council in Pretoria in December 2003, the presidency is organising a senior officials' meeting in South Africa early in its term, as well as a ministerial troika, a meeting which will be held in Dublin."
"The meetings will allow an opportunity to deepen our dialogue and to discuss issues of mutual concern."
"2004 is a particularly important year for South Africa as it celebrates ten years of democracy on 27 April."
"It is expected that EU Member States will be represented on this important occasion."
"Such an occasion is a cause of pride in South Africa, and we should share fully in that country's pride and in its achievements."
"A planned conference on the Great Lakes is a UNAU initiative, building very much on African ownership."
"Ibrahima Fall, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, is responsible for the organisation of this conference and prepares it together with national preparatory committees in the seven core countries."
"The EU Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region has offered his assistance and participated in some of the preparatory meetings."
"We will remain focused on this important conference which will seek to bring peace fully to this troubled region."
"Let me again assure the honourable Member and you, Mr President, that the Irish presidency will engage with South Africa and other key African partners on this very significant and important issue."
"I would like offer my thanks and appreciation to Minister Roche for his comprehensive reply, which I welcome."
"It is something that we will be able to refer to time and again in future."
"I would like to say to the Minister that we must take into account, when dealing with South Africa, the fact that Zimbabwe is a country neighbouring South Africa and the political situation there is certainly a cause of very grave international concern and is an issue which has been raised on many occasions."
"Could the presidency explain how it views the future relationship between South Africa and Zimbabwe, how it views the relationship between the EU and Zimbabwe, and could it say what effort the EU can make to bring about attitudinal change by the authorities in South Africa, to try and come to terms, in a pragmatic way, with the dreadful situation existing in Zimbabwe, which they have not yet faced up to?"
". Mr President, that is a very interesting question."
"It is, as the Member has suggested, critically important that the European Union engage with South Africa on the sensitive issue of Zimbabwe."
"Issues in Africa cannot be resolved by people externally wagging fingers."
"The European Union acknowledges the leading role of South Africa, not just on the Zimbabwe issue but generally on the continent."
"It has a particularly significant role to play in its own southern African region."
"Therefore, we will engage bilaterally with South Africa on the issue of Zimbabwe, as we do with the Southern Africa Development Community of which South Africa is the leading member."
"It has been agreed with both SADC and the African Union that Zimbabwe should be discussed as an issue of mutual concern."
"To take the point made by Mr Collins, the crisis in Zimbabwe directly affects its neighbouring countries and affects South Africa too."
"The impact of the situation in that troubled land on its surrounding countries has been the subject of discussion in the EU-Africa Ministerial Troika as recently as November 2003."
"The recent European Union-SADC joint committee of senior officials also discussed the issue."
"In our political dialogue with South Africa last December, there was a constructive exchange of views in relation to Zimbabwe and the South African side acknowledged EU humanitarian assistance to that troubled state."
"To return to the point made by Mr Collins, I absolutely agree with him."
"A part of the key to resolving the problems in Zimbabwe will be found in South Africa."
"South Africa is a key player and the Union, as Mr Collins suggests, must engage with South Africa in that regard."
"– We know that business relations can also be a basis for improvements in political relations, and so my question is this: are there any plans to enhance the overall framework for business relations between small- and medium-sized enterprises or family companies between Europe and South Africa, because that could form a basis on which to create, in the poorer regions, prosperity – which is ultimately also the basis for building peace?"
". 'Yes' is the obvious answer."
"Better business relations very frequently come after peace processes, rather than before them, but clearly anything that could contribute to the economic wellbeing of the particular area would be significant and important."
"There is no particular initiative in mind at the moment with regard to SME involvement in that part of the continent."
"There are a number of areas that would be of significance during the course of the Irish presidency."
"We do not have formal agendas but we are looking, for example, at a review of South African developments in the context of the tenth anniversary of freedom and at a review of EU developments, particularly enlargement."
"We will also be looking in terms of developments in the African Union and in the New Partnership for African Development."
"The formation of the African Union and NEPAD is another important initiative."
"There is no substitute for African states taking ownership."
"Africa will have to take ownership but we in Europe have to support Africa in that."
"There is no substitute for African states taking ownership of the continent on the basis of a united approach."
"Initiatives such as the African Union and NEPAD are of great importance."
"One of the ambitions of the Irish presidency is to raise issues relating to Africa higher up the agenda of the European Union."
"It would not only be positive in itself for Europe to take a more active role and interest in Africa, but Europe also has some moral responsibilities in the matter."
"Question No 5 has been withdrawn."
"As the Council is aware, the EU's Youth Programme provides for mobility and non-formal education for thousands of young people aged between 15 and 25 years and is open to youth in 30 European countries."
"It offers possibilities to young people in the form of both group exchanges and individual voluntary work as well as support activities."
"In the context of ensuring that the European Union takes the lead in protecting young people participating in such programmes from the risk of child abuse, and aware of the Irish 'Code of Good Practice: Child Protection for the Youth Work Sector' (September 2002), will the Council take immediate action to ensure that a child protection policy or strategy is incorporated in the Youth Programme, and will it propose the adoption of a resolution on the issue at the next Council of Youth Ministers, and will it also take the necessary action to ensure that a high level task force on the issue of child protection in the context of the review of the EU's Youth Programme is established?"
". That is a very interesting question – as I would expect from one of the more youthful Members of this House."
"The Council will begin its discussion of the Commission's proposal for the post-2006 Youth programme once it has been formally adopted by the Commission and forwarded to Parliament and the Council."
"In the meantime, it would not be appropriate for the Council to prejudge in any way the content of the proposal, which is entirely within the Commission's initiative."
"In parallel, the presidency will take forward work on the new generation of European education, training and youth programmes."
"The presidency programme in the youth field includes a draft resolution on social inclusion with regard to young people which will, , invite Member States, in pursuance of the social integration issues contained in the White Paper on Youth, to develop strategies and proposals to ensure that meaningful social inclusion measures are developed in the context of youth policy."
"I should also like to underline that the Council is conscious of the need to protect children against exploitation in all forms."
"This is an area in which the Council has adopted a number of measures, in particular, on 22 December 2003, a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"The framework decision obliges Member States to punish specific conduct linked to the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography as criminal offences under their individual national laws."
"Thank you for that answer, President-in-Office."
"You touched on some of the issues that I wanted to ask in my supplementary."
"As new communications technologies – the Internet, mobile telephones and so on – become available, we see cases such as those reported recently in Ireland, France, Italy and Germany whereby pornographic images of teenagers in schools were being distributed via mobile phones amongst fellow pupils."
"Can you lay down any specific proposals to be brought forward during the presidency, not only to tackle this in the legislative sense, but also with the aim of building partnerships between those involved in the industry on the technical as well as the distribution side and to put some of the responsibility and emphasis on those players to manage the way these networks operate?"
"."
"Mr Crowley is correct: modern technology and the evolution of modern technology bring a particular challenge."
"The cases which have been highlighted, for example in the Irish national media and the media in other countries, illustrate just how difficult it is for Member States to keep abreast of technologies and the abuse of technologies."
"The protection of children – particularly in terms of the Internet and other evolving technologies – is clearly something to be concerned about."
"With regard to pornography, and the actual peddling of pornographic images – whether on the Internet or via the new mobile phone networks – the framework decision of 22 December 2003 on combating sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is relevant."
"According to the framework decision, each Member State should take the necessary measures to ensure that all forms of child abuse are punishable."
"What the framework decision had in mind – and this again illustrates how correct Mr Crowley is – was the exploitation by commercial interests of technologies."
"What it did not have in mind, clearly, was the type of abuse that has been highlighted in the press commentary to which Mr Crowley has drawn attention."
"The focus is obviously on prohibiting commercial exploitation and commercial abuse of new technologies as a form of child pornography and exploitation."
"The proposals provide that in respect of offences concerning child pornography, each Member State should take the necessary measures to ensure that the production, distribution, supply and acquisition of child pornography are punishable."
"This will touch on the specific point that Mr Crowley was making about the new technology of mobile phones with photographic or video capacity."
"The framework directive is able to address the type of problem that he highlights."
"It makes the primarily responsibility in this regard for dealing with issues as they arise a matter for each individual Member State."
"One problem which of course affects young people in particular is unemployment."
"Unemployment gives rise to certain activities that are undesirable."
"The President of Eurochambers, Dr Leitl, recently said that unemployment is quite unacceptable as a matter of principle among young adults in the 15-25 age group, and that they should have a choice – either work or study – so that they can integrate into society."
"Do you think this type of initiative could also be launched within the Youth programme?"
". The honourable Member is correct because unemployment, youth unemployment in particular, is a particularly difficult area."
"Part of the overall, general Lisbon process is to address unemployment at all levels."
"A famous political leader in my own country once said that a rising tide lifts all boats, in other words, that the best answer to poverty and the best answer to unemployment is to create jobs and to create the appropriate economic environment."
"Within the Council's working party on promoting good practice in child protection and youth work across Europe you will find a reference to creating more coherence across policies, creating more coordination and cooperation in the formulation of policies of a social nature to address difficulties that appear in this sector. That call includes policies in relation to housing, education, training, social welfare, employment, health issues, crime prevention measures and many others."
"Poverty produces many ugly results and when poverty affects young people, particularly in a modern society, it poses specific challenges for policy-makers, as the honourable Member has suggested."
"I take note of his comment and his suggestions."
"Question No 7 has been withdrawn."
"A recent consumer survey organised by the Department of Agriculture and Food in Ireland reveals that most consumers want specific country of origin information in relation to all meat sales."
"What is the Council's position on extending beef labelling regulations to the food service sector?"
". I am sure we would all join in sending good wishes and a speedy recovery to Mr Fitzsimons: a colourful man."
"Mr Hyland asked a very important question, given some of the scares about foods, in general, and health risks."
"The Council is aware of the concerns that have been expressed by Mr Hyland. However, a proposal from the Commission, which would provide the basis for a detailed examination by the Council, is still awaited."
"The question anticipates something that will happen."
"I understand that shortly the Commission will submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of current rules on beef labelling that will examine, in particular, the issue raised."
"The Council will then have the opportunity to discuss it in depth and will wish to ensure the greatest possible protection of consumers' interests."
"I should like to make a further remark to my good friend Liam Hyland on this matter."
"The whole issue of labelling and of how labelling and consumer protection are interrelated has been something that Mr Hyland has been very active in for years."
"His question anticipates something that the Commission is about to do."
"His thinking has been in advance in this area for such a long time."
"In his question he identified an area that will require attention from the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"With such very kind comments from the President-in-Office I am almost sorry that I have announced my retirement from the European Parliament."
"As we have seen with the recent outbreak of avian flu in Thailand, the question of country of origin is one of genuine concern to European consumers."
"If proper traceability exists, then every food outlet should know the country of origin of the meat and other food products it serves."
"I know, and I am sure the minister knows, that producers and consumers in my own country, Ireland, are concerned that many restaurants are not able to provide this information."
"Apart from the safety and quality issues, this denies the consumers the right to support home or European production as opposed to third-country production."
"My supplementary question is: does the Council accept that consumers had valid concerns in this area?"
"I know now that it does and I am grateful to the President-in-Office for acknowledging this fact."
"What further action can the presidency take to ensure that this issue is addressed in future proposals on labelling?"
"I know the Council will have a very positive input into the eventual outcome of this vital area of consumer concern."
". As one of Liam Hyland's many satisfied constituents all I would like to say to the House is that I too am sad that he has decided to hang up his spurs in this House."
"I have no doubt whatsoever that he will take his extraordinary energies and talents and employ them very well elsewhere."
"Ireland's gain in getting Liam back full-time will be this House's loss."
"The Member is absolutely correct, because there are valid concerns about food safety and about the issue of labelling and the issue of traceability."
"For example, the BSE and foot-and-mouth scares shook consumer confidence right across Europe."
"The recent issues relating to avian flu mentioned by Mr Hyland have certainly shaken consumer confidence."
"In fact, it is not just an important issue: consumers have a right to be informed on an ongoing basis on any issue that is significant in terms of food safety."
"The Irish presidency intends to facilitate the discussion of the labelling issue – which is the core of My Hyland's question – when the Commission presents its report, which we hope to see in the near future."
"We are particularly concerned to get this matter on the Council's table as soon as possible."
"In fact, in Ireland a detailed study on the issue was carried out by a specially-established food labelling group."
"Arising from the report of this group my colleague, Minister Walsh, Minister for Agriculture and Food, wrote to Commissioner Byrne in the autumn of 2003 and suggested that labelling regulations, specifically beef labelling regulations, should be extended to the catering sector."
"This is the very point that Mr Hyland has been making."
"Consumers have an absolute right to know where beef comes from and they have an absolute right to know what has gone into it because the adulteration of food products is a very serious matter."
"My colleague, Minister Walsh, has asked that concerns in this matter be taken into account when the Commission is drawing up its report, and we look forward to the Commission communication in this regard sooner rather than later."
"Does the Council agree that fishermen and their representative organisations must be allowed greater participation and involvement in the decision-making process of the common fisheries policy?"
"Does the Council agree that in order for fishermen to have confidence in the scientific advice which is used to take fisheries management decisions, there must be closer links developed between fishermen and scientists to improve the transparency of scientific advice?"
"Does it also agree that regional advisory councils, which will include fishermen and their organisations in the decision-making process, are the way forward?"
". This is a question from Mr Ó Neachtain: a good west-of-Ireland name."
"The Council shares the view of the honourable Member that fishermen and their representative organisations not only should but must be allowed to have greater participation and involvement in the decision-making processes of the common fisheries policy."
"This is one of the principles agreed in the reform of the CFP adopted by the Council in December 2002."
"Closer links between fishermen and scientists would improve the transparency of scientific advice and that type of link is also to be encouraged."
"The Council believes that regional advisory councils – RACs – are the way forward."
"As the President of the Council said to the Fisheries Committee in January, these regional advisory councils will provide a forum where all stakeholders can come together and discuss issues of concern."
"This process of dialogue should gradually lead to greater mutual understanding and trust."
"A few years back, as a Member of the Irish Parliament, I chaired a parliamentary committee which looked at the difficulties which the fishery industry had relating to officials in various regulatory agencies in Ireland."
"One of the suggestions we made at that time was that the very type of dialogue which Mr Ó Neachtain has actually been promoting in the fishing industry is centrally important if both actors are to understand their respective roles."
"The Council aims to adopt the decision on establishing the RACs as soon as possible once it has heard the views of this Parliament on the matter."
"The Council looks forward to receiving these; again, sooner rather than later."
"I know that Mr Ó Neachtain will make a distinguished and very vigorous contribution to that debate."
"I want to thank the President-in-Office for his comprehensive reply and also for his support for the principle of regional advisory committees."
"I believe strongly that this new measure, which is included in the common fisheries policy for the first time, will be to the overall advantage of the fisheries sector in the years to come."
"Does Minister Roche foresee, if it is successful, that this would become a more involved part of the common fisheries policy and would lead to fishermen and stakeholders having a statutory role in the development of the CFP in the future?"
". I should like to thank Mr Ó Neachtain for that."
"The response to his supplementary question was implicit in my response to the original question."
"The presidency indicated clearly last month that the regional advisory councils would provide an important forum for all stakeholders."
"There are issues to be resolved but I would agree with the general tenet that consulting stakeholders in the fishing sector is critically important,"
"The Irish presidency will be pushing forward the issue of how we communicate with citizens at all levels – corporate groups of citizens and private citizens at all levels."
"The type of development which Mr Ó Neachtain has actually been pushing for some time is very consistent with the central policy plank of the Irish presidency, and that is to improve, across the board, the relationship between the Community and the citizens of Europe, whether those citizens are involved in fishing or farming or any other enterprise."
". These are very timely questions."
"The European Council has repeatedly expressed its preference for the accession of a united Cyprus to the Union on 1 May 2004."
"The December 2003 European Council urged all parties – in particular Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership – to give their strong support to UN Secretary-General Annan's efforts and, in this context, called for an immediate resumption of the talks on the basis of his proposals."
"The UN reiterated its willingness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in line with the principles on which the EU is founded."
"In the weeks since the European Council there have been a number of developments – in fact there have been developments within the last 24 hours – which have a bearing on the prospects for a comprehensive settlement."
"In northern Cyprus, following the December elections, for example, a coalition administration has been formed under Mr Mehmet Ali Talat, leader of the CTP Party, which has been in favour of the settlement of the Cyprus problem and the accession of a united Cyprus to the European Union."
"Mr Denktash – the leader of the Democratic Party – is the other party to that coalition."
"In Turkey, following an intensive consultation process, the National Security Council stated on 23 January 2004 that it had reached a consensus position in favour of negotiations, taking the Annan plan as a reference, on the basis of the realities on the island."
"Prime Minister Erdogan himself discussed the situation with Secretary-General Annan in Davos on 24 January and subsequently stated publicly that Turkey supported the resumption of negotiations on the basis of the Annan plan with a view to approval of a settlement by referendum before 1 May."
"Prime Minister Erdogan met with the political leaders of northern Cyprus, including Rauf Denktash, on his return from Davos."
"President Papadopoulos has reiterated the readiness of the government of the Republic of Cyprus to participate in resumed negotiations without preconditions."
"Last week Secretary-General Annan invited the parties to resume talks on a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of his proposals."
"He stated in his letters of invitation that he would take acceptance of the invitation as a commitment to finalising the plan with United Nations assistance by 31 March 2004, and to put a finalised plan to a separate, simultaneous referendum on 21 April 2004."
"The Secretary-General appealed to the leaders to summon the political will needed to bring about this result in the short time available."
"Under the timetable set out in his letter, the parties would agree to conclude negotiations by 26 March."
"If a completed text has not emerged by then, Secretary-General Annan will make whatever indispensable suggestions are necessary to complete the text by 31 March."
"That is a very ambitious timetable."
"The talks involving the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot leaders opened in New York yesterday, 10 February."
"This resumption offers a real opportunity to achieve the historic objective of the accession of a united Cyprus to the European Union on 1 May 2004."
"We all accept that there are still issues to be resolved."
"But this Union strongly supports the central role of the United Nations in the search for a comprehensive settlement."
"We fully support this latest initiative by Secretary-General Annan, and the Council is ready to assist in any way he considers useful to encourage agreement."
"The Commission will play an integral role in resumed negotiations in order to assist a speedy solution within the framework of the ."
"Following a settlement, the Union is ready to provide financial assistance for the development of the northern part of Cyprus."
"The Council continues to hope that it will be possible to welcome a reunited Cyprus to the Union on 1 May 2004."
"I should say to the House that I have a personal reason for hoping that will happen on 1 May, in that the town in which I live will be host to Cyprus for the Day of Welcomes on 1 May 2004."
"The time remaining, however, is short and if negotiations are to be successfully concluded, difficult compromises – and, of course, political will – will be required on all sides."
"The accession of a united Cyprus is in the clear interests of the people of the island; it is also clearly in the interests of the people of Greece and Turkey and this Union."
"My question is simply this: can the Council assure us, in the context of the Cyprus negotiations, which I greatly welcome and support, that no deals on the opening of accession negotiations or accession itself are being made with Turkey behind the scenes?"
". I understand the question, but this is a very delicate period."
"The Member will be aware that talks involving the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders are continuing as we speak at the United Nations headquarters in New York under the auspices of the Secretary-General."
"Therefore we all have a responsibility to exercise great care in commenting publicly on the prospects for progress at this time."
"There is no question that side issues, nudges or winks are going to be made in order to produce a resolution."
"In accordance with the clear commitment given to Turkey at the Copenhagen European Council in December 2002, the European Council will decide in December this year, on the basis of the report and recommendations from the Commission, whether Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria."
"When very detailed and delicate negotiations are ongoing in New York, this is not the moment to get into speculations about other deals."
"The reality of it is that the offer has been made, it is on the table, it is there for discussion and will be decided on in December next year."
"It relates to the objective Copenhagen criteria, which Members of this House and the Turkish Government understand."
"The European Parliament has previously expressed the view that it sees the Turkish presence in Northern Cyprus as an occupation."
"The European Community was born as a peace project, and our desire is to safeguard the heritage received from De Gasperi, Schuman, Monet and Adenauer."
"Against that background, is it in line with the EU’s ideas of peace and the heritage from our founding fathers to give Turkey a starting date for negotiations concerning membership of the European Union at the same time as Turkey continues to be an occupying power in Northern Cyprus?"
"In other words, can a country occupy another Member State of the European Union and, at the same time, be offered talks on membership?"
". I have already indicated the objective basis on which an adjudication will be made on the issue of Turkish membership."
"The Union has been the strongest and most consistent supporter of Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission of good offices in Cyprus."
"Quite clearly, we are all very conscious of the role that the Turkish Government can play to bring about a resolution there."
"I go back to the earlier point that I made."
"The objective basis on which any application for European Union membership will be decided is full and thorough compliance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"That is the basis; there is no other kind of bargaining to be done."
"Over a hundred lecturers and professors of criminal law at public universities from all over Spain have published a manifesto in which they harshly criticise the 'lamentable and continuing spectacle' of the criminal law reforms promoted by the Aznar Government in 2003."
"The publication condemns the latest amendment to the Criminal Code, which is intended to prevent the President of the Basque Government holding a referendum of the Basque people, and to cast him into prison if he does so."
"Similarly, it warns that the Spanish Government's policy of 'exacerbating the repression' in legal matters could result in the 'collapse of the rule of law, leaving nothing but barbarism'."
"Is the Council fully aware of this situation?"
"Article 7(1) of the EU Treaty states that 'the Council … may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), and address appropriate recommendations to that State.'"
"Does the Council not feel that it has a moral, political and legal duty to check whether the points which have been raised are valid and, if needs be, to adopt the appropriate recommendations and measures?"
". The Council refers the honourable Member to the reply it gave to his oral question H-0806/03 on the same subject during question time at the January 2004 part-session."
"In this context, the Council would highlight the fact that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law – principles that are common to all Member States."
"– I wish those Irish citizens still alive who remember being ruled from London were listening to this debate."
"Ever since the European Union was created, peace has been one of its key objectives. Over a hundred lecturers and professors of criminal law from all over Spain have felt bound to publicly expose the collapse of the rule of law instigated by the present Spanish Government."
"I believe this cannot be ignored if the common objective is to maintain peace and integration. Peace and integration in Europe have to involve respect for democratic principles."
"Are you satisfied that the Spanish Government is upholding democratic principles and the rule of law?"
". I understand the passion in the question but I would make the point that I really cannot add anything further to the responses to this question which have already been supplied to the Member, both on this occasion and on the previous occasion."
"Does the Irish Council Presidency have any thoughts on how to tackle the question of the status of Kosovo?"
". The Western Balkans will of course remain an important European Union foreign policy priority during the Irish presidency, as it has been during the preceding presidencies."
"We will seek in particular to build on the progress and good work by the Greek and Italian presidencies last year."
"The institutional framework for the Irish presidency is provided by the agenda agreed by the EU-Western Balkans summit in Thessaloniki last June, which I attended."
"That summit confirmed that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans lies in their integration into the European Union structures."
"Real progress has been made in Kosovo in recent times, on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 1244."
"The Council fully supports Harri Holkeri, the UN Special Representative for Kosovo, as he works to operationalise the policy of 'standards before status' and to ensure progress on the direct dialogue on practical issues between Belgrade and Pristina."
"Indeed, there could be no better special representative in this regard than Mr Holkeri; we in Ireland have reason to be grateful for his skills and particularly his negotiating skills."
"These are essential elements for further progress towards an eventual settlement to the status question."
"In December the Council underlined the importance of structural economic reforms in Kosovo."
"Progress in the privatisation process is a key element in implementing economic reforms."
"The Council called on the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to exercise their responsibilities constructively so as to enable the privatisation process to resume as soon as possible."
"The Irish presidency will work to ensure the closest possible cooperation between the European Union and the wider international community in support of Special Representative Mr Holkeri."
"In November, the Council reaffirmed the Union's readiness to assist in the realisation of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo, within its place in Europe, in the context of the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1244 and the 'standards before status' policy."
"We look forward to an early discussion of the report which the November Council requested High Representative Javier Solana to prepare, in close cooperation with the Commission and also in cooperation with Mr Holkeri."
"This will explore ways and means of further enhancing the European Union's contribution to the implementation of resolution 1244, taking full account of the stabilisation and association process tracking mechanism and the importance of the effective implementation of the 'standards before status' benchmarks."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Council President for his very full and detailed reply."
"I simply wish to add two critical comments or questions."
"Firstly, we are constantly hearing the phrase 'standards before status'."
"I am told, however, by all the major investors in Kosovo that they will not be investing in Kosovo in the long term unless they have some idea of how status is likely to develop."
"In other words, the 'standards before status' concept only functions to a limited extent because there is simply no certainty about Kosovo’s future."
"That is a problem for economic progress."
"The second point I would like to raise in this context is that the Americans have announced that discussions on Kosovo's final status could open in 2005."
"Should the EU not be preparing for these negotiations this year, in 2004, at the latest so that it is not presented with a ?"
"Yes, the first point I have to make is that the Member is obviously correct: economic progress very much depends on circumstances."
"As a lecturer for many years in one of our universities in Ireland, I said that economic progress is the most delicate of all flowers and has to be nurtured by a very specific eco-environment which is especially friendly to its own needs."
"Private investment in any troubled region is very obviously determined by the general climate."
"The EU is, however, anxious to support the economic development in Kosovo."
"In UNMIK Pillar 4 – I hate acronyms, by the way – the EU is assisting the revitalisation of economic activity in Kosovo towards the creation of conditions of a modern, open-market economy."
"This is the point which is at the heart of the supplementary question."
"The aim must be to establish a sustainable private sector which can create employment because that is the only hope for the region."
"The aim is to provide a long-term perspective."
"The requirement would be to bring Kosovo's legislative and administrative framework closer to European standards."
"If European companies are going to invest, that is what they will require."
"The European Agency for Reconstruction continues to finance and manage sustainable reconstruction and development programmes in Kosovo."
"Ultimately, the solution will have to be found on the ground in that state by creating the kind of conditions that the Member has in mind."
"The presidency urges the provisional institutions to engage constructively in that process."
"The Standards for Kosovo document – agreed on 10 December 2003 – and the ongoing development of the implementation work can provide a clear framework with which the provisional institutions must comply, but they can also provide a framework in which the necessary confidence can be built up."
"The review mechanism announced on 5 November 2003 envisages that progress made by the provisional institutions towards meeting the benchmarks will be assessed during quarterly period reviews."
"If there is compliance with all of this it will build the type of confidence that is necessary if a sustainable economic development is to take place."
"Sustainable economic development will only take place if and when the conditions for investment are adjudicated to be appropriate by private enterprise and by private investors."
"–– I would like to congratulate the Irish Presidency and the Council on all the efforts they are making to resolve the Kosovo conflict and other conflicts around the world."
"The Council and the Institutions are very concerned about what is happening in the world. They try to offer solutions and contributions to promote peace in the world and resolve conflicts."
"The European Union is also involved in helping to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland. This even includes providing financial support for the peace process."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, would it be too much to ask that some small efforts might be made too to help resolve the political conflict in the Basque Country, which is also part of the European Union?"
"– Although the question is valid, it is not relevant, as it does not relate to the Kosovo problem."
". The Council has nothing to add to the answers which were given at the September 2003 part-session, nor to those given to similar questions – Numbers H-0629/03 and H-0743/03 – at the November and December part-sessions."
"– Although in principle there is no scope for supplementary questions following the reply by the President-in-Office of the Council, I will allow further questions to be tabled."
"– Thank you Mr President."
"I should make it clear to the House that we will go on asking questions until the underlying problem and suffering cease to be an issue. We shall certainly continue to press for answers until we receive something better than mere bureaucratic responses."
"The five prisoners in question received extraordinarily heavy sentences following trials deemed by US witnesses and legal experts to lack all legal validity. These trials were condemned as show trials."
"Not only are the prisoners being denied their rights, their families are too. The latter are being denied the fundamental right to visit their relatives."
"I would like to ask whether the Council is concerned about the human rights of these particular Cubans or whether it is only concerned about the human rights of those other Cubans who have been so much in the limelight over the last few months."
"Can a selective approach to human rights in Cuba really be justified? Should the approach really vary, depending on the identity of the violator of human rights and the identity of the victim of violation?"
"Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware that the credibility and the authority of the European Union depend on it acting consistently?"
"In this case, the Union’s approach has been entirely inconsistent. Nonetheless, all this could appear to be of minor importance in the broader context of the whole outrageous situation in Guantanamo Bay."
". I would hate to give Mr Martínez Martínez a bureaucratic answer, because I have a great deal of respect for him, knowing him, as I have done, for many years."
"He is a good friend."
"The Council again emphasises that it deplores any situation where human rights are not upheld."
"They are a universal concern."
"As would be the case for citizens in any other country, if the Cuban Government is concerned about the welfare of any of its citizens in the United States, it is free to raise the matter with the US authorities, as provided for in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations."
"I must support the answers given during previous presidencies."
"The reality is that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations provides the framework on which issues of this nature are dealt with and the means by which the Cuban Government is entitled to make representations on behalf of any of its citizens."
"There is one other issue on which I anticipate a supplementary question: access."
"I know access to prisoners by their relatives is one of Mr Martínez Martínez's concerns."
"The position is that all states have an exclusive and unqualified right to decide on entry into their territory by non-nationals."
"I cannot add a great deal more than has already been said."
"However, I emphasise that the Council deplores any situation where human rights are not upheld."
"As Mr Martínez Martínez may be aware, I am a past human rights fellow of the United Nations."
"I take all human rights issues very seriously indeed – irrespective of where they arise and irrespective of which states are involved."
"– I would first like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his helpful reply. I do not find it fully satisfactory, however, because he has cited the Vienna Convention as the legal basis in this case."
"The European Union certainly has taken action in similar cases in other parts of the world. It is therefore my understanding that the reply given is not correct."
"When difficulties concerning human rights have arisen elsewhere between two countries covered by this Convention, the European Union has in fact expressed its concern for human rights. It has interceded and asked for human rights to be respected."
"I therefore call on you to revise your argument and develop it further. Failure to do so would be construed as prejudice."
". Again, I stand by the answers that I have already given on this issue."
"I would hate to think that anything I have said could be interpreted as indicating any partial approach to any human rights issue anywhere."
"Human rights is a universal concern and I would not like it to be thought that the Irish presidency, or indeed any other presidency of the European Union, would adopt a partial approach to issues relating to human rights."
"We have to be consistent, and, as I have already said, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations provides the framework in the light of which any issues arising should first be addressed."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too am dissatisfied with your answer, as I have heard accounts from relatives of Cuban citizens unjustly held in US prisons, who have been denied any visiting rights."
"In one case, a mother was denied any access whatsoever to her son, and in another, the wife of one of these detainees also told me that she had been prevented from visiting her husband in US prisons."
"This is, obviously, a flagrant violation of human rights. Consequently, I ask you once again what measures the Council must take to intervene in order to uphold the rights of this mother and this wife, so that they may be able to visit their relatives held totally unjustly in US prisons."
". At the risk of repeating myself, as regards access by relatives to prisoners, the honourable Member well knows that the position is that all states have an exclusive and unqualified right to decide on entry to their territory by non-nationals."
"That is well recognised in international law."
"The second point is that if the Cuban Government, which is clearly responsible for its own citizens, feels that issues arise that constitute an infringement of the Vienna Convention, it has an opportunity to address those issues."
"There is really nothing further the presidency can add to this."
"Mr President-in-Office, I really appreciate the difficult position you are in, having to give a reply on this acute problem, a reply on which we insist and which we demand from the European Union, from the Council, when it takes initiatives on other matters."
"On this particular issue, we are fully aware of the inhumane treatment of these people, which violates international law and human rights."
"What have these people done, Mr President-in-Office?"
"They were sentenced as criminals because they tried to prevent criminal terrorist organisations paid by the USA to work against Cuba and the murder of its leaders, including Fidel Castro himself."
"This incident clearly proves how hypocritical and selective everything said by the USA and the European Union about combating terrorism is."
"As long as the European Union does not say a word about the release of these patriotic fighters for democracy, it is aligning itself fully and participating in the strategy against Cuba, which is a beacon for the peoples in the area."
"I ask you, Mr President-in-Office, how does the European Union feel when, on the one hand, it talks about combating terrorism and, on the other hand, it is basically becoming the accomplice of the USA in the measures which they are taking against anti-terrorist fighters?"
". I certainly reject the suggestion that the European Union, and certainly this presidency, is in any way equivocal on matters relating to human rights."
"As I have already said, the Council and the European Union deplore any situation where human rights are not upheld, but again, as I have already said, if the Cuban Government is concerned about the welfare of any of its citizens in the US, it is free to raise the matter directly with the US authorities, as provided for by the Vienna Convention on consular relations."
"That is the issue. That is where this matter lies."
"There is a right to raise the matter there."
"Whether Members are satisfied or not with that answer, it happens to be the position in international law. It is established by the Convention and I can go no further."
"I am afraid that I am going to add to the President-in-Office's misery and woe with regard to these questions."
"I should like to make a suggestion, rather than ask a supplementary question."
"Could you, Mr President-in-Office, give us in this House an indication that, to achieve the result we all wish to see, you might, at some stage in the course of the presidency, bring up this issue – on a quiet basis – with your counterparts from other Member States, as well as from the US and perhaps Cuba?"
". If I answered Mr Crowley's question in the affirmative it would not be very quiet."
"However, he knows me well enough to know that I am bold enough to raise issues where they need to be discussed, even though they may sometimes cause discomfort."
"I do not want to create any false hopes, but I make the point that there are facilities, particularly within the context of the Vienna Convention, for the government of Cuba – which is primarily responsible for the wellbeing of its citizens – to raise this issue if it so wishes."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 18 to 33 will be replied to in writing (1)."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council"
"see Minutes."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0041/2004) by Mr G. Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the prospects for approximating civil procedural law in the European Union (COM(2002) 746 – COM(2002) 654 – C5-0201/2003 –2003/2087(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, the very high and ever-expanding volume of trade within the Union, and movements of persons on a similar scale, are constantly increasing the likelihood that individual citizens or firms might become involved in cross-border litigation."
"The cases concerned in this instance are those in which the parties are domiciled in different Member States and which, for that reason, pose certain difficulties."
"The risk in such situations is that the persons involved might refrain from asserting their rights because of the obstacles that they would encounter in going to law in a foreign country, with unfamiliar legislation and procedures, and the costs that they would have to bear."
"In many cases, moreover, including for example small claims litigation, legal expenses can even exceed the sum at issue."
"In other words, a genuine internal market is created by the existence of a common legal area, to which private individuals and firms can have access, without being penalised, regardless of the judicial systems of the different Member States."
"This is the background which has given rise to the two Green Papers covered by the Commission’s initiative."
"The first Green Paper deals with the issues of the conversion of the 1980 Rome Convention into a Community instrument and its modernisation."
"Conversion of the Rome Convention into a Community instrument, as is now being considered, is an additional measure following on from the procedure previously employed for the Brussels Convention and it is certainly useful in that it ensures direct application and uniform interpretation by the Court of Justice."
"The body of rules should be completed in the future by the Community instrument called Rome II, contained in the recent proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, for which Mrs Wallis is the rapporteur."
"The need to form the three instruments into a single whole is plain to see and implies not only that the Rome Convention should rapidly be converted into a Community instrument by adopting the necessary regulation, thus making the body of private international law rules homogeneous in terms of source, but also that the goal at a later stage should be codification in the true sense so as to enable the ‘Communitarised’ provisions of Brussels I, Rome I, and Rome II to be grouped together systematically."
"As for the innovations to be incorporated into the Convention of Rome, first of all we could introduce the principle to ensure that, when the law of a third country was chosen, the primacy of mandatory Community law rules, for instance to protect the weaker party (employees, consumers), would at all events be guaranteed."
"Furthermore, the scope of the Convention rules should be extended to include insurance contracts, and the provisions on consumer and employment contracts and electronic commerce transactions need to be clarified in some respects to enable them to be coordinated with Community legislation in force."
"The second Green Paper presented by the Commission, on establishing a European order for payment procedure and on measures to simplify and speed up small claims litigation, is also of the utmost significance."
"It is a matter of no little importance for many European citizens and firms, in particular SMEs, to be sure that they can recover claims, and do so rapidly, especially when litigation has cross-border implications because the debtor is domiciled in a foreign country or the judgment has to be enforced abroad."
"The added value of procedures to achieve that end, which would have to be laid down under a Community regulation for the reasons already set out regarding the Rome Convention, would lie in the fact that judgments would be enforceable throughout the Union without resorting to exequatur, thus making it possible to recover huge quantities of uncontested claims or settle cases in which creditors would otherwise be fundamentally disinclined to proceed."
"The regulation will also need to define the entire order for payment procedure, specifying the requirements applicable to creditors’ claims so as to establish a common measure affording certainty as to procedure and, where possible, costs."
"Some further comments should be made about the European order for payment."
"The first question to answer is whether the procedure should be confined to cross-border cases or could also be applied to litigation between parties domiciled in the same country."
"Bearing in mind that not all Member States have a special procedure of this type in their procedural law and those procedures that do exist differ substantially, it would be desirable, in order to avoid unequal treatment of creditors in different categories, for parties to have the option of using the order in domestic litigation as well."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say that the Commission is very pleased with the European Parliament’s support for the creation of a European order for payment procedure."
"Parliament’s suggestions on the special characteristics of this process – which we are truly very grateful for – will be taken into account in the preparatory work prior to the adoption of a regulation creating a European enforcement order in the very near future."
"I am pleased to see that we also agree on the idea that the order for payment procedure should not replace or harmonise national procedural law, but that it should be an alternative and optional instrument, and that, furthermore, it should be exclusively applied to pecuniary claims regardless of whether they relate to contractual obligations or non-contractual obligations, and regardless of their value."
"I would also like to point out that we agree with the opinion that there is no justification for establishing separate rules on jurisdictional competence which differ from those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 (‘Brussels I’) and we agree with the emphasis placed on the appropriate protection of rights to defence."
"The Commission also agrees that the direct enforceability of the judgments issued in this procedure should be achieved by means of the future regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested debts."
"These shared convictions will be fully satisfied in the coming proposal for a regulation although there are other issues on which Parliament does not appear to have made a definite proposal, but rather maintains a more open approach: as in the case of the choice of a model of a single stage based on evidence or a model of two stages without evidence."
"In any event, with a view to creating a truly uniform European procedure, the Commission will have to take a decision and I expect that it will opt for a procedure which does not require the presentation of written evidence."
"The Commission would find it unfortunate if, unlike in other cases – such as the Directive on free legal aid for example – Parliament did not support a broad scope, which also addressed national situations, and simply advocated a more restrictive approach."
"We would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur for their comments on the Green Paper on the future Community instrument for small-claims litigation."
"We must also say that we intend to present – around October of this year – a proposal for a Community instrument with a broad scope, a proposal which will be preceded by extensive consultation, both of the Member States and of all the parties involved."
"Its objective will be to simplify and speed up small-claims litigation, and in this regard we expect that it will consist of two elements: the first of them will create a European small-claims procedure, which will be an optional instrument to supplement the existing possibilities in the various States; and the second will replace the intermediate measures – the ‘exequatur’ – in order to allow for the recognition and implementation in other States of the judgments issued in a European small-claims procedure."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and its rapporteur for their support for the Commission’s initiative on the conversion of the 1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations into a Community instrument in order to guarantee that it is interpreted coherently and to speed up its entry into force in the new States."
"When we draw up the proposal relating to this instrument, we will certainly consider carefully the extremely valuable comments which appear in the report on various issues of a more technical nature and, as I have said, following the broad consultation process we have launched by means of the Green Paper, it should be possible to adopt a proposal for a Regulation in 2005."
"Mr President, this is not a legislative procedure but a consultation procedure, a preliminary phase, and I would point out that Parliament is not acting as a legislative body, but as a representative of European civil society and there is probably no other institution which represents European civil society as faithfully as we do, since we are elected by the citizens."
"The Commission’s proposals are good ideas."
"We are at the Green Paper phase, we hope that the Commission will present its proposals soon and, above all, I would like to welcome the fact that the Commission is now taking up one of the main proposals contained in Parliament’s recommendations: recourse to the Regulation, which is the most appropriate procedure for adopting these rules."
"We cannot leave them in the hands of a Directive, because that would give the national authorities too much leeway and could lead to confusion when it comes to applying the rules."
"Secondly, I believe there is a very important idea in the Gargani report: the idea of the importance of codification."
"This idea is reflected in the recent interinstitutional agreement, concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission: as far as possible, as we go on adopting legal rules, we must codify them, so that we do not find later that we have a series of regulations, directives, decisions etc., which bear no relation to each other."
"We are now beginning to acquire a substantial set of rules on cooperation in the field of private law and the ideal thing would be to be able to bring them together in a codified text, and we could also consider a type of permanent codification, that is, that each new rule should be integrated with others with a view to achieving the greatest possible coherence in the legislative text."
"This is not of course the time to make recommendations to the Commission on this issue, but there is an opportunity to do so and, therefore, we should try to achieve it and try to have it adopted."
"In conclusion, I believe that Parliament and the Commission are cooperating well in the initial phase;"
"I believe that the proposals the Commission will make to this Parliament from October will be well received and we will be able to work to the benefit of the citizens so that Community law is as harmonised and coherent as possible, to the benefit, as Mr Bartolozzi said earlier, of small companies and ordinary citizens, who expect more from the European Union than a mere mechanism for international diplomatic cooperation."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to address you tonight on this important theme."
"This afternoon I had the fortune to chair a meeting in which we were discussing the proposed directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"In that discussion, what came out most clearly was that the biggest difference among the legal systems of the European Union is actually the difference concerning procedure, rather than the substance of law."
"Proposals for the approximation of procedural law are amongst the most difficult to achieve effectively."
"That is something that we need to bear in mind."
"As you well know, I represent an area of Scotland in this House."
"We, in Scotland, have the unique good fortune of having a legal system that is more or less half and half, i.e. an amalgam of the civilian systems of mainland Europe and the common law system of England, Ireland and Northern Ireland."
"Perhaps the Commissioner should devote her time to studying Scots procedural law as a potential bridge between the two great different systems of this continent."
"However that may be, in my Group we certainly support the idea of moving from conventions to regulation."
"Mr Medina Ortega is entirely right to say that the regulation is the right instrument to deal with these problems of harmonisation."
"Finally, in relation to small claims, all that is in the Gargani report is admirable."
"However, I should particularly like to underline, in regard to the service of documents, paragraph 6(i) that states: 'service should effected by specialised personnel with legal training capable of explaining every aspect of the procedure to the debtor'."
"Much of what we have done in the way of harmonisation is defeated at the moment by bad translation, lack of interpretation and lack of clarity."
"I beg to support that point."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0021/2004) by Mr E. Mastorakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (COM(2003) 440 – C5-0393/2003 – 2003/0159(COD))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Maritime Safety Agency has not been operating for very long."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has proposed extending its functions in three very specific and very topical areas: the fight against pollution caused by ships, the training of crews and marine protection."
"I would like to point out that the recent maritime disasters have made it patently obvious that we need to adopt new measures at European level, not only involving the prevention of pollution, but also in relation to the provision and management of resources for combating pollution when it occurs."
"The Agency’s actions in terms of combating pollution will supplement the provisions in force in the States of the Union and will give added value to the actions taken at Community level in the field of civil protection."
"It will supplement the Member States’ intervention systems and in no event will it replace them – nor is it intended to do so."
"To this end, the Agency will be able to charter specialised and multi-purpose ships."
"As well as the provision of adequate resources, the Agency will provide technical and scientific support in this area to the Member States and the Commission."
"With regard to the minimum level of training for seamen, our proposal involves a simple comparison with the existing provision in the Regulation establishing the Agency, with a more important role for the Community, in accordance with Directive 2001/25/EC."
"It is therefore urged to contribute actively to the new procedures for the recognition of the qualifications of seamen issued in third countries."
"Also in the field of the protection of citizens, our proposal is intended to take account of the new Community competence relating to improving the safety of ships and port installations."
"The Regulation introducing this new competence will enter into force soon, thanks to the agreement reached by Parliament and the Council at first reading."
"According to this agreement, the Commission will have to verify the effectiveness of the control procedures introduced by the States."
"The Agency's attendance at these inspections is entirely appropriate."
"An amendment proposed by Parliament to the text of the regulation relating to the Agency specifies the framework for this attendance and effectively restricts it to inspections in the private sector."
"Although this approach is more restrictive than the one we have advocated, the Commission could accept it."
"By way of conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the positions of the Council and Parliament in this regard are very close and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Mastorakis for the work he has done."
"I believe that the amendments are constructive and I believe that in this way we will be able to reach an agreement with Parliament quickly and, therefore, provide the Agency with these new competences, particularly for managing resources for combating marine pollution."
"This, together with the modification of the contribution of resources in this year's budget and future budgets, will mean that we have, at European level, ships for combating marine pollution at sea, in order to deal with something which we unfortunately cannot prevent, which is the possibility of new disasters occurring, such as the ones we have seen already, since there is no such thing as zero risk."
"We must try as far as possible to minimise the effects of these disasters, if any more take place."
". Mr President, the European Commission has proposed extending the remit of the Agency so that it can support the existing Community framework and mechanism in the areas of involuntary or voluntary pollution of the sea and the policy of protection."
"We had a long debate on the breadth of this extension in our committee and with senior Commission officials and we arrived almost unanimously at the base line which the Council too can accept."
"The basic element of the proposed amendment is that the Agency generally operates in an auxiliary capacity, without contesting the jurisdiction of the Member States, and provides assistance to the European Commission."
"I will not hide from you that there was acute concern about transferring tasks, not just safety but also security, and we finally decided to accept the possible."
"Perhaps it helped that, in the rapporteur's language, the Greek language, safety and security are translated by the same word."
"We believe that, when we talk about a protection mechanism, it is obviously preferable to have a perhaps less equipped mechanism but as quickly as possible."
"At the moment, what is paramount for us, what must be paramount, is the organisation as quickly as possible of the combating of incidents such as that involving the , for which the European Parliament set up a temporary committee, so that we learn exactly what happened and we have proposals about what to do in future."
"In addition, provision is made for an evaluation of the amended regulation so that, if necessary, the procedure to improve it can progress."
"I should like to take this opportunity to call once again for a stop to the unacceptable treatment of the master of the , Apostolos Magouras, who is being treated as a criminal."
"Such conduct is not humanely acceptable and discourages qualified young people from entering seafaring professions, with obvious dangers for world shipping and our seas."
"To close, I should like to thank all the political and departmental factors involved and to point out that our committee disagreed with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets, considering that it was not right for them to be included in a regulation such as the amended regulation, for both substantive and formal reasons."
"Mr President, the fact that the report by Mr Mastorakis was accepted in our committee by 45 votes for and 1 vote against clearly proves, I think, the fact that almost the entire House assents to its content."
"For our part, we made it clear from the outset that we agree with the proposal by the European Commission to extend the remit of the Maritime Safety Agency."
"This needs to be done and I think that the shipwreck of the demonstrated that clearly."
"That is why we supported Mr Mastorakis's report from the outset."
"The stand which our party and the European Parliament in general took on the Sterckx report is also indicative in this direction."
"It was there that ideas which the European Commission is now proposing were first proposed."
"I am glad that here today, before this House, I am repeating on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats our support for the report by Mr Mastorakis, who has made an effort to reach an agreement with the Council, so that we can finish with this issue quickly at first reading without delays."
"The rapporteur's efforts to reach an agreement were difficult in numerous cases, because points of convergence had to be found with certain Member States which had certain matters to put forward concerning the principle of subsidiarity."
"Finally, these problems were overcome and I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"Apart from all that, no longer as representative of the Group of the European People's Party, but as a Greek MEP, I should like, given that he himself referred to this specific issue, to say that obviously I agree with him on the reference which he made to the Greek master and I hope that the Spanish authorities will do what they can so that he is dealt with fairly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is a rare sitting in which maritime safety is not raised."
"This one is no exception, but has produced a consensus."
"Indeed, we are, I believe, largely in agreement with our fellow MEP’s report."
"Two or three words on two or three subjects."
"Firstly, places of refuge."
"I think, Commissioner, that, once the work is complete, it will be good to have a European register of places and ports of refuge and of refuge procedures so that people might be aware of these and have full access to the details."
"A few words, now, about the agency itself."
"It is located in Lisbon."
"I wish it good luck in the port of Lisbon, but it must not be forgotten that it must also be equipped with regional technical agencies and that we must proceed quickly."
"We must act in such a way that the operational side of the agency, its range of tools in effect, is put in place as quickly as possible."
"Regional technical agencies are planned, I believe, on the Atlantic coast, in the Mediterranean, on the Baltic and on the Adriatic."
"Finally, I read yesterday, in the Commission report on the financial perspectives for 2007-2012, that you were proposing a European border protection agency with a European Corps of Border Guards."
"I think that, in this context, we must also turn our attention to maritime borders."
"What you proposed concerning land borders is worth examining with a view to its being applied to the maritime sphere, not in an identical, but in an adapted, form."
"To conclude, Commissioner, I think that the work is far from being finished."
"There is one area in which it would be as well to maintain our efforts: that of flags of convenience because, in my view, as long as it is possible, through a lawyer covering for an anonymous and ultra-rich owner, to register a ship in Panama for USD 1 500, and to do so with complete discretion, threats will continue to hang over sailors and the environment."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a prompt start to the EMSA would be very much in the general interest of current European maritime safety policy."
"I welcome the way in which Mr Mastorakis has pulled out all the stops in order to ensure that we can work efficiently in a short space of time."
"Perhaps not everyone will share my view, but I do not regret the restrictions surrounding safety, and I think that everything is clearly pegged out now."
"Trying to bring physical safety measures within the remit of the Agency would only make it controversial and could therefore have hindered its prompt coming into being."
"In my opinion, this means that the added value lies in the improved coordination of the knowledge and resources that are already available in the various Member States."
"It is important that we should be able to say ‘yes’ tomorrow, especially since we can then put this into law at the beginning of March, thus enabling the EMSA to table proposals for the budget in 2005, which should happen before 1 April."
"In this way, we are creating room in which the Agency’s power in the field of oil removal can be translated into practice, and making possible necessary investments in new equipment."
"I think it is very positive that the Agency should also be authorised to assess training courses from third countries, for, after all, the greatest danger at sea is human failure, and so this will reduce lack of knowledge."
"It is unfortunate that the tracing powers in the event of shipping disasters have turned out rather disappointing."
"Indeed, they merely involve the exchange of methodology and data, which I see as insufficiently pro-active."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether, if agreements were to be concluded with third countries, it would not be wise to ensure that Russia is one of the first countries with which this is done so that we can make the European coast safer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, owing to the bitter experience of the sinking of the , the Executive Commission is presenting us with a proposal for a modification of the Regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"We are in favour of increasing its competences, so that it can provide support in the field of marine pollution – accidental or deliberate – and in the field of civil protection, and so that systematic inspections can be carried out of the safety systems of ships and in port installations."
"We are also in favour of the Agency participating in the procedures for recognising qualifications in the maritime professions issued by third countries, to which I would add the power to approve devices which verify compliance with the Marpol rules and others, in order to prevent the waste from oil tanks or bilge oil from being dumped in the sea."
"Specifically, we believe that the European Agency must be provided with all the economic, human and material resources necessary to be able to carry out these functions properly."
"Firstly, it must have an emergency plan for cases of marine disaster which covers all coasts, from Gibraltar to Russia, and which can be deployed as required in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the North Sea, etc., including plans for dealing with the waste resulting from collection operations and the cleaning of fuel oils."
"It should also have a sufficient fleet of rapid intervention ships and specialised rescue ships, also with the capacity for pumping and transfer of fuel from any ship which finds itself in difficulties."
"And naturally it should have qualified personnel to verify the efficiency of control procedures and the application of safety rules and the prevention of pollution in European ports and ships which sail through Community waters, not just those which land on our coasts."
"I would like to thank Mr Mastorakis for his report and express our support for the Commission’s proposal, although we would have liked to have gone a little further."
"Mr President, it is appropriate to reiterate that Parliament, the Commission and the Council reacted quickly and efficiently to the tragic accidents involving the and oil tankers off the European coastline. Important legislation was also adopted, within the framework of which I should like to highlight the establishment of the European Maritime Safety Agency, which is to have its headquarters in Lisbon, and this is something that I naturally welcome."
"I should also like to point out that Parliament has set up a Temporary Committee on Improving Safety at Sea (MARE), whose report we await with interest."
"The fact that we are once again debating this subject here today, with the specific aim of extending the competences of the Agency, is ample proof that, contrary to what often happens in such circumstances, the passage of time and the effects of media pressure following these events have not exhausted our capacity for political action and to keep pace with this issue."
"Let us take a look, then, at the fields in which the Commission proposes to extend the Agency’s power to act."
"Firstly, marine pollution response. We have always said that the Member States must coordinate their efforts when accidents happen."
"Experience has shown that no State is capable of dealing with large-scale oil spills on its own."
"There are thus obvious benefits of coordinated Community action in this area and the agency can play an important role."
"Its new function, accident response, is, moreover, the major plus point of the proposal for us in Portugal, a coastal country, which has a long coastline and where numerous shipping routes converge."
"It is, however, necessary to be totally precise in defining the agency’s methods of intervention, with particular regard to the availability of specialised ships that will be at the disposal of Member States affected by pollution, and to the system for chartering these ships."
"Secondly, the training of seafarers does not cause any problem, especially with regard to how the agency will participate in the procedures of recognising the certificates of competency of seafarers issued by countries outside the EU."
"Thirdly the most contentious issue concerns the agency’s activities in the area of security, since the Commission’s original proposal appeared to impinge on the Member States’ competences in matters of national security and the fight against terrorism."
"Nonetheless, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have succeeded not only in confining the Agency’s scope to clearly defined areas which tally with the new Community competences resulting from the Directive on Ship and Port Facility Security, but also in ensuring that their activities complement the prerogatives of coastal States and do not impinge on them."
"In conclusion, we endorse the balanced approach taken by the rapporteur, whom we should like to congratulate for his excellent contribution to improving safety at sea and to preventing maritime pollution."
"What we must never forget is that, when accidents do happen, damage does not respect national borders."
"Mr President, it is essential that, in order to prevent abuses and to avoid temptation, the tasks devolved to the Community agencies be defined very precisely, even though the number of such agencies is tending to multiply at an alarming rate."
"That is the reason why we are giving particular attention to examining the proposal made to us to increase the competences of the Maritime Safety Agency, particularly in two sensitive areas."
"Although, with regard to anti-pollution vessels, we have, on the face of it, nothing against a mutualisation of the cost of providing these, it must be clearly reaffirmed, in regard to the management of these vessels, that the responsibility and the initiative when it comes to preventing and combating marine pollution lies primarily with the coastal Member States and that the Commission must only intervene on a complementary basis by scrupulously and sensibly applying the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is crucial to avoid a situation in which Community intervention is in danger of compromising the efficiency of systems of command that have proved their worth, as happened, for example, with the coordination of national, Community and extra-Community resources by the Atlantic police port authority at the time when the went down."
"As for extending the agency’s competences into the area of the fight against terrorist threats, any such extension must be clearly defined."
"Thus, the European agency obviously does not have authority to intervene regarding the actual principle of inspections, nor to propose possible sanctions."
"The agency’s only possible role is that of simply carrying out inspections of ships and port facilities."
"We shall have to be particularly vigilant about this issue, which is extremely sensitive in terms of the security of the Member States, in order to prevent confusion from arising and subcontractors from claiming responsibilities that are not theirs."
"Mr President, we are all aware that it was following the sinking of the tanker, and the subsequent lack of coordination between the actions of the Member States, that the Commission decided to table the amendments to the regulation that established the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"The wreck – and the human, environmental and economic tragedy that it caused in the areas affected, particularly in Galicia – demonstrated the need for intervention to be more effective and for actions between the Member States to be better coordinated."
"There is, however, no justification whatsoever for extending the jurisdiction of the agency to areas that are clearly the responsibility of the Member States, as this would entail doubling costs and removing responsibility from Member States."
"This would, in turn, raise questions of sovereignty, leading to conflicts of competences."
"I must say that I am delighted the agency is to be set up in Portugal; I hope that this takes place as soon as possible and it would be nice if the Commissioner could shed some light on the timescale for us."
"The competences I have referred to must not be allowed to undermine the subsidiarity principle. The rapporteur suggests that the agency’s work in pollution response should be restricted to technical and scientific support and should not replace the Member States’ own response mechanisms; it should provide additional resources when these have been requested by the government under the authority of which cleaning up operations will be conducted."
"I share this opinion, in view of the fact that no State is capable of dealing with large-scale oil spills on its own."
"In such circumstances, the agency may provide support, but should not replace Member States. The agency cannot and must not intervene to combat terrorist attacks; the agency will be entrusted with the competence of monitoring the efficiency of Member States’ ships and port facility security."
"Its establishment may contribute towards strengthening maritime safety, in conjunction with national authorities and the support of the various Member States, acting as an additional technical and scientific resource and not as a supranational body that monitors security or even fisheries activities."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I really cannot endorse most of the previous speaker’s comments, especially her concerns about the Agency’s competences."
"You know, if we look back at the past – the , the – the Member States really have shown that they are incapable of resolving the problems promptly on their own."
"We need the European Maritime Safety Agency, and we also need an expansion of its competences."
"This House has always thrown its weight behind the Agency."
"Let me recall just one particular instance: in autumn, when the Council was about to cut the posts for the Agency, which was being set up at that time, we promptly reversed this measure at the first reading of the budget."
"Madam Vice-President, I too believe that the rapporteur’s proposals – namely to provide the Agency with the requisite, which means genuinely adequate, financial resources to charter ships, equipment, and so on, and deliver a specialised pollution response service swiftly in the event that this is requested by a coastal state – mean that the Agency must indeed be provided with sufficient resources."
"Of course, I am slightly sceptical as well."
"We should not be overloading the Agency with general threat prevention tasks."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency’s primary objective is to ensure a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships within the Community, not to undertake general prevention of terrorism."
"We must be very careful to ensure that we do not raise expectations which the Agency cannot fulfil."
"Madam Vice-President, now that we have embarked on new territory – or waters – by establishing the Agency, we have called for it to draw up a detailed work programme swiftly."
"This is because we want to discuss the work programme with you, Madam Vice-President, since responsibility for the Agency lies with you as the Commissioner."
"The Agency does not have a separate structure or identity; instead, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that it operates efficiently."
"I have no doubt that you will do the right thing, Madam Vice-President, but we must discuss the matter in detail, for we cannot overload the Agency with tasks and then fail to provide it with the requisite personnel and resources."
"This would create difficulties for the Agency."
"We therefore need to discuss precisely which tasks it must perform, which tasks it can perform, and which resources we will need for this process."
"I wish to endorse the comments of one of the previous speakers."
"Madam Vice-President, I would be pleased if you could tell us this evening how quickly the Agency will be able to relocate."
"We were always gratified that the Agency started work in Brussels because the work was urgent and necessary."
"However, given that the Heads of State or Government have already tinkered around for a long time and trawled around various locations in Europe, and have now decided in favour of Lisbon, we do not want the next two years to be taken up with renting space and getting the premises ready before the real work can begin."
"Perhaps you can give us some indication of a possible timetable, because we want the move to Lisbon to take place swiftly so that an effective Agency is up and running very soon."
"I would like to make one final comment."
"In my previous life, I was a judge, and I think we must be cautious in what we say about the captain of the ."
"I too have the impression that he should have the opportunity to leave Spain in order to live elsewhere in the internal market, namely in his home country, Greece."
"However, in a democracy, in a state under the rule of law, there is a separation of powers, and it is not the Spanish authorities but the Spanish court which is preventing him from leaving the country."
"We in this House should be very careful and should not interfere with judicial independence."
"Mr President, the sinking of the oil tanker off the Galician coast demonstrated, amongst many other shortcomings, the lack of coordination of the Member States in terms of combating pollution."
"The Commission now proposes a modification of the recently approved Regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, created following the accident, not only to provide support in the field of marine pollution, but also in the protection against illegal actions."
"When it comes to pollution, the proposal seems to me to be rather confused."
"The Agency must have the resources necessary to intervene when a Member State requests it and under the authority of a State, with specialised ships which will operate under a chartering system and which will be made available, if requested, to that Member State."
"It is not specified whether they must be acquired, rented or hired on a permanent or occasional basis."
"I personally would like this issue to be clarified, because in Galicia, at the time of the visit of the Agency’s Director, right in the middle of the crisis, I read that one of the ships would be permanently based in Finisterre."
"The rapporteur’s amendments specify that the main responsibility in the field of pollution lies with the coastal States, which must have their own resources – which some of us find logical – and that the actions of the Agency will only come into play following a request from the Member State, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"But this principle is not a justification for the Community to remain passive."
"On the pretext that it is a competence of the Member States and not of the Union, we witnessed during the disaster how one of them, a country with a considerable coastline, did not possess, and still does not possess today, the minimum resources needed to deal with an emergency."
"The Commission cannot continue to ignore the need to establish Community response mechanisms or European coordination of the resources of the different States in order to cover emergency situations and respond to disasters."
"Amongst the new responsibilities, despite the reservations expressed previously, we believe, like the rapporteur, that the Commission’s proposal must be supported, since it contributes to increasing safety in maritime transport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is, unfortunately, too often the case in national politics, European politics is also suffering from the syndrome that in the case of environmental disasters, reactive action, instead of pro-active action, is taken all too often when working out adequate measures."
"Accordingly, the disaster involving the oil tanker was needed in order to set up a European Maritime Safety Agency."
"Not even a year after this Regulation was adopted, France was faced with the disaster involving the oil tanker ."
"That is why a proposal is now being tabled in order to change this Regulation and to remove its loopholes."
"Although we can only applaud a well-functioning Agency of this kind, I should like to raise a few objections."
"First of all, I welcome the fact that the Agency will have the wherewithal to fight pollution, at the request of a Member State, by means of special ships."
"This environmental aspect receives my group’s unconditional support."
"Secondly, we also back the proposal to give the Agency a role involving certificates of competency of seafarers, provided that the high quality of current training courses remains guaranteed."
"I should like to make a comment with regard to the third point."
"It should not be this Agency, but it should remain the competent port authorities themselves, who are responsible for taking safety measures against terrorist threats."
"In this connection, I, as an inhabitant of Antwerp, can state that the port of Antwerp has, in this area among others, made huge efforts in order to bring the safety of its infrastructure into line with the regulations of the relevant American customs authorities."
"As we did a few months ago with self-handling, we must oppose the Commission’s urge to introduce one centralistic model for all ports in Europe, and we remain in favour of the age-old Hanseatic model that has guaranteed prosperity, expansion, employment and the safety of our northern European ports."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the most recent maritime accidents on European shores, all those concerned have finally woken up to the realisation that the time has come to act, in order that we can prevent such accidents and respond to them effectively and without delay."
"The most welcome development is the establishment of a coordinating structure for such actions, namely the European Maritime Safety Agency, with clear and comprehensible aims that will result in greater responsibility and efficiency."
"The primary aim is to prevent and to combat sea pollution accidents and is, accordingly, the one that everyone is aware of."
"The sea covers most of our planet and is the source of future life, and as such we must protect its resources."
"Those who cross the seas as a matter of course must be held responsible at all times for the state of the ships, for the people who work on them and for those employed in the sector on land."
"There is, consequently, an urgent need to monitor routes and make them safe, and to strengthen the existing model, both in terms of inspections and of how frequently these are carried out."
"Although it is not a priority for the agency at this stage, growing concern about the threat of terrorist attacks on ships and port facilities has already resulted in the adoption of special measures and international instruments."
"This concern might be answered, clearly and unequivocally, in the agency regulation, which would constitute a further aim and would help to raise the confidence of all those involved in all Member States."
"In all honesty, nobody can guarantee total effectiveness, but permanent vigilance and care, supported by the necessary detection, correction and information equipment will certainly result in a reduction in activity of this kind."
"I also wish to highlight the importance of systematic and stringent evaluation of intervention in the area of preventing and combating maritime pollution."
"It is only by understanding the means and the motives of actions, and by holding those involved responsible that we will, in my view, be able to ensure that each step taken will be safer and more confident than the one before."
"A system of evaluating responsibilities must be applied consistently, regardless of the subject of the evaluation."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle is crucial and will certainly iron out any negligence, which cannot and must not be excused."
"I feel that the training of seafarers is of the utmost importance – both technical and scientific training in maritime safety and obtaining the appropriate qualification."
"In addition to complementing the response capabilities of Member States, the agency’s cooperation is intended to ensure that each Member State is properly equipped to respond to any accident close to their coastline."
"I agree that the European Maritime Safety Agency should have staff who are highly qualified and experienced in the field of maritime safety, to ensure that these objectives are properly and professionally addressed."
"Coming from Portugal, and having strong links to the sea, I believe that the European Maritime Safety Agency will always be a challenge for ..."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to say that I welcome the report and that I join in the congratulations accorded to the rapporteur, Mr Mastorakis."
"I should also like to say to the Commissioner, loudly and clearly, ‘do not be afraid to show ambition’."
"The evidence is there for all to see that this is a problem of European dimensions."
"We are not only talking about the or the ; we are talking about the thousands of ships that year after year pollute European waters in appalling environmental attacks, to which the Member States have proved incapable of responding."
"A European dimension is required; a European coastguard is required."
"I do not envisage any extra work here, because such work will only be done effectively if it is done across the board."
"If there is a problem here it is certainly not that the proposals are too bold; it is that they are too tentative."
"Commissioner, please show ambition!"
"Europeans need ambition, they need a response to these problems and they need the European Maritime Safety Agency to say when we will be able to put an end to the scandal of endless marine pollution, when we will see new rules on maritime transport."
"This is what we need!"
"In view of this responsibility, this House must be provided with all that it needs and must offer all the help that it can."
"We must not yield to the kind of conservative mindset of those who spend their lives thinking in terms of the relative power of the Member States and who overlook what is really important to the citizens."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mastorakis and all the honourable Members for the wonderful work you have done, participating in something which for almost five years has undoubtedly been one of the key elements of the mandate of this Parliament and this Commission."
"One of the great steps forward we have taken thanks to our joint work over these years has been to completely revolutionise the issue of maritime safety at European level, and we have shown great ambition, Mr Casaca, because we have gone from practically zero, I would not say to infinity, but certainly we have achieved a huge amount."
"We still have to make more progress, but the steps we have taken have been spectacular."
"I would like to say to the honourable Members, firstly, that in the field of security, in the anti-terrorist sense as well, somebody has to carry out the tasks of control, supervision and support, which are often closely related to security in the other sense, and we therefore believe it would be better for the Agency to deal with the two aspects."
"Secondly, with regard to giving the Agency management powers – and I understand that Mrs Miguélez Ramos would like more definitions – it is the case that we have chosen to leave several options open."
"At a given moment it will be possible to simply commission ships; in other circumstances, charter them; and in others, to operate them directly."
"There are various possibilities: contracting, management, ownership."
"We are not ruling out any option."
"We will have to see what budgetary resources are available to us and what the circumstances are."
"Let us hope that this Agency goes ahead and does so successfully and for a long time."
"It must be given a margin."
"We will have to seek the most appropriate formula and, undoubtedly, this Parliament, although only by means of budgets, will have plenty to say about which formula is ultimately decided on."
"Thirdly, with regard to the coastguard, ladies and gentlemen, I know what this Parliament wants and I would be delighted with it."
"But I believe we must begin by taking certain preliminary steps, until we achieve genuine integration of national coastguards and true coordination in all areas."
"Fourthly, you talk about greater competences and there have been several speeches expressing the concern that the Agency’s activities are going to replace the responsibilities of the States."
"No, ladies and gentlemen."
"We are talking about a supplementary and complimentary activity, which is in no way a replacement."
"It is not a question of taking powers away from the States, but rather we are talking about possibilities which did not exist before and which, by means of this Agency, at European level, will be available to us so that we can fight for safer and cleaner seas."
"Fifthly: when is the Agency going to move?"
"As soon as possible, ladies and gentlemen."
"But you must be aware that we are negotiating the issue of headquarters with the Portuguese authorities."
"If it were up to us, it would be before the summer."
"The problem is that the Portuguese authorities are facing certain problems with regard to installations and we will have to see whether they are resolved before the end of the year."
"But it will not depend on us, but rather on the Portuguese authorities."
"In any event I would like to say that 40 people have already been contracted, including temporary and auxiliary staff and eminent national experts."
"We have placed great emphasis on this aspect because we believe that this is where the accumulated experience and knowledge is to be found, and furthermore this will allow us to cooperate better with the States of Union, from which, I would insist, there is no intention to take away any powers, but rather to give them more support."
"In terms of the issue of management and responding to pollution problems, ten people are going to be allocated, for training, seven, for security, and with regard to terrorist aspects, some eight people."
"I would like to point out to the honourable Members – and thereby reply to Mrs Miguélez Ramos – that it is obvious that the north-western coast of the Iberian Peninsula is one of the points of greatest risk in terms of ship pollution."
"We only have to look at where most accidents have occurred over recent years: on the Galician coasts."
"Other points of risk are the area of the Channel, Brittany, etc. The idea is that anti-pollution ships should be concentrated and permanently based, essentially as an operational base, in areas where there is most risk and they will clearly also be needed in the Mediterranean."
"Finally, I will say that the Agency must also have tentacles in the Mediterranean."
"These are issues we are dealing with."
"Mr President, today we are going to approve – I hope – and also discuss in a moment, the issue of responsibility and the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPCF)."
"Once again – and these are our final plenary sessions – we are continuing to make progress and agreeing on extremely important issues so that, amongst all of us, we can provide the European Union with a legal system and a system of resources which truly allows us to combat marine pollution and improve security."
"We are aware that we will very probably in the future have to deal with issues such as flags of convenience and certain aspects of maritime law – and I am referring to what Mr Casaca said."
"We will have left the route prepared and I hope that the person who takes over from me – because this is a relay race – can finish the work which amongst all of us we have been promoting over all these years."
"With regard to the responsibilities of captains – and I believe there have been responses from different elements – we all want to see people enjoying every possible freedom, but there is a clear issue, and that is respect for judicial decisions in any country of the Union."
"– Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0016/2004) by Mr U. Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on intermodal loading units (COM(2003) 155 – C5-0167/2003 – 2003/0056(COD))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the work he has done and say to him that this proposal is clearly intended to facilitate and promote intermodal transport."
"We believe it is an essential element if we are to maintain sustainable development in the European Union, combine economic growth with quality of life, with competitiveness and with transport which is competitive and respectful of the environment."
"We need to improve and clarify the way we use the possibilities we have, combining modes of transport, which will allow us to optimise the infrastructures we have at our disposal."
"When we talk about the intermodality sector, we need a more coherent and rigorous approach to the maintenance and control of units, because it is the units which are going to allow the container – the principle of the container, as we have seen, is the carrier for the future – to be transported by ship, by train or by lorry through our territory."
"Hence the need for a more coherent and rigorous approach to maintaining the control of the units with a view to increasing safety, the harmonisation of certain characteristics of swap bodies in order to improve the efficiency of transfer and of the maintenance and implementation of a European intermodal loading unit which combines the advantages of current sea containers and those swap bodies, that is to say, stacking capacity, resistance, together with an optimum size for European pallets in accordance with the provisions of European road transport legislation."
"I would insist that it must also be possible to transport them by road."
"The Commission’s intention is to create a more harmonised and efficient system of loading units for intermodal transport."
"Although rail transport will undoubtedly benefit from the proposal, one key objective is to give greater opportunities to inland waterways and short-sea shipping within the European intermodal market."
"Therefore, only by means of greater harmonisation of loading units can we achieve the performance necessary to slow down the rise in transport costs, of transfers, and make sea transport more competitive when it has to take over from road or rail."
"In presenting this measure, the Commission has not proposed anything revolutionary – we are not trying to re-invent the wheel – we have faith in the approach, already proven and satisfactory, according to which we created the internal market: a Framework Directive which establishes the essential requirements and which leaves the technical details to the European standards bodies, which call on experts and also sector chiefs."
"It is they who know what the sector needs in order to achieve the political objectives."
"I must say once again that we have held a very useful and in-depth debate on the issue with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and I would like to thank them for having dedicated the time and effort to this measure necessary to allow this first reading to already be an entirely mature decision."
"In the Council, however, things are not going so quickly."
"I trust that the Council will carefully study the results of this first reading in Parliament and that it can agree a Common Position quickly and, if possible, a Common Position which supports the proposal which is going to be issued by this Parliament."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner is right: intermodal transport is competitive only to a limited extent, and the existing units – whether they are containers or swap bodies –cannot be easily used in all four modes of transport."
"The complicated and lengthy process of trans-shipment not only wastes a great deal of time; it also costs a great deal of money."
"By its very nature, intermodal transport is therefore at a disadvantage."
"Firstly, it is far more complex and therefore more complicated to organise, and secondly, there are very few actors who have a clear overview of the whole intermodal chain."
"That is why we must promote intermodal transport, and that is what we are doing with this directive."
"The purpose of the directive is three-fold: firstly, to create a new loading unit, theEuropean intermodal loading unit; secondly, to establish specific intermodality requirements for all new loading units, and we hope that at least in the medium term, we will therefore be able to halve the trans-shipment time at terminals; and thirdly, to improve safety in line withthe International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC)."
"Perhaps it was slightly misleading for the Commission to present the directive as part of the programme for the Promotion of Short Sea Shipping."
"Yes, of course it will benefit short sea shipping, but what we are talking about here is the entire transport chain and intermodal standardisation the like of which has not been seen before. As a rule, it is the individual modes of transport which are standardised, or standardisations are introduced for specific aspects of an individual mode of transport."
"This directive is therefore a first."
"Through standardisation, we will achieve planning and investment security, reduce barriers to market entry as well as product costs, and open up new markets. I am convinced that Europe needs the best possible intermodal loading unit combining the advantages of containers with the advantages of swap units."
"It would be a kind of European supercontainer, capable of being used on all modes of transport and trans-shipped easily. It would be stackable and lifted from its top corners; it would be suitable for use on ships, offer maximum space for transporting ISO palettes, and enable loading and unloading to take place quickly."
"The Commission estimates that the number of road vehicles required to transport the same amount of goods would be reduced by 25% if the new supercontainer were used."
"I think that is slightly optimistic, but at least it points in the direction of change."
"Fears that the use of existing loading units would no longer be permissible are unjustified."
"The use of the new supercontainer is not made mandatory by the directive; instead, the market must regulate it."
"This means that different units will continue to be in circulation, but the European loading unit will become the market leader because of its stated benefits."
"I too believe that it will be a great success in the export market."
"China and Russia are two massive markets to be conquered, and the expected increase in the transportation of goods to Eastern Europe speaks for itself."
"Nor does the directive affect the ISO norm."
"We have managed to assuage concerns about this issue through amendments to the Commission’s text."
"Cellular container ships, for example, are currently configured according to applicable ISO standards."
"We have stipulated that safe stowage inside and on deck of existing cellular container ships must be possible without adaptation of currently existing cell guides."
"We have also stipulated an external height of 2 900 mm, which corresponds to the height laid down by the European Organisation for Standardisation (CEN). We have thus created the best possible loading unit for road and rail."
"It must, though, be the European standardisation bodies, in conjunction with industry, that have the task of developing the detail of the standardisation."
"We have simply set a framework for this process."
"We wanted, or want, to create a standardisation procedure based on a mandate, so that standardisation can proceed more quickly. Efforts to achieve this have been under way for a long time, but they have not been concluded."
"This directive is merely the start of the process."
"Apart from the loading units, there are many other possible areas of intermodal transport where standardisation would be possible, for example at the interfaces between infrastructure and services, that is, terminals, trans-shipment facilities and, of course, information systems, liability and contractual regulations."
"Standardisation will therefore continue."
"I am pleased that we have made a start here, sending out a clear signal in favour of intermodal transport."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and thanking him for his work."
"Through his positive cooperation, he helped us understand the topic, which was not always an easy task, especially in a technical sense. He managed to immerse us in the subject without burying us."
"From our perspective, this was a very interesting experience of collaboration."
"The report, and indeed the Commission’s proposal, contained a number of challenges, and in my view, we dealt with these challenges very positively in committee."
"A new product must be attractive, in other words, it must be suitable for the market as well as being efficient and complying with modern requirements."
"I believe this outcome has been achieved."
"The product is designed to make the process quicker and easier while being suitable for new and existing lifting and stowage techniques."
"Existing systems will not simply be jettisoned overnight, as this would confront the people working in this sector with the need to undertake new or expensive investment overnight."
"Their security must be guaranteed."
"Very good solutions have been found to all these issues, in our view, and the Commission’s proposal and your committee report therefore have our support."
"Of course, it was the particular example of short sea shipping that was specified here, where intermodal transport already stands at 40%, but intermodal transport has not yet reached these figures in other modes of transport."
"In my view, the current initiative is designed to be an incentive for business and the transport sector to invest more in intermodal transport."
"I believe that we will persuade them to do so not only by offering subsidies, but by proposing efficient instruments, such as the all-round container, the supercontainer, as you call it, which allows for optimum loading while also taking account of what is happening on the international market and opening up new opportunities such as those you have described."
"Overall, we are very satisfied with your proposal."
"The only difference is that we still take the view that if the product is that good, the market will regulate it, so we do not need to invest any public money, although we are all convinced that it will be good for the overall development of the transport system if many actors become more multimodal."
"I would therefore like to make one final comment: I see our work today as a technical contribution to this concept, which we all endorse."
"However, if the loading units that we are proposing demonstrate their efficiency on water, in the air and on road and rail, then whatever form of transport is rolling along beneath them must demonstrate its efficiency as well."
"I say this to the railways in particular – we can improve the entire multimodal concept as much as we like in technical terms, but if one of the actors in the chain is weak or claims to be weak, the whole concept will be of no benefit whatsoever."
"So we see this as a positive step in the right direction, but it is also yet another clear wake-up call, especially to the railways, to adopt a multimodal way of thinking, to invest in this concept, and to review their structures and efficiency."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Mr Stockmann for drawing up an excellent report."
"At first there were various opinions on the matter and even misunderstandings, but the rapporteur managed, through a determined effort, to make headway on this issue and the committee in the end was very much of one mind on the development of the new European loading unit."
"The topic of discussion is the very challenging idea of making the various means of freight transportation in Europe compatible with one another."
"Standardised containers would bring benefits for congested Central Europe and, even more especially, to regions overseas."
"For example, 80% of the flow of foreign trade from my country, Finland, goes by sea, and the flexible operation of multimodal transport is absolutely crucial."
"The rapporteur has chosen the right way to proceed."
"The amendments are an attempt at ensuring there is compatibility with European standardisation offices and the prevention of problems with ISO standards."
"Operators in the sector will be given the responsibility for designing the new container in detail."
"There is a potential problem with Amendment No 17."
"If the height of the containers is to be 2.9 metres they will not, when stacked, fit the space currently available on present Roll-on Roll-off (RORO) ships."
"For that reason, the Commission’s proposal for the height of a container to be 2.67 metres would perhaps be better."
"Our group supports the proposal and we hope that the matter will also make speedy progress in practice."
"– Mr President, this Parliament has always believed in promoting a sustainable system for the transport of goods in which all modalities are accorded a role."
"In theory, these roles can be readily indicated, but practice has proved different, and so we have noticed that a number of modalities have been disadvantaged."
"One problem in this respect is the vast range of loading units, resulting in many cases from day-to-day practice."
"Some are used on a large scale, others to a lesser extent."
"All of this depends on the market situation."
"This latter is a dominant factor in the transport of goods."
"Changes are only meaningful when these are supported and encouraged by the market."
"This will only happen if actual benefits can be reaped."
"In this respect, the Commission proposal still contains a number of shortcomings."
"The introduction of a new loading unit is an excellent idea, provided it can actually be used in all modalities without any adjustments."
"It should be used in practice though."
"All commotion and comments with regard to this proposal seem to suggest otherwise."
"We are therefore delighted that the proposal is more market-oriented in the present report."
"The European Intermodal Loading unit (EILU) loading unit is no longer the panacea for all existing problems, but an option to be used in future, embedded in current operational activities."
"There is another area that will require attention during tomorrow’s vote, namely Amendment No 16."
"If the measurements included in this amendment are laid down, this is, to all intents and purposes, an elimination of the draft."
"In order to retain the positive aspects of the EILU – more pallets in one unit – it appears useful to leave the specific measurements to the market too, thus enabling the companies that do want to use the unit to achieve this technically."
"All things considered, Mr Stockmann has done an excellent job."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, let me remind you that the proposal prepared by you – following careful preparation by your officials – initially caused some confusion."
"The port authorities and shipping companies shot your proposal down in flames."
"In my view, we must also be grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Mr Grosch also worked very hard in the discussions with the industry, and as a result, we have largely assuaged the sector’s concerns."
"I think they were simply misunderstandings."
"I am very pleased that, especially with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur – which we on the Committee on Transport jointly support – we can establish and ensure here today that we are not proposing a European type of standardised container – I prefer not to use the term ‘supercontainers’ – which could obstruct our global transportation business."
"In the export and import industries, we are reliant on the effective, efficient and swift transportation of these loading units on ships without adaptation of currently existing cell guides etc."
"In my view, as stipulated in our amendments in committee, we must leave the task of working out the detail to the standardisation committees."
"As a lawyer, I would be reluctant to embark on the task of developing the fine detail in my role as a Member of this House."
"It is, however, my belief that the principles we have set out in the proposed amendments will ensure that the new European loading unit does not conflict with existing international norms."
"This new loading unit is important, for it enables us to align the industry’s interests in greater stowability of palettes with the interest of the shipping companies and port authorities not to have to change all the loading gear and the entire structure of the container ships."
"In this respect, I think we can be quite happy with what we have achieved."
"I hope that the industry will adopt what we are hoping for, namely more widespread use of intermodal units."
"We are reliant on the industry here."
"We simply make proposals and will have to wait and see whether the new standardised container is accepted by the industry."
"The industry’s task is to protect its own interests."
"Finally, I would like to point out that this proposal contains not only a definition of this new loading unit, but also a requirement for more stringent controls and inspections of all loading units, regardless of type."
"If loading units are not properly maintained and repaired, they can pose a danger in goods transportation, in port during trans-shipment etc. We must ensure that serious accidents do not occur, especially in ports and on ships."
"In this respect, the Commission is right to propose more frequent and thorough inspections of all loading units."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, we welcome an integrated approach to transport in which adequate use is made of all the types of transport available."
"If the problems of increasing traffic on the roads are to be solved, the European Union has to be pro-active in promoting intermodality."
"Pro-active, above all, means that the authorities should use the market to deal with the questions raised, not that the authorities should saddle the market with difficult regulations and added costs."
"In this proposal, this line of approach has not been followed completely, and that is why, initially, I had my reservations about a number of sections of the Commission’s proposal and the rapporteur’s proposal."
"However, now that the proposals have been adapted by means of amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, my greatest concerns have been lifted."
"In their choice of loading units, the participants in the market have to be free to find the best possible solution for each type of goods and mode of transport."
"At the same time, we should at all costs avoid a situation in which owners of intermodal loading units are faced with unnecessary obligations and high administrative and implementing costs."
"I do not think it necessary to use tax benefits or subsidies upon purchase to support the introduction of the European intermodal loading unit."
"The Commission has itself stated in its proposal that it does not want to make its use compulsory, but wants to leave its commissioning to the market."
"The introduction of subsidies and tax benefits runs counter to this idea."
"Technical specifications in which the characteristics of the intermodal loading units are described must be examined critically."
"Accordingly, it is important for the essential requirements that are prescribed not to contravene the international ISO standards."
"This on account of the fact that considerable use is made of units which are manufactured in accordance with international standards and which are also used outside of the Union."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur shares my concern in this matter, and that this is also being expressed in the text by means of an amendment."
"This also applies to adjusting the inspection period of the European intermodal loading units by equating them to those of the ISO container, which is frequently used in international traffic."
"The introduction of new intermodal loading units, though, does not yet guarantee intermodality."
"In addition to the current diversity, the poor quality of the rail services on offer constitutes an important barrier to the growth of intermodal transport."
"Internal shipping should also be included more in the discussion."
"As already stated, the improvement of transport requires quality legislation in which consideration is given to the scope of the market and which, by correct timing, can be introduced on time in an adequate and harmonised manner."
"That is, in fact, why I am of the opinion that the introduction of the digital tachograph should be shelved for one year so that legislation can meet the requirements to which I have referred, but lack of time has made it impossible to discuss this urgent matter with the Commission this week."
"This House still finds it difficult to actually get something done about it."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the work he has done and I believe that Parliament’s support for this initiative in general – though with some modifications – demonstrates its importance."
"I would like to point out firstly that I completely agree with several Members who have said that this alone is not sufficient: much more is needed."
"This initiative forms part of the strategy we have been developing over recent years, aimed at achieving more competitive, dynamic and operative transport, particularly in the rail sector; to update infrastructures so that we can genuinely put an end to the fragmentations and obstacles existing not just in the rail sector, but also – as we are doing now – amongst other modes of transport."
"This type of measure will enable us to promote intermodality."
"As the rapporteur has said quite rightly, following this attempt at convergence by means of certain common standardisation measures, other measures will have to be adopted, such as, for example, those relating to dock terminals."
"The Commission is already working on this issue in order to ascertain how we can achieve standardised dock systems, which facilitate loading and unloading and the docking of ships and which reduce times and costs."
"All of this is also associated with our proposal – which, unfortunately, has not moved forward – on the liberalisation of port services, in relation to which we also have to provide impetus and greater dynamism."
"This is all part of a whole."
"A single measure does not get us very far."
"We must make progress on all of them in order to achieve the best we can."
"I would like to say to the honourable Members that we accept the majority of the amendments."
"Some of them – Nos 2, 5, 14, 16 and 17 – must be reworded, because their current wording is perhaps not ideal."
"In any event, all of them are intended to clarify that the standardisation of intermodal loading units will not necessarily cause conflict with the existing global rules – in no way is that our intention."
"We believe that European standardisation bodies must not be, nor have any reason to be, slaves to the standards laid down by the International Standards Organisation, but that those bodies must decide which are the best possible standards for European intermodal transport, while taking due account, however, of the existing ISO standards and the needs of commerce."
"Furthermore, this proposal ultimately depends on whether the market accepts it."
"What we are proposing are common standards which can facilitate – if the market considers it appropriate – operation within the intermodal network with these new bodies, which, as I said before, would prevent interruptions and would allow the quick transfer from river to sea, to rail or to road."
"I would like to point out that we must reject Amendment No 6, since it states that harmonised rules will be developed by the European Standards Committee (CEN) and leaves out certain important standards bodies in this sector, such as the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)."
"Mr President, I trust that, following approval by Parliament, with the exclusion – I hope – of this Amendment No 6, we can make rapid progress in the Council and thereby launch a proposal for the sector which eases progress towards intermodality, which is absolutely essential."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the recommendation (A5-0042/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising the Member States to sign, ratify or accede to, in the interest of the European Community, the Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage, 1992, and authorising Austria and Luxembourg, in the interest of the European Community, to accede to the underlying instruments (14389/2003 – C5-0002/2004 – 2003/0209(AVC)) (Rapporteur: Mr J.M. Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado)."
". Mr President, the truth is that I tend to have plenty of work."
"If I count up all the issues, directives and regulations over the years, I think I am right in saying that I win hands down."
"In any case, I think that we all agree on the importance of what we are discussing today, the entry into force of the 2003 Protocol to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage (IOPC)."
"The funds for compensating victims of oil slicks are going to be increased to more than five times their current level, which is absolutely essential as it was clear from accidents such as the sinking of the and the that the funds available through IOPC were not sufficient."
"The Protocol still needs to come into force and we therefore need to encourage the Member States of the Union to ratify it quickly."
"We are convinced that it urgently needs to be applied, but unfortunately, the Member States are not taking the step forward."
"In the proposal that it put forward in September, the Commission urged the Member States to ratify the Protocol before the end of 2003 and it is now 2004."
"The common position adopted on 15 December set the deadline at June 2004 and the Commission made a declaration in this respect, indicating that we would have preferred it to have been ratified before the end of last year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its hard work on this issue, given that the Council only sent the Common Position to Parliament a few weeks ago."
"I of course want Parliament to take up the suggestions of the rapporteur, Mr Gil Robles, whom I thank not only for having conducted the debate on this report and coordinated it with all Members so quickly, but also for the clear manner in which he explains all the points and the importance of this document."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating expresses the agreement required from Parliament, as we have just been told, in order for the Member States to establish and ratify the 2003 Protocol to the International Convention on Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage."
"As has just been explained to us, the Convention created a fund to compensate victims of damage and it should be pointed out that it is funded by contributions from the companies or other entities that receive oil transported by sea."
"Therefore, increasing the maximum sum of compensation from the current EUR 162 million, as this Protocol requests, is not going to be a burden on public funds, but on those who benefit from the oil trade."
"Since 1978, the Fund has been used in more than one hundred cases, and in the majority the limit set was sufficient."
"However, the Commissioner reminded us that the and accidents demonstrated that the limit was now out of date and needed to be increased."
"Therefore, in March 2003, following the wave of emotion and concern unleashed by the latter of these disasters, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union asked for the Fund to be increased to one billion euros and, in May of that year, the decision was commendably taken on board very rapidly by the Member States of the International Maritime Organisation."
"In its Resolution of July 2003, very soon afterwards in the same year, on increasing maritime safety following the sinking of the oil tanker (the report by Mr Sterckx), Parliament was in favour of the decision by the global organisation and called upon the Member States to ratify the relevant Protocol as soon as possible."
"This was the first time that they were called upon to ratify it quickly."
"As we have been told, the Commission not only acted swiftly, but with clear political commitment, by asking the Council to move on from the very easy promising phase to the fulfilling phase, which is always more difficult."
"Finally, when the situation was becoming quite embarrassing, it secured the agreement from the Italian Presidency, setting a target date, as long as it was possible, which is what the Commissioner has just explained to us."
"The truth is that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market unanimously adopted the proposal to ratify the Protocol."
"In fact it would have been enough to issue the assent, but I felt it was essential to stress the request in Recital C of the Decision, that it is important for the Member States to sign or ratify the Protocol."
"I must acknowledge that all the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market were on this same wavelength."
"Why?"
"Because, as long as it is not signed and ratified by those Member States, we will remain in the current situation, in other words, with a fund that is insufficient to cover potential compensation."
"It therefore stresses that the Protocol should enter into force."
"Parliament wanted to make it clear that, from now on, any delay cannot be blamed on or attributed to the Community institutions."
"It will be the Member States who drag their feet in ratifying the Protocol who will have to face up to their responsibilities."
"I would like to think that this will not be the case and that they will all ratify it as swiftly as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all that remains – as my time is running out – is for me to thank the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the support they have given me, this committee and Parliament’s services for their invaluable help, and the Commission for the political support that it has consistently given."
"The report put forward today is necessary and urgent."
"I therefore trust that you will vote in favour of it."
". Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to this matter of the Protocol for 2003 adding to the International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage established in 1992, which is in the form of an intergovernmental organisation, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which I represent as rapporteur, was in favour of adopting the proposal for a Council Decision authorising the Member States to sign, ratify or accede to the Protocol."
"The FIPOL Protocol 2003 extends the maximum amount of cumulative funds available according to the various international agreements to 750 million special drawing rights, which, at the current exchange rate, is equivalent to 930 million euros. These funds are provided by shipowners and companies that receive oil transported by sea, to compensate for environmental disasters and victims of spills caused by accidents."
"One year after the accident, however, it is still difficult to assess the damage caused."
"A new report by the World Wide Fund for Nature shows that 3 000 kilometres of coastline were affected and calculates the damage to be around 5 000 million euros, in other words, five times the FIPOL Protocol for 2003 would be needed to deal with all of the damage caused."
"We therefore continue to call for a European Fund in addition to all the existing international funds, particularly considering the huge amount of oil traffic on our seas and the existence of areas such as the ‘, or the ‘Coast of Death’ in Galicia, which is one of the places where there have been the most maritime accidents in the past, along with other black spots such as the Calais straits, etc."
"We would also like to express our dissatisfaction at the deadline for this Protocol to be signed being extended to the end of June 2004, as agreed by the Council and the Member States, rather than retaining the original date of last December."
"If another accident were to take place during the first six months of this year, the cover would only be around 250 million euros, which is more than concerning."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Gil Robles on his report and I hope that the Commission will continue with its proposal for an additional European fund, because it is needed."
"Mr President, I think that both the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Gil-Robles, have expressed the substance of this proposal and Mr Ortuondo Larrea has also given various pieces of information that there is no need for me to repeat."
"This is an assent procedure, which means that Parliament has to adopt the decision in order for it to be obligatory and, in this particular case, Parliament has acted quickly, because the letter from the Council requesting the assent is dated 8 January, and tomorrow, 12 February, one month and five days later, Parliament will give its assent."
"I think that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been exemplary in this respect, because the request was put forward so that we had already appointed Mr Gil-Robles in October, in order that when the Council proposal arrived, we could adopt it quickly."
"I think this is a good example of interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions, almost ."
"From the point of view of content, Mr Ortuondo has pointed out the fact that there are insufficient resources."
"For example, in the case of the , we are talking about EUR 5 000 million, which is only one fifth of the amount needed to cover the damage, which is why Mr Ortuondo stressed the need for an additional European fund."
"I would like to discuss other more legal matters, however."
"Firstly, according to Community law, it is not the Member States who have competence in this field, but the European Union as a whole."
"The agreed formula is an intelligent one: the Member States signing in the interests of the Community."
"We hope that the legal system can be changed so that the European Community itself will be an actual member in order to avoid situations such as this in which particular Member States, such as Austria and Luxembourg, will not be bound by the agreement until 2005."
"There is also another quite peculiar situation: Denmark is not bound by this decision and it just so happens that it is one of the Member States that is most exposed to this type of accident, due to the extent of its straits."
"I wonder whether the Danish people are aware that, as a result of this , damage caused in Denmark by this type of incident will not be covered."
"I therefore feel that, from now on, although the Commission has acted as swiftly and efficiently as possible, it should initiate progress in this respect."
"This is not an agreement signed by the Member States in the interests of the Community, but an agreement signed by the European Union in the interests of the whole of the European Union: defending national sovereignty does not benefit the citizens of the European Union, which is what we are concerned with."
"This would be a fundamental lesson to learn from this type of agreement."
"We cannot continue to operate with old instruments from former ages, in which the Member States were acting to defend national interests, when we are dealing with collective interests, such as preserving the environment across the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in mid-2001, we discussed the Esclopé report concerning the desirability of the increase of the limit for damages in the case of maritime oil disasters."
"The Council’s common position has been long overdue."
"The International Maritime Organisation has, however, decided to raise the limit of existing funds to 750 000 Special Drawing Rights and thus placed the limit virtually at EUR 1 billion, so this addressed the point that this House made in the Esclopé report."
"We would therefore like to congratulate those Member States that belong to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on this decision."
"It does justice to reality and gives guarantees for an adequate financial arrangement in the case of oil pollution."
"This does not detract in any way from the fact that prevention is better than cure."
"I hope that this elaboration of the liability regulation offers encouragement in this respect."
"Consequently, the report by our ex-President receives my wholehearted support."
"Mr President, the FIPOL Protocol that we are debating today, to increase the financial resources available to compensate victims of spillages, is another matter which I would like to say to Commissioner de Palacio has nothing to do with the ."
"In fact, it would be ludicrous to tell the victims of this disaster that, because of the fact that we, Europe as a whole, did not do our duty, they are only going to be compensated for 15% of the damage suffered, because the fund for that purpose only has EUR 170 million available and because unfortunately this increase that we are debating today is not retroactive."
"Following the accident (we are talking about November 1999) it became clear that the compensation system was inadequate for dealing with this type of disaster, both at international and European level, where such mechanisms were not provided for."
"The IMO decided, a long time before the sank, to increase the amount allocated to the FIPOL to compensate victims to EUR 600 million, and in 2000, the Commissioner proposed creating an additional European fund, Compensation for Oil Pollution in European waters (COPE), with a limit of one billion euros."
"The proposal received the support of the European Parliament, but was rejected by the Council, which opted to negotiate in the IMO."
"Although the IMO finally established a new fund, and even set it close to the magic and famous billion figure, that amount will never be able to ensure full and swift compensation for victims of future oil spills, for two reasons."
"The first was mentioned by Mr Ortuondo Larrea: more than a year after the disaster we are far from succeeding in assessing the full extent of the consequences, not only because the vessel, carrying at least 15 000 tonnes, is still 3 000 metres deep in the Atlantic, but also because the oil is still reaching our coastlines."
"The second reason is that the rising number of increasingly independent reports calculate the damage caused at a figure that is never less than five billion euros."
"The maximum compensation limits cannot guarantee sufficient protection for potential victims of a large oil slick; this can only be achieved through unlimited liability, including collective damage."
"Setting a limit on damage is not rational and, above all, it sends a perverse signal to potential polluters."
"Given that only sovereign States can be parties to the Protocol, as has been mentioned here, the Commission proposes that we call upon the Member States to sign or ratify it – sign or ratify the protocol as soon as possible and by July 2004 if possible – in the words of Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, whom I congratulate on his work as rapporteur."
"Perhaps, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, we will have to get down on our knees, because, from May until now, only two Member States have ratified it and a minimum of eight ratifications are needed in order for it to enter into force."
"I also think it will be necessary to develop the agreements to extend the circle of liability, which, as we have said many times, should cover all those involved in the transport chain."
"Mr President, there was unanimous agreement on Mr Robles' recommendation on the part of the committee members, which is why we are encouraging him to go further."
"The system of liability under the two international conventions is a multiple system."
"Apart from subjective liability, which does not operate in practice, we have the objective liability of the shipowner, with compensation capped at EUR 72 million, and the supplementary liability of the fund in the event that the shipowner is unable to pay or the above sum is exceeded, which has been amended from EUR 92 to 250 million."
"The extensive damage following the accidents involving the and the proved the inadequacy of the compensation provided for."
"Thus, in December 2000, efforts were made, following a proposal by the Commission, to set up a European supplementary fund for damage in European waters."
"This liability would also be supplementary because the obligation to pay compensation would apply if there was no compensation from the funds."
"Although this proposal was approved by the European Parliament, it was rejected by the Council."
"By a happy coincidence, we know that, in May 2003, the protocol for the establishment of the International Fund for Compensation was adopted, with compensation capped at EUR 1 billion."
"This is again a supplementary fund."
"Given that no Community rules have been adopted to regulate the question of compensation for damage from oil spills, the Council decision to accede to the protocol must be seen by all of us as a particularly positive action."
"That is why the European Parliament, without reservations, must give its assent, with Article 200, paragraph 3 of the Treaty as the legal basis."
"It should be noted that there is exclusive jurisdiction on matters regulated by the protocol for the supplementary fund."
"In all events, there is no clash with Regulation 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments, because the protocol is based on the existing regime in the 1992 Convention."
"It is clarified that this is not accession by the European Union itself, but authorisation to the Member States to ratify the protocol."
"The rapporteur rightly points out that this must be done as quickly as possible, even before June this year."
"We hope that, in future negotiations, the possibility will be provided for the Community to become a contracting party to the protocol."
"There is no such provision today."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that the Commission has urged the Member States to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible, but unfortunately they have not yet done so."
"I entirely agree with Mr Medina that it should be the Commission that is responsible to the International Maritime Organisation, at least for matters in which we have exercised Community competence."
"The problem is that, as you are well aware, we have not been able to join the Organisation because, among other things, the Council has had the mandate for some time now."
"It is a proposal that I made nearly two years ago and, unfortunately, the various presidencies that there have been during that time have been very busy with other matters."
"This is true, but I also think that they should have given some attention to this issue, which they did not do."
"In summary, the Council’s enthusiasm for moving forward in terms of Community presence in the International Maritime Organisation is not across the board."
"The same is happening with another organisation, the International Civil Organisation, but I entirely agree that this is the right approach, particularly when, in this case, competence has been exercised in this field for the past four years, which had not been done before."
"The competence that the Community has now taken on is much greater and, therefore, it should also be able to defend it at international level."
"I would say to Mrs Miguélez that, as she is well aware, I made a proposal regarding criminal liability, among other things, because there is often a problem of wilful negligence, and not only in cases like those of the and the in which it is up to the judges to decide whether or not it is wilful, but also in cases in which bilges are being cleaned unscrupulously and tanks are being cleaned unscrupulously on the high seas, representing 90% of the spillages that take place on our coasts; it is true that they are more diluted, extended over a longer period of time and a larger area, and therefore are less concentrated, but the impact is absolutely disastrous and devastating and, as you are aware, I have proposed that this problem be dealt with."
"Earlier someone, I think it was Mr Ortuondo Larrea, was talking about the European Maritime Safety Agency, and certifying systems to monitor the issue of bilges and emptying tanks and also, in order to combat these types of measures."
"As you are aware, I believe that we need to act on every front: we need to act through the European Maritime Safety Agency, through monitoring by the port authorities, through the facilities which, it should be remembered, we adopted here, facilities in the ports enabling the vessels to unload and clean bilges and deal with other waste water."
"This should be done, do not think that we are forgetting, using the latest technology, from satellite photography to every type of system and method available for monitoring the systems installed in the vessels themselves, at the exit points in order to monitor when they leave and whether or not the cleaning has been done."
"I think that we need to act on all fronts because sea pollution is something that we cannot tolerate."
"The sea does not just belong to all Europeans, but to all of humanity, and we have the responsibility to preserve it for future generations."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you especially to Mr Gil Robles for the swiftness with which he prepared this report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."

"The next item is a report (A5-0035/2004) by Mr Brie, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Afghanistan: challenges and prospects for the future [2003/2121(INI)]."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you have ever visited Afghanistan or endeavoured to become more deeply informed about it, you will know how appalling and how extensive is the damage that has been done there – materially, culturally, socially and in human terms."
"Civil wars, the power struggles of local warlords, the Soviet war of occupation, the Taliban dictatorship, and the Northern Alliance’s bombardments too have killed and maimed millions, destroyed the economy of what was already an extremely poor country and left much of its society in ruins."
"For centuries, Afghanistan was the plaything of foreign powers’ strategic interests."
"In my view, the present situation is above all the consequence of the wars sparked off by the Soviet invasion, and of the USA’s short-sighted policies, both of which gave the Taliban real military and political power in Afghanistan."
"The victims have always been Afghan women, children and men – in their millions."
"This report, however, is not meant to be about our differences on the past – although we certainly have them – but about our common position that the international community must take responsibility for providing, on a massive scale, political, financial and economic support for the people of Afghanistan in shaping a peaceful, democratic and social future for themselves."
"This aid, and the financial support provided by the Commission in particular, must not be cut back; it must be stepped up to take account of the prevailing conditions."
"It would be irresponsible of the international community, in the shadow of the war in Iraq and of the tragic difficulties there, to backtrack on its commitment to Afghanistan and weaken its solidarity with its people."
"I believe that it is precisely because of the situation in Iraq and the unilateralist approach to it that Afghanistan must be one of the international community’s successes, on the basis of the UN Charter and with a pivotal role for the UN."
"Significant and positive changes have been made since the Taliban were ousted."
"This has been principally to the credit of the political forces in Afghanistan itself."
"The constitution that has just been adopted is a particularly important indicator of progress, guaranteeing as it does fundamental democratic and human rights, doing justice to all ethnic groups and stressing equal treatment for women and men – the latter being immensely significant not only in view of the overthrown regime’s brutal oppression of women and girls, but also in view of the fact that the situation remains totally unsatisfactory today, with women and girls still at a massive disadvantage, excluded from participation in many aspects of social life and with dreadful violence against women a fact of day-to-day life, with thousands of incidents."
"The international community must, as we do in our report, demand universal human rights, with women’s rights included among them."
"Whilst not adopting an imperial approach to doing this, it must be consistent."
"Despite these – and other – advances, the situation in Afghanistan is extremely volatile."
"The most pressing problems are the non-existent or minimal security in many regions, the potential for conflict inherent in the unbroken military might of warlords, governors and drug traffickers; the disarmament process has ground to a halt, it is proving difficult to demobilise soldiers from the private armies and reintegrate them into society, the Taliban are regrouping in some parts of the south and south-east of the country and there has been a dramatic increase in opium poppy cultivation and in drug trafficking."
"As these problems must not be allowed to prevent the forthcoming presidential elections being conducted successfully, I appeal to all Members of this House, and especially to those belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, not to support the amendments seeking to delete the description of these problems."
"Were we to do that, we would, I believe, be doing the people of Afghanistan no favours, nor would we be doing ourselves any if we want to keep Afghanistan as an international policy priority."
"Let me also remind you in this regard that, when we recently honoured the Secretary-General of the UN by awarding him and his organisation the Sakharov Prize, we did so in memory of the UN personnel killed in Iraq; the warning of a worsening security situation given as recently as 15 January by Lakhdar Brahimi, who was at the time the UN’s special envoy in Afghanistan and is now its special envoy in Iraq, must be taken seriously."
"I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee, and all the groups."
"I believe that we had a common will to make clear how much Afghanistan is a priority."
"Many thanks also to the EU Commission, to its staff in Kabul and to Francesc Vendrell, its special representative there."
". Madam President, I would like to apologise to the honourable Member at the outset for missing the first minute of his speech."
"But I would like to say how much I agreed with the rest of it, particularly what he said about the continuing priority that we must give to Afghanistan."
"I also agree very strongly with what he said about the commitment, the dedication and the courage of some of those who are implementing our programmes in Afghanistan."
"I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss Afghanistan in the week before I go there again and in the run-up to the most challenging goal set in the Bonn Agreement of 2001 – the free and fair election of a democratic government in Afghanistan."
"There was enormous optimism at Bonn about building a strong and democratic Afghanistan, and delivering a peace dividend to the whole population."
"Since then there have been huge strides forward, but there are still formidable challenges ahead of us."
"Last year I suggested that Afghanistan was at a critical crossroads and that the international community should redouble its efforts to help President Karzai extend his authority across the country."
"It is increasingly clear that this also means stamping out opium poppy production."
"The 2003 UN opium poppy survey makes extremely disturbing reading: not only has production risen by 6% from the bumper levels seen in 2002, but cultivation has spread into new areas – it now affects almost 90% of provinces."
"This pernicious trade – valued at about EUR 2.5 billion – undermines the efforts to build a functioning plural democratic state and also fuels ongoing instability and conflict."
"But before discussing how the international community is working with the Afghan Government to tackle this, I would like to highlight what Afghanistan has achieved in the last twelve months."
"Firstly, a new constitution – which recognises women as equal to men – has been agreed by the Constitutional Loya Jirga."
"Next, the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration has started, and there have been some encouraging early results on the reduction of heavy arms in Kabul and the Panshir valley."
"There has also been a start to the election registration process, though we need to speed up the pace."
"On the economic front, GDP growth raced ahead by 30% in 2002, with a figure of 20% expected in 2003."
"The new currency introduced in late 2002 has remained stable and the Afghan Government has succeeded in increasing the flow of tax revenues to Kabul."
"The international community has also continued 'to do more' than we promised at Tokyo."
"Total European Union commitments in 2003 exceeded EUR 835 million, of which just over EUR 300 million came from the Commission."
"As in 2002, over 70% of the Commission’s support has been contracted in year, which is an impressive track record by any standards."
"The Commission’s development programme has ensured that health services are delivered in six provinces, covering 20% of the population; travel times on the Kabul-Jalalabad road have already been cut by up to half, and work to fully reconstruct the road is now beginning."
"Key public sector workers – including doctors, teachers and the police – are back at work."
"The rural economy continues to grow, reflecting the provision of improved seed, animal vaccination and the widespread rehabilitation of irrigation structures."
"De-mining continues to enable people to return to their own homes."
"In addition, funding from ECHO of EUR 127 million has helped to support the return of 2.5 million refugees to Afghanistan since 2002."
"However, Afghanistan’s future depends critically on security."
"The escalating violence in 2003 has, as the honourable Member said, claimed the lives of aid workers, ISAF troops and many Afghan citizens."
"It has left large parts of the south and south-east off limits for international staff."
"By the end of 2003, EUR 13 million of Commission projects in high-risk areas had been temporarily suspended."
"We must recognise that insecurity and burgeoning opium poppy production are two sides of the same coin."
"Without better security, reconstruction will certainly stall, and we will find ourselves struggling to hold open and credible elections."
"So I strongly welcome Member States' engagement in the Provincial Reconstruction Teams, as well as their continued support to ISAF."
"I strongly hope that NATO will be able to provide more troops."
"I also welcome the role that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom are playing in helping the Afghan Government to build an efficient army, police force, and judicial system, as well as to implement an effective anti-narcotics policy."
"Without stronger institutions and better law enforcement, we will get nowhere in the fight against drugs."
"This is exactly why the Commission committed an extra EUR 50 million to support the police in late 2003, and why we will continue to play our part in delivering security, including tackling opium production."
"As I am sure the House is aware, in May 2003 the Afghan Government adopted a robust anti-narcotics policy embracing alternative livelihoods, institution building, effective law enforcement and demand reduction."
"The Commission has worked closely with the Afghan Government, the UK – the lead donor on anti-narcotics – and the UN to help develop and implement this strategy."
"In particular, in 2003 the Commission committed EUR 9 million to promote alternative livelihoods in the Eastern region; EUR 3 million to reinforce border control along the Afghan-Iran border; and EUR 65.5 million to support the police in delivering effective law enforcement across Afghanistan."
"In addition, the wider EUR 100 million committed for rural development for 2003-2004 will help to provide long-term legitimate employment for those currently involved in poppy production."
"This underlines the huge importance we attach to curbing the drug economy."
"I have asked Commission services to report back on how this will be taken forward following the Drugs Conference a few days ago on 8 and 9 February."
"I hope to have substantive discussions on this when I return to Kabul with the Ministerial Troika next week."
"Building a secure Afghanistan will not be achieved overnight."
"We all know that the road ahead is far from easy."
"But we cannot afford to let reconstruction fail in Afghanistan and it is critical that the international community underlines its strong and continued support for President Karzai at the upcoming International Conference."
"I would like to finish by thanking this House for its unwavering commitment to Afghanistan, especially as regards the budget."
"I look forward to building on this over the coming year and to informing the House, in due course, of the conclusions I arrive at after my next visit to Afghanistan."
". – Madam President, as we all know, Afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys."
"It is home to over 30 different ethnic groups, among them Pashtoons, Hasara and Tajiks, who co-exist in an equilibrium that has developed over history, but is very unstable."
"It is thus clear to us all that Afghanistan’s problems can be resolved only if proposed solutions and aid programmes are in harmony with Afghan culture and history."
"As the rapporteur said, the situation of women in Afghanistan is particularly tragic."
"The rate of maternal mortality is among the highest in the world; that is also the case for deaths of infants and children."
"According to official estimates the incidence of illiteracy among Afghan women stands at 90%."
"I believe that the position of women can be improved only if we involve the men."
"Women cannot be helped without persuading their husbands, fathers, brothers and their clan chiefs as well."
"If we want to help Afghan women, we have to respect their culture, and, in a country in which women have endured years of oppression, it is the men to whom it has to be explained that, if things are good for their wives and children, then they will be all right too and so society as a whole is better off."
"As has been said, women and men must be accorded the same rights."
"It is also important that we should build schools for girls – and for boys too – so that there can be some changes in the way they think."
"Reference has been made to the Afghan constitution, which accords equal rights to women and men, and which prohibits discrimination of any kind."
"As it gets involved, the European Union should continue to respect all this and allow its aid measures to benefit the population as a whole."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation on this issue and am behind both him and the Commission in their conviction that Afghanistan must continue to be a priority on our political agenda if the people who live there are to be helped."
"– Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Brie for his report, which has given us a fair picture of the situation in Afghanistan, one also very similar to that which we saw together on the ground when we visited last June, under the clear guidance of Mr Morillon."
"Since 2001 and following the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan, with the aid of the European Union and with international assistance, has had to face numerous challenges in order to ensure, on the one hand, its physical reconstruction and, on the other, its political reconstruction."
"I am clearly delighted with the adoption of a new Constitution for Afghanistan, on 4 January, by the Loya Jirga."
"This new Constitution marks a step forward on the road to democracy, as well as being a fundamental condition for the organisation of the future presidential and legislative elections."
"In order for the reconstruction to become a reality, however, and for the political process to be a success, a secure environment is necessary, so that the governmental bodies, the agents of international assistance and civil society can combine their efforts to reconstruct the country's infrastructures and civil institutions."
"There will be no reconstruction without security."
"That is why we must support the establishment of future provincial reconstruction teams, PRTs, which should soon be deployed outside Kabul."
"These teams will have the task of ensuring security, but also helping in the reconstruction of the country."
"Our support must extend to the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into civilian life."
"Finally, we must support the Afghan Government in its fight against opium growing, with a view to helping it to find effective alternative solutions."
"We must be aware that opium production has increased by 6% since 2002, which means that the country is the world's biggest supplier with 77% of world production."
"Furthermore, the European Union and the international community must continue to actively support the numerous NGOs which, despite the climate of insecurity, provide considerable assistance to the Afghan population."
"Within this humanitarian framework, we must encourage implementation of prevention centres and help centres for women, expectant mothers and children."
"In fact, even though we must take pleasure in the reference to equal treatment in the new Constitution, we all know that the situation of women is fragile and that respect for their fundamental rights will only be achieved with the help of the international community and as a result of intensive information and education campaigns."
"Afghanistan needs financial aid and logistical support from the European Union now more than ever."
"The democratic process has begun, but it remains fragile."
"It is important that the Commission quickly mobilises the necessary resources to ensure effective financial aid."
"That is why I believe that the creation of the European agency for reconstruction in Afghanistan, similar to the one implemented in Kosovo, should receive our full support."
"In summary, I would like to remind you that we owe a debt to Afghanistan."
"For many years we have been absent when that country needed us."
"It is now our responsibility to do everything to help Afghanistan finally live in peace."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Iraq, the occupation of Afghanistan rests on a solid legal basis."
"The United Nations Security Council agreed to the military action aimed at eliminating the terrorist bases where the attacks against the United States in Kenya, in Yemen, in New York and in Washington had been promoted."
"Also unlike secular Iraq, the Afghanistan of the Taliban had taken the form of a retrograde clerical State in which one of the worst forms of repression consisted of reducing women to the status of nonentity."
"Despite these clear differences, there are certain similarities between the economic and political reconstructions of Iraq and of Afghanistan."
"As in Iraq, in Afghanistan there is also increasing insecurity, which obliges civilian and military personnel, both indigenous and foreign, to dedicate much of their efforts to their own protection."
"Afghanistan and Iraq are both countries with a tribal structure where local bosses and ethnic and religious leaders only want to take the biggest slice of the national cake."
"In the past, national unity was only guaranteed by means of a dictatorship, and foreigners or occupying forces are not considered as allies unless they serve the interests of a certain clan chief."
"But as time passes, their presence is becoming more and more embarrassing, and at any time irritation may turn to hate, with a war of liberation just around the corner."
"The Brie report on Afghanistan brings us face to face with this reality by reminding us of certain essential truths, including the need to speed up the pace of reform and reconstruction."
"It rightly criticises the ambiguities of the new Constitution adopted by the tribal grand council, particularly with regard to the restriction of freedom of expression and the situation of women."
"When in 2004 we still see the shadows of women imprisoned in their burkas wandering amongst the ruins and the misery, the advantages over the previous regime are not at all obvious."
"The challenge of nation building is far from being won."
"Nevertheless, like our rapporteur I believe that, for the moment, the United Nations, the European Union and NATO have no choice but to continue their efforts to apply great courage to constructing a democratic Afghanistan which respects the rights of men and women."
"It is essential to establish decentralised institutions and the withdrawal of foreign troops."
"It is then up to Afghanistan to take control of its own destiny."
"Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his magnificent report on Afghanistan, a country which was in the headlines in autumn 2001."
"The Taliban regime was destroyed at that time, but that involved a genuine civil war and consequently exiles, displaced persons and a series of destructions of the country’s structures."
"What is the situation today?"
"Afghanistan is a country that needs not just political and social reconstruction but also economic reconstruction."
"I would like to mention the report which the European Union's special representative in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, presented to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy around a year ago."
"He had the experience of having been a United Nations delegate to Afghanistan and he described to us the lack of security in the majority of the territory."
"Today Afghanistan has an extremely serious problem with the drugs trade."
"The trade is estimated, as Commissioner Patten has said, to stand at USD 2.5 million per year, which is equivalent to approximately half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product."
"We hear about 70 000 to 80 000 hectares of cultivation by the bosses who control the territory, cultivation which is not restricted to raw production, since there are also ‘refining’ plants so that the drug can be exported directly."
"According to the report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), two-thirds of the world’s heroin is produced in Afghanistan."
"This naturally creates serious problems in the country and, in this regard, I hope the support of the European Union and the international community can continue with a view to eradicating consumption as well, which, as the Commissioner has said, is the other face of the existing insecurity."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank our rapporteur for the very complete nature of his report."
"It contains absolutely everything we may wish to find, and so it is a pleasure to read and support it."
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress that we have made women the emblem of the oppression of the Afghan people."
"We have made women the emblem of the fight against the Taliban."
"Will we make women the emblem of the reconstruction of Afghanistan?"
"That is not certain and therefore – as was said on comparing the situation in Afghanistan with that in Iraq just now – at times of war or liberation, in certain countries, the issue of women arises and becomes particularly acute."
"In this regard, the situation of Iraqi women is alarming."
"So why do we not focus on the issue of women today in Afghanistan?"
"Commissioner, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has had an exchange of letters with you in relation to the attention paid to the issue of women within the framework of reconstruction and in relation to the proportion of aid earmarked by the European Union for this issue."
"We wanted 20%."
"I realise that this is enormous and that the figure is perhaps rather arbitrary."
"In fact, it appears that 2% is allocated to this chapter."
"Mainstreaming, above all in the field of health, certainly plays its role to the full, and so we are not going to talk about figures."
"Having said that, what really amazes me, as well as the scant importance attached to the issue of women, is above all the absence of an education dossier in the Commission's work and in the budget lines proposed."
"Everybody knows that the issue of education, and in particular the education of girls, is essential within the context of women as an emblem of reconstruction."
"That was the first comment I wanted to make."
"The second is that we are certainly very happy with the mention of the principle of equality between men and women in the Constitution."
"We ourselves are fighting, in this House, for this principle to be present in the European Constitution."
"It follows that this issue does not only arise over in Afghanistan, but here as well."
"We are very well aware, here, that a principle is not sufficient, that it needs to be applied."
"We are happy with what has just happened in Morocco in relation to women's rights, but we are waiting for it to be applied."
"The same is clearly true for Afghanistan as it is for us."
"Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Brie needs little comment."
"In my opinion, it gives a good account of the problems with the new constitution."
"It makes it clear that there are good reasons for possibly delaying the elections by a few months, and emphasises once again the need to further improve the situation of women."
"The tragedy is, however, that, with this report in our hands and the Commission’s good intentions, we have sadly found ourselves in a position where we may well be full of good intentions and have excellent plans, but neither the European Parliament nor even the European Commission has any influence on the circumstances under which those plans have to be carried out, namely the lack of security."
"There is a growing number of reports from NGOs stating that twelve aid workers were killed last year, for example."
"A growing number of reports from NGOs reveal that there is a very large number of good projects that they are unable to carry out."
"The Commissioner, too, referred to EUR 30 million of projects that, sadly, cannot be carried out owing to the lack of security."
"This week, we have once more seen the newspapers full of splendid plans for rapid reaction forces."
"That is great when it comes to preventing bloodshed in Africa, but it must not be at the expense of less sexy projects, so to speak, such as the difficult development work in Afghanistan."
"After all, the Member States of the European Union now have a good deal to say for themselves in the way of promises, magnificent things that should be done, but soldiers are not going there, they are going there far too little, and that is the key problem."
"I believe that there are hardly any fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats still here, but I should like to call them to account on a mistake they made in December, in my view."
"They convinced Parliament that we should cut the aid to Afghanistan – yes, you heard right – because drug trafficking is not being tackled."
"The fact that drug trafficking is not being tackled is a direct consequence of the omission on the part of EU Member States to send any troops to Afghanistan, which contributes to dependence on warlords for the maintenance of order by such troops as are there, and consequently makes those troops reluctant to tackle opium trafficking."
"We must avoid a situation where we fail to keep our promises again, where Afghanistan sinks into an opium economy, led by warlords, and – my greatest concern – where the hopes of many Afghans, particularly Afghan women, are dashed once again."
"We must not allow this to happen."
"Madam President, Commissioner, very recently, a thought-provoking analysis of the political situation in Afghanistan appeared in the with the headline: ‘Afghanistan: The Gulf between Report and Reality’."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you can be assured that the present report has prompted me to reflect on this a good deal."
"I should like to summarise the article for you, therefore, and add a question about our strategy in Afghanistan."
"I also hope to give the article to the Commissioner later on, and that he has time to peruse it."
"This journalist, John Jennings, disproves the spectre of the Afghan countryside as an Oriental Wild West on the basis of his own observations."
"With a few localised exceptions, he sees a safe, peaceful society; in short, no local warlords constantly making life unbearable for each other and the population."
"On the contrary, he sees encouraging signs of reconstruction, and also the return of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran."
"In the opinion of Jennings, that huge majority of ordinary Afghans living in areas not actively contested by Taliban remnants have it better today than at any time since 1978."
"Interim President Karzai should have every interest in this."
"To look at the scenario Jennings describes, however, the reverse seems to be true: with the help of ISAF and NATO, the technocrats in Kabul are seeking the military and political removal of the anti-Taliban groups in the provinces."
"It is precisely that Pashtoon agenda that gives rise to the very real danger of a general revolt against a regime imposed from outside: an Afghan tradition."
"In Jennings’s view, it would be much more beneficial to the future of Afghanistan as a nation state to construct carefully and gradually from the bottom up, and to achieve political consensus among the regional authorities, which do, after all, sanction a weak central authority."
"Interfering with this fragile process would give the Taliban and their anti-Western Pakistani patrons a second chance."
"This would mean an out-and-out defeat for the West in the fight against Islamic terrorism."
"Paragraphs 12 and 13 of this report reveal that my colleague Mr Brie recognises the acute problem, this area of tension."
"Unfortunately, he does not enter into a more in-depth exploration of this fundamental problem regarding Afghanistan’s future as a nation: this issue is subordinated."
"We shall have to make do with that."
"What are the views of the Council and the Commission in this regard?"
"I should like to bring this article to the attention of Commissioner Patten, particularly given his plans to set off for Kabul in the near future."
"I shall hand it to you later on."
"After all, no small matter is involved: a fair, sensible international strategy towards a breeding ground for international terrorist networks."
"– Madam President, one reason why Afghanistan is a topic of crucial importance is the need to demonstrate that not only can terrorism with State links be defeated, but that peace can then be won too."
"Things are not looking too good in Afghanistan at the moment."
"It is rumoured that Taliban groups in the south are making mighty advances, one hears – as the Russian defence minister, Mr Ivanov, said in Munich last week – that the cultivation of drugs has increased nine times over since the war began, and we see how soldiers from Europe, who are supposed to be working for the country’s future security, are unable to take action against it."
"It appears that they were watching over the drug routes along which the drugs find their way to Europe and to our children."
"To my mind, this is a very problematic situation and is the reason why it is urgently necessary that we should make every effort to facilitate the establishment of the rule of law and of democracy under a strong and guaranteed central power that also takes account of ethnic differences and of diversity."
"There will be no peace in Afghanistan for as long as – as has been the case – the provision of aid and the division of power are one-sided, with the Pashtoons losing out."
"This, I believe, is something else that we have to stress."
"The elections need to be properly prepared, so that it is clear who is entitled to vote and so that the elections may gain legitimacy, and the new constitution needs to be used in order for this balance of power to be achieved."
"The new constitution brings with it both opportunities and problems, for it makes Sharia law possible."
"While the courts still have judges as conservative as the present ones, nothing that comes out of them will be acceptable to us in terms of our view of what the rule of law means."
"This, I believe, is why we must, over the coming weeks and months, devote much attention and a great deal of effort to looking after this country."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to thank Mr Brie for the wonderful work he has done, providing us with a clear and accurate picture of the reconstruction work that Afghanistan has to undertake and the challenges it must face in the coming years."
"Above all, though, I would like to thank him for the particular attention he has paid to respect for women’s rights, for the vigilance he has asked us to show because of the fragility of what has been gained."
"A great deal of progress has indeed been made, at least in the constitutional text: political power exercised by constitutional representatives, representation of women, equality between men and women written in black and white, respect for linguistic diversity considered as an asset and not as a threat and, finally, respect for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Even if an Islamic state is declared, I believe it would be remarkable for that part of the world."
"This challenge is, however, a shared one, faced by both the international community and the European Union."
"We must respect our own commitments to ensure this democratic transition and it is essential that we are clearly present in order to support all the processes to put in place the necessary structures for civil and economic reform in Afghanistan."
"In fact, the climate of insecurity must not destabilise the efforts made, and hence the unquestionable need for a multiannual framework programme which would allow both the structuring of the judicial system and the establishment of specific reconciliation regulations as well as an education system."
"It also seems to me to be essential that the whole process of pacification should go hand-in-hand with the process of economic and social reconstruction."
"Having said that, we are wary of the slow pace of this reconstruction, since it could jeopardise the stability necessary for the development of the country."
"We have made many commitments, we must fulfil them quickly and, above all, understand that the least delay on our part risks being exploited by others to establish their hold on fragile structures, with the help of funds originating from drug trafficking."
"We must also work on making the progress made in favour of the population visible so that the people do not sink into despair after 25 years of war."
"If we fail to meet this challenge, we could lose not only our credibility, but also an area of peace on which stability in the region depends."
"Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very fine report, which I know we will all support."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner and his team for their fine work in the field."
"I remind colleagues that in October 2001 the oppression of Afghan women was highlighted globally."
"The assumption was made that the removal of the Taliban regime would ease the women's plight."
"Today, two and a half years on, Amnesty claims that the international community and the Afghan administration have been unable to protect the rights of women."
"Rape and sexual violence by members of the occupying armed forces are still widespread."
"In the western province of Herat, Taliban-like decrees are still widespread and, as a result of this oppression, more women in Afghanistan are committing suicide now than they were under the Taliban regime."
"Human Rights Watch reports many sexual assaults against children."
"Despite the rhetoric, the creation of the Women's Ministry, the Karzai Government pursues anti-women policies, and there is no legal protection, while older legal systems still in position prohibit them from getting help."
"Women's resistance to the regime still has to work underground."
"The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan is forbidden to open an office and distribute its magazine."
"People caught reading its literature are still in physical danger."
"Commissioner Patten said that Afghanistan had reached a crossroads."
"I believe, as do Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, that the government has taken a wrong turn and that the position of women is worse than it was before."
"Madam President, the situation today is the result of continual intervention of one form or another by the Americans and their allies over recent years, both to overturn the popular democratic regime in Afghanistan and impose their mercenary Taliban and to directly invade and occupy Afghanistan militarily on the pretext of fighting terrorism."
"Unfortunately, in the proposed motion, all this is passed over in silence."
"Not a word is said about the criminal responsibility of the Americans and, in essence, support is given to the foreign-born Karzai government, the credentials of which, as we know, are non-existent."
"The report accepts these interventions and tries to propose solutions without disputing the present situation."
"It considers the transfer of the responsibility of the occupying forces to NATO to be positive and proposes new funding which will strengthen its position in the controlled areas, while there is no guarantee whatsoever for the management of these funds for the benefit of the Afghan people, especially women."
"It welcomes the new constitution approved by the Loya Jirga, while at the same time highlighting its negative aspects, which make it unacceptable."
"It nurtures futile hopes of democratic elections, while recognising that the conditions for them are not in place."
"At the same time, while finding that today the main source of income is from the cultivation of opium, the primary revenue from which goes to local warlords, it does not concern itself at all with its further movements in the world and the involvement of the CIA in it."
"That is why, although we congratulate and thank the rapporteur, André Brie, on the huge effort he has made, we unfortunately cannot support his report, because it is clear from the foregoing that the report does not face the facts."
"The Afghan people, victims of the new order, will be able to find their way if they resist the forces propelling it, either in the form of religious fanaticism or under the cloak of a poor copy of a western-type bourgeois democracy, the military interventions and the occupation."
"We must support them in this fight."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly and most importantly, my thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report, which gives a good overview of the many problems Afghanistan is still having to face."
"Allow me to examine the Commissioner’s communication in greater depth, however."
"Commissioner, you have overwhelmed us a little with figures, and I admit that they are impressive."
"However, I am wondering about the following."
"We have here a country which is in need of reconstruction, which must first and foremost reconstruct itself, and an economic basis is a prerequisite for this."
"As you emphasise, the fight against opium cultivation is a very important aspect, but, in all the various measures forming part of the strategy to combat that opium cultivation, I have not actually heard what alternatives the producers have."
"I have seen documentaries showing how the military descend upon farming communities and destroy everything for the sake of opium cultivation."
"I do understand the necessity of this, but how do we mean for it to stop if people do not have an alternative income?"
"The same goes for the warlords."
"How are they ever to stop being warlords if they are constantly being supplied with money from the opium economy?"
"Finally, I had actually wanted to speak about women, but I cannot because my time is up."
"I should like to give one example, however: the construction of a women’s centre in Kabul on which work had only taken a few months."
"It was built, it was inundated with women looking for education and health care, it was a place where they could take off their burkas in peace."
"It is possible; why is it, then, that we are so slow to produce results with international resources?"
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Brie on his excellent report."
"I would now like to address Commissioner Patten: there are two issues that I would like him to raise."
"In November 2003, Mr Karzai's Government allowed the enforcement of a 1970 law banning married women from the classroom which, according to the Deputy Education Minister, led to the expulsion of about two to three thousand women."
"Could you raise the issue of this law enforcement?"
"Article 3 of the Afghan Constitution states that: 'No law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam.'"
"This language – designed to secure a relatively smooth approval of the new Afghan Constitution – may entail high costs for women in the future."
"The control of education by religious authorities is definitely a very alarming signal and an issue that should be raised."
"Many reports confirm that in several regions of Afghanistan there is no security for women, and education for girls is under threat."
"16 attacks have been documented on girls' schools since September 2002, ranging from rocket attacks to setting schools on fire or their forced closure by gunmen."
"Their effect is devastating."
"According to the UN Development Programme, the gross enrolment ratio at primary level has been most recently calculated as being 39% for boys, with a corresponding rate for girls of just 3%."
"The UNICEF programme 'Back to School', launched in March 2002, gave rise to great expectations."
"More than three million children – one-third of them girls – flooded the classrooms in Afghanistan."
"However, in Kandahar, leaflets were distributed with the message 'Stop sending your women to offices and daughters to school."
"It spreads indecency and vulgarity."
"Stand ready for the consequences if you do not heed the advice.'"
"Then, after five months, these violent attacks on girls' schools began."
"We know the immense challenges that confront the Afghan Transitional Authority today."
"The European Union and the international community should strongly support economic, social and political reconstruction."
"However, it is imperative that security for women throughout the country is a priority for both donors and the Afghan Government."
"If we fail in that, the future will be very grim."
"Madam President, sadly Afghanistan has been slightly forgotten about in the aftermath of the Iraq war."
"A lot of resources will be needed to rebuild the country, and the EU is a large donor; in my view this entitles us to lay down significant political conditions, including demanding progress in human rights, particularly women's rights to education and access to the workforce."
"I also regret the new Constitution, which gives primacy to Sharia law over international, UN, civil, and political treaty obligations: this may cause conflict over areas such as female lapidation."
"I am concerned at the lack of security and the necessary concentration of ISA forces in Kabul to protect the government."
"There have been significant regroupings of Taliban and al-Qa'ida forces bent on murdering international aid workers in the provinces, which will set back progress."
"I do not believe President Musharraf is doing enough to rein in terrorist groups in Pakistan's tribal areas and north-west frontier provinces; this is ostensibly because Islamabad's writ does not run to these parts."
"More must be done if he is to have credibility in the fight against international terrorism."
"I was delighted that the Bactrian gold treasures were recovered and I would like to see funds devoted to the reconstitution of the National Museum in Kabul as a symbol of national pride under the patronage of the royal family, which is a benign uniting force in the land."
"Lastly, on the subject of the opium crop, my amendment has suggested consideration being given to buying and burning or using it for medical purposes as a painkiller, as a cheaper alternative to drug enforcement measures by the international organisations dedicated to fighting the drug trade and business."
"It would save the international community a lot of money to burn it and pay the farmers, instead of spending many billions of dollars fighting the drug trafficking trade."
"Madam President, the situation in Afghanistan is of great interest to this House."
"This important report, in the context of the development of democracy in Afghanistan, is highly topical."
"As the report emphasises, the situation since the end of the Taliban regime has improved, but additional efforts need to be made."
"For example, as many have said this morning, the situation of women must be highlighted."
"Literacy is still unbelievably low, with only a 10% to 15% literacy rate among women."
"Only one-third of school children are girls."
"They are often held back from returning to school."
"And even if some of these women go to school they face violence just for attending."
"These trends are strongest outside Kabul, in the south and east of the country, where the situation of women is not so well known but is much worse than in the political centre."
"The Constitution, drawn up in January, specifically recognises the equality between men and women."
"25% of the seats in the House of the People are reserved for women, yet it remains uncertain that this provision, along with others establishing rights for women, will help to implement women's rights properly or help women get elected in the coming election."
"Many Members have talked about the issue of drugs."
"We live in a world where a poppy grown in Afghanistan can end up being illegally sold as heroin in Scotland."
"The human suffering caused by the drugs problem and its links to crime in our communities concerns us all."
"That is why we should support the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which sets the target of complete elimination of poppy growing by 2013."
"I am pleased that the UK Government plans to deploy an enhanced drugs team to Kabul and Kandahar by the end of the year and has made GBP 70 million available, over three years, for law enforcement, capacity-building, alternative livelihoods for those who are involved in poppy cultivation, and demand-reduction initiatives."
"We must ensure that capacity for effective public administration continues to improve at central and provincial levels."
"Madam President, the ISAF troops and many other aid organisations are doing a lot of good in Afghanistan."
"Their work is, however, being sabotaged by the presence of the American forces."
"Last year, I had the opportunity, together with an EU delegation, to visit the US headquarters in Baghram."
"It was clear that the Americans have no plans whatsoever regarding women’s rights, democracy or the fight against drugs."
"By their own admission, what interests them is that each government in Afghanistan should acknowledge the US troops’ right to return, if they ever leave the country."
"That is quite revealing in terms of what is at issue here."
"When we were in Baghram, there was something we did not get to see and about which an American journalist told us, namely the prison in Baghram, in comparison with which reports from Guantánamo Bay seem like accounts of a Sunday school picnic."
"She had learned that, at that time in any case, there were several hundred prisoners in the jail at Baghram, exposed to torture."
"They were not being hit, but they were forced to stand naked for hours, day in and day out, under constant questioning."
"Finally, two prisoners died, and the journalist got an honest American doctor to state clearly in the death certificate that the cause of death was murder."
"It nonetheless took several months before the New York Times dared to publish the relevant article."
"That is how sensitive it is to acknowledge that in Afghanistan, just as in many other places, the American soldiers are gangsters who use every means available to defend American interests but who are completely indifferent to the local population."
"Let us remove the Americans and replace them with reasonable people from the ISAF and aid organisations."
"There are so many others who can make constructive efforts."
"The Americans are merely making a bad situation worse."
"– Madam President, the report on Afghanistan is to be welcomed in so far as it demonstrates that land of the Hindu Kush, having become a focus of international attention in the aftermath of 11 September 2001, will not again be forgotten, and that the European Union is maintaining its financial and political commitment in order to help achieve stability."
"The essential picture painted by the report is a very pessimistic one, which, in my view, takes too little account of the positive elements, one of which was, without a doubt, the Loya Jirga’s adoption of the constitution last December."
"The constitution is primarily intended to strengthen central government, without which this country, divided between ethnic groups and torn asunder by decades of warfare and Soviet occupation, has scarcely any chance of building itself into a nation or of normal development."
"The next thing needed is democratic elections, which will, in this country, be a difficult process."
"Even though the preparatory work has got underway too late, the elections should be held as soon as possible, on the presupposition that they will reinforce the stabilisation process."
"I am aware that the Americans are insisting on the elections being held in June, but, if the situation is to be kept calm, and the conditions for a more or less democratic election created, it is not absolutely necessary to stick to this date."
"We said in August that it would be no disaster if they were to be held rather later."
"All the other measures intended to help pacify the country can be compared with the proverbial glass of water, which is either half full or half empty."
"The security situation is as dire as it was before."
"The militant Taliban have apparently re-established themselves in the south-east, and the Americans are not excluding the possibility of using land troops in a spring offensive."
"Although the extension of the ISAF’s operations to the areas outside Kabul is to be welcomed, its mandate is so limited that German troops stationed in Kundus – the safest area, incidentally – are in fact simply onlookers while opium smuggling continues to be one of the country’s main sources of revenue, which, in its turn, has made Afghanistan the world’s largest producer of opium."
"The opium trade is in full swing, still helping to maintain the warlords and their armies, and that is one of the main problems."
"Mr President, first, may I apologise to the House for missing much of this debate, but unfortunately I had to be present at the STOA Panel to vote to try and prevent the suppression of a scientific report at the behest of Europe's chocolate multinationals on inedibles in food."
"Doubly unfortunately, the vote was lost by 11 votes to 8."
"On Afghanistan, firstly I congratulate Mr Brie on his report on a difficult subject in a difficult country."
"I was privileged to be part of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to Afghanistan in June 2003."
"It was clear that security is the paramount issue."
"Unfortunately, the glass increasingly seems to be half-empty, rather than half-full."
"The occupying coalition troops and the United States sit out their days in their fixed and mobile fortresses, when on the streets they exhibit the same heavy-handed style currently displayed in Iraq."
"ISAF has a footprint centred on Kabul, limiting its operations to 2% of Afghanistan's land area."
"The rest of the country is effectively abandoned to feuding warlords who monopolise revenues and dispense arbitrary justice in their private prisons, making President Karzai at times little more than the United States-backed mayor of Kabul."
"After the marines killed three Afghan national army soldiers in a friendly-fire exchange, ISAF stepped in to broker peace between the two groups, ostensibly on the same side."
"Yet for many in the Afghan national army, the ISAF and the United States troops are merely all flowers from the same garden."
"Campaigns without resources to spread ISAF's presence outside Kabul are wishful and wistful thinking."
"No-one seems able or willing to find the money to increase the number of troops – some 40 000 would be needed for nationwide coverage."
"In the south the main targets for the remnants of the Taliban are foreigners, but without reconstruction work, the temptation for the local population is to see the situation as no better, if not worse, than under the Taliban."
"Many people argue that large sections of the Taliban could be brought back into civic society, but to do that would be to shift the social centre of gravity back towards an Islamic conservatism that bodes ill for women's emancipation."
"Human rights is important, particularly the situation of women."
"Formal rights may well be given but they are unlikely to play out in the villages."
"The best hope for the future may be universal education, which will not change current attitudes but rather those of the next generation."
"The United States and the EU are pushing bottom lines that in practice are probably undeliverable."
"As the United Nations Special Representative said, if you are trying to introduce western-style democracy in Afghanistan, you are wasting your time."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Brie for a very well written and important description of the position in Afghanistan and of what we should do to improve it."
"I have four points I wish to make to Parliament and to Commissioner Patten."
"The first concerns drugs."
"While the international community works to prevent drug abuse, Afghanistan’s illegal opium production discourages individual governments in the surrounding area from contributing financially to the reconstruction of the country."
"According to an investigation by the UN body for drugs control and crime prevention, Afghanistan was responsible in 2003 for three quarters or 75% of the world’s total production of illegal opium."
"That is, to say the least, deeply worrying."
"The second point concerns the position of women."
"The antidemocratic and Islamicist Taliban regime was guilty during its time in power of the most deliberate violation of women’s rights in modern times."
"The regime introduced a gender apartheid that totally denied women’s identity."
"The Taliban regime is now gone but, in very many respects, its view of women still prevails in Afghanistan."
"The country’s authorities, the international community and the EU must therefore make every possible effort to change this view."
"The third point concerns freedom of religion."
"Afghanistan’s first constitution following the fall of the Taliban dictatorship is cause for concern, given certain wordings about the dominant role of Islamic law, about restrictions upon certain human rights and individual freedoms and about restrictions upon women’s rights."
"The last point concerns the education system."
"We in the European Parliament want to see an open education system as an alternative to the madrasas or the Koran schools that operate as strongholds of Muslim extremism and of a culture of hatred in which Taliban militants are recruited."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Brie on an excellent report."
"I also had the honour of being on the delegation to Afghanistan."
"I know that some people have congratulated me on being a first in a number of things."
"Another first that I now count is the fact that I was sitting having tea with some of the biggest drug dealers and drug producers in the world."
"I am particularly addressing my remarks to the honourable Member who, I know, is going to disappear into the sunset before too long, but maybe he can make a great contribution to European safety if in his few months remaining he takes on board some of the issues I was talking about."
"The total value of the poppy crop at the farm gate in Afghanistan is estimated at EUR 700 million."
"Its heroin street value is estimated at EUR 12.5 billion."
"The amount of revenue spent by Member State police forces, customs services and anti-drug squads to control heroin imports and use alone adds up to EUR 4 billion per year."
"The number of arrests for drug offences throughout the EU is around 700 000 people per year."
"60 000 people are imprisoned every year for drug offences, leading to annual custodial costs of EUR 1.5 billion."
"We need an alternative development approach for Afghanistan which integrates EU drug policy into its development policy."
"We have to offer the rural population economically viable and steady means of earning an income."
"Therefore is it not far better to stop this trade at the point of growing, rather than the point of consumption or distribution?"
"If we do this, we will save EUR 4 billion in policing costs alone, and EUR 1.5 billion in custodial costs."
"I propose to the honourable Member that we manage this transition, from poppy growing to fruit growing, as we now do for Greek tobacco, which we buy and burn."
"A similar exercise could be done for the poppy crop in Afghanistan, and I would like the honourable Member to take this on board seriously."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Commission Statement on reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners."
". Mr President, I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity to express to Parliament why this communication is so important."
"We have designed a coherent strategy maximising the use of all our instruments to promote respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights in a region that poses formidable challenges in this respect."
"The communication proposes to use our essential elements clause much better through our political dialogue with partner countries."
"It explains how further to involve civil society."
"Crucially, it invites our Mediterranean partners to develop nationally owned human rights strategies."
"This is an innovation. It is not the only one."
"Countries which progress well will be rewarded with additional MEDA funds."
"This is in addition to the MEDA projects already under way to help reform the judiciary and promote good governance – currently funded to the tune of EUR 100 million."
"It is easy simply to dismiss the chance of success of these projects."
"Yet, as we all know, the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law rests with governments."
"Any strategy that ignores this fact is doomed to failure."
"That is also why the Sana’a conference – which I know the honourable Member attended – was such a breakthrough, and one on which we must build."
"I am pleased that the Director-General of my own department, Mr Landaburu, was also able to attend that extremely important and significant conference."
"No real progress will be achieved without a freely functioning, vibrant civil society."
"This is where the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights comes into play."
"EUR 25 million have been allocated to this region for the period 2002-2004."
"In addition, a substantial proportion of the extra EUR 17.5 million, which this House voted to the European Initiative at the end of last year, will be used to reinforce support to grass roots organisations working to defend human rights and democratisation in this part of the world."
"The communication has already produced encouraging results, in Morocco and Jordan in particular."
"It was warmly welcomed by the Council."
"Key partners in civil society have also recognised its value."
"The full support of the European Parliament will be crucial to the success of this, which is, I repeat, a ground-breaking approach, in one of the most difficult regions of the world with respect to human rights and democracy."
"Parliament's resolution also takes up aspects of the management of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and Parliament’s role in the shaping of the initiative."
"In this context, I would like to recall that we have come a very long way since 1994."
"That was the budget year in which, for the first time, nine separate budget lines were linked up under one heading."
"Five years later in 1999, implementation of these budget lines was put on a firm legal basis with two regulations, one for developing countries and one for ‘other countries’ – Wider Europe, MEDA, the Balkans and others. These basic facts define the objectives of the European Initiative, shape its instruments, and set up the administrative procedures."
"The European Parliament was fully involved in the making of these regulations."
"I trust that Parliament will support the extension of the Initiative beyond 2004, in line with its current legislative framework."
"The Commission has always kept Parliament fully informed of our thinking."
"Our communication of May 2001 on the European Union’s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, which proposed a more strategic approach for the Initiative, was welcomed and fully supported by the European Parliament."
"In the same vein, since 2002, the Commission has kept Parliament informed about the multi-annual programming of the Initiative, and its annual updates, and sought appropriate discussion with Parliament on our priorities."
"Members are fully aware of the procedural constraints under which the Commission operates, which are contained in the human rights regulations, the financial regulation, comitology and so on. It is not in the Commission’s power to change these rules."
"But I am fully committed, and my services are ready, to continue the fruitful dialogue we have had so far on all issues concerning human rights and democratisation, including the strategy and objectives of our assistance to third countries."
"On this basis, I would call on Parliament to give full support to a speedy extension of the regulations before this Parliament is dissolved in order to have a stable framework in place for the next Parliament and Commission to build upon."
"I would just make two additional comments."
"The work we are doing in the field of democratisation and human rights in the wider Middle East is crucial not only to the sustainable economic and political development of countries in that region, but also to the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world, particularly those parts of the Islamic world which are closer to our own geographical borders."
"This is an area in which we have been working in general terms for some time."
"I recently read the statements by a very distinguished American public official about what was required in order to develop a more stable, secure and plural region in the Middle East."
"I read those comments with interest and wished I had been able to say immediately to him that they are very good ideas – we call them the Barcelona Process and we have been working on them since the mid-1990s."
"We have to recognise that this is not simply a bright idea for a Monday morning to be forgotten by the end of the week."
"This is a long-term process and we have to commit ourselves to it, I hope with more vigour and occasional tough-mindedness."
"We have to recognise that there must be linkages between financial support and behaviour on the ground."
"We also have to recognise that we are working with the grain of societies and with the grain of people's aspirations."
"My second point is quite simply that a number of honourable Members in this Chamber speak with very considerable authority on this subject."
"I am thinking of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, of the honourable Member who was once speaking from this bench and also of my honourable friend who will, I hope, catch your eye later in the debate, Mr President."
"They have played a key role in developing the European Union's policies on democracy and human rights."
"It stands to reason that we should listen very carefully to their views on the institutional arrangements that we need to put in place and on how we can sharpen up our performance and ensure that what we do is better focused and more effective throughout the region."
"I just want to underline that, as far as I am concerned, speaking for the Commission, we are open-minded about the ideas that Members of Parliament will put to us and simply want to ensure that what we do is as effective as possible."
"Two admirable reports by the UNDP have underlined the significance of this work and I, for one, want to ensure that we in Europe rise to the challenge of those reports and do not simply regard them as containing a few good ideas that can be brought out and dusted down from time to time."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes the Commission’s statement."
"I believe that it is an important step, and can also provide an integrated approach to various policies."
"As the Commissioner has said, this is about the integration of the Barcelona process with the ‘Wider Europe’ strategy and the issues related to the funding of MEDA and other programmes."
"These, I believe, must also include human rights and democracy, for lasting peace can come into being only if the state, civil society, the political forces and parties guarantee, in the long term, deep roots for democracy and the rule of law, which always provides the greatest certainty of peaceful development."
"This is of enormous significance for us, not only because of human rights, which should be guaranteed by other means, but also because stabilising regions like this on the basis of democracy and the rule of law is the best security policy we can pursue in our own interests; we should indeed ensure that stability prevails there in such a way that people have a future and do not fall prey to fundamentalism, as they would otherwise be justified in doing."
"This is what underlies many political problems in countries in the Middle East, making it more difficult to lead them towards a better future."
"It is specifically in matters such as these, Commissioner, that I see it as important that non-governmental organisations should be brought on board, but please allow me to comment on what you have just said in your conclusion."
"It strikes me as important that – as was previously the case in Central and Eastern Europe – such democracy programmes should increasingly draw on the experience of the European Parliament and of its MEPs, not only by consulting them, but also by involving them in the decision-making process."
"Whilst I am not defending a breach of the separation of powers, the fact is that we, with our own experience gained from the daily business of building up democracy, parties andgrassroots democracy, have more knowledge than is to be found in an administrative body, in which people are trained to look at things from a completely different angle, and I do not believe that this is about simply coming up with theoretical concepts that cost a lot of money but produce no results."
"It is far more about setting up effective structures on the ground."
"Perhaps we should revert to this former practice; it would be an interesting area in which to experiment and see what progress this enables us to make."
"May I make a final comment?"
"In the past, I believe, both the Commission and Parliament paid insufficient attention to whether or not our resolutions on human rights and democracy were actually implemented."
"In this respect, monitoring and implementation were our weak points."
"We came up with some tremendous resolutions, and then that was that."
"The possibility of checking whether or not anything is done about them seems to me to be acquiring ever-greater importance; it, too, is tied in with the integrative process of which I spoke at the beginning."
"I believe that many agreements should be linked to the establishment of human rights, and that much funding should be linked to the development of democracy, in order thereby to establish checks and balances that make possible the practical application of democracy and human rights, on which stability depends, and saves them from being merely fine-sounding words."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, it is important that the issue of human rights and democracy is once again brought to the centre of the debate on relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries."
"Almost ten years on from the Barcelona process we note that there is still a serious lack of democracy in these countries, which has also been pointed out in numerous United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports."
"Indeed, we must ask ourselves if the policy that we have implemented to date and, above all, the instruments put forward in this area, were adequate given the ambitious objectives of the Barcelona strategy."
"Article 2 of the clause of the bilateral association agreements has turned out to be broadly insufficient."
"I am, however, asking a more complex question: are bilateral agreements adequate instruments for promoting the development of human rights?"
"I believe that these agreements have helped to give international recognition to regimes that would otherwise have had no legitimacy."
"We need to be very careful about this, and I believe that the Commission communication poses this question."
"I support the ten points; the Initiative for Democracy that the European Parliament wants is an interesting instrument because it is one of the few instruments which allows measures to be carried out independent of governments."
"Indeed, all the others fall within the intergovernmental sphere, even if you are right, Commissioner, when you state that we need to remember that part of this dialogue must also involve the ruling classes."
"Nevertheless, I would like this instrument to be more consistent with the rest of our policies, otherwise there is a risk that it will be a way to legitimise the other policies, which are essentially ."
"This incentive is, therefore, excellent, it is good for countries prepared to go down this road and it is just as excellent regarding the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which could have interesting potential."
"It is extremely important for the Sana’a Conference, which has brought the issue to the attention of governments and civil society."
"I ask myself, however, if there should not be a permanent and unequivocal push for democracy from the European institutions, which is also based on new instruments."
"For example, Commissioner, why not try, with these countries, to have a multilateral convention on human rights, which is also based on institutions that are able to guarantee these rights?"
"Compared to the current situation, this would give rise to a different dynamic."
"Finally, I tabled an amendment to Article 11, because I think that farming out this policy to an external agency somewhat contradicts the debate that we have had up until now, since it should be the European institutions that have the power to implement this policy."
"Therefore, as regards financial procedures, should the Commission not have instruments that are adapted to implementing these objectives?"
"Mr President, democracy and human rights in Mediterranean countries are still in a wretched state, the main cause being that the authorities never relinquish power and do not even want to share it."
"Autocratic regimes can only maintain their hold on power by means of repression and by restricting freedom."
"The worst hit are the people who are badly governed and lag behind economically and socially."
"This forms a breeding ground for radicalism on the part of disaffected people that impacts on not only the region itself, but also the rest of the world."
"The European Union must do everything in its power to exert a positive influence on the situation, therefore."
"The partnerships provide a good framework for this; one, however, of which we have up to now made insufficient, and insufficiently binding, use."
"Financial aid alone, without political conditions, will only lead to a deterioration in the situation, and for that reason I welcome this spur to the reinvigoration of policy wholeheartedly."
"The Commission communication, with its ten priorities, is truly excellent."
"Many of the proposed actions are in line with the specific suggestions I made in my report on human rights last year."
"The intentions and approach are good, but, of course, results are by no means guaranteed."
"We are ultimately aiming to induce the regimes to make fundamental changes in their behaviour that they would not have been inclined to make of their own accord."
"The new actions must not lead to bureaucratisation, but rather to specific objectives that are tested systematically."
"It is very important to give the situation a positive boost."
"Can the Commissioner tell us how our partners have reacted up to now, apart from Morocco and Jordan, which he has already mentioned?"
"Can he also explain how the EU’s approach relates to the policy of the United States with regard to the region?"
"To what extent is there transatlantic coordination?"
"The proposed spur to action comes not a moment too soon."
"Further deterioration in the region could have far-reaching consequences."
"Many regimes say that security is more important than democracy."
"This contradiction could hardly be more mistaken."
"It is precisely a lack of democracy that makes the situation hopeless and dangerous."
"Anyone striving for security and prosperity must first safeguard democracy and human rights."
"I should like to hear answers from the Commissioner to my questions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, what is making things so very complicated, I believe, is the fact that we can never be sure of anything."
"I heard you welcome the efforts of the Moroccan authorities."
"For my part, I have just read the very recent report of the IFRM which was presented yesterday and which demonstrates the extent to which 11 September has had devastating effects in these countries, taking the form of many arbitrary imprisonments all over the place, which clearly represent a genuine violation of respect for human rights."
"So while we welcome the very interesting and noteworthy progress made in relation to the family code, certain extremely worrying elements nevertheless remain."
"I say this to demonstrate that the very considerable efforts agreed by the Commission and by this Parliament – which you stress yourselves – to reinforce all the mechanisms for action and assessment concerning respect for human rights are determined not only by the international context, but also by the relations that the EU’s Member States individually maintain with these different countries."
"How many programmes will we need in order to cancel out the disastrous effect of President Chirac’s visit to Tunisia, where he stated that there were no human rights problems, and, in the middle of a hunger strike by an eminent lawyer, that the main right is the right to eat?"
"How many programmes will we need in order to remedy that?"
"We are well aware that, in the evaluation of the association agreements, the constraints of the on the part of the States are terrifying."
"We truly need to consolidate the Community efforts resulting from the support of the associations, of the NGOs, of civil society and, as we know, of the Members of this Parliament and the Commission."
"So there are actors who can perhaps overcome that handicap."
"But I would like to ask you directly, Commissioner, about any responsibility you may have in this regard."
"In Tunisia, how can we explain that, while the Ben Ali government is in the process of holding back the funds allocated to the Tunisian Human Rights League, the Commission is initiating a clearly nonsensical programme aimed at providing support for media that do not exist, which are shackled, entirely in the hands of Ben Ali?"
"Everybody knows that Ben Ali is going to use this not inconsiderable sum to fund his presidential propaganda."
"Do you realise that or do you not?"
"How is such a thing possible?"
"That is something I really wonder about, as it is precisely on us that such a decision depends."
"Mr President, the European Union does indeed have every interest in creating an area of stability, security and democracy on the other side of the Mediterranean, and therefore any efforts it devotes towards this are by no means wasted."
"Much remains to be done, however."
"The situation in that region remains volatile."
"Indeed, aid must not be misused for further tolerating conditions or for keeping regimes in power that have been violating human rights for years."
"We, the European Union, must not perpetuate any taboos."
"Major obstacles to the achievement of our objectives include the further rise of Islam on the one hand, and the continuing immigration problem on the other."
"We must make it clear that further waves of immigration are in the interests of neither Maghreb countries nor Europe."
"Those countries certainly do not stand to gain from the brain drain or other such phenomena."
"Besides, further immigration hinders the integration of the immigrants already present in Europe."
"We must continue to make an issue of this."
"It is a matter of continuing our efforts to bring about greater democracy and stability in these countries, both in their interests and in ours, including in the context of the policy of good neighbourly relations that is now in the pipeline."
"Mr President, I have taken our Vice-President, Mr Dimitrakopoulos' chair, just to remind ourselves that democracy in the Mediterranean did not begin with this debate."
"I thank the Commissioner, whose work as Governor of Hong Kong ensured the continuation of the democratic life of that territory, which I hope will spark changes in the wider China."
"It is my pleasure to be rapporteur on the communication 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners'."
"We welcome the communication and its ten points for action."
"We note that it was published in 2003."
"Since that time, the MEDA process has taken on a new lease of life, with the agreements in December to establish the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum."
"In December also, the Council, while failing to agree on the European Constitution, did at least agree that the paper presented by the Commissioner and by the High Representative entitled 'Strengthening the EU's relations with the Arab world' would be adopted in March."
"We welcome that."
"I am also rapporteur on the two regulations dealing with the continuation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2005 and 2006."
"While endorsing the communication on 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners', we are also examining these two regulations."
"Parliament will vote today on whether to have a say in the priorities and running of this programme, the European democracy initiative, because the resolution put forward by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy today points out that this fund, which uniquely requires no host country consent, should be more focused, especially on what I describe as the 'arc of instability' from Russia to Morocco, where democracy is fragile, or on the Arab world, where it is non-existent."
"The Commissioner's references to the UNDP report underline the importance attached to it by the Commission, but unfortunately the Commission needs to put its money where its mouth is."
"We need to examine very closely the way in which the European Union is funding programmes in this region."
"For example, he mentioned a figure of EUR 100 million for good governance in the MEDA region."
"In fact, in the wider Mediterranean, my understanding is that EUR 500 million a year is available for good governance."
"But of this, only EUR 7 million is currently budgeted through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Reference has been made in this House this morning to forthcoming elections in Algeria and Tunisia, where very little money is getting through to the NGOs and activists who are looking for a free media and the development of human rights."
"Unfortunately – I have had some experience as the originator of this democracy programme – it is now rather bureaucratic and errs on the side of safety."
"The only way of dealing with this is to try and adapt it to the realities of the present situation."
"An unstable world to our east and south demands special actions."
"Having had experience of working in this field in the 1990s with the ex-Soviet Union, through an external agency which had an agility and freedom to manoeuvre not enjoyed by the Commission and the deniability not available to the Council, I can say that, with the advantage of Parliament's involvement, we have a much more effective programme."
"I welcome the Commissioner's assertion that he will be open-minded about further suggestions we might make as a Parliament."
"I intend to bring these forward, especially since I understand this morning that the Council has decided to withdraw the regulations as presented and to present them in a new format, thereby delaying yet further the adoption of the regulations."
"This debate will continue."
"Mr President, we are in favour of and support the Commission's communication on reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation in the southern and eastern Mediterranean."
"We are convinced that the enormous challenge of developing these neighbouring regions can only be possible, in terms of European responsibilities, if we combine responsibility and management. In other words, through the sound implementation of association agreements with strong political and cultural impetus, in a context in which the norm is increasingly represented by voices and images of poverty, fanaticism and terrorism rather than by the aims of genuinely moving towards freedom, social cohesion and peace."
"We therefore support this initiative and we advocate that in terms of the European Union’s general policy, as far as human rights are concerned, we should not resort to closing our eyes, on the one hand, for the sake of a false , nor, on the other hand, be content with mere condemnations or protests."
"We must be ‘consequentialist’ in our policies towards the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean. In other words, our priority must always be to consider the consequences of our policies in this regard."
"As the Commissioner has said quite rightly, there is a strategy which will soon be ten years old – that of the Barcelona process – and all we have to do is remember that, since Barcelona is an Olympic city, the entrance to the Commission's offices should display the motto '' for the development of our Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"– Mr President, what is termed the Barcelona process certainly has all the sympathy of men and women of good will."
"The capital of the Catalan nation was indeed worthy of being the place where a policy aimed at building bridges across the Mediterranean was launched."
"I must mention here in passing the memory of two illustrious Catalans who anticipated this policy each in their own way in the Middle Ages: Raymond Lull and Anselme Turmeda."
"I welcome the intelligent and understanding effort implemented by this policy, and in particular in the documents which are the subject of our debate."
"Nevertheless, given the general situation, I wonder about this policy’s chances."
"In order to fly the flag for democracy and human rights, we must be exemplary."
"We are far from it."
"As recently as yesterday, lawyers in this lovely city of Strasbourg publicly placed a funeral wreath in front of the prefecture mourning the death of the presumption of innocence as a result of a law which has just been voted on in France."
"A year ago, a Spanish judge ordered the closure of , the only daily newspaper in the Basque language, and imprisoned several journalists – some are still in prison."
"To this day, one year later, no contradictory debate has been organised to justify this blatant violation of press freedom."
"The criminal war waged by the United States against Iraq was subject to the active or passive complicity of the majority of Member States of the enlarged Union."
"This horrific wound is still bleeding, and it will do so for a long time."
"For many Muslims in the world it is an additional humiliation."
"This list is unfortunately far from exhaustive."
"If we are not careful, the obsession with security and the hijacking of the war against terror for partisan ends will undermine this policy, and many others, despite all the intelligence and good will of those who will try to implement it."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I think that if we want to implement a policy in this area, it is important to know what is happening in the Mediterranean and in the Arab world."
"The signals we are receiving are weak, perhaps superficial, perhaps devised with the ulterior motive of doing nothing at all, but what is not in doubt is that, in the last two years, signals have been sent, which we would do well to pick up on and pursue.I say this because I have the impression that there is very little awareness of this in our Member States."
"Mrs Flautre who spoke before me has, for example, already highlighted the Tunisian issue, with a series of extremely conflicting positions, and perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was two representatives from Tunisian civil society that were prevented from taking part in the afore-mentioned Sana’a Conference: this is the only thing that I was able to notice in the organisation of this conference."
"From this point of view, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must stop being excessively prudent because our actions must have credibility."
"We lose credibility, for example, when we do not enforce the clauses of Article 2: we are not credible in the eyes of governments – who, in fact, consider us to be relatively malleable partners – nor are we in the eyes of non-governmental actors, whose trust we are losing."
"I say this because, for example, we are drawing closer to the meeting for the ratification of the Lebanon Agreement and I believe, Commissioner, that it is important to note, in this House, the lack of progress on the independence of Lebanon’s judiciary and the fact that relations with the European Union should be subject to this requirement being met."
"Aside from individual references to specific positions, I believe that action by the European Commission or Europe in general is important: there is much demand for Europe – perhaps in comparison with the alternative – and great things are expected of it."
"The importance of Sana’a has been stressed here."
"Why is it important, Commissioner?"
"Well, it is important because of the format of the Conference: governments and non-governmental actors have for the first time found themselves on an equal footing in discussing and wrangling, but also in creating a final statement that, in my opinion, creates the requirements for a consultation process, which perhaps our US friends are less prone to emphasise and less inclined towards."
"I believe that it would be an important signal, Commissioner, in the context of our discussion, to ensure that Sana’a is followed up, in such a way that it does not remain just one of many such events but becomes a process that is monitored."
"The involvement of women has also been extraordinary and exceptional vitality came from women’s organisations, which really must be given assistance."
"We therefore have something to work on, Commissioner, that has arisen from the consultation we held with our partners and from the texts they have produced, a course of action that cannot be said to be handed down from above, because it has been requested by the partners themselves."
"I believe that this merits a very solid follow-up."
"Mr President, I can sympathise a little with Commissioner Patten who has to listen to one speech after another without being able to make comments after any of the speakers."
"Perhaps this type of debate or, rather, series of monologues that we have in the European Parliament could be a touch more lively."
"As one of the last speakers, I hope that the Commissioner will nonetheless manage to listen to one more speaker."
"I wish, in fact, to refer to two things mentioned by the Commissioner for External Relations in his speech."
"The first thing he emphasised was that we must improve relations between Europe and the Islamic world."
"We must develop more stable, more secure and more pluralistic countries in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean."
"The second thing the Commissioner said concerned the links between our financial support and behaviour at what he called grass roots level, that is to say how matters appear out in the cities, towns and villages when it comes to observing human rights."
"I want to talk about a subject that is almost taboo from a political point of view."
"It concerns the interplay between religion and politics."
"As the Commissioner said, our relations with the Islamic world are an extremely sensitive area, both internally in the European Union and in our various Member States."
"I mean that religion and freedom of religion are of fundamental significance for the development of human rights and, ultimately, of democracy."
"Religion must not, of course, take over the political system, but nor can religious life be kept completely separate from the rest of society."
"I believe that the types of solutions that exist in certain countries, for example in Iran where an Islamicist Council of Guardians says who may stand in elections and who may not, is completely unreasonable."
"Nor am I convinced that the French or Turkish solution, in which religious symbols are to be banned in schools, is the right one."
"I wish, therefore, to refer to what Commissioner Patten has said about our relations with the Islamic world and about Mr van den Bos’s report on human rights, adopted by Parliament in July 2003."
"A number of amendments were approved, emphasising every person’s right to seek their own faith, the right to change religion and the right not to belong to any religion."
"The value of being free to conduct missionary work, irrespective of whether the country concerned is predominantly Christian, Muslim or Jewish, was also emphasised."
"The fundamental principles are that of the equal value of human beings, irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity, the principle of non-discrimination and the principle whereby religion stands for non-violence, love and reconciliation."
"The equal value of human beings, irrespective of their religious affiliation, is emphasised."
"I believe that the conversation about the significance of religion for the good society and for combating the misuse of religion itself to issue threats, perpetrate violence and oppression and justify terrorism and discrimination against people is an important and fundamental part of our relations with the Islamic Mediterranean countries."
"Let the dialogue about religion and the good use of religion in the proper sense of the word be an important part of our relations with countries around the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, the importance attached by the European Parliament to respect for and the safeguarding of democracy and human rights everywhere and always is a known fact and is non-negotiable."
"As a general principle, it has become our prime concern to demand the same respect and the same application from all our partners, without wrongful interpretation, differentiation or a selective approach."
"In addition to this, our insistence on control of the application and operation of the principles of democracy, human rights, the rights of national minorities and sexual equality are uniform and undivided for everyone, everywhere."
"The linking of European financial aid with compliance with absolute respect for the above rights is also uniform for everyone, everywhere."
"This truth is repeated and emphasised in the relevant motion by the European Parliament to our Mediterranean partners, in order to avoid misunderstandings or different interpretations."
"Good accounts make good friends."
"Deepening political dialogue on issues of democracy and respect for human rights at all levels certainly helps to consolidate our bilateral relations and transactions and to further deepen them."
"The exchange of information, knowledge and experience by all the partners, as the motion comments, helps to further serve the desired approach on the basis of principles and rules which are common to and respected by everyone."
"The Commission's contacts with civil society and the reports on its findings to all the partners are a simple, straightforward tool for evaluating the present situation, to be praised, or an intervention to be corrected."
"With the recent excellent upgrading of the Mediterranean Forum to Parliamentary Assembly, a huge step has been taken towards democratic dialogue and creative consultation and understanding between the partners on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"This political dialogue will help enormously to resolve possible problems or misunderstandings and to support the procedure of rapprochement and cooperation, which will serve stability and the peaceful development and coexistence of the entire Mediterranean area."
"Let us hope that those developments in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which are still obstructing an unimpeded approach, come to an end as quickly as possible, without walls and divisions, for the good of the entire area and its inhabitants."
"Mr President, it is a fact that the countries of the south-eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East as a whole are an important field of action for the foreign relations of the European Union and the present Commission communication confirms this."
"It is particularly positive that the Commission recognises that the marginalisation of women undermines political representation and obstructs economic and social development in the area."
"It is true that women in Mediterranean and Arab countries, despite a certain improvement in conditions over recent years, continue to be the victims of sexual discrimination and inequality."
"Illiteracy, poverty, domestic violence, inadequate medical and pharmaceutical care, little participation in professional and political life, these are the main features of the life of women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean basin and in the countries of the Middle East."
"Worst of all, however, is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism, ultra-conservatism and autocratic regimes which base their power to a large degree on controlling the sexual conduct of women, their way of life, their reproductive functions and even the way they dress."
"Certainly, the best defence against the powers of retrogression and intolerance is to strengthen the secular aspect of the state and the legal democratic order."
"Our message must be clear."
"No political system, religious movement, tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women, human rights and the rule of law."
"The more these basic elements of a democratic state are missing from numerous countries of the Mediterranean, the more the hopes for economic and social development and an improvement in the position of women will remain dim and the resolutions passed by the conferences held within the framework of the Barcelona process will remain dead letter."
"That is why we are asking the European Commission and the representation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to use all the mechanisms at its disposal in order to include clear clauses and commitments on the recognition and protection of human rights and the rights of women and the principles of the rule of law as for the development of the countries of the Mediterranean and the elevation of the Mediterranean basin to an area of peace and cooperation."
". I do not want to delay the House unduly as it quietly prepares to go about its democratic duty."
"However, I should like to respond to one or two questions from what has been an important and useful debate."
"I was asked how our proposals had been received by our partners."
"The fairest diplomatic answer is that the ideas have been received rather cautiously in some countries but much more positively in others – Jordan and Morocco spring to mind."
"Whatever the response, the ideas that we have put forward are now a central part of the debate, a central part of the dialogue with these countries."
"It is important to remember that what we are talking about is not negative conditionality, but positive encouragement."
"We are talking about setting aside part of our MEDA funds each year and allocating them to those countries which enter into specific partnerships with us to develop democracy and human rights."
"That is an important shift of emphasis and an important way of trying to use our development assistance and cooperation to promote political objectives which we all know are crucial, not only to the stability and wellbeing of societies, but also to their long-term economic development."
"In pressing our views on issues such as human rights in Tunisia – to which the honourable Member rightly referred – we have to be vigorous and avoid being counterproductive."
"A couple of weeks ago in another part of the world – when pressing the case for the rule of law and civil liberty – I was accused of being neo-colonial."
"I had to point out that as far as I was concerned that was a terrible insult: I had been the real thing;"
"I had been a real colonial oppressor and not simply a neo-colonial has-been."
"We have to be careful about how we proceed with the debate."
"It is also important to recognise that it is a long process and that, as Mrs Bonino said, we need to be consistent."
"We need to show that we mean what we say."
"We have to be mindful of our credibility and we have to make sure that this is a debate we conduct on the basis of mutual esteem, on the basis that we are on an equal footing."
"I was also asked how our arguments and ideas tied in with those of the United States on democracy and the wider Middle East."
"It is fair to say that this is a subject about which we have a decade of experience."
"We welcome the United States' interest."
"I am sure there will be a lot of discussions, as there were last weekend at the Munich security conference."
"I hope that we do not lose the distinctiveness of our own approach."
"I hope that we do not lose sight of the fact that this is a long-term process and I hope that, as the honourable Member said late in the debate, that we do not lose sight of the relevance of the Middle East dispute, of the relationship between Israel and Palestine, to the discussion about democracy in the wider region, because at the moment undoubtedly some in the Arab world doubt our credentials and goodwill because they do not think we are doing enough to resolve the problems of Palestine."
"Lastly I would like to repeat again to Mr McMillan-Scott that we go into these debates with an open mind."
"We recognise the experience and the wisdom of Parliament and we are sure that together Parliament, Commission and Council will be able to frame a policy which will not only continue to command the attention of the whole House, but will actually lead to the sort of beneficial consequences that we wish to see."
"Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your contribution and your efforts in a climate which has not always been very easy."
"I have received motion for a resolution B5-0049/2004, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, Thursday."
"Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 9a and Annex XI of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to ask the President if he would refer the events of this morning's STOA management committee to the Anti-Fraud Office for investigation."
"The committee voted by 11 votes to 8 to suppress a scientific report on inedibles, in respect of which the European Academy of Sciences' advisory committee stated: 'This report is, overall, a reasonable, impartial and balanced piece of work on a very difficult topic.'"
"The peer review would lead me to conclude that it should definitely be published."
"It is important that the general public realise that this decision was made on the basis of grave political errors, rather than believing that the committee has become a majority-owned property of European chocolate manufacturers."
"We will forward your comment to the President, Mr Ford.(1)"
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(1)"
". Given the importance of the aims of the MEDIA programme, we broadly welcome the report and the extension until 2006 requested by the Commission."
"Like the rapporteur, however, we regret that there is, as yet, no definitive report that evaluates the programme’s implementation."
"We trust that Parliament will shortly be provided with this."
"A high-quality, wide-ranging debate must be held regarding audiovisual policy at European level, before decisions can be made regarding the bases of any future programme. It is, therefore, also important that all elements in the audiovisual sector – namely, operators, various networks and associations – as well as workers and representatives from the general public, will be invited to participate in this debate."
". As we all know, MEDIA PLUS and MEDIA-Training programmes constitute one of the pillars of Europe’s audiovisual policy."
"These form the Community support mechanism for the audiovisual sector and replace the MEDIA I and MEDIA II programmes, which were launched, respectively, in 1991 and 1996."
"Experience acquired in the previous programmes has helped considerably to improve the functioning of the current MEDIA instruments."
"MEDIA-Training aims to support study on the application of the new technologies; economic, commercial and financial management; techniques for the financing, production and distribution of audiovisual programmes; techniques for the development of new audiovisual programme types and script-writing and storytelling techniques."
"In addition to the establishment of a dedicated parliamentary committee, I also welcome the Commission’s intention to ensure, for 2006, that continuity is provided to operators and professionals who are involved in the MEDIA-Training programme, which would therefore be extended without any structural changes until 31 December, with increased funding."
"Encouraged by the parliamentary committee’s unanimous approval for the proposals to establish a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programmes, I voted in favour."
". I have voted in support of this report welcoming the extension of the European Maritime Safety Agency's powers to maritime security and seafarers' qualifications."
"Parliament is perfectly correct to emphasise the need to make maritime transport safer, better protect the marine environment and enhance shipping security."
"In the wake of the disaster and the many other catastrophes we have witnessed we can all agree that maritime transport must be made a lot safer and there must be far better coordination of actions in all Member States."
"A properly resourced European Maritime Safety Agency would enable such coordination with due respect for the need to safeguard the subsidiarity principle in recognition that primary responsibility must lie with coastal Member States."
"I also fully support the proposal that the European Maritime Safety Agency should be involved in recognition of certificates of competency for seafarers and hope that the Agency will prioritise this particular area with a view to ensuring greater safety for workers and citizens."
"It is however my view that EMSA should not be given responsibilities for combating terrorism: these must continue to be the responsibility of the Member States, and I welcome the clarifications contained in the report in this regard."
"I congratulate Mr Mastorakis on his report, which I wholeheartedly welcome. I should like to highlight two points that I consider to be of great importance:"
"- complete support for extending the competences of the European Maritime Safety Agency to include the fight against pollution."
"There are major advantages in coordinated Community action in this area and the Agency can play a crucial role, by integrating mechanisms that will make cleaning-up operations more effective following oil spills;"
"- agreement that the Agency will be able to intervene in matters of security, as a result of the new tasks assigned by the Member States through the directive on ‘ships and port facility security’."
". Regulation No 1406/2002, establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency, was adopted by Parliament and the Council on 27 June 2002 and came into force following its publication in the Official Journal in August 2002."
"The main task of this new body will be to provide technical and scientific assistance to Member States and the Commission in order to ensure that Community legislation in the maritime navigation sector is correctly implemented, to prevent ship-source pollution and to monitor the implementation of this legislation."
"Following the recent series of disasters at sea, the Commission proposes extending the competences of the Agency to provide it with the necessary means to address certain problems connected with maritime safety."
"Most importantly, it assigns complementary tasks to the Agency to support the Commission’s activities in the fight against terrorist acts on ships and port facilities, in training seafarers and in the fight against marine pollution. There is already a legislative framework in place that establishes a system of cooperation in the area of sea pollution, and a Community mechanism designed to encourage closer cooperation in emergency interventions in the field of civil protection."
"This proposal, which has undergone substantial improvement in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, wins my support."
". Mr Mastorakis’ report deserves our wholehearted support."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency must have the competences and the means to prevent and combat pollution caused by ships and other vessels."
"We must ensure that the Agency is located in Portugal and – in the interests of decentralisation and of combating the inherent imbalance in Portugal’s Lisbon-centric development – we must make it possible for the Agency, or one of its branches, to be located in Sagres, on the Algarve, in Southern Europe."
". The sustainable development of transport requires the adoption of an integrated approach to transport that exploits to the full the potential of all the different modes currently available."
"Bearing this in mind, the Commission has pointed out the difficulties encountered by users of current intermodal loading units (ILUs) – in other words, containers or boxes usually used in transport – which range from the diversity of handling and securing devices to questions of security and methods of monitoring."
"The aim of this proposal is to recommend the use of an optional European ILU (EILU) that will overcome such difficulties by combining the benefits of both swap boxes and containers, which could be used in rail, road, sea and river transport."
"This measure will provide the transport sector with the freedom to opt for the alternative proposed by the Commission, which will undoubtedly bring advantages."
"I welcome the method chosen to promote the new system, which remains non-mandatory for Member States, granting financial benefits and other incentives to encourage Community projects or programmes that clearly demonstrate the intention of using EILUs."
"In view of the potential benefits for commercial transport, I voted in favour."
". We can only take pleasure in the new protocol raising the capacity of the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) to EUR 930 million."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado report."
"However, we cannot ignore the fact that the damage caused by the sinking of the is estimated at a minimum of EUR 5 billion."
"In view of the size of oil tankers, and therefore the scale of the disasters they may cause, we are far from our target."
"This is why it seems to me necessary to progressively raise the ceiling for IOPCF compensation, and that we need an additional fund amongst the European States, provided that it is not used as a pretext to postpone the necessary adaptation of the IOPCF."
"We must also adopt international agreements which are not limited to establishing the responsibility of the owner of the vessel, as is the case today, but also extend responsibilities to all the actors in the transport chain, ship operators, charterers, and also owners of the cargo transported, thereby encouraging the latter to take care to choose safe ships."
". I wish to confirm my support for this report authorising Austria and Luxembourg to sign the 2003 Protocol by 30 June 2004."
"I believe that in response to the accident involving the there is a clear need to ensure that full and swift payments can be made to victims of future oil spills, notwithstanding our obligation to do everything possible to prevent such incidents from happening in the future."
"I call on all Member States to sign, ratify or accede to the protocol as soon as possible."
". I voted for this report because it is important to make the current system for compensating victims more efficient."
"Additional funds should allow for effective, quick and fair compensation for victims of future oil spills."
"This is why the Member States must sign or ratify the protocol on this fund as quickly as possible."
"I would like to express some reservations however."
"First of all, it is unacceptable that the human, economic and environmental damage resulting from the sinking of the is not taken into account in the raising of compensation."
"Furthermore, it is a shame to be deprived of recourse to the COPE Fund, a European additional compensation fund with a ceiling of EUR one billion, since it could have speeded up the compensation of victims who were not in a position to obtain complete compensation within the framework of the international system."
"This dossier, which has been left aside, seems to be mistaken for the additional fund."
"Finally, the Member States must transpose the measures adopted at European and international level following the and accidents as soon as possible."
"In conclusion, I would point out the equally important need to act in advance by means of a genuine preventive policy."
"Polluters must be severely punished and each party involved in the transport of goods must be made responsible."
". We voted in favour of this report, as we feel that the new supplementary fund will greatly help to ensure that victims of future oil spills will be paid in full and more swiftly."
"This proposal arose following the Council’s decision authorising Member States to sign or ratify, in the interest of the European Community, the Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage, 1992."
"The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) protocol increases the funding available to compensate the victims of oil spills."
"The Member States have been called on to sign this protocol as soon as possible and, if possible, by 30 June 2004."
"This decision follows the accident involving the in November 2002, when the Council adopted a firmer position on the need for additional compensation. More recently, the European Council of 21 March 2003 confirmed the point of view expressed at various Council meetings, calling on Member States, ‘in terms of compensation for the victims of pollution, including environmental damage (...) to pursue within the forthcoming diplomatic conference at the IMO in May an increase in the current ceiling on compensation to EUR one billion’."
"On 16 May 2003, the IMO adopted a new protocol to the existing oil pollution liability and compensation conventions."
"This protocol establishes a supplementary fund, which multiplies the ceiling by five ..."
". I congratulate Mr Gil-Robles on his recommendation on the establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage."
"I share his opinion that maximum levels of compensation in this fund are insufficient to guarantee adequate protection for victims of any future large-scale oil spill."
"The Supplementary Fund will compensate victims provided that compensation claims are deemed justified and if the person is unable to obtain full and adequate compensation under the 1992 Fund Convention."
"I should also like to point out that raising the level of compensation can be no excuse for negligence in terms of prevention."
". The proposal for a decision submitted for Parliament’s approval, authorises and calls on Member States to accede to the Protocol on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) compensation fund, which increases funding available to compensate the victims of oil spills."
"By significantly raising the ceilings for compensation established by the existing international system, the Protocol on the supplementary fund plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations on oil pollution liability."
"The new supplementary fund will ensure that victims of spills of harmful substances will be paid swiftly and in full, thereby providing against situations such as the and the ."
"Given that some parts of the Protocol on the supplementary fund fall within the exclusive competence of the Community, Member States must ratify it in order to comply with the Protocol, thereby leading to implementation, which will naturally enjoy the support of our vote in favour."
". The proposal for a decision submitted for Parliament’s approval authorises Member States to accede to the Protocol on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)’s supplementary fund, which increases the funding available to compensate victims of oil spills."
"Member States are requested to sign this protocol as soon as possible."
"The protocol establishes an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage, 1992, to ensure that victims of damage caused by oil spills from tankers will be paid compensation swiftly and in full."
"By raising the compensation ceiling established in the existing international system, the Protocol plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations in terms of liability for oil pollution, as the compensation ceiling set by the supplementary fund will be fixed."
"There will probably be far fewer parties to the new fund than to the 1992 fund, since numerous States that were party to the 1992 Fund feel that there is no need for supplementary protection. I believe that the new fund will greatly help to ensure the full and swift payment of victims of oil spills."
"I voted in favour."
". The extremely precarious state of the metallurgy sector is well known, as is the lack of an overall plan to revive the sector at European level."
"Portugal has also suffered as a result of this. Hence our vote in solidarity with the workers, the unions and the population of Terni, in the hope of maintaining a high-tech production hub."
"We deplore the rejection of our group’s proposal, which was intended substantially to diminish the effects of company relocations, from which Portugal is also suffering."
"It is therefore essential that the Commission propose adequate legislation to protect workers from the appalling consequences of company relocation, that it promote legislation containing social clauses designed to protect jobs and the standard of living of families affected, and which commit companies to providing workers with the opportunity to gain new professional qualifications."
"A new policy is also required that would oblige multinationals, especially those that neglect their social responsibilities, to return any financial support granted to them."
". I wish to support this call on the Commission and the Member States to learn lessons from the Europe's largest corporate scandal in years, and strengthen EU auditing rules with particular regard to the interest of workers."
"In the wake of the accounting scandal surrounding Italian food group Parmalat, which erupted in December 2003 with the revelation of a black hole of EUR 4 billion in lost funds and EUR 14 billion in unpaid debt, I believe we certainly need the Commission to set up a revised directive on corporate governance that could strengthen rules on auditing."
"Time and time again workers and pensioners have lost out in the wake of corporate scandals so none of us can be in any doubt that there is an urgent need to improve corporate governance and strengthen our defences against corporate malpractice."
"Good company law and good corporate governance are essential to the job security of all employees and to the protect the future of members of company pension schemes."
"The financial services industry must certainly put its house in order and ensure ethical conduct and diligence to protect the jobs and savings of millions of people."
"It is outrageous that no warning signals were sounded while Parmalat funds were being embezzled."
".– The Parmalat company has been presented to us as an example of the success of liberal globalisation."
"Parmalat, once a small family pasteurised milk company, was developed partly thanks to European Union subsidies."
"Since 1974, it had multiplied its subsidiaries and created shell companies in tax havens."
"The system lasted until 11 November 2003, when the auditors expressed doubts about a EUR 500 million investment in the Cayman Islands."
"Parmalat – like Enron, Tyco, World Com or Ahold – is nothing but a prototype for this rogue capitalism."
"For 30 years, Parmalat’s bosses have received public subsidies, disguised their accounts and announced fictitious profits."
"These practices have led to the elimination of thousands of jobs."
"However, the resolution proposed does not attack these Mafia practices and confines itself too much to observations."
"It is for these reasons that we have abstained."
"First of all, the EU should do everything possible to ensure that all the people responsible are extradited and tried quickly."
"Then, the EU must stop giving public subsidies to this type of company."
"Furthermore, employees and their organisations must have the means for effective control of accounts."
"Finally, all tax havens in the EU (San Marino, Monaco, Luxembourg, and others) must be eliminated."
". – At the end of yesterday’s debate, Commissioner Bolkestein neglected the two key problems: legal tax havens and the impact of fraud on employees and small savers."
"It is good that he is introducing strict disclosure requirements in September, which will result in special operations and transactions being listed in the accounts and the use of special instruments being explained; that should have been done much sooner."
"It is imperative that we have an accounting system that does not conceal the actual state of affairs and the reasons for it."
"What I now find the most worrying is that European countries are offering companies the opportunity of bypassing rules laid down by other countries."
"I had always thought that the problems of banking secrecy, letter-box companies and tax havens were confined to Luxembourg, Austria and the Swiss cantons Zug and Schwyz, but it now emerges that thousands of billions of Parmalat’s property was kept in the Netherlands with the help of 181 trust offices, five private companies and one foundation."
"The favourable investment climate for foreign companies created by the Dutch government in the 1990s gives swindlers and tax evaders elbow-room."
"I have not heard anything from the Dutch Commissioner about what action he is taking against this policy, which his party helped to promote."
"I shall shortly be putting this on the agenda, therefore, in questions to the European Commission."
". I welcome this report on approximating civil procedural law in the EU, aimed at harmonising the entire body of private international law relating to contractual obligations."
"I agree with the rapporteur that in this field it is preferable for the provisions concerned to be directly applicable in all Member States instead of being subjected to the uncertainties stemming from the transposition of a directive. The future instrument should therefore be adopted in the form of a regulation."
"I also agree with the rapporteur, with regard to the proposal for an order for payment procedure, when he underlines that the approximation of civil procedural law in the EU cannot happen unless the system of notification and communication of judicial and extrajudicial acts must be standardised. I also endorse his view that, in the small claims procedure, alternative ways of resolving cases should be found that may make it possible to simplify the taking of evidence and to limit the right of appeal."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s suggestions to ensure that the powers granted to the Court of Justice in this field are not excessive."
"I voted in favour."
"We agree with the demand that the Guantánamo Bay prisoners should receive a fair trial."
"That is why we have voted in favour of this report."
"We believe, however, that it is not clear that the prisoners fulfil the conditions for being regarded as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention."
"The report is not, therefore, correct in invoking the rules of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of captured soldiers as rights possessed by the Guantánamo Bay prisoners."
"Events in Afghanistan have been a cause for serious concern for a number of years. The world must not forget the Afghan people, who continue to suffer from the impact of wars waged by those who value their economic and geo-strategic interests ahead of people’s well being."
"The Taliban regime was appalling. Equally appalling, however, was the war started by the US Administration, under the pretext of combating terrorism."
"More than two years on, it is clear that the war did not solve the underlying problems of the Afghan people, nor did it help to support the country’s move towards democracy."
"As the report says, ‘the deteriorating security situation is the main threat to the population of Afghanistan and to the efforts of Afghan and international NGOs supporting reconstruction, rehabilitation and development initiatives and to the peace process in general’."
"Events today in Afghanistan, and indeed in Iraq, clearly demonstrate the complete mistake of going to war."
"The Bush Administration should be condemned for the appalling situation in these countries and for the terrible suffering of the majority of the population."
". – There is a great difference between the reality within Afghanistan and the way it is regarded by outsiders."
"It is a collection of isolated valleys, with different languages and cultures, that have little more in common than their Muslim religion, the oppression of women, and the fact that they were herded together into a single state in the 19th century in order to form a neutral buffer zone between the British and Russian spheres of influence."
"Although Tajiks, Uzbeks and Baluchis also live in neighbouring countries, the issue of whether their languages should be prohibited within Afghanistan is being discussed as part of the establishment of the Afghan constitution."
"The outside world is imposing a supreme president and a central army on the country with the task of achieving unity, whereas, in practice, the President and the army do not have any power outside the capital."
"This kind of illusion of unity will induce the outside world to retain a permanent military presence in the struggle against peoples who have no desire for such unity."
"The only possibility of a lasting peace seems to lie in a Swiss-style constitution consisting of cantons with a high degree of autonomy and different languages."
"I welcome the indication the proposed text gives that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is starting to understand something of this and is advocating decentralisation, a stronger parliament and an independent judicial system."
"I can only support the proposal in the absence of the amendments by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats which seek to move away from these."
". I welcome this report on the situation in Afghanistan."
"The reality is that the recent history of the country is characterised by a lack of security and by the slow pace of reconstruction, a situation that makes it essential for the EU to adopt positions."
"I agree with the rapporteur that concern must be expressed with regard to the difficult situation facing women in Afghanistan."
"The EU must insist that improving the situation of women represents a priority for the country. It is true that some progress has been made, such as the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by the Afghan Transitional Authority (ATA) and the reference to equal treatment for women and men in the new constitution adopted on 4 January."
"While these are important steps, they are insufficient in themselves. It is essential that the ATA condemn consistently, publicly and unequivocally all acts of violence perpetrated against women and children."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s view that funds from the Community budget earmarked for the ATA must be increased, particularly because granting less money may be seen as a lack of support for the progress that has taken place and as a disincentive to proceed with reconstruction."
"The idea of creating a European reconstruction agency along the lines of the Kosovo model must be considered."
"That concludes the voting."
"– Mr President, I would like to point out that someone has just been taking photographs from up there, with the evident intention of discrediting a lady MEP."
"I ask that the photographer should have his camera taken off him and the pictures confiscated."
"I will ask the services to do what they can, Mr Gröner.(3)"
"The sitting is resumed."
"The Minutes of yesterday’s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"– Mr President, I just wanted to say that Mr Hans-Peter Martin has announced the withdrawal of the report on lobbying in industry because of his own personal interest."
"This is not something that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes; it has been done contrary to the intentions of the relevant committee and of the coordinator."
"I just wanted to have it recorded in the minutes of the House that he personally withdrew this report contrary to the intentions of the relevant committee and contrary to the statement that he made."
"– Mr President, I just wanted to say that I hope – as I trust Mr Rübig does too – that this report can be discussed in plenary as soon as possible, as it certainly should be."
"We take note of the comments made for the Minutes."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0012/2004) by Mr Herzog, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to the Commission, on the European Commission's strategy on Services of General Interest (SGI)."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are extremely concerned about the Commission’s strategy in relation to services of general interest."
"First of all, we condemn the lack of transparency, and also of respect, towards civil society and Parliament."
"In fact, in relation to services of general interest, the Commission has carried out consultations throughout 2003, but they were separate consultations."
"The Competition DG has produced a package on financial compensations, which I only know about through journalists, and essentially these texts completely ignore the advice and requests of our Parliament."
"Financial compensation is essential to the very existence of services of general interest."
"Any intrusion by the Commission in the field of definitions and rules justifying compensations would be unacceptable, since it is outside of its competences."
"The Commission’s role is to apply the law, not make it."
"Another reason for Parliament’s call for a legal act under codecision which would include the principles of funding is to clarify the Treaties and case-law."
"In this regard, only codecision would allow us to achieve a legitimate and viable compromise."
"Therefore, in the White Paper, which it must publish before April, the Commission must give a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to this demand for a legislative act."
"By saying ‘no’, by not responding clearly and by assuming the right to impose substantial definitions and rules, it would be committing an abuse of power."
"For the moment, on the basis of the information available to me, I note that, in the package under preparation, it assumes it has the power to lay down rules, and that many of these choices formally contradict the European Parliament’s resolution."
"The resolution we adopted on 14 January of this year states that 'the task at Community level for services of general interest is to guarantee their exercise within the internal market and, notably, to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations'."
"But I believe that the Monti package, which I have not seen, makes funding possibilities more difficult, in the name of full respect for competition rules."
"I would insist, under these circumstances, and we have already told you this – I remember in particular the speeches by Mr Langen and Mrs Flautre, last year – on the fact that we do not want a new communication on the interpretation of the Treaty and jurisprudence."
"We want the Commission to prepare a legislative act involving the codecision procedure."
"However, the Commission is competent in the field of the application of rules."
"It is therefore entitled to prepare a decision and a framework, but these executive acts depend, as we all know, on the interpretation of rules."
"That is why we are asking you to say explicitly today, when you have corrected them following consultation, that these texts under preparation will only enter into force provisionally, while we await the adoption of a legislative act."
"I would now like to draw your attention to the substance of the Monti proposals, which contradict our resolution."
"Far from increasing legal certainty, they will worsen the uncertainty."
"Many services of general economic interest, in particular social, which did not previously notify, would now have to notify."
"For the acceptance of compensation, the requirements for tendering procedures will be toughened up."
"Our requests for criteria for the calculation of costs are being ignored."
"The notion of over-compensation would be greatly extended."
"As for services provided essentially to companies, they would be considered not to be included in the notion of service of general economic interest, which would represent a blatant intrusion into the field of definitions."
"So here are my questions."
"What is the Commission’s timetable for action?"
"Will you respond coherently to the consultation and the proposals on compensations in the White Paper that we asked you to present here in April?"
"Will you state clearly yes or no to a legal act through codecision?"
"Will you state that your executive texts are of a provisional nature while we await the adoption of the corresponding legal act?"
". Mr President, I would like to say what a pleasure it is to be here this afternoon."
"With several hours of further debates ahead of me, I will have been able to spend the whole day in the Hemicycle, and what more could a man want – except perhaps to be lying on a beach in Langkawi?!"
"The honourable Member raises some extremely important issues, and I will come to some of the points he raised in a moment."
"I recognise that his question suggests that there is still some confusion about the Commission's intentions."
"So I want at the outset to state as clearly as I can that the Commission does not intend to adopt any final package before drawing political conclusions from the broad public consultation on the Green Paper on services of general interest."
"The Commission services have assessed very carefully the responses received with regard to the financing of services of general interest."
"The responses are various and interesting, and I can, if Parliament would like, refer to some of them."
"The public consultation has clearly confirmed the need to increase legal certainty and clarity with regard to the application of the state aid rules in this area."
"In fact the comments received from interested parties and also the discussion on the Green Paper in Parliament have both shown that there is a broad agreement that such a clarification is not only necessary, but is also urgent."
"A decision exempting certain types of aid from the notification obligation would be, in our judgment, an appropriate instrument for achieving more legal certainty."
"Given the urgent need for clarification the Commission is considering extending the consultation started by the Green Paper to the specific aspect of financial compensations for public service obligations."
"This could be done by submitting appropriate proposals for consultation."
"In conclusion, I re-emphasise that the Commission will not draw any definitive conclusions in the area of services of general economic interest before it has presented its conclusions on the consultation on the Green Paper, which it intends to submit during the month of April, which is exactly what Parliament has requested."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start at the end."
"Parliament has resolved to demand the creation of a legal framework under the codecision procedure and while respecting the principle of subsidiarity in connection with the implementation of the provisions on the internal market and competition and in relation to the compatibility of competition and the internal market with services of general interest."
"We have called upon the Commission to present, by April at the latest – and we now hear that it will take all the time it has been given – a follow-up document, in which it will show what it has learned from the consultations on the Green Paper and make it clear where it stands on the possibility of a legal framework and what it proposes to do next."
"That is our position where codecision, subsidiarity and adequate provision for services of general interest are concerned, and we will not accept anything to the contrary."
"Secondly, we are so overwhelmingly in favour of the codecision procedure not only because it increases our influence, but also because services of general interest are a quite crucial issue for the public in terms of European politics, and because we want to do everything we can to prevent the public thinking of liberalisation, competition and the internal market as being in conflict with services of general interest and security of provision, and, instead, to try to get the two to work together."
"We affirm that social cohesion is not excluded by competition, liberalisation and the internal market, but is, on the contrary, dependent on them and needs complementary measures."
"That is why the way we handle services of general interest is closely tied in with public confidence in our policies on competition and the internal market and in Europe’s competences – and that is why we, the public’s representatives in the citizens’ parliament, who have to deal with this permanent antithesis on a daily basis, want to be involved in deciding and determining what is to be done."
"My next point is that it is important that the principle of subsidiarity be maintained in view of the differences involved – differences in definition from one Member State to another, differences in geographical situations, differences in the problems of demographics and those affecting social and health policy."
"That is another reason why we are so strongly in favour of the European constitution, because the draft contained a formulation securing the principle of subsidiarity, one to which we can give our support."
"There is something else I would like to touch on."
"According to the constitution, the European Union’s goal is the social market economy and social cohesion."
"Treating services of general interest as not being the antithesis of competition and the internal market is what defines and gives life to the governing principle of the social market economy and creates social cohesion on that basis."
"I stress the need both for potential service providers to be treated impartially and for there to be security of provision, the latter of which must be ensured even if aid payments are needed to do so."
"The fact is that we need services of general interest only where the market is unable to guarantee these services on a universal basis, at affordable prices and to a high standard of quality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have to admit that I prefer to discuss foreign policy with you, because that is where your heart lies."
"The fact is, though, that you have to take this opportunity too."
"What I did not like about the statement you had to deliver, I think, was its failure to acknowledge that the present European social model is supported by a majority of this House."
"A narrow majority perhaps, but still a majority."
"I believe it is also supported by the majority of the European population, who see services of general interest as something different from the other goods and services that are on offer."
"I believe that the basis for any consideration of services of general interest is the identification of the specific interests of the general public, and here I am certainly at one with Mr Karas."
"In contrast to many other services, people can also help to determine, by the way they vote in elections, the range of services of general interest available to them, especially if these services are provided by or on behalf of regional or local authorities."
"People want sufficient high-quality public services at a reasonable price."
"The market may well be an instrument with which this aim can be achieved – I certainly do not rule that out – if its activity is governed by proper guidelines."
"The basic guidelines would therefore have to be set by means of a legal act adopted jointly by the Council and Parliament."
"That goes without saying, in my view, and the Commission must surely agree."
"We can still discuss the precise details of the legal framework, but there must be a legal framework that takes account of the special nature of services of general interest and the needs they are designed to satisfy."
"Our preferred option is, of course, the framework envisaged in the draft constitution."
"Although we do not yet have a constitution, this is the direction in which we should be moving."
"Far too many of our citizens are discovering that liberalisation – which, admittedly, is often accompanied by privatisation – is resulting in fragmentation of services."
"I have heard, for example, that no fewer than 28 companies are operating on bus routes in the city of Manchester following deregulation."
"All too often, the price cuts resulting from liberalisation are short-lived, and new monopolies frequently emerge – private monopolies, which are no better than public monopolies."
"Indeed, they are worse, because they cannot be influenced at the ballot box."
"I also believe that, in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity – of which you, in fact, wholeheartedly approve – the only thing we should ask of the Commission is that it create a legal framework for public services."
"In all other respects, just as the clamour was once for freedom of thought, I would now appeal for freedom of structure, for the right of local and regional communities and authorities, which know best how to provide the services that people actually need, to structure public services as they see fit."
"The Commission should commit itself to this approach."
"Mr President, we have on a number of occasions expressed our disagreement with the Commission’s strategy concerning services of general interest."
"It is unacceptable that it should continue to intervene in this area, thereby undermining the very existence of high-quality public services that are essential in combating poverty and in ensuring social inclusion and a high standard of living for the whole population."
"What is urgently required, as we have proposed on many occasions, is a moratorium on liberalisation and a root and branch evaluation of the consequences of what has already been implemented in the various social and economic sectors, especially in terms of jobs, of the universality of the services provided, of client satisfaction and of making the functioning and management of services more democratic."
"Firstly, however, the Commission must refrain from implementing measures that, in practical terms, may result in further erosion of quality public services in the various countries of the EU."
"– Mr President, I believe that in this debate our problem is not so much to reopen all the discussions we have held time and time again on the meaning and the nature of services of general interest, but to deal with the issue of security and the framework, and more precisely that of the democratic security and the democratic framework, within the context of the debate on services of general interest."
"Today’s speech, Commissioner Patten, has certainly been reassuring, but you will be aware that the same can be said of Commissioner Lamy’s speech, a month ago."
"At that time we talked about discussion, about very rich consultation – three hundred contributions – we planned to carry out an analysis, we talked about options available to us, about the framework directive, the consensus within the Convention in favour of a European law."
"And the Commission considered and considered …"
"As for me, I have the feeling that in this way we are holding a form of debate which almost found its rhythm until the White Paper in April, while Commissioner Monti, during this time, has been presenting his ‘packages’, in which he makes snap decisions on the issues and all of this without debate and without discussion."
"I believe this is in unacceptable way of doing things, because the campaign for a democratic Europe, aimed at highlighting the added value of Community policies, is not going to be carried out by Mr Monti, but by us."
"However, if Mr Monti wants to, let him, instead of us, wage the electoral campaign to defend the social Europe."
"Mr President, one month after the adoption of the Herzog report on services of general interest, which called for the setting up of a European legal framework, adopted by the codecision procedure, we are already totally confused, as can be seen from Philippe Herzog’s oral question."
"The rapporteur has discovered, in effect, that at the same time the Commission, all by itself, using its own powers, has been preparing a regulation on the financial compensation from which services of general interest may benefit."
"Today, the Commission has just half-admitted this, and has promised that it will await the outcome of the consultations on the Green Paper before taking any decision."
"So much the better!"
"However, I would say to Mr Herzog that in the years to come you will see more of this sort of thing, and worse things too."
"To put it simply, it was not necessary to meddle with the workings of the European legal framework."
"This concept, like that of the framework directive, is ambiguous, because nobody knows exactly what should go into it, from authorised subsidies to the definition of the service itself, via organisational principles, obligations and relations with service users."
"Moreover, the concept of a legal framework which respects subsidiarity, which was invented by the European Parliament, is even more ambiguous, or even contradictory, because real subsidiarity in this matter would consist in admitting that public services, which are actually essential to life in our societies, must be defined, organised and managed at the closest possible level to the public within the national framework."
"We need a single rule: each Member State should be free to decide on its own public services."
"The corollary to this rule is that public service obligations should take priority over Community competition rules."
"Mr President, when I hear the discussion in this Chamber, I start to wonder what we are actually debating."
"For two years, Parliament has been demanding more legal clarity, and Commissioner Monti wants to create legal clarity on key issues."
"It is surely an illusion to believe that we can now suddenly enact the amendments envisaged in the Constitution on our own and bring competition law into line with the proposed article on the internal market."
"The fact is, Mr Herzog, that we spent months discussing that, and you did not obtain a majority for your proposals."
"You did not get majority support for the idea of rolling back sectoral liberalisation."
"You did not obtain a majority for your renewed demands for a framework directive."
"There was no majority behind your call for standardised European services of general interest."
"Now you are touting these ideas all over again."
"All I can say is that you either have no idea what Mr Monti is trying to do or you are seeking to overturn your defeat of four weeks ago."
"I cannot conceive of any other reasons."
"Mr Swoboda, as he said himself, is truly an expert on foreign affairs."
"On matters of competition law, though – you would do better to keep a low profile Mr Swoboda – because you have not grasped the views of the House as reflected in the voting figures."
"If we call for legal clarity, as we did, and Mr Monti presents a proposal – which takes full account of subsidiarity, Mrs Flautre – your objections leave me wondering what you actually want."
"Mr Monti proposes that subsidies of less than EUR 15 million a year paid to businesses with an annual turnover of less than EUR 40 million should in future be the sole responsibility of the Member States."
"If they no longer require approval, this surely means more freedom for the Member States."
"This is the legal clarity we want."
"I fail to understand the point of all the discussion here."
"Approval need no longer be sought for the awarding of aid for housing construction and for hospitals."
"I cannot fathom the debate here, because this is surely part of what we have been demanding."
"For this reason, all I can say is that, if Mr Monti’s proposal as I understand it enters into force, it will do so on the basis of the EC Treaty in its present form, which empowers him to enact such legislation without submitting it to codecision."
"He is acting to ensure that subsidiarity is strengthened, and he is acting to ensure that legal clarity will prevail in important areas by the end of the current legislative term of the European Parliament."
"We do not want to give our blessing here to state aid for the likes of Electricité de France or Volkswagen, but grants to small and medium-sized businesses, including regional grants, are to fall within the ambit of the Member States in future, and Mr Monti intends to open up that possibility."
"Before we spend another three years debating a White Paper and framework legislation, he is making things happen."
"I can only heartily welcome the fact that greater legal clarity will finally prevail in these matters before the end of this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for straying away from your usual subjects in order to take an interest in the problem of services of general interest, which is so important to the citizens of Europe."
"Following the completion of the consultations on the Green Paper, you reported on the general consensus on the need for clarification and legal clarity, as Mr Langen has just said."
"However, has any consensus been reached on the need for democratic clarity mentioned by Mrs Flautre?"
"What Parliament was asking for in its resolution – and it did not, in fact, do so unanimously, as I think we would all agree – was that the interpretation of the Court of Justice or the Commission should not be the only prevailing interpretation with regard to clarification on the subject of acceptable state aids, or in order to define the correct interpretation of Article 86."
"What we need is a debate, in the context of the codecision procedure, which will make it possible to carry out evaluations on a case-by-case basis, since it is true that everyone perceives the evidence as a function of his or her historical or national experience."
"Thus as far as all services of general interest which are the responsibility of regional or local bodies are concerned, it is clear that it is not the task of the Community to intervene."
"Do people realise, however, that in other countries, both Member States and third countries, the evidence may show that there are national public services which have operated very efficiently up to now?"
"Moreover, many people would consider, as regards the effects of liberalisation in areas such as rail transport – for example in a country with which you are familiar – or in areas like energy and electricity, that it is not entirely apparent that it is absolutely necessary to make competition rules alone the be all and end all of the system."
"Nor is it apparent that the calculation of State aids and compensation, whether legitimate or not, should be made the subject of a debate."
"We believe, therefore, that there should be a democratic debate."
"Mr Langen and his friends very often quote Article 86(3) in order to prove that something is the responsibility of the Commission, but they fail to mention Article 86(2), which lays down that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them."
"It is this that is the subject of our discussions among ourselves, but it should also be the subject of a discussion between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on a sector-by-sector basis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating Commissioner Monti, because I believe he is looking after the rights of consumers and of the citizens of Europe, and they are entitled to obtain a decent quality of service and, more importantly, to obtain it at a reasonable price."
"One of the fundamental defining characteristics of services of general interest is that they are subject to a transparent public tendering procedure."
"I believe there is still a great deal of confusion here between liberalisation and privatisation."
"I believe that liberalisation offers a fair framework for competition."
"In Sweden, for example, we have seen that many towns and cities, often administered by one and the same political party, compete with each other in a bid to provide the best possible services and that a town or municipal administration offering the best deal to the public, to the consumer, is awarded the franchise to provide its services in other towns and cities too."
"In public tendering procedures, it is possible to specify quite precisely what is wanted."
"If, for example, a railway service is being put out to tender, a public authority can say that there will be three people at six in the morning, twelve at ten o’clock in the morning and three again at midnight."
"Good and appropriate tender specifications can then be drawn up for the service from A to B. I am also in favour of public resources being used here, because we are all in favour of the social component of government activity."
"We want to ensure that services of general interest are accessible to people who have no driving licence or who have financial problems, mobility problems or other disadvantages."
"I have to say, though, that liberalisation and fair competition are one track, while privatisation is a second track."
"I would ask that we try to avoid confusing the two and focus here on the systematic pursuit of the strategy of free competition."
"In this context I should like to congratulate Commissioner Monti once again for organising his proposal along these very lines."
"It goes without saying that city councils and public administrations which provide services of general interest will have to compete with our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is why public bodies put services out to tender."
"At the present time, two out of every three employees works for a small or medium-sized enterprise."
"There are 18 million businesses here that can bid for a franchise to provide public services for the benefit of consumers."
"The small and medium-sized businesses pay 80% of total tax revenue; in other words, they ultimately provide the money that enables us to afford these social services in the general public interest."
"For this reason I believe that the term ‘social economy’, which was once in common use, is inappropriate, as is our German term , literally ‘subsistence provision’, which is commonly used to translate ‘services of general interest’."
"What we want is the best service for our citizens."
"That can only be provided in the framework of fair competition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to take this opportunity to say that I share the opinion that the market and free competition are important values."
"In this area, however, as in many others, we should not be fundamentalists, fanatics, or, if you will, ayatollahs, which, as we shall see in the forthcoming debate on Iran, is the worst-case scenario."
"Yet it strikes me, Commissioner, that this is precisely what the Commission is increasingly becoming, and in an increasing number of fields."
"I should like to give you an example: the Commission has just begun legal action against Greece for insisting that those who serve on coasting vessels in their islands must speak Greek."
"This is absolutely ridiculous, Commissioner."
"I should like to remind you that, very recently, only a few years ago, many dozens of Portuguese seamen lost their jobs on Norwegian routes just because they did not speak Norwegian, in spite of the fact that Norway is also required to abide by the laws of free competition."
"Though it pained me, I felt obliged to accept the reason given, namely that of safety."
"It is absolutely essential that crews serving on ships, especially on island routes, must be able to speak the language of the country concerned."
"In taking legal action against the Greek islands – which is similar to the action it has taken in other parts of Europe – the Commission has displayed an utterly fanatical attitude; it has shown that it has no idea how far to go with free competition, nor does it know where safety – or other extremely important values – should begin and end."
"The Commission lacks a sense of proportion and common sense and should take firm steps to remedy this state of affairs."
"– Mr President, first of all, in reply to Mr Langen, I would say this."
"With your usual vehemence you are concealing your own failure, because I would remind you that you renounced your own resolution of 2001, which was in favour of a framework directive, and in January you were forced to accept the fact that we were reiterating our demand for a legislative act by means of the codecision procedure."
"Do not try, then, to conceal your failure."
"Mr Patten, you are a diplomat and you know the meaning of words."
"You talked about confusion."
"Yet where is that confusion, when the Commission, in its Green Paper, is completely vague on the fundamental issue of funding, and when now, just a few weeks before the end of the debate, it tells us that it is now going to organise consultations on funding?"
"Where is the confusion?"
"Where is transparency?"
"Where is democracy?"
"The only thing that we ask of you is not to organise consultations on financial compensation today, but to produce a text which corresponds to the demands of civil society and of the European Parliament."
"The present text, which you will be presenting to the Commission in three days’ time, does not correspond to those demands."
"You also talked about certainty, legal certainty."
"That is all well and good, but there is a misunderstanding here."
"In effect, the Monti text will improve legal certainty in the sense that the rules will be clearer, but they have also been tightened up as regards the financial compensation which is the subject of this text."
"There will be greater certainty, but in the final analysis there will be fewer possibilities for funding public services."
"That is the content."
"Do not try to deceive us about the content."
"You talk about exemptions."
"All services of general economic interest are social in nature. Those which did not need to provide notification will be obliged to do so."
"At this very moment the social housing organisations are in the process of indicating to the Commission that the Commission will be obliging them to notify what was not notified previously."
"So much for making things more certain."
"Finally, will you please indicate, especially in the White Paper, whether or not you will now agree to prepare a legal act via the codecision procedure."
"It is, after all, an elementary principle of good democracy to answer yes or no after so many years."
"Thank you very much, Mr Herzog."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2004) by Mr Perry, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Commission, on the implementation of Directive 73/239/EEC by the UK between 1978 and 2001."
"Mr President, as we debate, yet again, this issue of the regulation of Lloyd's of London, 63 names are currently facing bankruptcy proceedings against them in the English courts."
"This is not an abstract issue to them, nor is it a matter that has long since been resolved."
"It is a very real issue and one that will continue to be of serious moment for years to come."
"Those 63 people did not become names under the present regulatory regime, but in the pre-2001 period."
"The losses that they are now faced with and that are, seemingly, forcing them into bankruptcy, occurred under the regulatory regime enforced between 1978 and 2001."
"Those 63, the petitioners to this Parliament, and thousands of other names from many European countries have one simple question, the question put in our resolution of last September and reiterated today: did the United Kingdom, between 1978 and 2001 implement, fully and correctly, Directive 73/239/EEC relating to Lloyd's?"
"This question has been put to Parliament by petitioners."
"It is a legitimate question."
"We have put it repeatedly to the Commission."
"The Commission, so far, seems strangely reluctant to answer it."
"The dossier presented to Parliament in December in response to our resolution of September 2003 is totally inadequate and conspicuously fails to offer any answer to that central question."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, who launched two sets of infringement proceedings against the UK Government over the regulation of Lloyd's, regularly tells us that his responsibility is only to bring a Member State into compliance."
"That is right, but only in part."
"He has other responsibilities as well."
"Life would be simpler for us all if there was only one responsibility."
"That is never the case."
"Allow me to remind the Commission that it has a Treaty obligation, under Article 197, to answer questions posed by Parliament."
"That Article is not there to allow clever sophistry, like the question once posed in an Oxford University admission interview, which asked: 'Is this a proper question?', to which the smart-Alec reply is, 'Yes, if this is a proper answer.'"
"That may well do in a university interview, but not in Parliament."
"If a non-reply was sufficient, there would be no point in having the Treaty obligation in Article 197."
"Citizens have a Treaty right to petition Parliament about whether rules are being respected."
"The Commission has a Treaty responsibility to ensure that EU rules and directives are properly respected."
"Parliament has a Treaty right to have its questions properly answered."
"I can only assume that, for reasons unknown to me, the Commission finds it embarrassing to answer this question."
"Clearly the British Government is acutely embarrassed and I find it shaming, as an Englishman, that the British Government is being so secretive in this case that it ordered the withdrawal of all British responses from the file the Commission released to Parliament."
"What on earth does it have to hide?"
"The Commission should not aid it in this secrecy or become complicit in it."
"When this petition was put to the Commission, I believe the Commission behaved correctly."
"It investigated the petitioners' complaints."
"It was clearly not satisfied with the situation and sent a detailed questionnaire to the British Government."
"Although this House has never been allowed to see the responses, it is obvious that the Commission was still not satisfied, since it launched infringement proceedings."
"Subsequently it launched further, separate infringement proceedings covering the regulatory regime post-2001."
"The Commission now judges that the current regime is in compliance."
"Well, it knows the facts and we do not, so we cannot comment at this moment on that."
"But the Commission's satisfaction with the post-2001 regime does not take away our right to ask the Commission about the regulatory regime prior to 2001, nor the Commission's responsibility to answer us."
"The EU has to be based on a system of rules and laws."
"There cannot be a pick-and-choose system."
"Policy-holders of Lloyd's have a right and need to know whether the solvency rules were being respected."
"People who invested in Lloyd's names also have that right."
"As one said to me, we had a right to assume the rules on solvency were being respected and that we were not operating, as it were, in the Wild West, where rules could be ignored."
"If the Commission persists in refusing to give a clear answer to this House, we have a major difference about the interpretation of Article 197 of the Treaty and a major interinstitutional problem."
"In my opinion Parliament would need to refer this to the European Court of Justice for resolution under Article 232 of the Treaty."
"Under that Article, if Parliament believes the Commission has failed to act, under the obligations imposed upon it by the Treaty, then the ECJ can be called upon to give a ruling."
"I hope that this afternoon the Commissioner, whom I greatly respect, as indeed I do Commissioner Bolkestein, will now at long last give us a straight answer to a straight question. Did the United Kingdom between 1978 and 2001 implement fully and correctly Directive 73/239/EEC?"
"Yes or no?"
". Mr President, may I say straight away that while I recognise that there is some disagreement between the Commission and the honourable Member on this enormously important matter, we recognise the exemplary diligence with which he has pursued an issue of considerable importance to so many people."
"He has pursued the case with great conscientiousness and I am sure he has and should enjoy the gratitude of a large number of Lloyd's names."
"Let me say a few words on the background to this very complex issue."
"As the House knows, following several petitions to the European Parliament complaining about the United Kingdom regulation and the supervision of the Lloyd's market and a number of individual complaints, the Commission decided to open infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom in December 2001."
"As a result of these proceedings, the United Kingdom changed the legal framework for the supervision and regulation of Lloyd's, which is now governed by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000."
"After issuing a supplementary letter of formal notice in January 2003, whose purpose was to clarify the concrete functioning of the new regime, the Commission concluded in October 2003 that all aspects of the Lloyd's regime under examination now comply with the requirements of the relevant European Union insurance directives."
"More specifically, in a press release issued on 15 October 2003, the Commission confirmed the compatibility of the regulatory and supervisory regime for Lloyd's, as established under the Financial Service and Markets Act, with the requirements of Articles 8(1)(e), 13(2) and (3), 15(1), 16(1), 19(1) and 19(2) of Directive 73/239/EEC, as amended."
"As regards the regime applicable to Lloyd's prior to the entry into force of the Financial Services and Markets Act, the Commission has consistently maintained, in full accordance with ECJ case law, that the objective of infringement proceedings under European Union law is to establish or restore the compatibility of existing national law with European Union law and to rule on the possible past incompatibility of national law, which has been in the meantime brought into compliance with European law."
"I think my honourable friend would accept that the Ombudsman agrees with the legal interpretation that I have set out and that we have set out in the past."
"To borrow from my honourable friend's anecdote about the examination question at a university with which I am familiar, I would only ask whether this is a proper answer and would say that it is a proper answer if you want an answer that is in compliance with the relevant case law."
"In its resolution of 25 September 2003, Parliament called for access to the Commission's file under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 – that is under the general public access provisions – and for a Commission statement on the compatibility of Lloyd's regulation and supervision in the period 1978 to 2001 – that is before the implementation of the 2000 Act."
"Since the infringement proceedings had in the meantime been closed, the College of Commissioners mandated my colleague and friend, Commissioner Bolkestein, to forward the relevant documents to President Cox, and this was done by letter dated 15 December 2003."
"As regards the assessment of the UK's former regime, the Commission's views are detailed in the first letter of formal notice, sent in December 2001, which is part of the file forwarded to Parliament."
"Following the UK Government's reply which indicated the entry into force of the 2000 Act in December 2001, the Commission's inquiry dealt exclusively with the new United Kingdom regime."
"Therefore, since the regime, which was applicable between 1978 and 2001, no longer applies, the Commission sees no scope for further action."
"Let me repeat that I recognise the dedication with which my honourable friend has pursued this matter and I am sorry that, for the reasons which I have adduced, I am not able to give him on this occasion a reply which will, I suspect, satisfy him wholly or in part."
"Mr President, I have known Mr Perry for some time in this Parliament – and I consider him one of my best friends – and I have followed the issue he raised in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market with very real interest."
"But having examined the case, I have no choice but to agree with what Mr Patten just said."
"That is to say, in the infringement procedure, the Commission is not the Court of Justice, but an agent of Community law which tries to ensure that the law is applied, by demanding that the State comply with Community legislation."
"And in this case, I believe that the Commission has done that, although perhaps rather belatedly."
"The result of an infringement procedure, once the State in question has complied with Community law, is the closure of the case, because – as Mr Patten has also said – there is a repeated judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities according to which there is no case for infringement when the State in question has complied with Community law."
"I believe that Mr Perry has a laudable interest in the Community institutions functioning properly and, of course, it would be desirable for us all to do the same with all the directives that are not transposed by the Member States."
"What does not work here is a mechanism of fines and penalties imposed by the Commission."
"The Commission does not have those powers."
"Only the Court of Justice should have them and, specifically, I would refer Mr Perry to British law."
"Continental administrative law allows a State to be called to account for non-compliance with its obligations, including, for example, the failure to transpose a Community directive in time."
"But I have the impression that the procedure which is being tried here is not going to lead anywhere, because I do not see how the Commission, at any point, is going to be able to invoke non-compliance with a Community directive in the past on the part of the State in order to call them to account."
"From a legal point of view, that mechanism does not exist."
"In other words, given that Mr Perry is probably completely right to be concerned about compliance with Community legislation and acknowledging that there has probably been harm done to individuals, the judicial procedure is not that of reiteration of the action by the Commission – which has fulfilled its obligations – but, if necessary, an internal British administrative procedure in the event that, in accordance with British law, individuals have been prejudiced by the failure to transpose a Community directive in time."
"I therefore believe that the Commission, at this time, has fully complied with its obligations and we in the European Parliament cannot demand that it act in any other way."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very careful reply, which he relates very much to this particular question, the issue of Lloyd's."
"I should like to think of this in terms of two very general principles: firstly, the implementation of legislation by Member States and action by the Commission to ensure that that happens; secondly, the entitlement to information between Parliament and the Commission during such enforcement measures."
"I should also like to apply some common sense to those two principles."
"Looking with common sense at how this particular matter proceeded, one cannot but feel that something is not quite right, that there is a period of 20 years when nothing seems to happen and no implementation takes place."
"I am sorry, Commissioner, that your colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein is not here."
"I know that he shares our deep concern about implementation of legislation by Member States and making sure that it happens effectively so that the internal market, of which we are all so proud, works properly."
"However, if it takes a Member State over 20 years to implement a directive, and a Member State can carry on without doing that for such a long period of time, then common sense tells us that something is not right."
"I am greatly concerned – as I am sure others are – about the message that this sends out to acceding states on the eve of enlargement concerning the way we conduct our business and the way we expect Member States to adhere to Community law."
"It is all very well to say that there is no past incompatibility."
"As a lawyer, that sounds to me like a very nice, lawyer's answer."
"What we are looking for here are common sense answers and an answer to the question as to why a Member State can be so long in default and why it is that we, as Parliament, cannot get a simple answer to a simple question about that."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by dealing with the allegation contained in Mr Perry's report that directives have not been implemented."
"That seems to have been accepted in this House."
"However, that assertion and allegation have not been proven."
"Mr Bolkestein has on many occasions – both to the committee and to this House – indicated that he could not look at past regimes: he could only rule if current law was compatible."
"Some of us heard that, but others failed to hear it."
"If there is alleged past failure, then the place to seek redress is in the national courts."
"This has been played before the national courts on many occasions, and the judgments have gone against the plaintiffs."
"Indeed, at the moment before the English High Court there is a case of alleged breach of statutory duty against Her Majesty's Treasury and the Secretary-of-State for the Department of Trade and Industry."
"Yet Mr Perry calls for documents which the UK Government has sent to the Commission, whilst failing to recognise that those same documents may form part of its defence."
"Any defence has to present its case before the relevant court."
"Equally, I have learnt, from being a member of the Committee on Petitions, that one of the petitioners is about to bring a case before the Court of Justice."
"Let me refer now to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"There is a degree of ignorance or naivety that appals me."
"Parliamentarians do not have to refer to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 in order to gain access to documents."
"There is an interinstitutional framework agreement for parliamentary access."
"But, if anyone were to read that Regulation, he would see that the infringement proceedings are a particular exception under Article 4."
"Let me just refer to something Mr Perry said."
"All of us in public life must be consistent in the application of principle."
"Mr Perry said that he finds it shaming that the UK Government was so secretive that it undertook the withdrawal of documents."
"What does it have to hide?"
"This morning I was in the STOA Panel discussing and voting on a study on inedibles in food product packaging."
"Mr Perry voted for the suppression of a public document."
"I fail to understand that."
"We must be consistent in the application of principle."
"The Commission has met its obligations."
"If Parliament wants to go down the cul-de-sac to the Court of Justice, let Parliament prove itself foolish."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"- B5-0080/2004 by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the elections in Iran;"
"- B5-0083/2004 by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the general elections in Iran;"
"- B5-0084/2004 by Pedro Marset Campos and Esko Olavi Seppänen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the elections in Iran;"
"- B5-0088/2004 by Enrique Barón Crespo, Anna Karamanou, Jannis Sakellariou, Johannes (Hannes) Swoboda and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the political situation in Iran prior to the parliamentary elections on 20 February 2004;"
"- B5-0094/2004 by Michael Gahler, Arie M. Oostlander, Bernd Posselt, Lennart Sacrédeus and Ilkka Suominen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the parliamentary elections in Iran;"
"- B5-0098/2004 by Alima Boumediene-Thiery, Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, Monica Frassoni, Per Gahrton, Marie Anne Isler Béguin, Nelly Maes, Matti Wuori and Eurig Wyn, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the elections in Iran;"
"- B5-0099/2004 by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the parliamentary elections in Iran."
"Mr President, as the parliamentary rapporteur on Iran, I should like to emphasise the cross-party disquiet about political developments there in the run-up to the elections."
"Representatives of the two largest groups and of one of the other groups in this House recently paid separate visits to Iran."
"I can see that the groups are largely in agreement in their assessments of the current situation and in the political conclusions they have drawn."
"Sadly, we are compelled to note that the process of democratisation has received a severe setback, in that this forthcoming election will be less democratic than the previous one."
"The President and the majority of members of the Parliament in Tehran agree that this cannot be regarded as a free and fair election."
"We share their view."
"The electorate, whose frustration is so deep that they are not even supporting the reformers, are likely to vote with their feet and stay at home on election day."
"This really benefits no one, not even the usual suspects in Iran, although they are delighted and are already canvassing European governments to do business with them and forget the reformers."
"I have to ask the Commission whether, in view of this setback, it simply plans to turn its attention to other matters."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me say that we must now intensify our political contacts with the Iranian institutions but also with all the political forces and civil society in Iran."
"We must not only talk to those in the reformist camp; it is also particularly important that we seek dialogue – and it will be a difficult dialogue – with those who exercise power in the judiciary and in the Council of Guardians and make it clear to them that, if they continue to pursue their present policies, they will make poor use of their country’s potential, obstruct progress towards a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU and, above all, thwart the hopes and expectations of the Iranian people."
"Also, any sustained attempt to govern against the people is doomed to failure, as events of recent decades in this world have shown."
"That is why I make this appeal to those who hold power in Iran: change; turn about, before it is too late."
"Perhaps you can indeed put the domestic dialogue back on track, so as to foster the growth of democracy in Iran."
"– The ayatollahs on the Council of Guardians are doing everything they can to hold on to their religious, political and economic power."
"Their exclusive power to interpret the Koran is constantly being abused for political ends."
"They block everything that does not appeal to them or that could impinge on their own position of power."
"They have now vetoed more than a third of the laws adopted by the parliament."
"More than 2 500 reform-minded candidates have now been excluded from the elections, including around 80 sitting MPs."
"Whilst large sectors of society, young people in particular, want modernisation and freedom, the hard core in power is clinging to medieval ideas and repressive practices."
"The younger generation constitutes the vast majority of the population in Iran."
"In addition, even many former revolutionaries have become disillusioned by the clergy’s abuse of power."
"President Khatami himself calls the exclusion of candidates a threat to the nation and the system."
"The conflict between reformers and conservative clergymen is increasingly coming to a head."
"If nothing is done about it, it seems that it is only a matter of time before the situation boils over, with everything that entails."
"The human rights and democratic situation in Iran is still extremely worrying."
"Unless substantial improvements are made, the European Union will not be able to form a partnership."
"It is highly debatable whether it is actually still advisable to continue to negotiate."
"What is Commissioner Patten’s opinion on this?"
"Does he still see prospects for partnership with Iran now that the situation is deteriorating so dramatically?"
"Nor is the human rights dialogue with Iran of any great account, as I know from personal experience."
"It will not make things any better if the parliamentary elections turn out to be a farce."
"The European Union must not lend itself to a dialogue that is used as a pretext for not actually carrying out any reforms."
"Iran is a potentially rich country with an ancient civilisation, and has the potential to play an extremely important, constructive role in the region."
"It will not become a new civilisation, however, whilst the ayatollahs continue to abuse their unrestricted power, but will instead be doomed to remain an international pariah."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today in Iran the conflict between conservatives and reformists threatens once again to throw an entire nation of this great Middle East into obscurantism and fundamentalism, into a pernicious and despairing arbitrariness."
"More than ever, therefore, and certainly more than in the past, our Community institutions must make their presence and influence felt among the conflicting forces in the Iranian Parliament, in President Khatami’s Participation Front and in Ayatollah Khamenei’s Guardian Council, in order to defend the universality of the values of the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"These fundamentals should serve as a basis for negotiations and exchanges between the two factions, without which there is a risk of ending up with a State in which there is no rule of law, and to push that State or to push the cohesion of Iranian society and the geopolitics of this tormented region towards even worse scenarios."
"The time has come to defuse the Council of Guardian’s attempts to disqualify reformist parliamentary candidates in the forthcoming general elections."
"In effect, the acknowledged absence of democratic rules and procedural transparency will end up discrediting the political rulers and encouraging their rejection."
"Those rulers have already succumbed to the suppression of freedoms, including freedom of expression, and they are the cause of the failure of economic and social development."
"To suppress all the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran, who are already worn down by years of war and revolution, would be to snuff out their last hopes and ideals, leaving the way open to despairing ideologies and extremisms."
"The mobilisation of the European Union must be a matter of priority and it must be committed and pro-active, and must engage decision makers and all social categories or categories of activity."
"Any withdrawal, any ostracism on the part of foreign diplomats, would strengthen the retrograde and destabilising forces in a region of the Middle East which is as far from us in geographical terms as it is geo-politically sensitive in our view."
"Any argument in favour of severing cultural links between Europe and the Middle East should also be rejected."
"The creation of a special parliamentary delegation to Iran proves this, the signing of the additional protocol on safety controls for nuclear materials confirms it, and the preliminary discussions between the European Union and Iran on human rights should convince us of it."
"These first signs must support and encourage the European Union’s approach to the Iranian authorities with a view to sending, right now, a party of observers to examine the electoral process and cooperating, right now, in judicial reforms and in the control of drug trafficking."
"At the present time, history is being made in Iran, and Brussels has learned enough from Munich in the past to be aware that it cannot refuse to make its voice heard now in Tehran."
"Mr President, Europe and the United States of America have long been striving to achieve considerable influence over developments in Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan."
"That influence often produces results quite different from those that had been expected."
"Muslim fundamentalists in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq owed their survival not so long ago to support from the West against others."
"In Iran, too, attempts were made for a long time to keep allies in power when their position was contested."
"Fifty years ago, the Mossadeq government was ousted as it was considered that it was too left-wing and that it could conceivably have entered into cooperation with Iran’s neighbours to the north, which were still part of the Soviet Union."
"An authoritarian ruler, the Shah, returned to power, but he proceeded to make ever more enemies in his own country on account of his lust for power and his neglect of his people."
"Whilst left-wing nationalism and socialism had no opportunity to constitute an alternative, a medieval variant of Islam was given renewed opportunities to organise popular resistance."
"Twenty-five years ago, a popular uprising put an end to a regime that had always sought military and economic cooperation with the West."
"The outside world has never trusted the new authorities."
"Following a few years of great enthusiasm, social policy and democratic experiments, this regime, too, incurred hatred within the country."
"The sizeable younger generation wants an end to the exclusion of politicians whose views differ from those of the conservative clergy, to restrictive rules for women, to the expulsion of students, and to the frequent hanging, stoning or amputation of body parts of those who do not fit into the world view of the authorities."
"Many people have fled the tyranny, often to Europe."
"Nevertheless, in recent years, Europe, motivated by economic interests, has been making overtures to this regime."
"The United States was hesitant, but seemed to be doing the same after Iran suffered the earthquake in Bam and showed readiness to have its nuclear projects inspected."
"In 2002, a part of the opposition standing up for the rights and freedoms that we take for granted in Europe was placed on a list of terrorist organisations."
"That increased the confidence of the real authorities in stopping earlier initiatives for democratisation and normalisation."
"Excluding the most critical candidates reversed the political composition of the parliament from the outset, turning the large majority into a small minority."
"My group hopes that Europe will learn from this and take the side of the Iranian people and their resistance organisations from now on."
"Mr President, a clear signal from Tehran is always welcome, and yesterday President Khatami gave one personally."
"In a speech on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Iran’s Islamic revolution, the Head of State levelled particularly sharp criticism at the exclusion of a whole host of reform-minded candidates from the parliamentary elections on 20 February."
"President Khatami said – and my colleague Mr van den Bos has also said this – that elections are a symbol of democracy."
"The President then warned that ‘if this [right] is restricted, it’s a threat to the nation and the system’."
"His message to the conservative forces in the Islamic republic is unmistakable."
"Their repressive actions are destabilising both State and society."
"Public bitterness is already great and will only increase."
"What is the lesson that the European Parliament should draw from these unfair elections for the Iranian parliament, the Majlis?"
"If it turns out that the vast majority of the new Majlis consists of arch-conservative, even radical Islamists, we should not set any store by close relations."
"‘A sheer waste of taxes,’ a German Iran specialist, who is also a voter, commented to me an hour ago."
"I think that this is spot on."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when a delegation from our parliamentary group recently visited Iran, we were actually surprised at the degree of discussion that took place there as well as at the willingness to engage in dialogue which was shown by the many young women who constitute the majority of the student population in Iran."
"Yes, the majority of university and college students are women."
"It is probably this very situation that prompted the Council of Guardians to curb and nullify the potential effects of what we, from our perspective, see as an encouraging development."
"If we talk today about the elections in Iran, it would be quite legitimate for anyone to say that Iran should take its own decision and to ask why we are interfering."
"I would say yes, Iran – that is to say the population of Iran – should decide for itself."
"That, however, is precisely what the Council of Guardians wants to prevent."
"It is not a matter of reformers or non-reformers."
"If the non-reformers are elected, we shall have to live with that."
"The point is that the Council of Guardians operates a selection process from the outset to determine who is allowed to stand for election, and it is this very selection process that prevents the Iranian people from deciding freely."
"Such elections cannot produce a truly legitimate freely elected Parliament because of the way in which candidates are preselected."
"We in the European Union have no option but to press for the most important changes that are needed in Iran, whatever happens at the polls."
"I am thinking here of the death penalty."
"The present moratorium on stoning, a particularly barbaric form of execution, must be scrupulously observed and even enshrined in a legal instrument."
"I am thinking of the ratification of the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which will probably be a matter for the new Parliament."
"Whoever is elected, we must press a clear case for ratification."
"I am also thinking of the situation in the Middle East, where we need Iranian support."
"Let there be no shortage of criticism – unsparing criticism – of these conditions in Iran."
"At the same time, the Commission will no doubt also have to work to ensure that all the main aspects of Iranian conduct in the Middle East are conducive to peace in the region."
"Be that as it may, the fact remains that we cannot but roundly condemn the approach adopted by the Council of Guardians."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also took part in the visit to Iran."
"I am thankful that Iran is seeking dialogue and cooperation."
"It has made us Europeans an offer, which came from the Supreme National Security Council, for the creation of a joint commission to engage in a bilateral Euro-Iranian dialogue centred on the fight against drugs."
"At the present time, Iran has about two million drug addicts, along with some eight million occasional drug users."
"These are very high numbers in a country with a population of 60 million."
"The bulk of drugs leaving the region currently goes to America, but we can expect Europe to be targeted soon for a massive wave of drug smuggling."
"This is why I am particularly grateful that the head of the Supreme National Security Council has made an offer to the European Union to work with him and his organisation to stop this flow of drugs from the war lords in Afghanistan."
"The second offer, for another bilateral commission which would engage in a joint effort to combat terrorism, is one which, in my view, we should not refuse, likewise the offer made by the judiciary to cooperate with the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg in order to accelerate the training of Iranian judges in this field as well as simply to show them the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems."
"This should be put at the heart of our bilateral relations."
"Similarly, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the promotion of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises in Iran and those in the European Union, is a means of strengthening democracy."
"I believe that the business contacts in this domain could point the way to more fruitful cooperation in the domain of dialogue and democracy."
"Another point of particular importance to Europe, of course, is partnership in the domain of energy."
"Security of energy supplies is the issue of the future."
"Mr President, Iran is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in a state of deep political crisis, with thousands of progressive candidates having been excluded from the imminent elections and with millions of Iranians who voted in favour of the reforms wondering where the country is heading."
"The extent of the exclusions also includes numerous important women who played a leading part in the legislative reforms and, as a result, the position of women is further deteriorating in Iran."
"These are women with whom we have cooperated constructively within the framework of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights."
"Elections are a symbol of democracy only when they are conducted properly, to quote President Khatami."
"Nonetheless, it would appear that above President Khatami and the democratically elected representatives of the people stands the all powerful Revolutionary Council, which is endeavouring to deprive the parliament which will come out of the elections on 20 February of any democratic voice or powers of reform."
"It is known that of all the bills voted for by parliament in 2000, over one-third were not ratified by the Council."
"It is a fact that Iran, a country with a long history and an important geopolitical position, can play a strategic role in the stability of the area, especially in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan."
"However, I fear that efforts by the hard core to bend the will of the Iranian people may result not only in a parliament which has no democratic legitimacy, but also in the weakening of Iran's international position."
"Without doubt, Iran's basic problem is its power structure."
"No reform efforts and no progress with respect for human rights can be made while the Islamic Revolutionary Guards show disdain for the decisions taken under democratic procedures."
"The recent moratorium on stoning must be converted to legislation which will put an end to this horrific punishment."
"And I should like to take this opportunity to add something else."
"I hope that Iran will include women in the teams which it sends to Athens to represent it at the 2004 Olympic Games."
"Mr President, I am incredibly disappointed with the joint motion for a resolution."
"It should be crystal clear that President Khatami’s decision to call a general election in February has crushed any hope of his intending to implement reforms in Iran."
"In Iran, the critical dialogue has clearly been interpreted in such a way as to convey the impression that we in the EU are now better placed to understand and accept their oppressive regime."
"When will the EU realise that this dialogue is a farce?"
"Is there nothing being done by the hierocracy in Iran that can make us take seriously our own much trumpeted values of democracy and human rights and, let it be said, act in accordance with them?"
"What, moreover, do we do on the day that Iran’s mullahs export their regime to Iraq?"
"The EU should now support those forces that really want to see a pluralist and democratic Iran."
"At the moment, it is the resistance movements, for example the Mujahedin, that, in order to please the Iranian Government, the United States and the EU have added to their list of terrorists, even though they have never attacked civilians."
"As a first step, the EU should ensure that members of the Mujahedin are not handed over to Iran and certain death, and it should, as quickly as possible, see to it that they are removed from the EU’s list of terrorists and support their demand for a referendum in Iran."
"Mr President, anyone with an interest in democracy is seriously concerned about the recent political developments in Iran."
"There is the risk that the banning of reform-minded MPs from fighting the elections will result in a huge abstention rate, particularly among young people."
"This is the only way for them to express their disillusionment."
"They fear more than ever that they will become victims of the backward-oriented forces."
"The constant flagrant undermining of the reform-minded forces constitutes a threat to a new revolutionary movement."
"Furthermore, Iran is running the risk of further isolating itself at international level."
"This is particularly worrying with regard to the conflicts in the Middle East region."
"Given its location, Iran is making the Middle East more vulnerable than ever."
"In the short term, the European Union should bring all diplomatic channels to bear in an attempt to induce the regime in Iran to reconsider the exclusion of reform-minded MPs from the elections."
"This should be made a condition for giving the existing cooperation between the European Union and Iran new impetus in areas of mutual interest."
"Apart from that, the European Union should lose no time in developing new initiatives aimed at cutting off the drug route between Iran and Europe."
"Mr President, Iran is a great country with a glorious past."
"I also believe it to be one of the most sophisticated Middle Eastern societies, with an inherent tendency towards progress and modernity."
"Perhaps its fundamentalist Islamic revolution will be seen, with the passage of time, as a blip in the curve of its traditionally long historic record of advancement."
"It is precisely for this reason that at this critical juncture of the ongoing power struggle, the EU must maintain open supportive dialogue with both the government and the reformists, and in particular with the modernisers within the government."
"We have already seen the welcome suspension of the barbaric medieval punishment of female lapidation for adultery, and Iran has now agreed to sign the NPT Additional Protocol to put a stop to its covert nuclear weapons programme, now fully out in the open after the confessions of Abdul Qadeer Khan in Pakistan."
"Ultimately, democracy too will prevail and the mullahs of the Council of Guardians will hopefully return to their intended spiritual and pastoral role."
"Mr President, surely no one can be in any doubt that the illusion of democracy in Iran is dead and that only a complete overhaul of the political system will one day enable democracy in Iran to flourish again."
"At this juncture I should like to join with Mrs Sandbæk in calling for dialogue to take place with the opposition, and not with the religious hierarchy, with those who head the criminal regime that oppresses Iran. Most urgently, the Mujahedin currently in Iraq should be removed from the terrorist list and should not be extradited to Iran."
"It is through dialogue with those who genuinely want democracy, with secular forces, that we will be able to see the situation change towards democracy in this most important of countries, as all those here recognise."
"Mr President, the Islamic Council of Guardians operates as an unelected organisation consisting of Islamic theologians whose task it is, in accordance with Islamic principles, to preserve the heritage of the revolution of 25 years ago."
"The issue is that of whether this Council of Guardians does not instead discredit religion in itself, the role of priests and theologians in society and what is, in this case, the entirely dominant religion, namely Shi’ite Islam."
"These are the consequences for the Islamic revolution in Iran of the activities of the Council of Guardians, of the legislation they have promoted and of other legislation they have prevented."
"We Europeans and members of the European Union must state that, if people have the right to vote, they should have the right to stand as candidates."
"It is completely unacceptable for theologians to be able to prohibit people from both voting and standing as candidates."
"Mr President, Iran makes us face up to our own contradictions."
"It is undoubtedly, as Mr Tannock has said, a great country with a prestigious past."
"It is also a potentially rich country, which has oil, and it has shown its willingness to return to the international fold by abandoning its military nuclear programme and adopting a moratorium on the death penalty."
"Iran is strategically important because it has a border with Afghanistan and another with Iraq."
"In short, Iran is essential to us and yet, within a month, it has destroyed our hopes of seeing it make progress in terms of democracy."
"On the eve of the country’s parliamentary elections, the conservatives’ coup d’état is succeeding."
"Only fifteen of the reformist parliamentary candidates who were disqualified have been reinstated by the Revolutionary Council."
"The provincial governors who had threatened to resign will not do so."
"President Khatami will not resign."
"The students will not protest and the EU Member States, sensing a change in the wind, will not declare themselves to be frankly hostile to neo-conservatives who, they think, will distance themselves from religious fundamentalism."
"The result is that complete hypocrisy reigns."
"I ask you, Commissioner, are we too going to close our eyes, in the name of economic and geopolitical interests, to this serious attack on human rights which is shattering the hopes of so many Iranian men and women, and what will be our attitude as regards the cooperation agreement?"
". Mr President, I am sure that most Members of Parliament would agree that it is crucial to try to develop a long-term and constructive relationship between the European Union and Iran."
"Why?"
"First, as Mr Tannock said, Iran is a great pre-Islamic civilisation; one in which we in the West have occasionally meddled in ways that were not always – to put it mildly – very well judged."
"Second, Iran is an enormously important regional player."
"One only has to look at its neighbourhood to see how important it is and to recognise that we cannot have a credible policy for the wider Middle East that does not embrace and include Iran."
"Thirdly – and I feel this very strongly – we see in Iran, in my judgment, the first stirrings of genuine Islamic democracy."
"Indeed, for the hard-line conservatives, that is the problem."
"I happen to think that demography is strongly on the side of democracy in Iran."
"However, the theologians, who are seeking to block progress, are not the first theologians we have seen – even in our own European experience – who have not been wholly in favour of democracy and the advancement of civil liberties."
"I will come back to that later."
"Because of the significance of Iran, I have favoured – as the European Union has favoured – a constructive, tough-minded engagement with that country."
"That has taken a number of forms."
"We have tried to develop a political dialogue, which most recently has focused on our understandable concerns about whether Iran's nuclear ambitions for energy have turned into nuclear ambitions for military purposes."
"We were concerned by the IAEA reports last summer and autumn."
"We are pleased at the progress that has been made following the visit of the three European Union foreign ministers to Tehran, but we will now be watching for Dr El Baradei's next report, for discussions in Vienna and for a clear commitment by Iran to meet the undertakings that it gave in Tehran when European foreign ministers visited."
"We also hope that we can develop a dialogue about terrorism, as well as weapons of mass destruction, and about the peace process in the Middle East."
"We have established a dialogue on human rights, which is an extremely important aspect of our relationship with Iran."
"It is fair to say that we have seen progress in some areas, allowing thematic rapporteurs into Iran."
"Some of the – frankly barbaric – punishments that have been carried out appear to have been stopped for the time being."
"Someone said during the debate that we should talk to the judges and others: I have."
"I felt that, in talking to some, I had been transported back several centuries, in order to take part in the discussions."
"However, it is important that we have these discussions and have them on a frank basis."
"We say to those that we talk to in Iran that a human rights dialogue is not simply an alternative to doing something about human rights."
"So we want to see our dialogue leading to progress in that area."
"We have also talked to the Iranian Government about trade and investment and economic issues."
"We have had a number of rounds of negotiations towards a trade and cooperation agreement – a fairly basic most-favoured nation agreement."
"We had not had any discussions for a while."
"That sort of agreement is important to Iran, not least because of the number of young people coming on to the job market every year and the requirement on the part of the Iranians to attract more foreign investment in order to create the jobs and the economic development which is needed to deal with that demographic pressure."
"The Iranians know perfectly well that all those issues – political, nuclear, trade and human rights – are umbilically linked."
"We cannot simply ignore problems in one area and think that we can move forward rapidly in all the others."
"I repeat that I am in favour of engagement, but engagement should not be regarded as a sort of cop-out for acting responsibly in these areas which matter so much to Parliament and to the Union and beyond."
"It is in that context that I just want to say this about democracy: we have obviously been pleased that the democrats and the moderates have done so well in recent years."
"We are a little disappointed that, despite that, they have been unable to make more progress in government, partly because so much of what they wanted to do has been blocked by the conservative clerics, by the Guardian Council."
"That has led to some disillusionment on the part of the public, which led in turn to a low turnout in the elections and a less satisfactory result for the democrats than they might otherwise have achieved."
"I am in no doubt that what we are seeing at the moment is an attempt by the conservative clerics to distort the electoral process."
"Why are they trying to do that?"
"They are not trying to distort the electoral process because they think they are going to do well, but because they think that, unless they do so, the moderates, the reformers and the genuine democrats will do well."
"It is an attempt to thwart that democratic impulse in Iran that we are seeing at the moment."
"I have to say – and I hope this does not sound too much like the leader of a Boy Scout troop – that you cannot halt the democratic process in Iran indefinitely."
"It is like trying to stop the tide coming in."
"So I hope the conservatives will realise that and that Iran is best served by allowing people greater participation in the government of their own country."
"If we see genuine democracy rather than the Potemkin variety of democracy, that will be one of the best ways of underpinning a relationship between Europe and Iran, which all of us should wish to see."
"I repeat that if we are serious about a creative and constructive policy for the wider Middle East, it has to involve Iran."
"It is no good condemning Iran out of hand and regarding it as being led by Manichean forces of wickedness and darkness."
"We have to be constructive and encourage the genuine democrats, who many of us have met and we have been impressed by their bravery."
"I hope that in the course of the next months and years we will see Iran making the difficult transition to an Islamic democracy which can play a constructive leadership role in the affairs of its region."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"– B5-0095/2004 by Mr Thomas Mann, Mr Nassauer and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on political assassinations in Cambodia;"
"– B5-0082/2004 by Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Cambodia;"
"– B5-0079/2004 by Mr Watson and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on political assassinations in Cambodia;"
"– B5-0097/2004 by Mrs Isler Béguin, Mrs McKenna and Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Cambodia;"
"– B5-0085/2004 by Mr Herman Schmid and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Cambodia."
"Mr President, over the past few weeks, three politicians from the Sam Rainsy party have been murdered."
"Chea Vichea, a founder member of the party and president of the free trade unions, was shot on 22 January."
"He is the latest victim in a long series of killings."
"The absence of retribution for political assassinations is tantamount to an invitation to commit further atrocities."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats utterly condemns these assassinations but also condemns the slowness of criminal investigations."
"Cambodia needs vigorous political leadership."
"Its leaders must enact reforms that put an end to the continual violations of human rights."
"I also refer in this context to the country’s record on child prostitution and forced labour."
"For some time now there has been an agreement between the Cambodian Government and the United Nations on the establishment of a war-crimes tribunal."
"All that stands in the way of its creation is the ratification of the agreement by the Cambodian Parliament, and that must be done without delay."
"We therefore call for a UN delegation to be sent to Cambodia."
"We must help, and we want to help, so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cambodia, I am sorry to say, is certainly not making progress."
"In the elections the Cambodian population showed greater political and democratic maturity than was demonstrated by the country’s leading political forces."
"And incidentally, Mr Mann, not only politicians from the Sam-Rainsy party are being shot dead in the streets; my research has revealed that three members of the governing Funcinpec party have met with the same fate."
"In other words, rather rough customs prevail, and the normal rules of etiquette for dealings between Government and Opposition are not observed, which means that anyone who has made himself unpopular for whatever reason is in grave danger."
"It is, in fact, the case that impunity continues to act as an incentive to eliminate unpopular politicians, whatever their origins, because the assassins do not have to face the consequence of their actions."
"Public trust in politics has been seriously damaged."
"Even on the odd occasion when a person is charged, nobody normally believes that he is the real murderer."
"As well as having a huge impact on morale in the country, this situation also severely restricts the flow of international aid."
"The Asian Development Bank does not intend to resume its payments unless the new Parliament, which was, of course, elected some time ago, is convened soon and a new government is formed."
"This is actually the crux of the problem, and influence must be exerted to change the situation."
"At the time of the peace process, the UN specified that a two-thirds majority was required for a party or coalition of parties to form a government."
"Parties are now unwilling to assemble the broad coalitions that would fulfil this requirement."
"In practice, it has become a barrier to normal political life in Cambodia."
"This is where influence must be exerted to create political conditions that are truly conducive to improvement."
"This is the spirit in which the planned delegation should conduct its talks."
"Mr President, political murder is a heinous crime in darkness: it is even more chilling in daylight."
"Mr Chea Vichea, trade unionist and member of the Cambodian opposition, was shot and killed on January 22, beside the road in Phnom Penh, in the middle of the day."
"So brazen was his killer, that passers-by mistook the bullets for firecrackers."
"Mr Vichea is the fifth member of the opposition Alliance of Democrats to have been murdered in 2004, and the latest victim of a year of violence."
"His funeral brought into the streets a crowd estimated at 30 000 strong."
"I know why, having met Mr Vichea last April and been deeply impressed by his commitment to democracy and good government and improving the lives of his fellow citizens."
"Mr Vichea was a founding member of the Sam Rainsy Party."
"He was a committed advocate of the rights of Cambodia's 200 000 garment workers."
"His killing, along with that of activists from the Funcinpec party, adds to a temper of political intimidation in Cambodia that is worsened by the failure of the caretaker government to respond to these murders."
"Whether the Cambodian People's Party is responsible for these killings or not, its persistent failure to apprehend and punish the killers leaves it accountable for the rising tide of fear in Cambodian politics."
"Hun Sen's government continues to rule Cambodia without full legal and constitutional authority."
"It is imperative that a negotiated settlement be reached to enable legitimate government, yet negotiations cannot take place in the shadow of political murder, which sours attempts to construct a viable coalition and threatens to provoke retaliatory violence."
"The European Parliament must condemn not only this killing, but also the climate of intimidation and impunity that Cambodian authorities allow to persist."
"Our resolution calls for the suspension of all non-humanitarian aid to Cambodia and for the European Commission to refuse to deal with Hun Sen's government."
"The EU should not do business with a government that fails to safeguard the lives of democratic leaders."
"In conclusion, we call on the Council to issue strong words of condemnation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in its misfortune, Cambodia is once again crying out for help, but the echo of the distress of its people and of its associative and democratic militants reaches us only from beyond the grave."
"This is now the case with regard to Chea Vichea, the President of Cambodia’s Free Trade Union of Workers and a founding member of the Sam Rangsi party, for whom the main contribution of the European Union will be to salute his memory after his death."
"However, this trade union leader strove to defend the rights of more than 38 000 of those modern slaves of globalisation working in the textile industries of South-East Asia."
"The fact that the police or the Cambodian Government did not take action when threats were made against him is understandable, in the light of the collapse of the rule of law and of democracy in Cambodia."
"The fact that the integrity of such leaders of civil, trade-union or political society is not safeguarded by anything more than the dialogue between the European Union and that region of Asia which is going through severe political crisis is something that we should regard as a challenge."
"Is it really necessary to point out here that the assassination of Chea Vichea is merely the latest in a series of violent crimes against opposition figures and that 2003 was the most violent year since 1998?"
"Is it necessary to add that none of these crimes has been the subject of any court judgment and that the perpetrators have consequently never been convicted."
"Against such a background, how can we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the despotic rule of the Khmer Rouge, when the martyred people of Cambodia are still experiencing such violence and terror?"
"The credibility of our European Union at international level and the emphasis it places on international law and democracy versus the use of force and makes it imperative that we should bring together the Cambodian political leaders and make them aware of the urgent need for political and economic reform and ensure that they face up to their responsibilities with regard to the fundamental rights of their citizens."
"The Cambodian Parliament must take up its duties again, and a serious agreement must be ratified, not a compromise which looks more like a masquerade between the UN and the Government, with a view to creating a special tribunal with responsibility for judging the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge."
"This is a project, incidentally, which has already been in preparation for five long years."
"I would also like to point out, Mr President, that it is essential to put an end to the unacceptable, intolerable forced labour involving children, whether it is the children working on the Phnom Penh garbage dump, of whom we are all well aware, or those who are sold into prostitution, or those who are the victims of trafficking in human beings, thereby feeding one of the most vile of all networks."
"Although it is a matter of urgency, Mr President, that an ad hoc European delegation be sent to Cambodia as an initial measure, we must not forget that the fundamental duty of the European Union is to continue to provide permanent and voluntary assistance to Phnom Penh, side by side with all the people involved."
"Mr President, in the killing fields of Cambodia the Khmer Rouge murdered millions of their own people, and now the country is struggling to find stability and equilibrium."
"It is balanced between the King and the political parties, there is a degree of balance between the parties – sometimes more, sometimes less – and the country is also trying to maintain a balance between various outside influences."
"A constant balancing act is, however, no recipe for long-term stability, which cannot be achieved unless the rule of law is firmly established."
"This is why paragraphs 4 and 6 of the resolution are of paramount importance."
"Straightforward prosecution, by due process, of the murderers and assassins who are threatening the very existence of democracy, and above all the long-overdue creation, together with the United Nations, of a special criminal court with a view to enabling Cambodian and international lawyers to work together in order to ensure that those who have committed crimes against humanity can finally be brought to justice and duly punished: in this way, after a bloody and turbulent past, the country can at long last find stability, underpinned by the rule of law, which will enable it to become an important partner of our European Union."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the Commission for holding firm."
"I believe that since the elections in Cambodia the European Union, via the Commission in particular, has shown itself capable of taking a stand."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the situation is now extremely delicate and I agree with Mr Watson’s analysis."
"Although we do not know whether Mr Hun Sen and his party gave the orders for the enormous number of crimes which have been committed, we know that they have done nothing – neither they nor Mr Hun Sen’s Government – to arrest even one of the perpetrators of these crimes."
"We also know that the Cambodia of today is no richer than the Cambodia of ten years ago, and that for ten years the European Union and the international community have poured millions and millions of euros into the country."
"Knowing all this, therefore, we should perhaps draw some conclusions from it."
"The person who has been unable to act as Head of Government in order to prevent crimes, to arrest the guilty parties and to bring even a minimum level of wealth to Cambodia is called Mr Hun Sen."
"I believe that if the Commission were to ask the Council to create a mandate to go and discuss the matter with the Americans, the Australians and the Japanese, with a view to making the removal of Mr Hun Sen the condition for the resumption of loans from the Asiatic Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it would be possible to demonstrate, and to make the Vietnamese and the Chinese understand, as they already have done to a large extent, I think, that the problem of change in Cambodia can only be solved by the removal of Mr Hun Sen and the granting of a mandate to another member of his party, which did, after all, win the election, even if that election was not entirely democratic, indeed, far from it."
". Mr President, I will be very brief because any sentiments I express will largely echo the remarks that have been made with some passion and knowledge of the country by Members who have already spoken."
"I was very interested to go back and re-read the report of the European Union's election observation mission to the Cambodian national elections in July last year."
"In passing, let me say once again what an exceptionally important role these election observations missions play in the development of democracy around the world."
"The report noted that, compared with previous elections, the atmosphere was less tense and there were fewer violent incidents – although such incidents did occur."
"Concerns remained during the pre-election period over the number of alleged political killings."
"As Mr Watson said, we have seen the killing of a number of those associated with Prince Norodom's party and we saw most recently the appalling assassination of Chea Vichea."
"I wholly endorse what has been said about the importance of his political role as one of the founder members of the Sam Rainsy Party and the importance of his role as a noted and brave trade union leader."
"I strongly condemn that assassination."
"I wholly support Parliament's call for a thorough investigation and for the prosecution of the perpetrators in accordance with the due process of law."
"I would also like to take this opportunity once again to call on all political parties in Cambodia to continue to pursue negotiations which could lead to the swift formation of a new government."
"We all want to see the formation of such a government as rapidly as possible."
"Parliament rightly continues to take an active interest in the affairs of Cambodia and I will ensure that this interest is reflected in what I say to Council and in the work of the Commission."
"Thank you, Mr Patten."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"– B5-0096/2004 by Mr Thomas Mann and Mr Zacharakis, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Greek seamen held in Karachi;"
"– B5-0081/2004 by Mr Katiforis and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the Greek seamen in Karachi;"
"– B5-0078/2004 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the and its crew;"
"– B5-0086/2004 by Mr Alavanos, Mr Bakopoulos and Mr Korakas, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Greek seamen held in Karachi;"
"– B5-0087/2004 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Greek seamen held in Karachi."
"Mr President, I should like to express my perplexity and, at the same time, my anger about the situation which we have before us concerning the four Greek and three Filipino seamen from the tanker the ."
"This tanker ran aground last summer outside the port of Karachi in Pakistan as the result of an error on the part of the Pakistani pilot, who was steering it into port."
"The sea levels were very low because the tide was out, the mistake was made on the part of the Pakistani authorities and we had a dramatic incident."
"Of course, tonnes of oil were spilt into the sea but, from that point on, the way the Pakistani authorities acted was incomprehensible."
"The sole and only victims of this unfortunate incident were the Greek and Filipino seamen."
"The matter was not dealt with globally in order to see what were the responsibilities of the company, of the Pakistani pilot and so on. All the blame was laid at the feet of the Greek and Filipino seamen, who are receiving unacceptable treatment in prison and one of whom attempted the other day to commit suicide."
"Apart from that, we had something else: the head of the salvage team, a Greek seaman, also went to help and he too is being held by the Pakistani authorities as we speak."
"This situation is, without any doubt, tragic."
"I personally have met the families of the seamen, who are honestly in a state of despair, and that is why Parliament must react and, I believe, it will react, because this is first and foremost a humanitarian issue."
"Mr President, in addition to what Mr Hatzidakis said, there is a relatively recent report on the circumstances surrounding the accident involving the tanker by the relevant ministry in Pakistan, which does not contain any, even rudimentary evidence that could be used to substantiate charges against the seamen."
"Similarly, the ship's insurers submitted proposals for compensation a long time ago but have not received any official reply from the Pakistani authorities, and yet they have spent over USD 20 million on this accident, for transportation of the shipwreck and so on."
"We know that the European Union Troika with Commissioner Patten is going to Islamabad next week, on the 18th of the month, and that they have managed to get this issue placed at the top of the agenda on relations between the European Union and Pakistan."
"We hope that there will be results from this discussion, which for a long time now has been plaguing our feelings and our thoughts, mainly of innocent people struggling to make a living at sea."
"We note that interventions have been made on the part of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by Georgos Papandreou as minister for foreign affairs and by the deputy minister, without any substantial response from their counterpart in Pakistan."
"This is a terrible situation."
"In addition to what Mr Hatzidakis said about the Greek seaman who tried to commit suicide, there is the following tragicomic or sad fact: attempted suicide is a criminal offence there."
"So now this shadow of a man is on trial because he attempted to commit suicide."
"We hope that suicide will not also be a criminal offence when it is committed."
"With such conduct, how do you suppose any qualified young man will turn to the seafaring profession? Who, ultimately, will protect the lives of seafarers and the marine environment in the future?"
"We are calling for humanity, logic and legality to prevail at long last in this affair and we are depending on the efforts of Commissioner Patten next week in Islamabad."
"Mr President, I too should like to add a few things on behalf of the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece and the whole Confederal Group of the European United Left who, with other groups, have signed and are supporting the joint motion calling for the immediate release of the members of the crew of the ,who have been held illegally in Karachi by the Pakistani authorities since July 2003."
"This is a clear case of hostage taking for financial gain."
"It is telling that the engineer, Mr Pappas, who arrived in Karachi 20 days after the ship had run aground as head of the salvage operation, which was a success, is being held together with the crew."
"It is inconceivable that the entire crew should be held on the grounds of the ecological disaster caused when the ship ran aground at the entrance to the port of Karachi and for even the ship's cook to be held to account."
"Besides, the ship ran aground when it was under the responsibility of the port authorities of the local pilot."
"The situation is particularly worrying for the health of the detained seamen who, without having any responsibility, have been prohibited from returning home, a state of affairs which has even led to a suicide attempt."
"We must again emphasise that these unacceptable tactics, which are used by numerous governments and which benefit shipowners and insurance companies, that is, using seamen as scapegoats in order to resolve financial disputes and to apportion them responsibility, which they do not have, for whatever happens at sea, cannot continue."
"We call on the European Commission and the Presidency and the Greek Government to intervene decisively and demand the immediate release of the seamen being held in Karachi."
"They must not be held hostage any longer."
"Mr President, for eight months now, Greek and Filipino sailors have been held by the Pakistani authorities."
"Their tanker ran aground outside the port of Karachi, causing the greatest environmental disaster in the history of Pakistan."
"Thirty thousand tonnes of crude oil spilled into the sea, contaminating the coastline and destroying the livelihood of fishermen."
"In the view of the Pakistani Government, the disaster was caused by incompetence and negligence on the part of the crew."
"As Mr Hatzidakis and the previous speakers have pointed out, however, the tanker was incontestably under the command of a local pilot at the time of the accident."
"There can therefore be no clear-cut apportionment of guilt."
"The Pakistani Ambassador has informed me that judicial proceedings will shortly be instituted against the sailors."
"Shortly?"
"According to media reports, they have been under house arrest since October 2003 and are not allowed to leave Pakistan."
"Government sources have assured me that the sailors have unrestricted freedom of movement within the country."
"That will have to be verified."
"International law actually covers unresolved compensation issues."
"In the domain of oil pollution there is an International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, to which 124 nations have now acceded."
"I hope that Pakistan will soon do likewise."
"On both humanitarian and legal grounds, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appeals to the Pakistani Government to allow the crew members to return to their homes and families, subject to a pledge to return to Pakistan when the judicial proceedings take place."
"Such pledges are made on word of honour and must be redeemed."
". Mr President, let us be clear, this is a most regrettable business."
"It would be most unfortunate if the Pakistani authorities were to believe that they could resolve the case by detaining the crew."
"As the honourable Member said earlier, next week the EU Troika will be visiting Islamabad and I will once again appeal to the Pakistani authorities to release the crew on humanitarian grounds, in line with a guarantee that I understand has been given by the Greek Government to ensure that the crew would cooperate in any investigation that subsequently takes place."
"That seems to be a sensible way to proceed and I do not know what further the Pakistani authorities can expect from the Greek Government."
"The Commission would recommend arbitration according to internationally established standards along the lines of the 1992 Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage."
"We encourage Pakistan to discuss the advantages of ratifying the convention with officials of the International Maritime Organisation."
"In the meantime, it would be constructive to settle compensation claims in line with the convention's regulations, as though Pakistan was already party to the convention."
"That is what the insurers have proposed."
"I have already raised the issue with the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Mr Kasuri, during his visit to Brussels on 5 November 2003."
"Heads of our European Union Missions in Islamabad have discussed the issue on several occasions with the Pakistani authorities, including Mr Kasuri."
"As referred to earlier, I and the Foreign Ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands have agreed that during our visit Pakistan on 18 February we would raise the issue again if the situation remained unchanged."
"It would obviously be admirable if things could be sorted out even before next week."
"I repeat, this deplorable situation has gone on for far too long."
"The sooner it is resolved the better, and our sympathy goes out to the families of the crewmen and to the crewmen themselves, who have been detained in these circumstances for so long."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions.(1)"
"(1)"
"Mr President, I believe it is paragraph 5 of the resolution which states that observation of the elections did not take place because of the refusal of the Iranian authorities."
"That requires correction in so far as the request was also made by Parliament."
"It should therefore be worded in slightly more neutral terms, in that ‘the authorities’ should be replaced by ‘the Iranian side’."
"May I request that correction."
"It is merely a matter of factual clarification."
"(2)"
"– Mr President, I only wish to move amendments to recitals D and F. In D and again in paragraph 7, it should be political figures rather than opposition members, since three of the five assassination victims belonged to a governing party."
"And then the date in recital F should be 7 January instead of 4 February."
"These are technical rather than substantive amendments."
"Mr President, my Group has no problem with the second of those amendments, but we feel that the first weakens the text and therefore we object to it."
"(3)"
"Mr President, this is also just a small technical amendment, but I do consider it important, because it is, after all, about people in custody."
"The text refers to Greek and Filipino sailors, but the title refers only to Greek sailors."
"I believe we agree that the Filipinos should be released too."
"For this reason, I move that the title be amended accordingly."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 12 February 2004.(1)"
"By letter of 24 February 2004, the President of the Catalonian Parliament informed us that Mr Joan Colom i Naval has been appointed a member of the Catalonian Court of Auditors."
"Mr Colom i Naval, I congratulate you on this appointment and, pursuant to Rule 8(4) of the Rules of Procedure, inform the House that Mr Colom i Naval's mandate as a Member of the European Parliament – in long and good standing, I might add – officially terminates tomorrow, 26 February 2004."
"So, Joan serves his last day here, and will carry from this House our respect and our best wishes."
"By letter of 19 February 2004, the Belgian authorities informed me that Mrs Frédérique Ries has been appointed a member of the Belgian Government."
"Again, let me – in this case in her absence – congratulate Mrs Ries on this appointment and note, pursuant to Rule 8(4), that her mandate as a Member of the European Parliament has terminated and that a vacancy exists as of 12 February 2004."
"In the same letter, the Belgian authorities informed me that Mrs Ries had been replaced by Mrs Jacqueline Rousseaux with effect from 19 February 2004."
"I welcome our new colleague and remind Members that credentials must be verified in line with the appropriate procedures.(1)"
"Mr President, I just wanted to draw the attention of the House to a major seminar that has been held in Dublin over the last two days on the subject of HIV/AIDS."
"I would also like to draw to the attention of the Commission what emerged during that conference, particularly that the growth in the incidence of AIDS has been so horrific that it has been considered worse than the spread of the Black Death in the 14th century."
"I hope very much that colleagues – not only within this session of the Parliament but also in the next Parliament – will recognise the serious, catastrophic and deadly problem we are facing."
"I hope, too, Mr President, that as you were present in Dublin, we will see some continuity from that conference."
"The conference you mentioned, Mrs Banotti, adopted a declaration."
"At the next Conference of Presidents, I propose to give a copy of that declaration to the Group leaders and also to give a brief account of my own sense of the meeting on HIV/AIDS, which indeed imposes a duty of care on this institution and on the European Community in general."
"Mr President, I draw attention to the fact that in a recent Eurobarometer poll European voters identified the subject of immigration among the top four issues for the forthcoming election campaign."
"We have a situation in which Member States in the last five years have so far failed in their Treaty obligation to establish a common asylum and immigration policy offering a reassurance of orderly control of asylum and immigration, a level playing field and responsibility-sharing."
"They have made a complete mess of free movement from the new Member States and in some Member States – such as my own – there has been complete hysteria from the popular press; there is a worrying rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia; passions have been inflamed by the proposed ban in France on the wearing of headscarves, and so on."
"We therefore face quite a dangerous situation."
"Mr President, when you meet the heads of government at the forthcoming summit, would you ask them to do everything in their power to ensure that the subjects of immigration, asylum and the integration of immigrant communities are handled with sensitivity and tact so that we ensure that there is no extremist success at the forthcoming elections?"
"I take note of that suggestion."
"Mr President, I returned just this weekend from a visit to the West Bank."
"I had been there on a fact-finding trip with a number of other Members of this House to get some information about the so-called security barrier and I was shocked by the sights that met me there."
"This is not a barrier which is being built on the border between Israel and the West Bank; it is a barrier that has been built around the towns and villages of the Palestinian people."
"They are literally being walled in with no-man's-lands and permit-only exit and access, controlled by the Israeli defence forces."
"This is a recipe for continued destabilisation of the Israeli state; it is not a security solution."
"I would appeal to you, Mr President, to convey my message – and perhaps the message of many others in this House – to the Council and to the Commission that in the International Court in The Hague we must come off the fence."
"We cannot be neutral with regard to the legality of the location of this barrier."
"I do not deny the Israeli state the right to build a barrier anywhere it likes on its own territory, but the Court must come down heavily against the legality of this particular barrier, which is imprisoning, criminalising and dehumanising the Palestinian people."
"– Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention, and to that of this House, something I regard as a very sad situation in Slovakia, our neighbour and soon to be a Member State."
"It would appear from television reports that the government has cut social security benefits for the Roma, which has prompted many women and mothers – and, appallingly enough, their children as well – to loot food shops in order to get food."
"I do not in the least want it to be thought that I approve of violence in any form, but the Roma must be in a truly tragic predicament, and I would ask you, Mr President, to seek information and an explanation of this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, the Commission granted non-European wine producers – in South Africa, Australia and the USA – authorisation to use three denominations of Port wine: Tawny, Ruby and Vintage."
"This decision by the Commission has provoked a furious reaction in the Port wine defined region, the oldest wine region in Europe, and will have a devastating impact on the legitimate interests of Port wine producers."
"This is a disgraceful decision, one to which we object in the strongest possible terms."
"This is not just a matter of economics; it is both highly sensitive and a cultural issue."
"The EU must support Port wine, its authenticity and the trademarks that it has acquired."
"I would ask the Commission to make note of Mr Lage's comment."
"Mr President, it is the comments of my esteemed colleague, Mrs Ludford, that cause me too to request the floor."
"I entirely agree with her that we face a very unpleasant situation in which we are in danger of seeing the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament characterised by a fear of foreigners and a hostility towards them."
"I therefore wish to propose perhaps attempting to take action at this early stage."
"I am not normally one to propose new expenditure, nor am I normally one to propose that Parliament print glossy brochures extolling its own virtues, but I should like to make an exception in this case."
"Kofi Annan made an outstanding speech to us recently, and I would ask that this speech be printed, that it be printed in all the languages and that it be published in a presentable edition so that we can use it in the election campaign."
"I think he made a fantastic contribution to this debate and issued an extremely necessary challenge to all the European peoples."
"Nearly everybody clapped – for the speech at least."
"That, then, is what I would call for."
"That is a very good point."
"The speech is certainly being translated into the languages of the current 15 Member States and I will ensure it is also translated into the languages of the accession countries."
"I will also see if it is possible for our information services to distribute the speech through the mass media to reach a wider public than has thus far had access to it."
"– Mr President, I wish to bring to your attention a written statement by Mr Glyn Ford, a Member of this House, in which he urges the boycotting of the products of a company in the European Union."
"I would also like this statement to be forwarded to the Council, the Commission and the Member States."
"I would ask you to call upon the Legal Service to make a statement as to whether this is in any way permissible."
"In Germany, my own country, it would be prohibited by law."
"Mr President, I would like to take up the issue raised by a previous speaker."
"The decision taken by the Commission on 20 February amending the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products is important because the problem does not just affect Portugal but all European wine-growing areas."
"This decision merged the two categories with which we protected our highest quality products into a single category indicating quality wines and introduced the possibility for third countries to produce wines using our designations – using equivalent requirements as the only point of reference. In economic terms, this decision is a crisis for the entire European wine sector."
"At the same time, it also means that we are abandoning a series of quality guarantees to be given to consumers as regards European production."
"Amongst other aspects, the Commission’s justification – which stresses how this decision was taken to aid talks within the World Trade Organisation – is extremely worrying, because we are continuing to open up Europe to products for which we cannot provide the consumers with guarantees."
"Mr President, I want to alert Parliament and the Commission to the earthquake that occurred late last night in the Atlas mountains in Morocco and which has caused a considerable number of deaths there."
"I am also speaking on behalf of my friend and colleague Mr Deprez when I point out that there are a lot of people in Brussels and in this Parliament whose families are in Morocco."
"The Commission is very good at providing humanitarian assistance via ECHO, and this is an instance in which we should move as fast as we can."
"I should add that, on behalf of Parliament, I am communicating with the authorities to ensure that they are aware of our expression of sympathy."
"Indeed, we need effective solidarity and I will communicate that to the Commission as well."
"The next item is the Commission communication on its annual policy strategy for 2005."
". –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting the annual policy strategy adopted by the Commission this morning."
"It spells out the political priorities for 2005 and the initiatives necessary for their implementation."
"It also outlines the budgetary guidelines needed to ensure the priority initiatives are adequately funded."
"Mrs Schreyer will comment on this last point. I will focus on the first issue I mentioned."
"As of two years ago, it has become our custom to engage in a structured dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council on an annual basis."
"Given the special issues pertaining to 2004, the structured dialogue will take the form of a meeting of the Commission and the Conference of Committee Presidents to be held in April."
"Subsequently, there will be the opportunity to take stock at a second meeting with the Conference of Presidents in September."
"We are aware that this is a transition year and that our institutions are due to pass the baton on to their successors. This is what makes the dialogue so vitally important."
"The process in hand is special as it is directed not only at the budgetary authority but also at the incoming Commission."
"It is important to guarantee continuity and consistency of the Commission’s policies and the fulfilment of our institutional obligations. This is what we are trying to do."
"We need to pass the baton on smoothly to the next Commission. When the latter starts work, it will have to confirm or amend the priorities we are presenting here today."
"Our second objective is to prepare the ground for the incoming Commission in order to preserve the margin of manoeuvre on political and budgetary issues."
"Our third is to guarantee consistency with previously established strategic guidelines, especially the financial perspective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 will be the first full year with a Commission of 25 members, a Union of 25 Member States, a new Commission and a new Parliament."
"It will therefore be the duty of this new Commission to begin to apply a political agenda consistent with its mandate."
"Furthermore, 2005 will be a key year as regards concluding the negotiations on the adoption of the package for subsequent financial perspectives."
"This matter has to be resolved before the end of 2005."
"Some very important issues will need to be borne in mind at the many meetings planned."
"These include the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, and reconsideration of the sustainable development strategy."
"I should point out that the aim is now long-lasting development and this calls for new measures to adjust and improve implementation."
"Other important issues will include defining the new social agenda, consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justiceand concluding accession negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria. The report on Turkey will have to be presented before the end of the year."
"In the light of that report it should be possible to decide on the way forward."
"At international level, the focus in 2005 will largely remain on issues relating to international security and stability, the fight against terrorism and the rebuilding of Iraq."
"This involves shaping the Europe of the future and moulding what already exists. It also involves ensuring correct operation of the enlarged Europe and full implementation of policies and standards in all Member States, new and old alike."
"The second is security and European citizenship. The third is external responsibility, association and neighbouring countries."
"They cannot be classified as anything but mediocre for the European Union as a whole. The persistent stagnation of our productivity and employment levels should also be taken into account, together with our desire successfully to integrate the new Member States."
"Reactivating growth should be the main political objective. This should be achieved by working unceasingly to improve the competitiveness of the European model whilst maintaining prosperity and cohesion and without abandoning key elements such as sustainable development."
"The second priority is security and European citizenship."
"It is essential to remember that enlarging Europe both in terms of its territory and of its population will call for additional effort and greater coordination. This will be essential in responding to the challenges involved in dealing with the new common borders, the increased mobility of people within the area and the need to ensure security."
"The European Union will have to manage a land border over 6 000 kilometres long and a maritime border totalling over 85 000 kilometres. There are already well over 15 million third-country nationals resident in the European Union and a further 1.5 million or so arrive every year."
"Enlargement brings the question of the diversity of cultures and of the peoples of Europe into sharper focus. It presents us with the new challenge of European citizenship as an additional dimension of the Union."
"Mr President, the third priority is the role of the European Union in the world, that is, its external responsibilities. Issues of association and neighbouring countries are especially important."
"The new dimension of the European Union, the new post-enlargement external borders mean there must be a stable and comprehensive political framework encompassing our neighbours to the south and east."
"The Commission will therefore implement a new Union policy for neighbouring countries, aimed at those that do not wish to join the European Union. In addition, the Commission’s external action will be determined by the following objectives."
"Firstly, to contribute to the enlargement process presently under way. This entails preparing for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007."
"Further to the decisions taken in 2004, the Commission will also pursue the pre-accession strategy with Turkey. It may also be possible to begin active negotiations with Croatia, if suitable progress is made."
"As I said at the beginning of my speech, Mrs Schreyer will provide details concerning human and financial resources. I would, however, like to make it clear to you that the situation regarding these two issues is currently both critical and delicate, as she will explain in a few moments’ time."
"The Commission’s proposal represents the minimum action necessary to ensure this institution will be able to shoulder its institutional responsibilities taking account of enlargement, and above all, of the new policies envisaged by the Union."
"I hope that within the framework of the outstanding interinstitutional cooperation that has characterised the budgetary process, and in the knowledge of the support of this House, it will be possible to respond appropriately to these challenges."
"."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Vice-President of the Commission has set out the Commission’s priorities for 2005, and, if the objectives and expectations of European policy are to be met, the necessary resources must be made available; 2005 will be the second year in which our Budget will cover a European Union of 25 Member States, and I very much hope that we will, at first reading, agree on a Budget for a European Union to which all the people of Cyprus will belong."
"The Financial Perspective, which, last year, we adjusted to take account of enlargement, lays down the financial framework for the coming financial year."
"The adjustment was made in accordance with the decisions taken in Copenhagen and in line with the amendments introduced by your House. The decisions taken in Copenhagen, as set down in the accession treaties, set out the financial commitments made to the new Member States."
"In addition, the Council has made decisions concerning the augmentation of pre-accession aid for Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, which means that enlargement has left its unmistakeable stamp on the changes in the 2005 Budget in comparison with this year’s."
"Whilst the enlargement of the EU is a great gain in political, economic and ecological terms, it also presents challenges to the new Member States, who must implement all the EU’s laws, and also to the Commission, which, as guardian of the treaties, must ensure that they do so, and that their integration over the coming years is successful."
"To do this, there will have to be changes in the Commission’s personnel."
"As long ago as 2002, the Commission presented the overall development plan, according to which a total of 3 900 new posts are necessary."
"It is planned that there will be 700 additional posts in 2005, and we will be asking the budgetary authority to approve them."
"Let me also take this opportunity to follow my fellow-Commissioner Mrs Loyola de Palacio in extending very warm thanks to the budgetary authority, and most especially to Parliament."
"You have been very supportive of the Commission over the past years, and we continue to count on your support, which will enable the new Commission, too, to cope with the demands made upon it, and the tasks it has to perform, as an institution."
"For 2005, the Financial Perspective plans a framework of EUR 114 billion, with upper limits for the financial commitments that we are capable of taking on in internal and external policies, as well as in administrative expenditure, that are lower than provided for in the programmes; the reason for this is that prices have needed less adjustment because of exchange rate fluctuations."
"We will therefore have very little room for manoeuvre next year."
"The Secretaries-General of the institutions will, over the coming days, be presenting a report on how we are going to manage with this tight budget."
"Even though funds for new initiatives, in both the internal and external policy spheres, are very limited, the Commission is nevertheless proposing, for 2005, new initiatives and increased resources in line with our priorities, for example, in transport and energy, for the preparation of a European air traffic management system; in the area of industrial policy, for the establishment of agency for the testing of chemical substances; in justice and internal affairs, for the further development of the Schengen Information System, whilst, in the field of research, there is a need for more funding for the decontamination of nuclear research facilities."
"Those are just a few examples."
"In foreign policy, we need to do what we have undertaken to do in the various areas – our commitments to combat Aids, action measures in Kosovo, and cooperation with non-governmental organisations in strengthening democracy."
"We are at present reckoning on a financial commitment to Iraq still being needed in 2005, so we will again have to have recourse to the flexibility instrument if we are to be able to perform the tasks that the European Union has taken on."
"As the Vice-President has already explained, the discussions on the 2005 Budget will relate to all institutions in the new framework or with changes in their composition."
"It will be a new experience for the Council to adopt a Budget for 25 Member States."
"Although there will be a newly-elected Parliament as early as first reading, it is a very good thing that, in the person of Mr Garriga Polledo, we have appointed a principal rapporteur who is very experienced and who will ensure continuity in the debates."
"There will be a change of Commission between the first and second readings of the 2005 Budget."
"In purely institutional terms, we will see many new faces in the 2005 Budget procedure."
"On 16 March, we will be having a trialogue to discuss the priorities for the 2005 Budget, and I am confident that we – having succeeded in doing so in earlier years – will be able without delay to come to an agreement about them, so that the European Budget for 2005 can, once more, be a good one."
"I should like to thank both Commissioners for their introductory remarks."
"Of course, this year we are to see a moment of change, but both Commissioners also stressed the need for consistency and continuity."
"– Mr President, we regret that the President-in-Office of the Council and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, cannot be here to see the presentation made today by the Vice-President and the Budgets Commissioner."
"I believe this is a very important occasion. I cannot imagine what political engagement can have kept them away from Parliament today."
"Be that as it may, I would like to thank the two Commissioners for their presentation. We understand the reasons for this delay."
"Nevertheless, I would like the Commission for its part to understand the problems the delay experienced has already caused Parliament. For the first time, Parliament is going to implement a budgetary year in the light of the evaluation report based on the annual policy strategy document."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioners if they undertake to keep to the schedule the Budget Commissioner just outlined."
"I would like confirmation of this."
"No further delay is acceptable."
"Furthermore, as Commissioner Schreyer is aware, Parliament has already reached its own positions on the financial perspective."
"It has reached positions on fundamental issues such as safeguarding our parliamentary rights and the length of financial perspectives. Parliament has already made its views known on the latter."
"A position was also reached on our priorities for the future. We would like the political priorities of what is to be financed to be absolutely clear before any ceilings are fixed."
"Commissioner, as regards further enlargements, you will be aware that this House is of the opinion that it is essential to ensure beforehand that the European Union has both the institutional and the financial capacity to absorb new members."
"Concerning the categories, be assured that, as on other occasions, Parliament will support you on the new posts, as long as we engage in a rational dynamic process."
"In any case, we shall require a fuller definition."
"Finally, as regards the financing of category 4, I think you should really approach the Council, Commissioner, notably the signatories of the so-called ‘One per cent letter’."
". Let me start with many thanks to Mr Garriga Polledo for his assurance of continued support for the Commission."
"I think we really have to stress the fact that enlarging by adding ten new Member States is no trifling matter, and the public expect the European institutions to apply the law even-handedly from the word go."
"Doing that also requires the necessary complement of personnel, not least, of course, where languages are involved, and we have to guarantee that those positions will be filled."
"I will answer your last question as to what the 2005 Budget will be like by saying that we have of course not got as far as a draft Budget, but it is already plain that the Council has already decided on certain increases."
"What this means is that there are more or less external factors that we have to take on board, and our consequent decisions have to respond to this reality."
"I would see it as a very bad sign if, just before enlargement, we were to start questioning the decisions taken in Copenhagen."
"Nobody wants to do that, and we will of course take that into account in the preliminary draft Budget."
"I can assure the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 will be submitted in due time."
"– Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner, whilst I can endorse your priorities wholeheartedly, I wonder if you, Madam Vice-President, do not also think that there is a particular motto under which we can march into 2005, and that it is ‘Growth and Employment’?"
"Do you not agree that we all share in responsibility for the fact that this Europe of ours has not, over recent years, seen sufficient growth and enough job creation, and that this is a very important task for the new Commission?"
"Now that there has been talk at this tripartite summit of a super-Commissioner or Commission Vice-President with responsibilities for economic reform, do you not also think that, if there is to be such a person, he or she should primarily have responsibility for growth and employment, since we will find it difficult to advance the European ideal if we fail to prioritise these two things?"
"Let me now turn to something originally mentioned by Mrs Flemming: the Roma and Sinti."
"In the enlarged Europe, after Bulgaria and Romania have joined it, there will be 8 million Roma and Sinti, living in social conditions that are extremely difficult, and more difficult than in many Member States."
"Are you willing, at this early stage, to prepare the forthcoming Budget in such a way that there will be more financial support for the integration of Roma and Sinti in our society – even though it is more than just money that is needed?"
"If not, we will face conflicts flagrantly contradicting the ideal of unifying Europe."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that, as Mr Prodi explained in his letter to the President of Parliament dated 20 February, he could not be here today as he had long-standing engagements with the Prime Minister of Romania and the President of Côte d’Ivoire."
"As it is unfortunately impossible for Mr Prodi to be in two places at once, he is not in the House today."
"I prefer not to comment on the absence of the Council. I can certainly say, however, that we all like to have the three institutions together in this House."
"We would have welcomed the Council’s presence."
"When it comes to the issue of employment and growth, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to discuss the question of the Super-Commissioner. It will be for the incoming Commission to decide on how to organise a Commission of 25 members."
"According to the Treaty of Nice, the new President will have extensive competence in that regard."
"I think it is possible for it to be very well organised and to function very well."
"A 25 member Commission does not necessarily spell trouble. The opposite is actually the case."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do fully agree with you on the need to find a way of strengthening industrial policies."
"Mr Liikanen has worked hard on this over the years. It stands to reason, however, that it is essential to make further progress on this in the light of the new phenomenon of globalisation."
"It is also essential to develop external trade, as the two are closely linked."
"There is discussion of matters such as access to public markets and trans-European networks. There is discussion of the growth measures associated with the policy and strategy for growth."
"This relates to decisions taken at Lisbon and to the proposals made at the last European Council in Brussels. Issues such as moving forward with proposals concerning the interaction between industrial policy and other Community policies feature also."
"There are proposals to improve and simplify legislation relating to key industrial sectors. The aim is to strengthen competitiveness in sectors such as the automobile industry, construction, the cosmetics industry and the information society."
"As regards employment, there is also discussion of issues relating to the social aspects, amongst others. In short, I would like to say that many political measures are being considered with precisely this objective in mind."
"We need to restore growth. We need to achieve strong growth levels in order to move forward and absorb the new Member States."
"We need enlargement to be successful. We all hope and expect it will be."
"– I too would like to thank both the Vice-President of the Commission and Commissioner Schreyer for the very clear and comprehensive account of the financial planning for 2005, and especially for Mrs de Palacio’s observation that a 25-member Commission can and will function every bit as well as the one we have at present."
"Of that, I too am convinced, and I think it highly important that this Commission should not merely be open to twenty-five members, but should also be credible, strong and capable of putting its policies into practice."
"The issues around the Stability and Growth Pact show just how important that is; this is where the Commission has already passed a test and has yet to pass another by backing stability and growth and safeguarding the policies and principles underlying them."
"That is in the interests of all of us, as ‘business and growth’ and ‘stability and growth’ are the two sides of the same coin."
"Something, though, that I regard as a very important area, and about which I would like to ask you a question, is security policy, involving judicial cooperation, security and freedom in an enlarged European Union."
"Resources are available for it, and it is a very important area."
"Where, in it, do you want the specific policy priorities to be – in securing borders or combating drugs?"
"The citizens of the European Union expect enlargement to bring greater security rather than to diminish it, and for this the funding must be guaranteed, so that the external borders can be properly secured, and methodologies developed to effectively combat international crime and illegal immigration."
"Mr President, let me start with Mr Swoboda’s question on the position of the Sinti and Roma in the European Union, and reiterate that, in all the negotiations on enlargement conducted by the Council and the Commission, very particular attention has been given to the issue of how minorities are treated."
"We have examined this question with particular care, and it is quite clear that enlargement will greatly strengthen these minorities in their rights and, above all, protect them. In consequence, I believe that these minorities will themselves welcome the enlargement of the European Union."
"As far as the financial and social dimension is concerned, the new Member States will have access to the Social Funds, which share in funding special programmes vital to the integration of minorities."
"In 2005, the new Member States will be able to draw on a total of EUR 900 million from the European Social Fund, and I believe it important that we should ensure that some of this money is applied for this purpose."
"Turning to the security issues, this is an area in which the Council has taken more and more decisions; in no other area has the Council adopted so many new resolutions over recent years as in the area of justice and internal affairs, and it goes without saying that these must also be backed up by funding."
"In 2005, for example, it is planned that more funding should be made available for the Schengen Information System than had previously been planned, increasing the amount by an additional EUR 4 million."
"If I may mention just a couple of courses of action, proposals have been made for funding the conversion of the European Police College into a European institution for training senior police officers, and the network of national training institutes is to be built up."
"I would also point out that, over recent years, we have also greatly increased the number of staff working in this area."
"If I may quantify this, in 1999, there were 82 posts allocated to this area, whereas next year there will be over 300 of them, the object being to create the area of freedom, security and justice in Europe that we all need."
"Mr President, I am speaking on account of the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, and the head of the Italian Government, Mr Berlusconi."
"I am speaking on account of Mrs de Palacio because, having been elected by Italian pensioners in 1999 to represent them within this Parliament, I have not, I am sorry to say, heard anything to confirm the policy for old people and pensioners that has to date been very poorly implemented by the European Commission."
"I am speaking on account of the President of the Italian Government Mr Berlusconi because, even though he knows the secret of the elixir of long life and eternal youth, he has not yet imparted this and so we will continue to grow old in Europe."
"This concerns me greatly because many more pensioners need to hear confirmation that the European Commission, like the European Parliament, is on their side when it comes to combating the rapaciousness of the ministers responsible for the budget in the Member States."
"– Mr President, I am sure anyone would like to enjoy eternal youth, and that the honourable Members of this House are no exception to that rule."
"Seriously, however, I would like to say the main concern within the competence of the European Union as regards pensioners relates to the sustainability of pensions systems in the different countries of the European Union."
"There are calls for this to be the first area to be tackled. In fact, the reports on the condition of the economy in the various Member States are systematically taking account of this issue in analysing the situation."
"In this context, it is appropriate to consider the level of cover and the levels of balance and sustainability in pension systems, in addition to the debt, deficit or growth. As the honourable Member will be aware, a number of Member States of the Union are introducing changes to ensure pensions systems stand the test of time."
"That is what needs to be assured first of all."
"The second issue concerns the ageing of Europe’s population. Provision has been made for this in a range of policies."
"Ageing does not appear separately because when presenting priorities, one inevitably condenses the actions proposed into a few points. Ageing is certainly taken into account in connection with the quality of health care, means of transport, or facilities for those with impaired mobility."
"That stands to reason. These are just some examples of the types of policies involved."
"After all, quite apart from the debate on pensions, the aim has to be to ensure that older people are fully integrated into the wider society."
"They must never be sidelined or discriminated against."
"On the contrary, they must always be at the forefront of our minds, and we should strive to ensure they are fully integrated and included."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioners for their statement."
"On external actions, I noted that the Commissioner mentioned Iraq but did not mention Afghanistan."
"The European Union has done a lot in Afghanistan; we have committed and spent money faster than ever before in keeping our promises."
"I am worried about the security situation in Afghanistan, however."
"The money might just as well have been thrown down the drain if the situation reverts to where it was a couple of years ago under the Taliban."
"The same situation applies to Iraq."
"Unless the security situation is secured, we are putting money from the poorest people in the world into an area which is quite rich."
"I feel that there is some measure of caution that we need to exercise in whatever we do in Iraq, unless the security situation confirms that the funds we give for cooperation and development are secured and that we are not wasting the money because the situation becomes unstable and dangerous."
"On the point of the Lisbon Agenda, I should like to ask the Commissioner to look back at the record of the Conservative Party: in 1977 my country was considered the sick man of Europe; my party got into power under Margaret Thatcher and we are today one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe."
"You do not need to go and reinvent the wheel: please read the books."
"Which female Commissioner would like to respond to that British challenge?"
"– Mr President, it appears that a degree of gender balance has indeed been achieved. Much remains to be done in that regard in the wider world, however."
"Hopefully, the gains made will be consolidated and built upon."
"That is what I am hoping for from the incoming Commission. Nonetheless, it is true that a glance at the ten new candidatures reveals a degree of imbalance."
"That is just too bad. What we need to do is work with the situation as it is, not simply talk of quotas."
"I shall now turn to the concern expressed by the honourable Member. The fact that there is no specific mention of Afghanistan certainly does not mean that action in that country will not be maintained."
"Commitments were made to Afghanistan and will obviously be honoured."
"What is currently at issue is the Union’s contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq. The honourable Member is of course right to say that the situation in those two countries is completely different."
"The opportunities open to Iraq are not the same as those available to Afghanistan."
"The latter is a much poorer country. It has far less potential and natural resources of its own."
"Once Iraq’s infrastructure is back in place and the country’s potential can be released, its future should look more hopeful."
"I am sure we all hope this will very soon be the case."
"Moving on to the Lisbon Agenda, you are quite right, ladies and gentlemen. There is no need to keep on reinventing the wheel."
"I fully agree with the honourable Member that what has to be done is implement the agreements reached at Lisbon. The Lisbon reforms must be carried through, implemented and developed in all Member States of the Union."
"That is the way to ensure the economy becomes more competitive. Next year’s mid-term review will of course reveal, amongst other things, whether activity at Community level has been in line with the objectives set."
"In the case of areas I am very familiar with, like transport and energy, I do believe everything that should have been done has been done. Only a few issues remain under negotiation between Parliament and the Council."
"I think the same is true of other areas too."
"There certainly are some outstanding items. The main shortcoming, however, is the failure of Member States of the Union to implement structural measures."
"Progress has been very uneven in this regard. Some countries have forged ahead."
"Others are still experiencing problems. Nonetheless, it is to be hoped that the situation will soon improve, as all are aware of the need to act."
"A number of Prime Ministers, Heads of State and Presidents are on record as having made statements to that effect."
"The European Union sorely needs these reforms. I trust they will be given new impetus and implemented at the earliest opportunity."
"I should like to thank colleagues and both Commissioners for their contributions."
"That concludes the debate."
"The 2005 APS (Annual Policy Strategy) forms part of the framework proposal for the 2007-2013 financial perspective and is the result of the project known as the ‘European Constitution’. This takes neo-liberal, federal and military development yet another step further."
"The main axes place competitiveness ahead of cohesion, security ahead of citizenship and ‘foreign responsibilities’ – both civil and military – ahead of cooperation. This at a time when the financial context is increasingly restrictive, when new reductions are envisaged in the size of the budget and when a policy of spending cuts and redistribution is pursued in order to fund these priorities."
"The first axis – the economic one – obliges us to comply with the objectives of the ‘Lisbon Strategy’, specifically with the (liberalisation of) services Directive, which proposes to use the financial services markets as a template for the ‘defence market’ and to create a ‘research’ space aimed at commercialising scientific and technical progress."
"The second axis – security – suggests that we should put in place border management and create a police force, in order to control migratory flows, in line with the interests of employers, and in so doing strengthen the trend towards security in the name of combating terrorism."
"The third axis – external affairs – is concerned with ‘defence’ and places emphasis on creating a free trade area in Europe and the Mediterranean, thus turning the EU into a regional power."
"We oppose this project."
"A different Europe is possible and necessary."
"The next item is the joint debate on economic and financial guidelines:"
"Council and Commission statements on the Spring Summit: follow-up to Lisbon, and two reports on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs:"
"- Report (A5-0045/2004) by Christa Randzio-Plath, on the situation of the European economy, report on the broad guidelines for economic policies;"
"and"
"- Report (A5-0044/2004) by Roberto Felice Bigliardo, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on public finances in EMU – 2003."
". Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to brief Members of the European Parliament today on our plans for the spring European Council."
"The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern TD, wrote to heads of state or government on 17 February 2004 and communicated our proposed priorities for the Council, as outlined in the draft annotated agenda for the Council, which Members will have seen."
"We intend to reserve the morning session of Friday, 26 March for our annual consideration of the Lisbon strategy of economic, social and environmental renewal."
"The Parliament will already be aware, from the Taoiseach’s address on 14 January 2004, that in its presidency programme, Ireland is giving the highest priority to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"As presidency we are acutely conscious that we are almost at the half-way point with regard to the 2010 deadline by which the targets set in 2000 must be reached."
"It is important to note the considerable progress that has already been achieved on areas ranging from energy liberalisation to the implementation of the internal market in the financial services area."
"Notwithstanding the clear progress that has already been achieved, we must equally recognise that more needs to be done to enable the Union to capitalise on the promising signs of economic recovery."
"We want the European Council to convey a message of determination and confidence, demonstrating that the requisite political will exists to enable us to step up the pace of reform."
"We intend to call on governments, the European Parliament and the Commission to work together to overcome the obstacles inhibiting the implementation of agreed reforms, so that we can complete the necessary legislative programme and then transpose agreed measures quickly into national law."
"We have identified two overarching priorities for the spring European Council, namely sustainable growth and more and better jobs."
"We are adopting a holistic approach to the issue of growth, recognising that we need to take action on a range of factors such as competitiveness, innovation, environmental sustainability and social inclusion if we are to make the European economy more dynamic."
"We need to enhance competitiveness so that our economy can withstand global challenges."
"It is equally vital that we take specific steps to make the internal market more vibrant."
"We are focusing, in this regard, on two particular areas: financial services and the services sector more broadly."
"We believe that an effective single market in the financial services area will enable the EU economy to grow significantly by increasing the provision of more and cheaper capital."
"We hope that the European Parliament can engage constructively with us in pursuing this objective by helping to finalise the remaining elements of the Financial Services Action Plan, particularly the proposed directives on transparency and investment services, before the end of its current term."
"We are all aware that the services sector has powered the EU economy over the past decade, providing a dynamic motor for growth that has accounted for 70% of the EU’s GDP and of its employment opportunities."
"We see the full application of internal market principles to that sector as a vital tool in enabling competitive businesses to expand throughout the EU and offer greater choice to EU consumers."
"Consequently, we look forward to fruitful cooperation with the Parliament in advancing significantly the proposed directive on the internal market for services next year."
"The Lisbon strategy explicitly recognised that for the EU to compete globally, it must make the transition to a knowledge-based economy in which leading-edge technology and expertise will provide crucial added value to EU products and services."
"However, we continue to lag behind our most important international competitors in terms of our investment in, or the priority attached to, innovation."
"The number of researchers in the EU accounts for only 5.7 per 1000 workforce, while the corresponding figures are 8.1 per 1000 for the US and 9.1 per 1000 for Japan."
"Indeed, as the Commission’s spring report has noted, the private sector contributes three times more investment in human capital in Japan and a staggering five times more in the US than in the EU."
"Each of our institutions, national governments, the Council, the Commission and Parliament will need to see how we can provide dynamic solutions that will foster a climate in business that is more conducive to innovation."
"As a first step in that process, we have proposed that the European Council should agree that Member States should consider targeted supports and incentives to encourage greater research and development investment by businesses."
"Equally, if we are to increase the number of researchers undertaking the work necessary to enable our economy to grow, it is important to look at how we might retain our own researchers and attract researchers from other countries into the EU."
"The Council looks forward, in this regard, to the continued cooperation of Parliament to ensure the early adoption of the forthcoming draft directive on the mobility of third country researchers."
"I am personally committed to the objective of ensuring better regulation within the EU."
"I firmly believe that better regulation can enable the EU economy to grow significantly by achieving the right balance that will allow the interests of the public to be safeguarded while at the same time easing any unnecessary burdens on business."
"The presidency has developed a joint initiative with the succeeding presidencies – the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK – aimed at giving priority, over the next two years, to the objective of better regulation."
"Our second priority is that of more and better jobs."
"Our presidency approach to the issue of employment is informed by the recommendations of the Employment Task Force chaired by Mr Wim Kok which reported to the European Commission at the end of 2003."
"We welcome the full incorporation of the Task Force’s policy messages into the analysis and assessment outlined in the Joint Employment Report."
"We are proposing, consequently, that the European Council should agree that, within an overall employment strategy, Member States should give urgent attention to three structural challenges, namely adaptability, greater labour force participation and investment in human capital."
"As you are aware, we set targets under the Lisbon strategy that female labour force participation should reach 60% and that the rate for older workers should increase to 50% by 2010."
"The Commission’s spring report has recorded the increase in the female employment rate over the past three years to 55.6%, in part because of the progress made on improving the availability and accessibility of care facilities for children under three."
"If we can maintain that rate of progress, we have a realistic chance of meeting the 60% target for female participation by 2010."
"As presidency, we consider that the most urgent issues needing to be addressed, with regard to attracting more women into the workforce, are the continuing pay disparities experienced by women and the importance of more family-friendly work environments."
"However, we have more serious difficulties with regard to the target in respect of the employment rate for older workers."
"The employment rate for the cohort of workers aged between 55 and 64 had reached only 40.1% by 2002, meaning that another 7 million jobs would be required to enable us to meet the 50% target by 2010."
"Conscious of the importance of this issue, the Irish presidency is proposing that the right legal and financial incentives be put in place to retain older workers in the workforce."
"The labour participation issue highlights the reality that implementation of the Lisbon strategy requires the commitment not just of national governments but of a range of actors including employers and trade unions."
"The support of employers is essential, for instance, if we are to create family-friendly and enabling environments that attract and retain female employees and older workers."
"Equally, we need the commitment of trade unions to facilitate the necessary adaptation to change that is increasingly essential in a competitive, global environment."
"We believe, therefore, that it is essential to explore ways of involving the necessary stakeholders more fundamentally in implementing our Lisbon goals."
"The process of change is unavoidably difficult."
"However, we can build a better future for the citizens of our Union, and of the enlarged Union."
"We believe that the process of implementing the Lisbon strategy will benefit greatly from the contribution of the new Member States, each of which has had to manage fundamental and wide-ranging economic transformations."
"While we have much to do, the benefits for our citizens of our implementing the Lisbon strategy effectively will be considerable."
"The prize is a great one."
"Our work programme and the potential benefits for Lisbon are well encapsulated in the presidency theme that we have chosen."
"We, as Europeans, are 'working together' to ensure a 'better quality of life' for all the citizens of Europe by 2010."
"Mr President, the Commission has come before the House once again accompanied by the President-in-Office of the Council, as it does every year. We are here to discuss the priorities for economic, social and environmental policy to be dealt with at the Spring Summit."
"Since 2002 it has become established practice for future objectives to be set at the Spring Summit."
"If we ensure that the summit is effective and successful, we shall in addition be consolidating the emerging economic governance of the Union. I myself am an impassioned advocate of the latter, which is also endorsed by the whole Commission."
"The Irish Presidency has just presented its priorities. It has also confirmed its ambition to make the summit a success, and its determination to do so."
"The Irish Presidency’s ambition and determination are supported by the analysis and conclusions presented in the Spring report."
"This analysis was well received in the debate held at the time. It received further support subsequently through the many contributions and initiatives by a good many Member States."
"The overview provided in the Spring report is very clear."
"I shall not dwell on it, though I would like to make a few brief comments on the content."
"The material adopted on 21 January already contained the main political messages and key conclusions."
"A series of positive results was mentioned, notably concerning job creation."
"Six million jobs have been created despite the climate of weak growth."
"The considerable improvement in the situation regarding long-term unemployment and female employment was also mentioned. In addition, there was reference to opening up competition in strategic web markets, and to the increasing penetration of the Internet into schools, businesses, public administrations and homes."
"A recent Commission study confirms that the economic reform process launched in recent years contributed to the additional growth of Europe’s GDP by over half a percentage point between 1996 and 2001."
"This is certainly a positive sign."
"It must not, however, lead to playing down the difficulties that have already arisen in connection with the process. These difficulties are particularly striking if they are set against the ambition and objectives defined at Lisbon."
"Employment and productivity are not contributing enough to the growth of Europe’s GDP."
"The internal market remains too fragmented and the transposition of directives still leaves a great deal to be desired."
"At the same time, however, it reveals the urgent need to recommit to the latter. Most importantly, it highlights the urgency of making every possible effort to implement the Lisbon strategy."
"I shall now identify what the Commission believes the priorities are at this juncture. They can all be found in our report."
"Greater investment in networks and research is called for."
"So too is greater investment in development and innovation. It is also important to strengthen the competitiveness of the service industry and to introduce the changes needed to prolong working life."
"I would like to comment briefly on each of these aspects."
"In the light of the slow growth experienced in recent years, it is essential to increase investment in infrastructures and research, development and innovation. In so doing, a more integrating approach involving the European dimension should be adopted."
"Private investors are directly affected."
"They can and must draw on the potential for growth and medium- and long-term benefits resulting from the operation of an integrated economy without barriers."
"It is incumbent on the public bodies, including European ones, to complete an appropriate regulatory framework at national and Community level as a matter of urgency. At the same time, the opportunity for a more ambitious political and financial support must be created."
"Strengthening investment in this way will prove more effective if it is in line with an overall vision such as that generated by the projects included in the growth initiative."
"Through the latter, the Commission and the European Council are seeking to coordinate efforts to overcome cross-border problems. I refer to problems concerning the development of infrastructures for transport, energy and telecommunications, and also for research, development and innovation."
"Fostering the development of knowledge and human capital is crucial to this endeavour. Much remains to be done in this regard."
"Commissioner Reding is here with me today and will take the floor shortly. She will provide a detailed account of the relevant courses of action agreed within the framework of the Lisbon strategy."
"Improving the competitiveness of industry and services is the next priority."
"Parliament and the Council must focus on the adoption of the legislative package to promote competitiveness."
"The package contains key proposals such as the recognition of professional qualifications, the Community patent, the most recent directives on financial services and the framework directive on services."
"Further strategic reforms concern the review of the guidelines on the TENs and the action plan on environmental technology."
"It is also necessary to consider how the Lisbon strategy could be improved for the industrial sector."
"The third priority is to promote active ageing, allowing older workers to remain active for longer."
"The elimination of financial incentives for early retirement could be one way of achieving this."
"Mr President, if I may, I should like to make two further comments on the report on the Broad Guidelines for the Economic Policies of the Member States and the report on public finances."
"The Commission’s recommendation concerning the 2004 update of the current Broad Guidelines on economic policy enabled Parliament to undertake an interesting study. Mrs Randzio-Plath has been largely responsible for the latter."
"Once again, Mrs Randzio-Plath has cooperated in the analysis of the Lisbon strategy and in developing the policies contained in these Broad Guidelines."
"She regrets their inadequate implementation and feels that investment is undoubtedly the key issue to focus on in future. The Commission certainly welcomes Parliament’s renewed endorsement of the main axes of the strategy on economic policy contained in the Broad Guidelines."
"The common broad agenda for structural reform is crucial to increasing Europe’s potential for growth."
"The importance of sound and responsible management in macroeconomic policies should not be overlooked. It is essential for strengthening confidence and a precondition for increasing internal demand and employment."
"In this regard, my views differ from those contained in the draft resolution."
"I do not subscribe to the opinion that there is an increasing divide between the aims and objectives set at Lisbon and the current Broad Guidelines for economic policy."
"I also fail to detect any lack of consistency between the instruments as is stated. The current guidelines cover the period 2003-2005."
"They focus in particular on the contribution by economic policies to attaining the Lisbon objectives over the next three years. Consequently, the aforementioned guidelines are a vital objective in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Their added value is to be found precisely in that they provide an integrated approach to dealing with the various challenges arising."
"This global approach is developing thanks to the rationalisation of policy coordination."
"In this regard, progress has been made in bringing the Broad Guidelines for economic policy into line with the employment guidelines. Overall consistency has improved as a result."
"I should also like to comment on Mr Bigliardo’s report on public finance within the Union."
"It represents valuable and useful input. I appreciate the broad support for the Commission’s approach to strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact, and economic governance in particular."
"The current framework for coordination of economic policies is based on clear principles, stable prices and monetary conditions, and healthy public finances."
"As our main objective is to promote growth, we believe this is indeed the most logical and appropriate framework."
"Nonetheless, experience has shown that there is room for improvement as regards getting the pact under way or into practice. The Commission is undertaking a review."
"This will include discussion with other institutions and with the governments of Member States. The Commission intends to make more detailed proposals before the summer."
"I trust there will be an opportunity for me to discuss these specific points with the House."
"The cornerstone of our strategy is the concept that short-term difficulties should not be dealt with in ways resulting in long-term imbalance. Instead, it is essential to tackle such difficulties bearing in mind the current economic situation, possible future challenges, and existing provisions for coordinating budgetary policies."
"This has helped in improving the budgetary situation and reducing the anticipated level of inflation."
"At this juncture, the major challenge is how to devote more attention to growth and sustainability of public finances."
"My final remark on economic governance is that the objectives set at Lisbon were both ambitious and realistic. Success depended on the determination and commitment of one and all."
"It now seems that failure to meet the interim objectives will endanger the achievement of what had been agreed for 2010."
"Our key challenge is to ensure effective economic governance. Steady progress is being made at European level."
"The right priorities are being set and the appropriate measures and policies identified. When it comes to taking decisions, however, difficulties and delays abound."
"In addition, Member States have been unable to integrate the aforementioned priorities effectively into their various national policies."
"The Commission is trying to do its duty by drawing attention to this programme. I believe it is useful to invite opinions on the best solution to the problem."
"It is important to seize the opportunities offered by the economic recovery and the momentum for enlargement so as to give the necessary boost to the Lisbon process."
"The impetus must come from the European Council."
"The Irish Presidency has identified this as one of its priorities, hence the opportunity for strengthening coordination of economic policies."
"The Commission launched its consultation last month for the same reason."
"The Commission will also prepare proposals for the perspectives for the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. It is anticipated that this will be the main issue dealt with in the Spring report next year."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I am pleased to be able to take part in this plenary sitting along with my colleague Pedro Solbes."
"The presence of both of us here is highly symbolic, because it signals that the Lisbon strategy is not based solely on economics and finance – although these clearly remain absolutely essential elements – but that crucial importance is also attached to its social and human dimensions."
"Who can overlook, for example, the fact that almost 20% of young Europeans leave the education and training systems without any qualifications?"
"Who could fail to be concerned by the social exclusion to which some of our population are condemned?"
"How can we respond to the growing need of individuals for lifelong learning that will enable them to keep working or to play an active part in the life of our societies?"
"As I have often said, human resources are the prize asset of the Union, provided we can derive maximum benefit from them."
"But without high-quality education and training, it is illusory to imagine that we shall achieve our objectives in terms of growth, employment and social cohesion."
"The fact is that our economic potential hinges on our human capital."
"Experts have calculated, for example, that an increase of one year in an average person’s period of study would translate into a productivity gain of more than 6%."
"We are also aware that education is a key factor in civic and social integration."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the construction of the edifice for which the plans were drawn up in Lisbon must begin with the laying of solid foundations on the bedrock of education and training."
"The spring report that the Commission adopted a month ago contains the observation that, despite some encouraging progress in a number of areas, the Union is still far short of the targets it has set itself."
"There are several reasons for this, foremost among which are excessive fragmentation of the internal market and sluggish transposition of the guidelines adopted within the framework of the Lisbon strategy."
"My colleague Mr Solbes has referred to these points."
"An equally important reason for our shortcomings is the lack of investment in knowledge, whether in education and training or in research and innovation."
"In Lisbon, the Member States undertook to increase significantly the level of investment in human resources."
"But what is actually happening?"
"Public investment in education, measured as a percentage of GDP, has made little or no headway and is even declining in some Member States."
"Moreover, private investment in education, especially higher education, is far from adequate in Europe when judged against the standards set by our competitors."
"Private-sector expenditure on education is four times as high in the United States and twice as high in Japan as it is here in Europe."
"The same applies to research, where there is an alarming brain drain from the European Union to the United States."
"If we want to become a knowledge-based economy, the fact is that we shall have to generate fresh momentum, one of the key components of which must be research."
"Indeed, without public and private investment in research, the economy of the Union will stagnate, deprived of its motive force, which is knowledge."
"This is precisely why the encouragement of investment in research was placed at the heart of the Lisbon strategy."
"April 2003 saw the adoption, after broad consultation, of the communication entitled , which identifies measures designed to increase the average level of investment from the present rate of 1.9% of GDP to 3% by the year 2010, with two thirds of all investment coming from the private sector."
"This 3% action plan comprises four main sets of measures: supporting the steps taken by European countries and stakeholders and ensuring that they are mutually consistent, considerably improving public support for research and technological innovation, increasing the levels of public funding for research and, lastly, improving the climate for research and technological innovation in Europe."
"These are not easy tasks by any means."
"The success of this action plan will depend on resolute and concerted efforts on the part of the Member States and the private sector."
"But we must face the fact that today’s investments are tomorrow’s growth, productivity and employment."
"It is also imperative to step up the efforts to modernise our education and training systems and equip them to meet the needs of a knowledge-based society."
"These are matters that the Commission and the Member States have taken very seriously."
"In February 2002, we agreed on a programme of work designed to make our education and training systems an international standard of excellence by 2010."
"The Education Ministers have also adopted European benchmarks in five key areas, such as basic skills and lifelong learning."
"In addition, the Copenhagen Declaration of 2002 initiated the process of European cooperation in the field of vocational training."
"The first concrete results have emerged, such as the Europass and the work on the recognition of informal training."
"In November 2003, the Commission presented an interim report on the implementation of the programme of work, and in this report I sounded the alarm by stating that, unless the pace of reform quickened, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the objectives we have set for our education and training systems – not only these but also the objectives of the Lisbon strategy in its entirety, which is a far more worrying thought."
"Deficits in education and training, after all, lead almost automatically to economic slippage and social problems."
"On the basis of these observations, a joint report has been prepared with the Member States and will be discussed tomorrow by the Council of Education Ministers with a view to submission to the European Council for its Spring Summit."
"This report identifies several priority areas for action."
"The first of these is investment in human resources, where there is a need for more investment, but also wiser investment, and for the mobilisation of the private sector, particularly for investment in higher education and vocational training."
"The next priority is the adoption by the Member States of genuine strategies for the promotion of lifelong learning, particularly among disadvantaged sections of society."
"Today, only one adult in ten has access to opportunities for lifelong learning."
"Finally, there is a need to nurture a real education and training culture in Europe, particularly through the creation of a European qualification structure."
"The report also highlights the key role of universities in the knowledge-based society."
"While our universities possess many assets, it cannot be denied that they are confronted by fundamental challenges in an increasingly globalised and competitive environment."
"As a general rule, they possess fewer resources than the major American universities, for example."
"Since the eighties, they have also lost their status as the preferred destination of foreign students."
"What can be done to make our universities world-class centres of excellence?"
"What can be done to attract the best students, researchers and lecturers?"
"Some progress has already been made through the Bologna process, designed to promote the convergence of our systems of higher education, through the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, which support innovation in education and training, and, more recently, through the Erasmus Mundus programme, so strongly supported by the European Parliament, for which I thank you once again."
"Can we declare ourselves satisfied, in this field and in others?"
"Can we stop now?"
"I do not think so."
"I believe that, at every level, we must continue our efforts and redouble them if need be."
"This, indeed, is the message of the Commission’s spring report and of the interim report."
"The direct corollary of this message is the Commission’s proposal on the new financial perspective."
"On the tenth of this month, President Prodi briefed you on the background to the financial perspective and its main features."
"The discussions will be long and difficult, and many figures and percentages will be bandied about."
"But before engaging in this debate, let us first concentrate on this project of ours and on our ambitions for the period beyond 2010."
"As President Prodi emphasised in his address to this House, no European country can meet the challenges of globalisation on its own."
"The same applies to the entire Lisbon strategy, including the fields of education and training."
"Oh yes, I know – education and training are subject to the subsidiarity principle."
"And nobody is questioning that."
"But we have managed to made significant headway through Community action."
"A million Erasmus students may seem like a huge number, but they represent only two per cent of our entire student body."
"That is not enough."
"We need to go further."
"The same is true of trainees."
"And the fact that some two million pupils have been involved in our school projects may seem impressive, but this figure is not even one per cent of the total school roll for the whole of Europe."
"And so there is truly a need to move forward."
"Moreover, Community programmes, which are veritable innovation laboratories, contribute to reforms and adjustments of education systems and serve to promote the sharing of experience."
"The Bologna process, for example, would never have materialised without the Erasmus programme and without the growing demand among students for greater mobility."
"Community action through programmes as well as through political cooperation therefore helps to achieve three fundamental objectives: to make the European construction process and European citizenship tangible and visible, to develop the European dimension of education and training and to support efforts to improve the quality of our education and training systems."
"Our action at the European level is essential if we want to achieve our economic and social objectives."
"In this context, in the month of March I shall be presenting to the College of Commissioners a communication on the new generation of programmes for the period from 2007 to 2013."
"The aim of this communication will be to make education and training a reality for everyone."
"It will set out the main thrust and the priority measures of the new generation of education programmes."
"A formal proposal should be presented before the summer."
"This means, ladies and gentlemen, that we shall have time to discuss it."
"Given your track record in this field, however, I am already confident that I can count on your support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, today we are discussing our economy."
"Making our economy the most dynamic in the world means ensuring that the triangle of the Commission, Parliament and the Council will enable the triangle of the economy, employment and the environment to develop in an effective and balanced manner."
"Let me begin with the economic, monetary and industrial issues. At the time of enlargement, firm coordination of the Member States’ economic policies in the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact is indispensable if we are to become more competitive in the global marketplace."
"Competitiveness is achieved not only by cutting costs but also, and more especially, by creating conditions conducive to private enterprise and by making labour legislation more flexible."
"It is vital that we should encourage all investments, private or public, with a view to ensuring that research and development expenditure reaches 3% of GDP by 2010."
"We must show resolve in this domain in order to halt the steady widening in recent years of the gap between ourselves and the United States and to stop the departure of some of our best brains to other continents."
"To this end, we must focus our efforts on high-tech sectors such as health and biotechnology, defence and space – the Galileo programme sets a good example in this respect – state-of-the-art telecommunications and renewable sources of energy."
"These efforts must not obscure the fact that the economic fabric of Europe is woven by our entrepreneurs and our numerous small- and medium-sized businesses."
"We must take steps to guarantee their sustainability."
"From this perspective, the creation of a tax structure that does not hinder the transfer of ownership of SMEs is an essential requirement."
"The vitality of an economic area is also measured by the quality of its infrastructure, by the modernisation of its channels of communication and by the development of alternatives to road transport."
"Recourse to the Structural Funds to finance investments in the infrastructure, in research and development and in innovation will be useful, and indeed essential, to every – and I do mean every – Member State of the European Union."
"Great importance also attaches to the completion of the trans-European energy networks."
"Moving on to employment, the second point of the triangle, we must live up to the expectations of our fellow citizens, for whom jobs remain the paramount concern."
"We simply must put an end to these policies of handing out assistance and plastering over cracks, which reappear after the slightest gust of wind, and devote ourselves to real structural reforms."
"The creation of 15 million jobs will truly depend on innovation, backed by new imaginative and dynamic policies based on private initiative in the framework of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I note that the President-in-Office of the Council wants to see more jobs and that Mrs Reding has emphasised the need for quality and adaptation in our training systems."
"In the same vein, let me say that we must engage in intensive deliberations about the problem of the demographic deficit and the need to start pursuing sound immigration policies without delay."
"We must reflect together on possible solutions."
"Many people are also concerned about the absence of a social Europe, and yet it is everywhere; it is a reality."
"It is not administered; it is voluntary and serves to encourage equality between the sexes and to curb discrimination."
"I need not add to what Mrs Reding has said on this matter."
"Where special efforts are really required is in the domain of minimum European standards with regard to labour legislation and the social security of permanently mobile workers, standards that will prevent any unfair competition based on low pay and poor working conditions."
"As for the environment, we must bear in mind that our efforts to foster growth and employment must be guided by the aim of sustainable development, one of the guarantors of stability."
"Above all else, we must be strict with ourselves and realistic about the impact of the legislation we adopt."
"For this reason, I believe it would be useful, prior to the adoption of a piece of legislation, to be able to assess the sustainability impact of all EU expenditure under the bill in question."
"It was our political group, incidentally, which tabled this initiative in committee."
"Let me finish by emphasising the importance of the Sixth Environment Action Programme, which should help us to implement the Kyoto Protocol."
"These are the points I wished to emphasise."
"There are many more things that could be said."
"I simply hope that the Lisbon strategy can help us to move forward for the sake of all our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, we are today taking part in what has become almost an annual ritual, namely the debate on the state of the Lisbon strategy in the run up to the Spring Summit. It is useful to go back to basic principles."
"These principles include a renewed European social model, based on common shared values, with a sustainable strategy for solidarity and economic and social development. This catalogue of good intentions does need to be given tangible form, however."
"I believe the saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions is common to all our languages."
"Proclaiming and restating these good intentions year after year is not enough. What is required instead is a critical analysis of how the Lisbon strategy is being implemented."
"This has been clearly stated today, notably by the Commission."
"In this election year I should like to highlight certain issues of particular concern."
"It is all well and good to refer to the internal market and financial services. It should also be borne in mind, however, that the impasse concerning taxation of income from capital and unacceptable monopoly situations needs to be overcome."
"It is all well and good to refer to the development of services, but it is also necessary to respond to the concerns regarding ever-increasing relocation and the need for an industrial strategy for Europe."
"We must therefore prove that we are capable of working together to develop our approach to implementing the Lisbon Agenda."
"Mr President, I hope you will allow me to refer to current developments. Firstly, my group and Parliament as a whole feel that the entry into force of economic and monetary union called for strengthening economic governance."
"I believe that was the majority view enshrined in our stance on the Convention."
"The Commissioner mentioned this. One of the meetings of our leaders has attracted special media attention."
"I refer to the meeting held in Berlin, where the creation of the post of Super-Commissioner for economic affairs was proposed."
"This is certainly an important issue."
"It implies agreement to apply the Community method."
"This is absolutely crucial."
"It also implies agreeing to what the governments were opposed to at the Convention."
"Opinions have changed. It is now deemed necessary to strengthen economic union."
"This can be translated into a corrective approach."
"Readiness to correct is a sign of wisdom."
"There is a willingness to amend the draft constitution in this regard."
"I do not believe the House would have difficulty in offering clear support to such an approach. After all, it does not make sense to discuss the creation of the post of Foreign Minister and not to have an equivalent post for economic affairs."
"I am sure Commissioner Solbes will be happy to support this proposal, or even to defend it before the Commission."
"Another important aspect is involved. Discussion of reform should not be restricted solely to discussion about dismantling social gains and the welfare state."
"The Irish, Dutch, Danish and Swedish models prove conclusively that it is possible to be highly competitive, have an efficient economy whilst enjoying a high level of protection."
"Reform must therefore be based on these models."
"The reform process is not incompatible with retaining the principles that made Europe great."
"I refer to setting the forthcoming financial perspective. The Irish Presidency will be responsible for launching that debate too."
"It is a most important issue, because it so happens that further to that Berlin Summit and to a certain letter, there is talk of wanting to undertake far more activity with far fewer resources. I have in mind for example the Lisbon strategy and enlargement."
"It is all becoming an issue of blind faith. It does not make sense simply to hope for miracles."
"Applying sensible economic principles most certainly does make sense, however. Consequently, in order to discharge its responsibility, the Commission made a proposal presented to the House by Commissioner Barnier."
"The 1.24% of GDP proposed may seem too tight, but we believe it is the minimum worth considering. In France, my home country, and elsewhere in the European Union researchers are out on the streets demonstrating."
"I repeat, the researchers are out on the streets, not just the workers. It is simply not possible to call for more research and then drastically cut resources."
"It is therefore essential to give full support to the plan proposed by Commissioner Reding and developed by Commissioner Busquin."
"As I conclude, Mr President, I should like to mention three more issues. Firstly, we continue to have every confidence in the Irish Presidency and trust that in March it will be able to present a viable proposal aimed at moving the Constitution forward."
"Secondly, we believe the agreement reached in Cyprus must be supported. In our view, it is very important for the future of the Union."
"Lastly, on the occasion of the visit of an Iranian Nobel Prize winner to this House, I would like to say that I believe the Union must stand firm in its support of democracy in Iran. It must also continue to express its criticism of the conduct of elections in that country."
"Mr President, in January Liberals in this House welcomed the presidency's strong focus on the Lisbon Agenda."
"Your priorities for the Spring Summit have restated that commitment."
"Europe is stuck in second gear."
"As America accelerates, as a resurgent Asia pulls into the passing lane, Europe is trailing behind. We must not let the recovery fool us."
"If Europe is picking up speed it has more to do with the slope of the road than with the state of our engine."
"As Commissioner Lamy said a week ago, we have oversold expectations of Lisbon and we have underinvested in results."
"Any sustained economic recovery in Europe has to be built on job creation."
"An export-led return to growth could conceal an American-style jobless recovery that will leave us no better off when the road levels out or when the next climb begins."
"More and better employment is the key to sustained growth and prosperity and the only sustainable route to social cohesion."
"We cannot allow recovery to be a fig leaf for governments reluctant to reform."
"A return to growth can only hide the weaknesses of the European economy; it cannot remove them."
"A failure to use the good times to gain leverage against the bad is the very failing that did for the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This summit must rebuild that pact around a new order of commitment to financial discipline and debt management."
"Governments must free people to work the hours they choose and keep the flexibility they need."
"We have to make work pay and open new ways into work for women and older people."
"We have to end the failures in education and re-education that are limiting the potential of too many Europeans."
"We have to invest more in research and development and foster more competitiveness and innovation."
"The only European social model that matters is the one that preserves our common prosperity for the future."
"We need to set attainable targets and concentrate on delivery."
"We know what needs doing."
"We need delivery on policy, not wish lists and hand-wringing."
"Another 'high level group' will simply deliver another expensive tranche of obvious conclusions."
"While my Group supports job creation and the return of older workers to the employment market, we had more in mind than consultancy positions for retired prime ministers."
"The presidency has rightly identified the need for European governments to act more decisively, not only in Council but at home."
"In many cases the commitments made in Council have been allowed to stall at the transposition stage."
"The latest figures from the Commission show that last month 131 internal market directives – that is 8.5% of the total – have not been fully implemented in at least one Member State – in breach of their own deadlines!"
"We need to be tougher on policing the internal market."
"This Spring Summit has to be about delivery."
"Before June, Liberal Democrats in this House expect final decisions on crucial measures to assist European worker mobility, including in the area of the mutual recognition of qualifications; we want real progress on a framework directive on services, and we feel that it is past time for agreement on a financial services action plan that can free up Europe's capital markets."
"The Lisbon Agenda gave us a decade to reform."
"Five years on, too little has been done."
"We cannot afford to be standing here five years from now wondering how we let Europe get left behind."
"Mr President, four years after the ‘Lisbon Strategy’, which was approved during the Portuguese presidency and which raised so many hopes, the socio-economic situation in the Community, particularly in Portugal, has deteriorated significantly, and not one single objective has been implemented."
"The only decisions that have been approved are liberalisations and privatisations, measures that have reduced job security and increased attacks on public services. In other words, this is the neo-liberal agenda of Europe’s employers, the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employer’s Confederations in Europe, the agenda of the captains of industry, which has become the be-all and end-all of the EU’s economic and social policy."
"Another Spring Summit will soon be upon us, yet, from what we see in the Commission’s report, the economic recipe will be ‘more of the same’."
"Support will continue for the process of liberalisation and privatisation in numerous sectors, from transport to energy, from postal services to telecommunications."
"Blatant bias is shown against the public sector; the struggle of the workers and of others affected by these anti-social policies is ignored; social issues are deemed of secondary importance; and employment policy is based on making work more flexible, on unstable work and on wage restraints."
"Unemployment has risen and the jobs that have been created are scarce. The number of workers on short-term contracts has risen by four million and of those working part time by two million."
"Multinationals continue their relocations, which exacerbate unemployment and hamper development in many regions, as is currently happening in my country. The hardest hit are women and young people."
"Hence our insistence that the Lisbon Strategy must be revised and that a moratorium be placed on liberalisations, in order that economies can be revived and demand can be sustained."
"This is also why we have insisted on pressing for the Stability Pact to be suspended, and replaced by a social progress and employment pact, in line with the objectives of full employment, sustained economic development and economic and social cohesion."
"This is the only way in which we will see more training, more education, more innovation and more research, which are the prerequisites for sustained development in the EU."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to use the three minutes at my disposal to make a few telegraphic-style comments."
"First of all, as regards the diagnosis of the current situation, I shall not labour the point that the traditional economic, social and environmental indicators are not very good."
"The reports from the Commission are fairly clear on this matter."
"There are three points I should like to emphasise which have not featured very often in this debate."
"The first thing that strikes me is the diversity of conditions among the various countries of the Union."
"If you look at countries such as Denmark, Sweden or Finland, you see economies which maintain high social and environmental standards and are also globally competitive."
"These examples should give us food for thought."
"It therefore seems to me that any sweeping statements about the European economic situation need to be put into sharper focus."
"The second point that strikes me about the diagnosis relates to job creation."
"I never hear any mention of the need for differentiation between strategies adopted for areas of economic activity that are fully immersed in the maelstrom of international competition, for commercial activities that are relatively well protected from international competition and for non-commercial activities."
"And yet many analyses show us that these last two areas offer the greatest scope for job creation."
"The third and final point, which is rarely heard in this assessment, is an evaluation of liberalisation: are we really sure that liberalisation actually improves the supply situation, that it encourages innovation and that, as Mr Monti likes to repeat, it lowers prices?"
"I am not so sure."
"I believe it has created numerous oligopolies."
"Mr President-in-Office, our concern with regard to this European Council summit is as follows: whenever we read your presidency papers, and when we read the letter from the Conservative and Socialist Prime Ministers and Heads of State who gathered in Berlin, we fear that the progress made by the European Council in Gothenburg is being rolled back, in other words that we are returning to the old ‘either-or’ philosophy which says that high environmental standards and social provisions guaranteeing a certain standard of living are incompatible with competitiveness and job creation."
"This is an old chestnut."
"It has surfaced again in connection with the REACH programme, for example."
"If the European Council wants to make constructive proposals, I would commend to it the adoption of an industrial policy that benefits the environment."
"How can it be that the Commission presents a good paper on environmental technology but does not accompany it with a road map for the funding and implementation of its proposals?"
"To supplement the funds provided by the European Investment Bank, why should we not moot the idea of a grand European public loan to fund sustainable development, since we are in a part of the world where savings are in great abundance and serve to fund the US deficits?"
"Finally, Mr Solbes, as regards prices policy or, to be more precise, the redirection of state aid and subsidies, Ecofin was supposed to present a five-year plan designed to phase out the subsidisation of environmentally harmful activities."
"Nothing has happened."
"Ensuring that prices reflect the true cost of production, including the social cost, would be another task for the Ecofin Council."
"Lastly, in order to move the process forward, it would also be desirable to make use of European legislation on public procurement, which permits recourse to environmental technology."
"I could say a lot more, but three minutes is such a short time for such a broad subject."
"You got quite a lot into three minutes there!"
"Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that the forthcoming summit of the European Union leaders will primarily focus on how best we can improve the economic and competitive position of the EU."
"We all support the goals laid down by the EU leaders in terms of implementing the Lisbon strategy."
"We all too want to ensure that the EU does become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"We have seen advances in the policy areas of research and development, financial services, the liberalisation of energy and telecommunication markets, environmental protection and regulatory reforms; it is now much easier for workers and students to move around the EU to access jobs and education; it is easier to set up and run a small business; consumers are already enjoying cheaper telephone calls; significant strides have been made in terms of equality and social protection; the internal market itself has helped to create two and a half million jobs in Europe within the last ten years alone, and yet, despite these achievements, it is increasingly clear that unless we implement a broader policy reform programme in Europe we will not make the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"Negotiations are taking place with regard to the financial perspectives of the EU for the period after 2006 and priority attention must be given to ensure that EU budgetary measures support initiatives to bring about sustainable growth and increased employment in accordance with the Lisbon strategy."
"I support the implementation of the 'action for growth' initiative, which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks."
"The financial services action plan must be implemented to ensure there will be an integrated financial service market in the EU by 2005."
"This will ensure that banks, fund managers and insurers will be able to operate on an EU-wide basis, which is good news both for the future development of the financial services industry and for the consumers of these services."
"A corporate governance and auditing action plan must be supported to ensure that EU business practice operates to the highest international standards."
"A new Community patenting system must also be implemented within the EU."
"Our Community customs code must be changed to ensure that we strengthen and modernise the EU customs policies."
"I support the building of a better regulatory environment in Europe."
"All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for their impact on enterprise and competitiveness."
"For the EU to remain competitive we must all take advantage of the new and evolving information technologies."
"The new eEurope 2005 programme must seek to introduce a greater level of broadband to schools and libraries so as to guarantee access to high speed internet services and increase skills development for all our young people."
"The pan-European eGovernment services initiative must also be completed to ensure that the provision of public and government services is available online."
"That is why I support the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Mr President, in this magical world of the European Union, we never let reality intrude on our dreams, and from one summit to the next we go on regaling each other with fascinating fairy tales, such as the Lisbon Strategy or the European Constitution."
"In actual fact, the European Union, and particularly Euroland, is the Sick Man of the global economy."
"Only yesterday, we learned that Euroland had seen its external balance of trade fall by 58% in 2003, a drop that was entirely ascribable to the decline in its industrial exports."
"In all aspects of the game, Commissioner – growth, employment, investment and competitiveness – Euroland is being outplayed by all the other economic and monetary areas, including Japan now."
"But Mr Solbes and Mr Trichet, in their respective domains, continue to strut the stage regardless and, like Diafoirus the physician and his son in Molière’s , to fob us off with their wrong diagnoses: ‘The diagnoses are the thing, I tell you’, says Diafoirus Solbes."
"Have no doubt, gentlemen: with this medicine of yours, Europe will soon be a picture of health as she lies in her coffin."
"I am glad to say, however, that the Stability Pact is dead and buried, and its demise came at the hands of those who had wanted it but then changed their minds, as they are entitled to do, namely France and Germany."
"So there is no point, Mr Bigliardo – and I see he is not even here – in penning a tardy hagiography and, for some rather incomprehensible reasons, venting your spleen in aggressive tirades against France."
"The zeal of the convert, no doubt."
"As for you, Mr Solbes, it seems to me that you would do very well to use your few remaining months in office to put away your wooden sword, which has not served you very well, and to withdraw the action you brought against the Council before the European Court of Justice, which is essentially the sort of thing that could lead to a veritable war of secession in Europe."
"You would do better to ask yourself some questions about the euro, as the Italian President of the Council did."
"It is the euro that is obstructing the recovery of Euroland, because it has become the passive adjustment variable of the real monetary and commercial challenge to the United States and Asia."
"This point can be satisfactorily proved by comparing, even on the basis of the Lisbon objectives, the performances of the Euroland countries with those of their non-Euroland partners within the Union."
"So for pity’s sake, gentlemen, since we are coming to the end of this legislative term, open your eyes, rub the scales from them and face up to reality!"
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, Commissioner Reding, I too am tired of always hearing the refrain or mantra of the Lisbon objectives."
"One reason is because we repeat them in an attempt to convince ourselves that we will succeed in doing things in Europe that we are not capable of."
"We are discussing public budgets, we are discussing the role that European public administration and public administrations in individual States can play in promoting the economies of research and innovation."
"We are doing this at a time when the European Union Financial Perspective provides for a budget in which agricultural expenditure will still take up between 40% and 50% of the resources."
"Does the Commission think that spending on agriculture will achieve the Lisbon objectives?"
"If it does not have the courage to discuss this, in terms of the European Union’s budget, then it will be very difficult to make use of a lever as important as European expenditure – to benefit technological innovation and scientific research."
"While discussing the Stability and Growth Pact we have seen major governments – in countries that are essential for the European Union and even more so for the eurozone – hold discussions to arrive at a deficit equal to 4 or 5% of the public budget."
"I ask myself if it would not be possible for countries such as France and Germany – where public spending is equal to or greater than 50% of GDP – to find the necessary funds in these extremely substantial resources to make infrastructure investments and to develop scientific research and training, in particular, at university level."
"Another major European country provides us with an example."
"Unlike Mr Abitbol, I do not believe that the United Kingdom’s better economic performance results from the fact that the British have kept the pound and have not adopted the euro."
"The UK provides an important example in which a committee – not the Blair government but a government committee – indicates that 80 000 civil service jobs might be cut, in order to make savings of EUR 20 billion – in other words 1.5% of the United Kingdom’s GDP – which would be earmarked for schools, health and security."
"Resources need to be found from within public budgets, and we need to have the courage to take such costly political decisions."
"Two further points are the European Union’s prospects and economic growth."
"We have read – for the moment just in newspapers – the text drawn up by Commissioner Lamy’s committee of experts – this is not yet about what Commissioner Lamy says – which calls for international trade to be linked to national values in Europe."
"This means putting the European Union on the road towards protectionism."
"Is this how we want to grow economically?"
"Finally, Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, Commissioner Reding, I would like to focus on the issue of immigration."
"Just a month ago the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Anna, came here to urge Europe to adopt a more open policy, first and foremost in the interest of Europe itself and its economy."
"How does Europe respond?"
"It responds by closing the borders of the Europe of Fifteen to workers from the enlarged Europe."
"Workers from the ten countries that will join the European Union will be second-class workers; we will have workers who are from the Community but who are nevertheless illegal."
"This is, for example, the response as regards immigration."
"Even from this point of view, rather than accepting the challenge of enlargement, Europe closes in."
"The Europe that closes in is not moving towards Lisbon but towards economic growth that is increasingly insignificant compared to the growth enjoyed by the United States and now also by Japan. Europe is, however, choosing its own destiny."
". – Mr President, ours is the enormous task of creating a new synthesis of the goals our society has set itself whilst at the same time remaining committed to the ideals that are characteristic of Europe and for which it is known."
"We have to create a new synthesis between work as a factor in social integration, equality of opportunity and the economic demands of competitiveness and job creation."
"What I have quoted from Jacques Delors’ 1993 White Paper is no less relevant today, and I believe that the failure to transpose this White Paper, despite the praise heaped upon it by all the Heads of State or Government and by this European Parliament, and despite the endorsement they gave it, demonstrates how important it is that the Lisbon process should no longer be allowed to stagnate, but that, instead, we should do everything possible – which, fortunately, the Irish Presidency of the Council is willing to do – to implement it at national and local level."
"I regret the failure to make progress in implementing it, and the primary reason why we should all share in that regret is that all the Member States are hiding behind the argument that there is that further progress is financially unsustainable."
"I believe that this excuse should no longer be considered appropriate, firstly because we now have the investment initiative – even though it is quite modest and will certainly not have the effects that the Marshall Plan, with even less money, did in reconstructing Europe – and, secondly, because we are giving no thought to how better coordination by the Member States can recover lost revenue, not only through the fight against organised crime and the black economy, but also – and primarily – by combating tax evasion."
"From VAT alone, it would be possible to raise an extra EUR 100 billion per annum, with which we would be able to manage to provide far more credible funding."
"I think it is also high time that we thought, when it comes to raising funds today, no longer only in terms of the European Investment Bank and its contributions to the organising of growth – valuable though they indeed are – but also to reconsider and examine the possibility of the European Union at last applying an instrument we debated as long ago as 1993, and inviting subscription to Eurobonds."
"Although this year’s Spring Summit must indeed create confidence – which is what we demanded that the Thessaloniki Spring Summit should do – it must also make it clear that we, in Europe, can be seen to add value by all pulling together."
"Vitally important though investments in the computer field and in information technology most certainly are, there are other areas in which we can invest: in the environment, in saving energy, in alternative energies, in order to generate sustainable growth accompanied by job creation, and – as has rightly been said – there is such a thing as investment in people, the European Union’s most valuable raw material, not only in early childhood but also in tertiary education and lifelong learning."
"One thing, though, I do not want to omit, and that is our need, alongside investment in people’s education and training, for investment in social services."
"To take one example, we will never be able to reconcile work and family life in Europe unless childcare provision is improved."
"This is where Europe, in most but not all of the Member States, has a lot of catching up to do."
"The World Commission on Sustainability and Globalisation too, backs up our demand in its report, published this week, and I think this shows us that what is needed today is no longer merely prescriptions of what is to be done, but the political willingness to join forces."
"No longer can Europe wait for growth in the United States; it must pull itself by its own bootstraps out of the swamp of mass unemployment, inadequate investment and inability to coordinate."
"I believe this to be a challenge for this Spring Summit, and I very much hope that it will succeed in persuading governments that the action they have taken to date will not be enough to prepare us for the future, which is vital to all of us and to generations yet to come."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2003 the European Commission was obliged to revise its economic forecasts downwards for the third year running."
"The rate of GDP growth in the euro zone in 2003 fell once again, from 3.5% in 2000 to 1.5% in 2001, 0.9% in 2002 and 0.5% in 2003, which means that the European economy was close to stagnation."
"These problems started the debate within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and have led to the report that I am presenting in this House today."
"It is a report that takes into consideration some important needs, first and foremost the need to properly understand what the Stability and Growth Pact currently means for Europe."
"The increasingly pressing question is whether or not there can be stability without real growth."
"We have tried to answer this question because we realised that what happened when the Ecofin Council adopted its well-known position as regards the problems faced by France and Germany is that our Europe has different opinions and was divided on such a significant issue."
"There is no doubt that keeping the Stability and Growth Pact under 3% is an essential condition, especially today when – faced with enlargement – we must keep ordered and regular budgets."
"This is why the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs insisted on countries from Eastern Europe being called upon to follow Europe’s lead, and balance their budgets and in future present a more encouraging prospect."
"Nevertheless, I also believe that we cannot continue to treat an important problem, such as that of the Stability and Growth Pact, as a political issue."
"There are large countries that have invested a great deal and which, in my opinion, also have the right, even the duty, to carry out structural reforms, for which appropriate deadlines are needed, for individual States to put their budgets in order."
"I am referring in particular to France, which has started to take this route, and to Germany, which has paid a considerable price for its efforts to reunite with the former East Germany."
"In this situation, we believe that public investment must be used to kick-start the stalled economy and that the value of the euro and the euro/dollar rate must be looked into."
"As has already been stated by Mrs Randzio-Plath, whom I thank for her cooperation in drawing up these two reports, Europe is facing a situation in which it must determine its own precise and unique approach independent of all economic links with the United States."
"In this regard, we must get started on the Lisbon strategy, on which we are seriously behind schedule. The plan is to invest more in research and, above all, to launch a policy that solves the global problems of unemployment and that, with development, allows our young generations to hope fora secureand fruitful working relationship in Europe."
"These are the objectives of the important report that we have adopted and passed in the committee and which we will vote on tomorrow in this House, with a political and economic forecast that is in no way negative but which, instead, makes use of all of the work carried out by the European Parliament in this parliamentary term."
"We believe that Parliament is an institution that should have a greater say in all types of analysis and economic forecasting."
"In order to remain consistent, the European Parliament should, in future, play a leading role in major economic analysis forecasting and become involved in the valuable work that the Commission is already undertaking."
"I would like to thank all those who cooperated and I hope that we can open a fruitful debate."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, looking around the Chamber, I get the feeling that it is not yet clear to some people – most of us, indeed – that meeting the Lisbon objectives, a policy for growth and employment, and hence the Spring Summit, rank alongside the constitution, enlargement, the European elections and the appointment of the Commission as the European Union’s most important policy area and the most important thing it has to deal with this year."
"I think we need once and for all to stop weeping and wailing and apportioning blame; instead, let us for once remember that we have adopted enough resolutions and set ourselves enough targets, that now is the time to at last abide by the resolutions and buckle down to achieving the objectives."
"It is positively paradoxical that it should be Germany, France and the United Kingdom who have agreed that they want to plant a super-Commissioner in Brussels to handle economic coordination, that it should be they of all countries, one of which is not in the euro zone and is blocking the constitution that will make Europe stronger on the world stage, and the other two break EU law by breaching the Stability and Growth Pact, even obliging the Commission to go to the European Court of Justice."
"I do not believe that a super-Commissioner can make up for the Member States’ lack of political will, and, rather than allowing him to distract us, we should once and for all put into practice the resolutions we have adopted, which means putting them to work in the Member States."
"I have to tell Mr Della Vedova that this also applies to the agricultural budget."
"The fact is that it was these Heads of State or Government who had already decided that, because the agricultural budget was to remain stable and on this level from 2006 to 2013, no change was possible – something that I welcome."
"Continually casting doubt on decisions already made, rather than implementing them, weakens us all."
"There are those in this House – those on the Left, for example – who say that the Stability and Growth Pact is the reason why the Member States do not do their homework, but I then have to tell you that it is Germany and France – two prominent countries – that are jeopardising the Stability and Growth Pact and failing to abide by it."
"It is the same two countries that head the list of those who are failing to transpose the internal market directives, and the same two countries that are also foremost in calling for a super-Commissioner."
"We need stability and growth, for on them competitiveness depends, itself the foundation of growth and employment, without which there is no social cohesion."
"Let us stop playing the market off against the state, and instead push for our system of the social market economy, which leads to social cohesion."
"Let us stop playing investments and debts off against each other, and instead stick to that to which we have committed ourselves."
"Mr President, the Lisbon strategy remains the most coherent means of making Europe a centre of economic, social and environmental excellence."
"But it is not enough for Europe to proclaim its ambitions; it must also equip itself with the means to achieve them."
"Budgetary austerity is no such means, even though stability remains an aim that must be resolutely pursued."
"For all that, balanced public expenditure would be much easier to achieve if the European economy started growing again."
"The Right preaches austerity to us, claiming to defend future generations against the burdens imposed by our generation."
"But what will future generations say if we leave them a world characterised by gross inequalities, where insecurity and unemployment marginalise more and more of the population?"
"The virtues of American flexibility are extolled to us."
"And yet the unemployment rate in the United States currently stands at about six per cent of all active jobseekers."
"This concept of actively seeking work is important, because it has served to remove five million Americans from the unemployment statistics since President Bush took office."
"Moreover, the country with the Statue of Liberty keeps 2.2 million adults of working age in captivity in its prisons."
"The American social model is manifestly not to be recommended."
"In the realms of research and of public and private investment, on the other hand, Europe should indeed draw inspiration from the United States."
"Where Europeans see risks, as in the domain of biotechnology, the Americans see opportunities."
"While our Union invests some 700 million euros a year in biotechnological research, the United States invests 25 billion dollars a year in its National Health Institutes."
"Europe has set itself the objective of allocating three per cent of its GDP to research."
"But where is the cash?"
"In the meantime, 400 000 European scientists are working in America."
"Major European companies, such as Nokia, are investing more in their research in the United States than in Europe."
"The same applies to investments in infrastructure."
"The European Union has just produced a 62-billion-euro plan to revitalise the trans-European networks between now and 2010."
"The U.S. Senate, meanwhile, is discussing a project to spend 318 billion dollars on improving the motorway network alone over a six-year period after the House of Representatives had originally called for an appropriation of 375 billion."
"When people preach American competitiveness to us, we have to analyse the real facts behind the statistics."
"Europe will not become the world’s most competitive economy by jettisoning its social model or by getting rid of high-quality services of general interest."
"Europe must invest more in its human capital, more in research and more in its physical infrastructure."
"The next summit, Mr President-in-Office, must be the harbinger of a European spring."
"Mr President, the Spring Summits have unfortunately always been more about words than deeds."
"To that extent, results have not been forthcoming."
"Consequently, the Irish Presidency must be called upon to follow through its own initiative, so that this time we are not left with mere words."
"At what has been termed the Berlin Summit between Chancellor Schröder, Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac, the three gentlemen proposed the creation of a new post of Deputy President of the Commission, popularly known as the post of super-Commissioner, with responsibility for coordinating all the issues relating to economic reforms of the EU."
"Naturally, there must be greater focus on economic reforms, but I start to get concerned when the ‘three tenors’ talk about the necessary industrial development of Europe."
"Hopefully, we are not talking about more relaxed enforcement both of the rules governing state subsidies and of competition policy in general."
"That is the last thing Europe needs."
"It would remove the focus from what should be done in terms, namely, of real structural reform in many Member States and more investment in research and education."
"The latter could be financed by bringing forward the badly needed reforms of agricultural policy."
"Structural reforms are about stopping the trend towards ever increasing taxation, ensuring flexible labour markets and keeping the growth of public expenditure at a sustainable level."
"We must not be like Mogens Lykketoft, the leader of the opposition in Denmark, and propose introducing a penalty duty to be paid by enterprises each time they give notice to an employee over 50 years of age."
"That would prevent the recruitment of older staff, make the labour market inflexible and cause the loss of jobs."
"It is no solution."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support the two reports by, respectively, Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Bigliardo, as adopted by the committee, but not the proposed amendments to these."
"Mr President, the torrent of words, not to say hot air, about the main guidelines can no longer obscure the fact that the Lisbon process has stalled and that the European Union has no economic policy."
"This, in fact, has been a recurring problem since the birth of economic and monetary union, in spite of all the proposals that have been made."
"There is, of course, an issue of governance."
"Mr Blair, Mr Chirac and Mr Schroeder are proposing a super-minister."
"And why not?"
"But what use is a minister if nobody knows how to solve the underlying problem?"
"What is more interesting is the observation in Mrs Randzio-Plath’s report to the effect that governance suffers from a democratic deficit."
"She calls for debates in each country, in each national parliament, debates to which the whole of society should be able to contribute, before the springtime meeting of the Council."
"I may tell you, however, that such a proposal was carried by this Parliament back in 1996, following my report on public participation in the Union’s institutional system, but it was never implemented, and this Parliament has not pursued the matter."
"In essence, structural reform is something of a magic formula."
"Reforms are indispensable, but clearly the real issues are their direction and substance and the need to avoid contradictions."
"If we take the case of the labour market, positive mobility is essential, yet at the same time the Member States are taking decisions designed to prevent workers from the new Member States from exercising freedom of movement within the European labour market."
"The European Union must therefore create a wider range of incentives, particularly for the much-vaunted development of human capital, an effort that will undoubtedly require a high volume of resources which we are not mobilising at the present time."
"People speak of industrial policy, but that has not been functioning properly since the time of the Maastricht Treaty."
"As far as funding goes, it has been established that investments of general interest will not be made without an increase in Community resources."
"And I must emphasise that the authors of the Lisbon objectives also proposed that public funds devoted to priority projects be exempted from the discipline of the Stability Pact."
"But that is not all."
"Everyone knows that there are large sums of money flowing into portfolio investments and restructuring but not into industrial investment."
"One fundamental problem is therefore that credit facilities, the tax system and savings rules provide insufficient incentive for industrial investment."
"At a time when the falling dollar is strangling our recovery, it is not actually enough for the Central Bank to effect a general cut in interest rates at the risk of deepening the liquidity trap – what is required is a genuine policy of differentiated credit conditions based on the Lisbon objectives."
"Mr President, the Spring Summit must be an opportunity to re-evaluate the Lisbon agenda with a greater emphasis on the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development."
"We cannot just focus on competition and a free market economy to deliver the type of Europe that we want."
"This was agreed in Lisbon and in Gothenburg but is not being implemented."
"The so-called big three meeting between Britain, France and Germany last week proved that, despite the leadership shown by the Irish presidency and the fact that many small states would be joining the EU in May – half of them smaller than Wales, the constituency that I represent – the big Member States still wanted to dictate the agenda."
"Their focus is on economic reform and flexibility, to the detriment of quality employment, better pay and conditions, greater attention to caring needs, the sustainable use of resources and creating an inclusive society."
"These issues have to be given priority at this Spring Summit if we are to achieve sustainability and quality in Europe in the future."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank both rapporteurs for their work on this very important issue."
"One of the most difficult areas for any government or European institution to deal with is the very rapid change that is taking place in the global economic circumstances."
"We need to ensure that our policies are flexible enough to be able to respond quickly to those difficulties and upsets."
"It has been our experience over the last number of years, in particular since the introduction of the Stability and Growth Pact in 1996, that by a stringent fiscal management policy, a response to altering currency differentials and an investment – in core human terms – with regard to education, infrastructure, development and so on, we can respond to those changes and difficulties which occur."
"I am delighted that the Irish presidency has highlighted the importance of continuing to implement the Lisbon agenda, and I hope that in the next social summit meeting, as well as at the March summit, those ideals will be ensconced into every Member State and that they will all move forward and move away from the old ideology of increasing taxes."
"That is not only a failed policy; it has also been proved that those that have the highest tax levels within the European Union are the ones that have performed the 'least best' in the changing climate."
"– Mr President, in five years, ten months and four days, we will be in 2010, the year by which, as agreed at Lisbon, the European Union should be the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy."
"That leaves us little time to achieve an ambitious objective, which has, so far, been the subject of much discussion, but of little else."
"When I read the reports by my fellow-Members about the state of the economy today, then there is reason to face that short time with some trepidation."
"In this joint debate, we are dealing with two reports about economic policy and public finances in the EMU and a resolution for the forthcoming Spring Summit."
"Both reports focus on what has happened to date and what is not going well yet, whereas the resolution for the forthcoming Spring Summit outlines expectations and desires."
"At the moment, those expectations are, above all, agreements on paper."
"Economic growth is moderate; the Member States are facing budgetary problems and the economy of the United States is currently growing faster than that of the European Union."
"We are therefore a long way from being the world's most competitive region."
"I can, in part, support the draft resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"The objectives of the Lisbon process have been pitched too high and defined in an insufficiently clear manner."
"That is why it is of major importance to make adjustments now."
"First of all, the objectives should be reconsidered and defined more clearly."
"We will then perhaps obtain achievable objectives."
"You will appreciate that achievable objectives will help this House speak out more emphatically about the progress of that process."
"Furthermore, it is, above all, in respect of the implementation of the Lisbon agreements that adjustments must be made."
"If that is done, then we will not be bogged down in discussions on how things can be improved, but what is being said here today will also be put into practice."
"Mr President, the reports for the Spring Summit of the European Council compel us to draw an overwhelming conclusion, which I shall summarise here. At its Lisbon Summit in 2000, the Council formulated the aim that the European Union should become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"In actual fact, we have tended to decline in every respect since then, with the result that we are now further away from that aim."
"All the indicators have fallen into the red – especially in the euro area, I might add. Let me illustrate this with a few examples: growth slowing down to 0.4% in 2003, rising unemployment, productivity lagging behind that of the United States, declining public and private investment, worsening budgetary balances and a lack of any clear impetus in the direction of structural reforms."
"Faced with this situation – a disastrous situation, to be perfectly honest – what proposals do we hear?"
"That we should be more resolute in pursuing our present policies, designed primarily to defragment the internal market, to support research and innovation and to increase investment in human capital as a matter of priority."
"All of these are very admirable objectives, but in fact they may not solve anything, because they do not go to the heart of the problem."
"The large countries of the euro area are ailing, but their cure can only come from themselves."
"The Union can certainly assist them, but only by helping to liberate and protect the creators of wealth."
"‘Liberate’ and ‘protect’ are the two key words."
"In actual fact, however, we are doing the opposite."
"We are not having a liberating effect at the European level, because every day we adopt new regulations, entangling governments and businesses in ever more complex and costly decision-making systems."
"Every day we add new rigidity."
"Yesterday it was the standardisation of monetary policy for twelve countries; tomorrow it will be a European constitution which, by its very nature, runs counter to the flexible Europe that we need."
"Every day we add new taxes, and the European tax proposed by the Commission during the preparation of the next financial perspective is the latest manifestation of this trend."
"At the same time, the Union does not afford its economy enough protection."
"Its competition policy does not take sufficient account of the pressing need to create major European conglomerates."
"It is selling off the Community preference at knock-down prices in industry as in agriculture."
"Even now it is in the process of agreeing to the use of European wine designations by producers outside the Community."
"Finally, it has been instrumental in allowing the entry of unskilled immigrants who do not meet the needs of our economy and who impose a heavy burden on our welfare budgets."
"In short, we are doing the opposite of what is needed."
"Mr President, we must not be surprised when we reap what we have sown."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to clarify Mr Abitbol’s speech a little: Mr Berlusconi has never said that the euro is blocking the economy, but he said something else, which is that the introduction of the euro has led to bursts of speculation, which definitely must be eliminated."
"I can, therefore, confirm that Italy is a strong supporter of European unity, without any ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’, and – in my opinion – the single currency will benefit the European economy in the future."
"After this introduction, I would like to congratulate Mr Bigliardo on the report that he has presented, which is an in-depth study into the European economic situation, and also an attempt to interpret the Stability and Growth Pact in a new way, by looking carefully at European Union public finances."
"The recovery of the economy which began in 2002 showed itself to be short-lived and it certainly did not trigger a sufficiently powerful trend towards economic growth."
"Amongst other things, the European Union has seen an increase in unemployment and a gradual weakening of public finances."
"At the same time, the strong euro has created difficulties for exports and the trend of slowly falling inflation has caused consumption to reach a standstill."
"On the basis of the examination of these problems, we must ask ourselves whether the rigidity of the Stability and Growth Pact might have had a negative effect on the growth in productivity and on the increase in employment."
"In order to improve the flexibility of the labour market, we will certainly have to remove the remaining obstacles, adopt the recognition of professional qualifications and establish business incentives linked to productivity."
"Similarly, programmes seeking to modernise production processes must be stepped up, and it is essential that further investment is channelled into the research and development sectors."
"We therefore fully agree with the objective to bring, by the end of the decade, spending on research and development to 3% of GDP, of which two-thirds should, as approved by the Barcelona Council, go to the private sector, to reward small- and medium-sized enterprises for their participation in these processes."
"We will then be happy if, they at least, are not in future included within the total expenditure that balances the budget deficit, which must remain below 3% of GDP."
"Economic growth in a given area depends largely on the investments that have been planned and made and on the priorities that have been set."
"Certainly, the transit corridors and goods and passenger transport networks must receive greater attention."
"In implementing and developing the networks we need to provide for the completion of main routes, the elimination of existing bottlenecks, in particular in cross-border areas, by developing connections and strategic inter-connections."
"Furthermore, it should be recalled that when putting infrastructures in place for direct connections consideration must be given not only to the central regions of Europe but also to the peripheral regions of the Community."
"This would effectively guarantee genuine freedom of movement of people and goods within the European territory and would pave the way for strategic interconnection with the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries."
"Of course, projects of such scale require extremely substantial financial investments, which cannot contravene the strict provisions of the current Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Pact must, therefore, be read and interpreted in a more flexible manner, but it must also be seen as a guarantee of stability in Europe."
"Its existence, which was saved and safeguarded by the prudent and intelligent choices made under the Italian Presidency, must be protected and confirmed, but with a more objectively realistic vision of the European economic framework."
"Mr President, the European Union is on the cusp of a whirlwind of change: we have enlargement within a few weeks, we have a new constitution being negotiated, we have – hopefully – the possible reform of the broad economic guidelines, the Stability and Growth Pact and the application of Structural Funds."
"This is all in a world which is already topsy-turvy in terms of international trade and the whole issue of security and so on."
"The question is, are we ready to deal with all of these challenges?"
"I do not think the signs are good in that respect."
"In relation to enlargement, we already see that virtually all states are running in panic to protect their labour markets."
"We see a situation where the most prosperous of the Member States are saying 'not a penny more'."
"We have a situation where a self-selected decides that what is best for the European Union is a 'Super Commissioner' for Economic Affairs."
"Fine!"
"I have no problem with that, but where is the proposal for a 'Super Commissioner' for a socially-inclusive, cohesive and sustainable European society?"
"Economics are fine, they are very important in terms of developing a single market, but they are a very narrow focus for creating a socially-inclusive and sustainable European society."
"Our concern is that we have a lot of proposals, many of them very good, but we have virtually no joined-up government in the European Union."
"I am fearful that we are not going to get that in the current period."
"We are facing a period when we will have a new Parliament and a new Commission within a few months: all of these things will be challenges for our institutions and we still seem to be bogged down in focusing purely and simply on competitiveness – which, of course, I do not deny is important, but it is only one half of the story."
"We need to put social inclusion and social cohesion goals at the heart of our social protection policies when we are talking about reform of that area in the Lisbon process."
"We need to ensure, however, that when the Stability and Growth Pact is reformed – as it should be – states which invest in education and training are not penalised as a result."
"We must build a dynamic into the Lisbon process by ensuring that the Stability and Growth Pact actually provides for growth as well as stability, and the best way of doing that is to ensure that there are incentives to invest in what will drive the economy: well-trained, satisfied workers who have good jobs and provide the productivity that we need."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when the Spring Summit takes place next month, it will be four years exactly since our European economic ambitions were laid down and welcomed in Lisbon."
"Regrettably, during those past four years, the necessary progress has not been made in order to realise those ambitions."
"It is abundantly clear where the problem lies: the Member States are not pro-active enough in order to make the European economy competitive and dynamic."
"In anticipation of the Spring Summit, President Chirac, Chancellor Schröder and Mr Blair put their heads together in order to breathe new life into Project Europe, or so we were told."
"Such a get-together rarely benefits our European economy."
"After all, they do nothing but work out a common denominator based on their own national interests, which the rest of Europe has to accept."
"That our European economy is currently at a standstill is due to the poor functioning of the German and French labour markets."
"Was it not, in fact, France and Germany that saddled us with agreements about the agricultural budget, as a result of which we are now facing an enormous rise in the European budget following enlargement?"
"And who will be footing the bill?"
"Certainly not Great Britain, for that country is firmly holding onto its rebate."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party believes that the heaviest burdens should rest on the strongest shoulders, but that involves all of them."
"With this resolution, we are urging the Member States to work on the Lisbon objectives and keep their economies healthy."
"We, in the European Parliament, however, may not saddle industry with unnecessarily heavy administrative and financial burdens, as is the case with the proposed ‘REACH’ chemicals policy."
"It is only the Member States, though, that can ensure that Europe remains competitive at world level."
"It is important in that respect that the Stability Pact should be upheld and that every country should keep its budget in order."
"That alone can bring prosperity and a rise in employment, which is what the public so desperately need."
"Mr President, it is interesting to hear this discussion because this House is in unusual agreement about the situation of the European economy."
"In almost every speech, we hear about the low growth rate, falling investments, increasing unemployment and the disappearance of capital and of highly qualified labour etc. It is a tone quite different to that we heard three or four years ago when there was a lot of optimism."
"I believe that this set of problems has to be taken very seriously."
"My own view is that a long-term growth policy is needed, with the emphasis upon infrastructure, the environment, technological development, the development of human capital and such matters as have been addressed by many of the speakers."
"The issue is, which of the prior conditions are the most important."
"I believe that responsibility for this new policy must lie with the Member States."
"My impression is that the EU does not have the political strength, unity and economic prospects needed to lead such a policy and to put Europe back on the right road."
"The Member States must produce the growth package in the form of national policies based on large-scale public-private cooperation."
"In my own country of Sweden, the strongest periods of growth have in general emerged from national ventures in which public policies have combined with trade and industry to succeed in creating especially favourable effects."
"I wish especially to indicate the importance and significance of the public sector’s playing an active role in such contexts, both because it is important for employment and because it consumes large portions of resources."
"– Mr President, the European Union is in a difficult situation; our monetary policy is centralised, with responsibility for it resting with the European Central Bank, whilst financial and economic policy is decentralised."
"The connecting link that enables the whole thing to function, and allows us to develop the internal market, is the Stability and Growth Pact, and let me say here and now that I urge us all to adhere to it, including the Eurozone’s two biggest countries, Germany and France."
"We therefore support the Commission in its case before the European Court of Justice, in which it is seeking to prevent the competences under the Stability and Growth Pact from becoming obscured."
"On its own, though, that is not enough; achievement of the Lisbon target is a task not only for the Member States, but also for the Commission and Parliament."
"It is for the Member States to bring forward the reforms that are needed in the labour market, in the social field, in fiscal policy, in making locations attractive and in promoting forward-looking sectors of industry."
"That is for the Member States to do, and we cannot discharge them from that responsibility."
"It is for the Commission to set a sound industrial policy in motion, something we have, over recent years, neglected to institute in parallel with the promotion of the service sector and the phasing-in of the European internal market."
"Over and over again, considerations of consumer and environmental protection predominated."
"If we want to stake a claim on our place in the world, then this is where we have to move forward."
"I call upon the Commission to give serious consideration to imposing a moratorium of between three and five years on environmental and consumer legislation."
"That is the only way in which we will actually reach the Lisbon objectives, for so far we have done no more than prepare for the journey; we have actually remained standing still."
"Only a moratorium of this kind on the part of the European Union, which in any case leads the world in protecting the environment and people at work, and in the social field, can enable us to become what we decided at Lisbon that we wanted to be – the most competitive region in the world."
"– Mr President, I am almost tempted to start a debate with Mr Langen on moratoriums;"
"I opposed moratoriums in biotechnology, and I would be against one in this case too."
"I would prefer, though, to concentrate on research, for we need a policy on it if the European economy is to be competitive."
"The astonishing thing is that this is an area about which we are all agreed, and yet, especially in the Member States, it has experienced cutbacks over recent years."
"Most spectacularly of all, in France – for the first time in Europe – researchers are even taking to the streets, and their counterparts elsewhere are perfectly prepared to do likewise, so it is not just the farmers who are demonstrating; the researchers are obviously doing it too."
"I see that as interesting, but also regrettable, for this makes it quite plain how the high-flown utterances of Heads of State or Government contrast with the austerity of their actions."
"Now, along come the finance ministers and tell us that there is no money."
"The question is, though, whether we cannot do any research because we have no money, or whether we have no money because we are not doing any research."
"To take just one Member State as an example, Finland shows us very clearly how it is possible, even when times are hard, to succeed by investing in the future."
"Today, Finland keeps on being hailed as the highest-achieving country in the European Union, and it has not even been a Member State for that long."
"What this means is that Finland has done a great deal, even without the European Union."
"So I would urge us in this House to keep on track in campaigning for the 3% expenditure on research and for the launching of an innovation strategy for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"I will conclude by urging Members to this House to be present at the Science Convention that we intend to organise in Brussels for early April, in order to make it clear that this strategy still enjoys support from this House, at least."
"Mr President, I deplore the fact that the report on public finances insists on supporting the Commission’s determination to comply, to the letter, with the provisions contained in the Stability Pact. This constitutes slavish devotion to the current orthodoxy in economic matters, which persists in ignoring reality."
"I deplore the fact that the consequences of the Stability Pact are being ignored and that we are not discussing here today the economic and social problems that the citizens are experiencing."
"I deplore the fact that the main aim of economic policy is budgetary consolidation and price stability, at the expense of economic and employment growth, of improving standards of living and of meeting people’s needs."
"Portugal is an example of this slavish implementation of the Stability Pact. The country is deep in recession, with a reduction in GDP that might exceed 1% and the highest levels of unemployment in the EU, which is jeopardising not only economic convergence with the EU, but also, for the third year in succession, the very conditions needed for a swift and sustained recovery."
"Budgetary consolidation must not be used as a stick with which to beat public services, nor must it jeopardise public investment. It must be a guarantee of high-quality public services."
"This policy, this Stability Pact must be amended. We must first speak about a sustainable growth and employment pact so that we can respond to the EU’s economic and social problems."
"– Mr President, I too would like to refer first to aspects of research and development that can be the driving forces generating value for businesses."
"I agree with Mr Linkohr that it would be useful to open a debate on Mr Lange’s contribution. Unfortunately this is not possible."
"I should like to present one example. If Europe eventually takes the decision to actively support and promote clean technology, research and development in that field will become an obvious source of employment and investment in the Union."
"One of the major challenges currently facing the international community concerns implementing the Kyoto Protocol and meeting its objectives."
"This has generated heated debate between the industrial world and the administration."
"In my view, widespread application of cleaner technology is one solution, precisely because it would facilitate the reduction of polluting emissions."
"The competitive and dynamic Europe we are all hoping for is unlikely to emerge without investment in such technology."
"It is absolutely vital to be far more active in promoting the efficient use of natural resources. The reason is, quite simply, that decoupling economic growth and the increased use of resources is a for ensuring the continuity of sustainable growth."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I sometimes get the feeling that there are those who have, very recently, been blowing the dust of history off the nineteenth-century theory according to which all you have to do is to unchain market forces,"
"and then, suddenly, masses of jobs will be created."
"I see that as utterly false."
"If we take a close look at where, over the past few decades, there have been the greatest increases in growth and employment, they have occurred precisely in those sectors that Mr Langen listed earlier, namely in sustainable development and in the protection of the environment."
"I believe that it is also in these that investment has to be more vigorously encouraged, particularly as regards urban renewal, both in relation to its social and environmental components, and also transport."
"Here too, it appears that it is in relation to the social and environmental components that there is the greatest potential for growth, and so it is here that there are, potentially, the greatest effects on employment."
"As, I believe, an unregulated market cannot do other than result in adverse consequences for the environment, it naturally follows that investment in these areas would help to secure the ecological bases of our existence."
"I believe that we have to be faithful to Lisbon and Gothenburg in our approach and in our seeking sustainable production methods in Europe, which will induce growth and employment, founded upon the ecological bases of our existence."
"We have, in the past, come up with sound approaches to this, and we should continue on this road in a credible way."
"Internationally, I believe, we will lose our credibility in many areas if we now proceed to dump our own objectives and what we agreed to in Johannesburg and Kyoto."
"We have to hold fast to our own objectives and carry on down this road."
"– Mr President, I would like to say something about the Spring Summit, which we can expect to be a sobering experience, and the ambitious process that we initiated at Lisbon four years ago."
"The grave economic downturn in many Member States demands more effective action."
"There is a need for closer approximation between economic, employment and structural policies, without going as far as attempting to harmonise them."
"Cutbacks in the bureaucracy of the state, improved structures in financial markets and more investment – to which Members have already referred – can promote the creation of more and sustainable jobs, but there is, above all, a lack of coordinated cooperation in the area of lifelong learning and the introduction of European educational marketing."
"Studies in the EU have revealed that too many young people have been poorly educated."
"More support for human capital, though, makes them more employable, and so this is something that has to be addressed in schools, work-based training and in universities."
"I also believe that social dialogue has to be stepped up."
"I regard it as a key element in handling changes in our society, and it is regrettable that, in many Member States, it tends to take place on the margins."
"The enlargement of the EU in the coming months means that we have to be consistent in pressing on with joint measures in employment and social policy, of which the European employment strategy was, and still is, one of the most successful features."
"I might add that the budgetary expenditure for these areas is minimal in comparison with the structural resources for enlargement."
"The Commission’s insistence on increasing contributions and hence the burden on net contributors can therefore only be repudiated."
"Both on the European and national level, we need something else, and that is iron discipline where spending is concerned."
"It follows from this that we cannot support the amendment in which the Socialists dare to warn of austerity budgets."
"The last point I want to make is that nothing will come of any attempt at softening up the Stability and Growth Pact or at discrediting it as unworkable."
"This, Commissioner Solbes Mira, is where the Commission is absolutely right; the budgetary offenders must be brought before the European Court of Justice."
"That deserves every political support, for the one thing needed by our businesses, by their workers as well as their managers, is guaranteed and long-term stability."
"– Mr President, contemplation of the economic situation in which the European Union finds itself leads us to the conclusion that the summit ahead of us has three main tasks."
"Firstly, the summit must ensure there is an increase in investment; secondly, it must ensure that there is an increase in investment, and thirdly, it must ensure that money is better invested."
"Both in the private and public sectors, we are lagging behind the USA; in the public sector we are behind them by 1%."
"I absolutely fail to grasp how, in view of this economic state of affairs, Members of this House can manage to come up with two recommendations for us, one being that we should deal with the crisis by leaving more muck in the air, which is what Mr Langen’s proposal in part amounts to; the other, that we carry on stubbornly wrecking the economy with austerity measures, rather than giving it the kick-start that it needs."
"Bad textbooks on economic policy are legion, but never yet have I found one so bad that it would recommend these courses of action in a phase of the economic cycle such as the one that we are now in."
"Quite the opposite is the case: the situation we are now in demands that we take the action outlined by Mr De Rossa, adopting a dynamic attitude towards the necessary balance between stability on the one hand and efficiency on the other."
"I am eager to see what the Commission will do with the slogan ‘Dynamic action, balance between stability and efficiency’."
"We look forward to your proposals, Commissioner Solbes, and hope that we will have a productive debate."
"– Mr President, I should first of all like to extend warm thanks to Mr Roche for his brief from the Council, and particularly for what he said about older workers."
"It is my belief that we could achieve the Lisbon objectives in the field of employment if we were to succeed in creating a better labour market for older workers, so I was very disappointed to note that the Commission talks only about abolishing the financial instruments for them."
"We might as well deny them the right to vote."
"What the Commission states is wholly unacceptable."
"We need to create a labour market capable of offering scope, one that will also make such arrangements less necessary than they currently are."
"Secondly, I should like to turn to the legislation itself."
"The Commission was right to point out that legislation on the internal market must be introduced swiftly."
"It too, of course, has come up with its own proposals, although you cannot help wondering whether they will contribute a tremendous amount to employment."
"I fear that the reverse might sometimes be true."
"I am also concerned that in the field of financial services, as was the case in the takeover directive, there is the temptation to emulate what we think is happening in the United States."
"I think we should carefully consider what effect all of this has on employment."
"There is also the environment, of course."
"It is indeed the case that in the assessment of existing environmental laws, and the drafting of new ones, far more consideration should be given to the employment effects than has been the case to date."
"It is too easy to trivialise this, as Mr Langen has done."
"My final point concerns productivity, an issue that I think is still very much being underestimated."
"Productivity ties everything together."
"If we improve productivity, we can do more, we can obtain better jobs."
"Often, though, it is the other side of this House that stands in the way of improving productivity because there is too much consideration for old ideas for which there is little sympathy in this day and age."
"Mr President, the reports that we are discussing express concern at the gulf between the Lisbon objectives and the results achieved."
"The Council and the Commission share these concerns and rightly insist on the importance of confirming a strategy for a knowledge-based economy."
"I do, however, believe that, in view of the Spring Summit, the Union’s Financial Perspective needs to be considered and questions must be answered."
"The first question concerns the means of achieving a balance between the stability policy which manifests itself in the form of the single currency, and a policy of promoting research, innovation for small businesses and investments in TENs, which will enable the European regions to integrate."
"The second question concerns how to address the globalisation of the markets that is challenging even the most modern businesses that have to compete with the US and Japan – that is to say the countries at the forefront of research – and traditional businesses that have to compete with China and economies that have low labour, social policy and environmental policy costs."
"The third question concerns developing factors for competitiveness, which help to strengthen the Community’s presence in fundamental research, and also in industrial policy."
"This community commitment is possible if the Financial Perspective is consistent with the objectives of EU enlargement, and also with growth that is increasingly linked to human capital, product quality and the competitiveness of businesses operating in an ever more open market."
"I believe that the political problem turns, in fact, on the ability to bring about the structural reforms and also to take the budgetary decisions that we believe are necessary to give Europe a future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Stability and Growth Pact that is under discussion, and I believe we have every cause to highlight the fact that we need this Pact for the sake of our future."
"Those who engage in lawbreaking at European level, by using a ministerial decision to interfere with the Commission’s procedures, have to be told in plain language that breaching this Stability and Growth Pact will end up undermining the stability of the euro, and that will cause the foundation of growth in Europe to crumble."
"This is where the letter from the six countries with consolidated budgets speaks volumes, and it is my hope and wish that we may recover that awareness with this Pact in mind. What is true of this Pact is true of much else, that if you want to change the law, then find yourself a majority, but you do not change the law by breaking it."
"Secondly, the process of structural reform that the European Central Bank is demanding ought to happen at national level."
"There is a particular lack of such reforms in Germany."
"It speaks volumes when we read, as we currently do, of a fall in the per capita average gross domestic product in Germany, and of Germany being fourth from the bottom."
"It certainly does not indicate that the Social Democrats are making a good job of running Germany."
"It would also indicate that the mere fact of Commissioner Verheugen’s membership of that party is enough to disqualify him from being the super-Commissioner here in Brussels."
"Let me close by pointing out that the Lisbon Process does not mean that a large spending programme means that there is money to burn."
"On the contrary, savings have to be made at the European level too, and so I have no sympathy for the Commission’s demand for a 50% increase in the Budget."
"That, too, would overburden the net contributors within the European Union."
"Several Members of this House could do with a thinking and reflection process, and, overall, I believe that a consolidation phase would do the European Union some good."
"Mr President, as we are addressing the issue of the European economy in the debate on these reports, the point I would like to emphasise is the vital importance of turning the Lisbon agenda from rhetoric into reality."
"Advances have been made since European leaders declared that they were going to make Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy within ten years, but there have also been a lot of steps back."
"It seems to me that a fundamental aim of the Lisbon agenda is to produce economic reform and more flexible labour markets."
"In many cases, however, we have seen the European Union going in the opposite direction to this aspiration."
"Labour markets are not made more flexible by measures like the Temporary Workers Directive, which could drive hundreds or thousands of temporary workers out of employment."
"I am also concerned about plans to phase out some of the opt-outs to the Working Time Directive, which give additional flexibility."
"Of course it is important to ensure that people do not have to work excessive hours, but there are many aspects of the Working Time Directive that just add red tape and do not give proper protection to working people: these measures just make it more difficult for them to run their lives in the way they would like to."
"There are other proposals which I think are overreactions: the intention in the Chemicals Regulation, for example, is that one must control and regulate the use of dangerous chemicals, but this should not give rise to the disproportionate reaction we have seen from that regulation."
"Many items of European legislation are over-intrusive and simply add to business costs."
"In the end, that will cost jobs for people in Europe and very often mean that consumers end up getting a worse deal and a narrower range of choices."
"To make the Lisbon agenda a reality we have to cut down on the red tape produced by the European Union."
". Mr President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members who took the floor for speaking in this debate. I should also like to thank them for the ideas they put forward."
"Unfortunately, time constraints are such that I am unable to comment in detail on all of the latter. I would, however, like to highlight what I feel are the key aspects of the debate."
"There seems to be widespread agreement that the rate of growth needs to increase, and that our present rate is unsatisfactory."
"Nonetheless, I would caution against simplistic comparisons."
"For a comparison between the United States and Europe to be valid, their respective starting points must be taken into account. The anticipated commitments of both areas must be borne in mind too."
"Even a comparison between the Eurozone and the zone beyond it is not straightforward."
"Essentially, the key issue arising at present is whether the Lisbon diagnosis remains valid or not."
"I am convinced that basically, increased capacity for growth in Europe depends on two factors, namely more employment in Europe and more productive employment."
"I believe this diagnosis remains valid."
"If that is the case, the question arises as to what is going wrong in Europe."
"I do not believe the difficulty lies in the diagnosis."
"Rather, the difficulty lies in the implementation and practical application of what was decided in Lisbon."
"It has to be said, however, that the Commission’s report clearly states that progress has been made in certain areas, though there is general dissatisfaction regarding others."
"On the one hand, ground has undoubtedly been gained on the employment front. On the other, rather less has been achieved concerning productivity."
"Progress has also been made within the internal market, though not on the scale anticipated."
"A number of obstacles have been overcome, allowing the financial system to become more unified. Unfortunately, unification has not yet resulted in bringing financial costs down to a level comparable with what is the norm in the United States."
"Certain additional elements have been put in place, and I am sure these will prove helpful. In my view, the growth initiative is an important factor in relaunching other aspects."
"Our proposals for this year focus on those elements that can facilitate productivity and ensure it increases."
"Research and development are indeed one of the objectives set. It is, however, important to put discussion of research and development into context."
"Clearly, 3% of GDP is a figure similar to that of the United States, but if one distinguishes between public and private investment in research and development in Europe and in the United States, the figure for public investment in Europe is higher than in the United States."
"The question arises as to whether the figure alone is the problem, or whether the problem concerns our ability to work better between ourselves, avoiding duplication of activity. There is also the issue of generating added attraction and promoting private activity."
"These factors are all crucial, in my view. I certainly feel these priorities are well chosen and appropriate."
"That implies a certain appropriate degree or level of social protection. It also implies a certain level of environmental protection."
"This led to further points raised during the debate."
"The question arose, for instance, as to whether this was a difficulty related to defining a strategy."
"I maintained this was not the case."
"It is a problem of the political will, essentially at national level, to implement agreements reached."
"As to whether the Stability and Growth Pact is a problem or a positive element, I myself believe the latter is the case."
"I believe sound finances are essential to long-term growth."
"With regard to fiscal policy acting as a discretionary element to improve growth in the short term, it might indeed serve as such in some cases, at least in theory."
"In my view, however, it is also important not to overlook certain other fundamental issues."
"Firstly, the operation of the budgets and automatic stabilisers in Europe."
"This is far more dynamic here than in the United States. It means that every one-point drop in activity is compensated for by half a point as regards budget deviation."
"There is indeed a limit in place, that notorious 3%."
"Experience has proved it to be a reasonable limit."
"I am convinced this is still the case, and that it is useful for the European Union to have a fiscal framework."
"I also believe this fiscal framework calls for budgetary balance to be achieved in the medium term, given the difficulties anticipated and the ageing population."
"Further, it seems to me that 3% as a nominal reference is a key factor for that budgetary balance in the medium term. It is essential to the desired efficient system that will make it possible to control activities under way and allow us to cooperate."
"I therefore feel it is vital to tackle the problems related to the future of the pact. As I see it, the Treaty remains valid."
"The fundamental concepts certainly do. Nonetheless, improvements are called for in certain areas."
"The interrelation between the guidelines for economic policy and the pact is certainly one such area. It is important not to focus on fiscal consolidation ."
"Fiscal consolidation should be perceived as a way of generating increased growth. Clearly, this is closely connected with the Broad Guidelines of economic policy."
"It presents a second difficulty we have become aware of in recent years, namely that some of the problems currently experienced result from inappropriate action at a critical point in the economic cycle."
"Growth elements have been introduced into the pact by giving more importance to structural deficits."
"Last November’s communication was along those lines."
"Some problems do still remain in this crucial area, of course. We are certainly prepared to discuss and debate them."
"We feel the problem of the future is extremely important."
"With this in mind, the debt needs to become more important in the pact game. So too should all future commitments that are bound to have a negative impact on growth in the long term."
"Issues like the ageing of the population and the need to fund future commitments are crucial."
"I have one last remark to make."
"In my view, as some honourable Members have indeed pointed out, the national will to apply the pact is absolutely vital."
"This could mean improving current budgetary processes. I have in mind changes to ensure national parliaments themselves are more involved in defining their own future commitments and in meeting the commitments eventually entered into."
"I feel the starting point is sound."
"Increased growth would of course be welcome, and the margin for manoeuvre is indeed limited."
"In establishing its financial perspective, the Commission endeavoured to achieve a balance between on the one hand, not exceeding the current margin of manoeuvre, despite the additional commitments, whilst on the other hand, not increasing the current financial margin more than absolutely necessary."
"We are very much aware that at the end of the day the Union’s budget is 1, 1.4, 1.24%. We appreciate that the major element of public expenditure is currently at national level."
"Consequently, if there is no cooperation at national level it will not be possible to move towards that increased growth we all aspire to for Europe."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank every Member who participated in the debate."
"I may not agree with all of the analysis, but I found the debate extraordinarily interesting and very constructive."
"I do not have time to mention each of the points, but there were a number of interesting points made during the course of the debate."
"Mr Blokland, for example, illustrated that the Lisbon agenda is running out: we can number the amount of time we have left in days."
"That was a very interesting point."
"Flexibility in our approach was emphasised by Mr Crowley, and Mr De Rossa indicated how dynamic a world Europe exists in and how extraordinary the challenges are which arise from that."
"Not surprisingly speakers were very clear as to the need to continuously tackle the barriers that prevent full implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Mr Baron was absolutely correct when he said that the way to hell is paved with good intentions; there are plenty of good intentions in the Lisbon strategy."
"As presidency we are conscious that as well as expressing good intentions we also need to focus the whole process in very much the way that Mr Watson suggested."
"The strategy does not belong to the European institutions, but to the people of Europe."
"There are many stakeholders here – a point well made by Ms Randzio-Plath."
"Somehow we have to engage the attention of all these stakeholders – not just the Member State governments and the institutions, but the people of Europe – and make sure they focus on the agenda itself and what this means in reality."
"Many Members spoke about the issue of regulation."
"I am not sure that Mr Jonckheer and myself would agree with each other, but he made the point about the concerns that exist about liberalisation and regulation, a matter that was also touched on by many other speakers."
"We feel very strongly that a significant amount of time and attention must be focused on making sure that regulation is effective, i.e. that it helps the process rather than hindering it."
"Another of the key focuses in the debate was on what is necessary to put in place to create a truly knowledge-based economy."
"I would agree with Commissioner Reding who at the very outset made a point about the necessary emphasis on education."
"I would also agree with the points made by Mrs Grossetête and Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo on the need for research and development."
"There were many contributions throughout the debate about how we deal with the issue of creating a knowledge-based economy and I believe that Members were correct in pointing out that education is key, as is investment in research and development."
"One point that did strike me was the one made again and again about the necessity of creating a research environment within the Europe."
"Researchers are the seed capital of a knowledge-based economy and the EU and its Member States must recognise this."
"The Lisbon strategy is not some musty academic concept; it is vital to the lives of the citizens of the EU-15 and, as from 1 May 2004, it will also be vital to the lives and wellbeing of 450 million citizens of our Union across 25 states."
"It is an endeavour that deserves all of our attention, our energy and our ingenuity."
"Insofar as this presidency is concerned it is a key priority and we are putting a lot of attention and focus on it."
"At the March European Council meeting we intend to use a focused, as opposed to scatter-gun, approach."
"We believe that we have to focus very carefully on those things that we can achieve and get on with the task of achieving them."
"In conclusion I would like to thank each Member for their contributions to this very interesting and focused debate."
"We should like to thank the Council."
"To conclude the statements on the follow-up to the Lisbon Strategy, I have received three motions for resolutions.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
". The European Union must modernise the operation of our labour markets."
"We must ensure that we coordinate our economic policies to a greater extent."
"We must ensure that we bring about less and better regulatory reforms."
"We must guarantee that we complete the trans-European networks in the transport and energy sectors."
"We must ensure that all areas of the European Union, both urban and rural, peripheral and central, receive maximum benefit from new technologies that are coming on stream."
"The European Union, if it is to remain competitive and if we are to reach the targets laid down by EU leaders concerning the implementation of the Lisbon strategy requires the enactment of a series of legislative measures at an EU level."
"We have to ensure that the internal market is fully completed."
"We should also ensure that we invest to a greater extent in research and development policies and this is one area where the European Union has been lacking when compared to the US in recent times."
"I support the European Union becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"And we must all work towards this goal."
". – The European Commission should compile a timetable for the Member States, specifying who is going to achieve what, when and how."
"The European mini-summit in Berlin has once again demonstrated that everyone is agreed on the objectives but not on the actions to be taken, and so we are not making any headway."
"Replacing the current vague agreements with a timetable with exact objectives should help the Heads of Government find a way to invigorate the knowledge economy and make the European labour market more flexible."
"In addition, during the Spring Summit, the Commission should indicate what has been done about removing superfluous legislation, of which, according to the Commission’s promises to European industry, 25% is to be deleted."
"By reducing the burden of administration, companies will once again have the chance to be enterprising and thereby generate economic growth."
"A European 'super-Commissioner' for economic affairs is not the answer."
"Germany’s Chancellor Schröder should have known this, for the German 'superminister' for Economic Affairs and Employment, Wolfgang Clement, has not managed to prevent the German economy from still achieving one of Europe's lowest growth rates."
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2004) by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Council, concerning the failure to consult the European Parliament in connection with the TEN Quick Start projects."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the question that has been tabled seeks to avoid any confusion and to prevent any possibility of the current codecision procedure on the development of the trans-European transport networks affecting the list of sections of priority projects indicated by the Commission in its communication to the Council of 11 November 2003 on the growth initiative."
"This identifies sections and projects that have been taken into account as recipients of community funds that are currently available as well as credits from the European Investment Bank."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of which I am giving this speech, looks to the Council to know what importance it should attribute to the afore-mentioned communication."
"On January 27 of this year, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, clarified in writing to the parliamentary committee to which I belong, that the communication on the Growth Initiative including the list of priority projects is not a legally binding document, nor is it a list of sections intended to receive preferential treatment."
"According to the Commission, therefore, what we have is merely an incomplete list of actions within the priority projects that the European Commission and the Member States have pointed out as being sufficiently advanced to allow them to be immediately started, thus stimulating the European economy."
"It seems necessary for the Council to confirm the Commission statement today and for it to further explain what it intends to do to ensure that indicating sections of projects proposed by the European Commission in no way makes them a priority before the codecision procedure that is currently underway on the guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport networks has been concluded."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, that I am representing here, is aware of the benefits of quickly starting programmes which, apart from building the necessary infrastructure to create the single market within the whole of the enlarged Europe, will be able to make a major contribution to the revival of the European economy that everyone hopes to see and which we spoke about a few moments ago."
"This is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is working and will continue to work in weeks to come to ensure that the guidelines can be adopted within the current parliamentary term."
"To this end, we must look at the European Parliament’s commitment and the Council needs to undertake to do even more, not just to meet the deadlines that we have set ourselves, but also to show willing to try to reach a genuine agreement because the codecision procedure makes sense, is important and does not give the impression that the decisions have already been taken by the Commission and the Council without Parliament being able to indicate its duties and its prerogatives."
"A swift conclusion of the codecision procedure on the guidelines for the development of the trans-European networks would undoubtedly allow the green light to be given to the list of advanced projects."
"This list must not be seen as pre-established, but as one that must be redefined – again, within the framework of the codecision procedure – in line with the afore-mentioned guidelines."
"The only way in which we will be able to revive the European economy and physically construct the European single market without inconsistencies is by swiftly concluding the codecision work on trans-European transport networks and only then to subsequently identify advanced projects to which we will commit Union resources, as well as urging Member States to begin programmes."
". Mr President, at its meeting of 12 and 13 December 2003, the European Council endorsed the European Action Plan for Growth on the basis of the reports presented by Ecofin, the Commission and the European Investment Bank."
"The action is an important step in the implementation of the Lisbon agenda to improve competitiveness, employment and growth potential in the enlarged Union."
"Structural reform will be complemented by higher investment in both physical and human capital."
"The Council also welcomed the work carried out by the Commission and the EIB – and by the relevant configurations of the Council itself – in the establishment of the Quick Start Programme."
"Identification was also made according to a strict set of criteria of a provisional list of projects for immediate action."
"The Council also recommended that if other projects fulfil the same criteria the list may be complemented in accordance with the procedures followed for its establishment in the framework of the annual cycle for reporting to the spring European Council."
"I would like to confirm to Members that the Commission’s communication to the Council on 'the European Initiative for Growth – Investing in Knowledge and Networks', as well as reports from the EIB and the different Council formations in this regard, constitute guidelines only."
"In order to be taken forward they should be enshrined in a formal legal instrument – in this case, a decision of the Council and the European Parliament."
"The Commission communication is a non-exhaustive list of actions within the priority projects which have been identified by the Commission and the Member States."
"These projects are considered to be sufficiently mature to commence immediately and thus stimulate the European economy at present."
"It is important that the Council and the Parliament pursue their constructive engagement in the current discussions on the revision of the guidelines."
"In this respect Council welcomes the letter from President Cox to President Prodi dated November 2003."
"The presidency is strongly committed to ensuring that the work on this critically important dossier should be successfully completed by the end of this Parliament’s term."
"It is essential, therefore, that the EU’s institutions work together to bring forward this work."
"We recognise that the European Parliament has a particularly important role to play in this process."
"Agreement will open the way for crucial investment to be disbursed on key network projects and thus facilitate the pursuit of our fundamental objective of promoting economic growth for the enlarged Union."
"The adoption of the draft decision on TENs on the eve of enlargement – by 1 May – would have considerable symbolic importance."
"It would also provide a welcome illustration of the EU's commitment to the rapid integration of the economies of the new Member States."
"As a final point, may I add that I listened very carefully to Mr Costa's contribution to the debate."
"There seemed to be some concern about Parliament's potential to contribute to this area."
"This has perhaps not been fully acknowledged."
"I would like to assure him and the House that the matter in focus is part of a bigger issue in which the Parliament and its talents will be fully engaged by the Irish presidency."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, that was not sufficient."
"I will repeat that for your benefit, Mr President-in-Office: your statement was inadequate."
"The Chairman of the Committee asked a specific question as to whether the Council agrees with the description of the ‘Quick Start’ list as, in essence, a personal list drawn up by the Council, but as not binding upon Parliament."
"You have failed to answer that question, and I find that extremely sad."
"You embarked on a major statement about why the ‘Quick Start’ list is necessary, but you did not address the way in which this ‘Quick Start’ list gives the impression – which your speech, in my view, reinforces – that you want Parliament to be kept out of decisions about which projects are to have priority."
"We did try to help you out of your difficulties, making it clear to you that the TEN projects’ Annex III, the priority projects, is a matter for our joint decision, and that the Council cannot draw up its own special list from among these priority projects, effectively saying that, of the 30 projects, it finds this one and that one and the other one the most attractive, and that it is now deciding to start with those."
"You subsequently attempted to defuse the issue by saying that the choice was made on the basis of readiness for work to begin or the availability of funding."
"Indeed so: which projects are tackled and when is not a decision for the Council; it must be decided in accordance with the criteria in Annex III as to which projects are ready to be built, which have received planning permission and which are capable of being funded."
"So I will again ask you to state unambiguously whether the ‘Quick Start’ list is binding in law, and if so, on whom; or whether you have attempted to use it to circumvent Parliament’s and the Council’s right of joint decision on the priority projects."
"For my part, and on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we will not let this pass."
"We will not allow the Council to use a so-called ‘Quick Start’ list as a means of unilaterally disregarding Parliament’s rights."
"Mr President, this oral question has at least one thing to be said for it, inasmuch as what was a phantom dossier has now become clearly visible, since the Council has just confirmed that what we have been reading in the press, what we have heard whispers about from the Council, and what, in some cases, certain Commissioners have been saying, does in fact exist."
"There really is a Quick Start programme, even though Mrs de Palacio had explained to us that it did not exist."
"Thank you, then, President-in-Office of the Council, for confirming this so clearly here today, and I should also like to thank all those Members who put their names to this oral question."
"After all, it is a good method to try to begin with those projects which have been around the longest, thereby avoiding a situation in which, as a result of trying to take on too much, we end up by not achieving very much at all."
"I therefore welcome the fact that there is, after all, a method for implementing the TEN projects."
"What is clear, however, is that the real priority list is this one, the Quick Start list, because that is where our meagre funds will be going, and our funds are very meagre compared with the immensity of the task."
"I therefore share Mr Jarzembowski’s point of view. I believe that it would be inappropriate for the European Parliament not to be informed about and associated with the implementation of this list."
"I am not sure whether we should go as far as codecision when it comes to the method for funding and implementing the TEN projects."
"What I sure about, however, since it was I, together with a number of other Members, who called for it is that we must have regular information about the implementation of the thirty TEN projects which we shall be voting in favour of."
"I hope, therefore, that this sitting will at least have been useful in two ways. On the one hand, it has sought to clarify the procedure so that we can see whether or not we are within the codecision framework – and we shall have to have a very clear answer on that subject – and on the other hand, if we are not involved in a codecision procedure, it has at least made provision for an annual report on the implementation of the TEN projects which we have voted in favour of."
"Mr President, there has been a lot of talk about involving the European Parliament in drawing up what is termed the Quick Start list."
"I do not want to make a further contribution to this discussion, but instead concentrate on something of equal importance in this context, namely the financing and management of the projects."
"The Court of Auditors has investigated the management system for the trans-European transport network and is extremely severe in its criticisms."
"The conclusion is that control must be improved."
"It must be more effective, and there is a need for uniformly consistent application of the TEN rules in all the Member States."
"The new Member States already participate in the TEN programme."
"I am sincerely in favour of enlargement, and I am sincerely in favour of the Member States participating in all the EU programmes as rapidly as possible, but the new Member States are not always as good at controlling EU funds, and the Commission is not always that good at keeping the new Member States up to the mark."
"Unfortunately, the Quick Start projects are an example of this."
"In Slovakia, for example, a motorway project designed to link Katowice to Zilina and not in any way complying with our standards was approved."
"The project was approved even though there is no justification for it whatsoever in terms of economics or traffic conditions."
"Unfortunately, we see far too many examples of projects being approved without proper investigation, without cost/benefit analyses and without account being taken of their environmental consequences."
"The TEN programme is a success, but we must not build motorways and bridges if there is no need for them."
"We must ensure that the controls are effective and uniform in all the Member States."
"If we secure proper control of EU funds, we secure greater legitimacy for the TEN projects."
"If the finances are in order, we make it easier to attract private venture capital."
"That is something we must, in particular, remember, since public-private partnership looks like being an option in connection with financing future infrastructure projects."
"Only once these things are in place will we be well on the way to giving impetus to a great many of the necessary infrastructure projects, and that will take us closer to our common objective of creating a coherent EU."
"Let me give an example of a project designated both for EU cofinancing and a public-private partnership."
"This is the fixed link between Denmark and Germany across the Fehmarn Belt."
"There is quite clearly a need for a bridge across the belt so that we can remove this bottleneck from the north-south axis."
"On the Danish side, a lot has constantly been done to ensure that this major project can be carried out."
"Unfortunately, it appears that there is rather a lack of political will in Germany."
"Once the project has got under way, and it will hopefully not be very long before that happens, the EU will be stronger and, at the same time, the regions on both sides of the Fehmarn Belt will find that employment has been given an economic boost."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there are those who call into question the Constitution that extends Parliament’s powers to approve legislative procedures by codecision. This is not a good time, therefore, to overlook Parliament’s power to approve, in conjunction with the Council, the vital question of the Trans-European transport networks."
"I therefore request, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that this crucial issue should be put before Parliament for consideration."
"In any event, as a Member of this House, I should like to bring to your attention today high-speed train projects in Galicia, in Portugal, in the North-east of the peninsula and in Aquitaine; in other words, a highly significant stretch of the EU’s Atlantic seaboard."
"I refer to the projects linking Oporto, Vigo and El Ferrol; Santiago de Compostela, La Coruña, Vigo, Orense, Valladolid and Aquitaine; and El Ferrol and Bilbao."
"All of these are contained in plans drawn up by the Portuguese and Spanish Governments, in this case the Galicia plan."
"We want this project to come to fruition and to be approved in the proper manner by codecision."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a new Eurobarometer poll was conducted a few days ago."
"What attracted particular attention was the extremely low level of participation in June’s elections to the European Parliament."
"In some countries, scarcely more than 20% of the public say they are interested in these elections, and in virtually none of them do over 50%."
"There is absolutely no cause for surprise at these figures."
"The fact is that the European public hear the same old thing year in and year out, that everything bad comes from Brussels, and the good things are all home-made."
"The game here is ‘passing the buck’, and the Council is particularly good at it."
"It keeps quiet about the fact that it, as a rule, is part of Brussels, and, when it has the opportunity to play Santa Claus, as it is now, for example, doing with the TENs, the Council likes to be seen dispensing blessings in what is, of course, a solo performance."
"Who cares about the fact that the Treaty speaks in terms of codecision in these matters, with Council and Parliament jointly taking decisions on the trans-European transport network?"
"Their Eminences of the Council want to be the only ones to dole out largesse and to make promises; none of the glory must rub off on anyone else, certainly not on Parliament."
"We are not prepared to play along with this charade of disinformation; we are not prepared to do so as a matter of principle, and we are certainly not prepared to do so with 13 June in the offing."
"The resolution we have submitted is intended to press that point home."
"Most of all, we demand a clear message to the European public, that not only bad things come out of Europe, and that the European Parliament and its members share responsibility for much that the public see as important, and which, it is to be hoped, benefits them in practice."
"– Mr President, I have a lot of trust in the Council, especially in Mr Roche, and understood his speech to mean that he is in favour of Parliament being fully entitled to take decisions in all the areas to which we have referred."
"Judging by what I hear my fellow-MEPs saying, they are less trusting."
"I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council – and this is my first point – to say, here and now, loud and clear, whether he acknowledges Parliament’s full decision-making rights in all these matters, be they the ‘Quick Start’ list or any other list."
"My second point is that the committee, when it was under Mr Costa’s chairmanship, agreed that this House is not so irresponsible that anyone can, by hook or by crook, add on his or her pet projects; on the contrary, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism added a limited number of projects for which there was a rational justification."
"If I may mention just two of them, out of – I think – about six, which enhance Europe’s cohesion and unity, not only in and around the new Member States, but also in and around the future accession countries in the Balkans, we were talking in terms of lines running across Austria from Prague via Linz, and another running from the North via Vienna to Graz and then on to Croatia – in other words, lines that make a great deal of sense."
"I really do think that this House has, over the past months, shown itself to be responsible, in that not even in the run-up to an election does it add on one project after another indiscriminately."
"Parliament’s right to share in decisions must, however, be guaranteed in full."
"It would be a good thing if the President-in-Office’s ambivalent answer today could become a clear and unequivocal statement to the effect that the Council does indeed acknowledge Parliament’s power of codecision, because this House demonstrates a high degree of responsibility and comes up with a few extra ideas for these important investment projects."
"After all, the Council and its Presidency ought to have an interest in getting a few more good ideas, and you will get them from this House’s Committee on Transport."
"Mr President, I certainly agree with promoting a European growth initiative."
"Nonetheless, I cannot accept the restrictive interpretation of the so-called Quick Start List."
"A list of priority projects already exists. These were endorsed at the Essen and Dublin European Councils, and the Commission has proposed a second enlargement."
"I believe all these priority projects should have an equal chance of access to Community aid."
"The challenge ought to be getting the projects under way at the earliest opportunity, not cutting the number of projects."
"In my view, one option could be setting up some sort of a bonus system involving an extra payment for projects or parts of projects certified as having been completed over the next three years. That would be far more effective than an cut of the list of projects on the basis of the likelihood of their being launched or completed."
"Certain sections of high-speed railway line could be largely completed between now and 2006."
"The Vitoria-Dax line is one of these, yet it does not appear on the Quick Start List."
"I am also of the opinion that the so-called maritime highways should be deemed cross-border projects on condition that they link ports in two Member States."
"– Mr President, it is with great amazement that I see that, in a debate as important as this one, the Commission is conspicuous by its absence."
"In addition to what has been said by other Members, I would like to reiterate that Commissioner de Palacio’s handling of this dossier has not been particularly democratic."
"On two occasions, she has attempted to interfere in the internal affairs of this House; on one, she wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Committee to tell him who the rapporteur for this dossier had to be, and she has, secondly, insisted to the groups that the procedure should be a simple one and not a full one including codecision."
"It is my belief that we have to endure a full codecision procedure and fight in this House for what we want, as we have a responsibility to the public, whose taxes pay for these investment projects."
"– Mr President, speaking personally, I wish to repudiate the attacks made on Mrs de Palacio."
"Not in any way did she attempt to exert negative influence on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism; on the contrary, she offered help in bringing the trans-European networks dossier to a conclusion, and that was very valuable."
"What I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, though, is whether he has nothing to say to us."
"Are our questions so unimportant that he is unwilling to give us an answer?"
". Mr President, I had not intended to respond to the debate."
"My comments at the outset were, I think, comprehensive, particularly the additional comments I made at the end."
"This statement by the Council has been noted."
"To conclude this debate, I have received one motion for a resolution.(1)"
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, I should like to emphasise the need to give a determined boost to the priority TEN projects. They are vital for the economic development of the European Union."
"Regrettably, certain Member States have failed to support projects essential for the Union."
"This is the case of the project to build a high-speed and high capacity goods railway link through the central Pyrenees."
"The project was supported by Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but not by the French Government."
"Member States should be aware of the need to implement such projects urgently, in order to prevent the anticipated collapse of goods transport systems within the Union."
"Parliament’s warning call should be heeded. The European Union must facilitate the work of the Member States and continue to support its implementation."
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0063/2004) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to the Council, concerning the Olympic truce."
"–Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are so many conflicts and trouble spots in the world at present – let us appeal to common sense and act instead to preserve life."
"This is the aim of the Olympic truce, an ancient and noble tradition dating back 3 000 years and which the International Olympic Committee has been trying to revive for the past decade."
"At a time of conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, the Pacific and the neighbouring regions, we need to send out a strong message supporting the truce and calling for dialogue and reconciliation both during and after the Olympic Games."
"In November 2003, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution to build a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal."
"Thousands of public figures from all over the world and from many different fields – politics and art to name but a few – went on to sign the Olympic truce."
"This is the European Year of Education through Sport, and in this context we can, and should, convey the fact that sport has a key role to play in the process."
"We should use the widespread publicity that the Olympic Games and the European Year of Education through Sport are receiving to convey a message of peace, to discuss conflict resolution and to emphasise the invaluable role played by sport in society."
"Finally, too, we should ask ourselves why the security measures for the Olympic Games and many other international sporting events are becoming stricter and stricter."
"In Athens, 50 000 people will be deployed to protect visitors to the Games and the 10 500 athletes taking part from 201 nations – an operation costing EUR 650 million."
"How can this be called a cultural and peaceful event when it has to be guarded around the clock?"
"What message are we sending out here?"
"This is why we are appealing to EU Member States and international institutions and calling for common sense and understanding and also why we, in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, are putting this oral question to the Council."
"We want the EU and its Member States to shoulder this responsibility and take advantage of the common sense prevailing during, and hopefully after, the Olympic Games."
"It is my hope that the European Year of Education through Sport precedes a broader discussion in which we will think about how to resolve conflicts more peacefully while putting our weapons to one side and allowing the weapons of peace, represented by the Olympic ideal, to reign supreme."
". Mr President, I particularly want to thank Mrs Prets for the question."
"The European Council of December 2003 expressed its support for the idea of an Olympic truce and welcomed the relevant resolution which was agreed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly."
"It is in fact no coincidence that 2004 is both the year of the Olympics and the European Year of Education through Sport."
"The Council recalls to the Parliament that the educational values of sport were already acknowledged by the Nice European Council in December 2000, thus confirming previous declarations, particularly Declaration 29 attached to the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This defines sport as something which forges the identity of people."
"The Council's resolution of 17 December 1999 also presented sporting activities as having a pedagogical value which contributes to the strengthening of civil society."
"One of the aims of the European Year of Education through Sport, as set out in the European Parliament and Council decision of February 2003, is to take advantage of the values conveyed through sport to develop knowledge and skill, particularly amongst young people."
"Sport allows young people in particular not only to develop physical prowess and readiness for physical effort, but also provides social skills such as team work, solidarity, tolerance and, of course, fair play."
"The Council confirms its commitment to these aims and values, as, I am sure, does the Parliament."
"I should point out that it does not come within the Council's competence to undertake the specific actions proposed by the honourable Member."
"However, at its meeting of 29 January 2004 to launch the European Year of Education through Sport, the troika of education and sports ministers stressed the importance of the Olympic truce."
"The ministers supported the truce for its message of peace, tolerance and friendship; its unique place in the lives of citizens and its positive role in the promotion of friendship and the breaking down of social and cultural barriers."
"The troika ministers also strongly recommended that joint actions bring together the goals of the European Year of Education through Sport and those of the Olympic truce during 2004."
"On a personal level, on behalf of the presidency, like to wish the Greek nation, and all the athletes who go to Greece to compete, peaceful and successful Olympic Games."
"I hope that these Games, as Mrs Prets has said, take place in an atmosphere of tolerance and peace."
"Mr President, sport is not just about performance, competitions and elite sportspeople; it is also about developing a sense of community and a common purpose; it is about humanity itself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these are not my words."
"They are the words of the United Nations Organisation, the UN."
"I fully support them, however, and I also fully support the idea that this Parliament should back the Olympic truce."
"What does seem to me to be important is that sport should not be politicised."
"As far as possible, sport must be kept outside of politics and must serve as a tool for constructing, never for destroying."
"Sport must be a tool for promoting peace and understanding."
"With regard to the Olympic truce, we are not talking about anything new."
"There have been Olympic truces every two years, for the summer games and for the winter games, for many years, and at the end of last year the United Nations adopted a resolution urging its Member States to observe the Olympic truce."
"I am in favour of it, as is the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"We do, however, want it to be a contribution from the world of sport to the rest of the world."
"We do not want any political party to try to gain electoral advantage or to try to politicise this issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the real world there are conflicts and wars."
"In the world of sport there are games and competitions."
"In the real world there are armed forces."
"In the world of sport there are teams."
"In the real world there are laws."
"In the world of sport we swap them for rules of play."
"In the real world there are neutral parties."
"In the world of sport we have referees."
"And in the real world, regrettably, there are many deaths, and we want to help to preserve life by means of the world of sport, and this must be the world of sport’s contribution to society."
"Mr President, in an effort to end the clashes which were plaguing the Peloponnese, the Delphi Oracle advised the warring sides in 776 B.C. to organise games, putting their differences to one side, so that athletes and citizens from all over Greece could take part in the games in safety."
"Thus the ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic truce was born and has lasted for over 1000 years."
"Greece promoted the revival of this tradition with the support of the UN, the European Council, UNESCO and the International Olympic Committee."
"In the run up to the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004, the International Olympic Truce Centre was set up and undertook to conduct a major campaign."
"Over 400 famous people in the world have signed the text of the Olympic truce."
"The Olympic Games, which return this year to the country in which they were born and to Europe, are a global reference point and, together with the message which emerges from the sporting performances, can send the message of the culture of peace."
"Peace and dialogue are two objectives which the European Parliament has always supported."
"They are values which we continue to hold at the centre of our efforts for as long and with as much effort as are needed to achieve them."
"Each of us, as members of the European Parliament, are called on to act as ambassadors of the good will of the Olympic truce, promoting the message and the culture of peace in all meetings, missions, parliamentary committees and international fora in all the corners of the planet which we frequently visit."
"We expect the support and encouragement of the Council and the Irish Presidency in this effort."
"The main message of the Olympic truce is: if we manage to have peace for 16 days, perhaps we can manage to have it forever."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0062/2004) by Mr Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2005 budget: guidelines for Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII(A) and VIII(B) and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present the guidelines for other sections and the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2005."
"My intention is that the guidelines should deal with the essentials and be kept very concise."
"Details and the consideration of specific measures will be left for the motion on the estimates."
"Please allow me now to touch briefly on some aspects of this year’s guidelines."
"The exceptional feature of the budget year 2005 is that it will be the first full budgetary year for the European Union of 25 Member States, the first full year of activity for the newly-elected European Parliament, the newly-appointed Commission, and the first full year of implementation of the new Staff Regulations."
"Technical adjustment will reduce the ceiling of the financial perspectives of heading 5 for 2005 by EUR 94 million at current prices."
"On the basis of these budgetary constraints for 2005, new entities such as the European School of Administration may have to be delayed unless savings are made by launching such bodies."
"The amount of staff in most of the institutions has been increasing rapidly to cater for the needs of the enlargement."
"The main bulk of these additional needs related to the enlargement are covered in the 2002-2004 budgets, even if a number of measures remain to be taken."
"In view of the delays in recruitment procedures, a thorough assessment will be made of the situation in view of the 2005 budget."
"We are assuming that the financial impact of expanding the institutions' premises will occur mainly after 2005."
"A key question for the 2005 budgetary procedure will continue to be the administrative reforms of the institutions."
"That brings me to Parliament (Section I), where several uncertainties relating to the drawing up of Parliament's budget for 2005 need to be considered, such as the current lack of agreement on a Members’ Statute, the actual outcome of the enlargement-related recruitments in 2004, and developments of several building projects."
"At this stage, therefore, we reserve our position regarding the limit of 20% of the expenditure under heading 5."
"It is regrettable that the Member States have not yet been able to agree on a Members’ Statute and it is hoped that progress will be made on this during the course of 2004."
"The same also applies to the Statute for Members’ assistants."
"As far as the financing of the European Political Parties is concerned, I think we agree that this expenditure should in principle remain outside Parliament’s self-imposed ceiling of 20% of heading 5 as it is not an administrative expenditure of the institution but an operational one."
"However, I am ready to compromise on this particular point and accept the text of Mrs Buitenweg’s Amendment No 8, which leaves open the option of including this expenditure within the 20% ceiling."
"In view of the delays in recruitment procedures for staff from the new Member States and difficulties encountered in recruiting especially linguistic staff from certain new Member States, we consider that a decision on making appropriations available for additional enlargement-related staff can only be taken at the first reading of the 2005 budget."
"A mid-term plan for building projects is necessary in order to define the level of Parliament's budget in 2005 in view of possible capital injections needed to pursue the property policy."
"As regards the functioning of the car service, we need to re-evaluate it to see if it provides a satisfactory service to Members while guaranteeing value for money."
"Moving on to Council (Section II), the Council is asked to consider presenting its estimates with the Preliminary Draft Budget instead of its first reading to increase transparency."
"Parliament will also continue to monitor the Council operational budget, while respecting the Gentlemen's Agreement as regards the administrative expenditure."
"As for the Court of Justice (Section IV), here we note that this institution has, in the last couple of years, experienced higher growth rates in staff than most other institutions."
"With regard to the Court of Auditors (Section V), we mention that the Court of Auditors has distributed its enlargement-related staff increase over the 2004 and 2005 budgets."
"Finally, as regards the Economic and Social Committee (Section VI) and the Committee of the Regions (Section VII), we ask both committees to pursue budgetary rigour in their estimates, especially in staff requests and building projects, and to improve the cooperation as regards the joint services to fully benefit from the new joint premises."
"We expect that the move to the Belliard building and the vacation of the current buildings will take place as foreseen."
"A few points did not make it through the vote in the Committee on Budgets. We present again to the House only the most important of these, on which I would ask for your support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, who is known for his rigour, as those of us who have worked with him in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgets are well aware, particularly when negotiating the issue of European Agencies over a long period of time."
"At the moment the usual advocates of budgetary rigour and saving are more necessary and more realistic than ever, because now there is a reduction in the ceiling for heading 5 and I would find it difficult to name any rapporteur who was more notorious than Mr Kuckelkorn for their rigour to carry out these cuts."
"Furthermore, I am genuinely curious to see the report of the General Secretaries of the institutions on the estimates of the administrative needs for 2005."
"I believe it is going to be a very fortunate and beneficial year for everybody since the Secretaries of the various institutions are going to have to reconcile enlargement and its administrative requirements with the restriction we are going to be faced with next year of the reduction of EUR 140 million in heading 5."
"By the way, this rigour which is being asked of the other institutions must also be applied to the Commission and to the European Parliament itself."
"Our group, Mr Kuckelkorn, believes it is perfectly possible to remain next year within the 20% limit for the European Parliament’s budget, particularly after the Council, as a result of the opposition, above all, of the German Government, has blocked the reform of the Members’ Statute."
"Our group has presented and defended amendments in the Committee on Budgets in particular on the issue of multilingualism and its implementation."
"We tried this in the 2004 budget and we would be very happy to find now that we have an interlocutor open to dialogue on the possible initiatives our group is presenting."
"At the moment the report, voted on in the Committee on Budgets, supports it."
"We entirely agree with the rest of the measures in Mr Kuckelkorn’s report and we are finally left with the issue of the funding of the political parties."
"My group would have liked – and we were one vote away from achieving it in the Committee on Budgets – that committee to express its support for including this funding of European political parties within Parliament’s limit of 20%."
"What we did not want with this amendment we are presenting was to have to negotiate the funding of the political parties year after year, which would be the case if we were funding outside the limit of 20%."
"Funding them within the 20% limit would prevent this situation and would ensure a quick negotiation by means of a transfer."
"We should remember that the code of conduct necessary for this transfer to political parties is due to be finalised very soon."
"Nevertheless, because of the opposition of other political groups, and particularly yours, Mr Kuckelkorn, this has not been possible and therefore the compromise solution proposed in the amendment of the Greens/ALE Group seems to us to be acceptable as the only way to avoid jeopardising this transfer, which must be carried out in 2004, in this budgetary year."
"Furthermore, with this compromise, with this amendment from the Greens, we would prevent the budgetary restriction of heading 5 from jeopardising the functioning of the political parties during next September, as they themselves warn, which may be faced with serious operating problems of an administrative nature if this transfer does not take place."
"I am pleased that Mr Kuckelkorn is prepared to take this compromise into account – to vote for this amendment – and, if this is the case, Mr President, I believe that the rest of the vote on the report by Mr Kuckelkorn will be practically unanimous because, on the rest of the major issues, we fully share his thinking."
"– Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, for an excellent report."
"Next year’s budget is very rigorous in terms of the administrative budget, as the rapporteur stated."
"The fact that this year we shall have ten new Member States and the same number of new official languages makes it all the more rigorous."
"The issue of Parliament’s multilingualism is an enormous challenge. It calls for a new kind of flexibility in the areas of translation and interpreting."
"Nowhere else in the world is there a body that functions so multilingually as the EU institutions."
"This nevertheless requires special action and care; otherwise, the multicultural principle could become chaos."
"That is why the administration should make a special effort to ensure that the posts are filled and the translation work flows smoothly right from the moment of accession."
"In the new environment there will be an increase in retour interpreting."
"This could lead to a situation where all of Parliament is dependent on one interpreter who is translating from a less common official language into a more common one."
"To ensure the quality of translation work it will be necessary to translate from more than one interpretation booth."
"This in practice means making special demands on the ‘bigger’ language groups, such as English, French and German, making it necessary for them to be able to translate from more source languages than the other interpreter groups."
"A major political issue in recent years has been the adoption of the Members’ Statute."
"It was hugely disappointing that it should have become the subject of internal disagreements in the Council."
"The European Parliament, and its current President, Patrick Cox, in particular, had worked very hard dealing with this matter, and, consequently, it was too bad that it was torpedoed."
"It is important that the Members’ Statute is adopted speedily, so that it could come into effect preferably by the start of the next parliamentary term."
"This year’s budget at long last saw the implementation of activity-based budgeting as far as the Commission is concerned."
"It allows us to see directly how much each activity costs."
"The same activity-based budgeting approach should also gradually be applied to the administrative budget, to the European Parliament, for example."
"This way we would also be in a better position to monitor developments in administrative costs and expenditure in different administrative branches."
"I would like to wish the rapporteur every success in his work."
"– Mr President, Mr Kuckelkorn’s report is a preliminary expression of opinion mainly on Parliament’s budgetary procedure for 2005."
"It is unfortunate that the Council could not adopt the new Members’ Statute."
"When the European Parliament itself voted in favour of reviewing its own salary and travel expenses system, it was a big step in the right direction."
"It is not morally right to try to cheat on travel expenses, even if it is not actually against the rules of Parliament to travel tourist class for the price of a business class ticket."
"As Members themselves were prepared to entirely give up this unjustifiable source of income for the sake of the airlines, it was unfortunate that the Council did not take up the offer."
"Germany, France, Austria and Sweden are now to blame for the justified criticism that the public make of the flaws in the pay and expenses system used in respect of Members of the European Parliament."
"A problem has also arisen with the Council concerning another matter."
"The Council wants pan-European political party support for the European Parliament’s budget, whilst Parliament would like it for the Commission’s budget."
"If there is Europarty support for the budget it cannot be allowed to impact on Parliament’s maximum total for administrative expenditure, resulting in forced cuts in other areas."
"Then there are also those of us who do not want Europarty support and who will vote against its introduction in this year’s draft supplementary budget."
"Then there is still a good number of Members of the European Parliament who have referred the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a decision."
"We are starting to pay for party support for the wrong reasons."
"Europarty support blurs democracy."
"The national parties of the ‘big’ countries can use it to dominate European party decision-making far more easily."
"The representatives of the ‘smaller’ countries would have a double problem, as they would have to make themselves heard in a Europarty dominated by the ‘large’ nations before gaining a hearing in a European Parliament elected on the basis of Member States’ populations."
"We must ensure that Parliament retains multilingualism and that personnel selection considers nationals from all countries."
"There must also be recruitment from countries other than the new Member States."
"Some Member States are under-represented on the parliamentary staff because Parliament has not properly organised staff recruitment competitions."
"Parliament must aim to keep increases in expenditure under tight control."
"– Mr President, this budget for the first calendar year with 25 Member States in the European Union really will be a test of strength."
"After all, the Commission's administrative reform has only just recently got up to speed."
"The Commission will need to make every effort to achieve sound financial management, a well-functioning information system and fully reliable accounts."
"The rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, is right to refer to the possibility of saving costs by inter-institutional cooperation."
"Considerable savings could be made if this Parliament were no longer forced to meet in Strasbourg, but this appears legally impossible without cooperation from France."
"That is why I would suggest to the Bureau that the Council, or the French Republic, should be presented with the bill for the dual location, which amounts to over EUR 200 million per annum."
"Our group emphasises the huge importance of multilingualism in this House."
"Parliament should not enhance, but rather undo, the public’s image of it as an elite club."
"Every citizen must be able to follow all public meetings in their own language."
"Democracy in diversity is the core task of this Parliament."
"Mr President, the procedure of voting without debate, applied to the Haug report on the Communities’ own resources, deprives us of a joint discussion, using this report, on the budget guidelines for 2005."
"The fact remains that the Haug report and the Kuckelkorn report have one thing in common which deserves attention and which also deserves a much wider debate than we are allowed here."
"Both of them start by calling for sound management and rigour."
"Later, however, in the report we are concerned with here, we read that, for its own budget, Parliament reserves its position on the 20% increase limit which it imposed upon itself for administrative expenditure."
"We also read, in the explanatory statement to the Haug report – and I quote – ‘new own resources should be introduced that do not take the form of contributions of the Member States and do not, taken as a whole, increase the tax burden on ordinary citizens’."
"The situation is clear then: the majority of Parliament wants to increase the Union’s budget, in particular in order to fund enlargement."
"There is nothing surprising in that; promises have to be funded and resources are not inexhaustible."
"I look to the rapporteurs and the Commission to explain how it is possible to increase the European budget without increasing the tax burden on taxpayers except by reducing the national budgets."
"If the majority accepts this principle of ‘communicating vessels’, governments and finance ministers will have to make it clear to the public which policies and measures funded from the national budget will bear the cost, in a context which is already one of rigour, and of which the Commission claims to be the guardian, inasmuch as it takes action against those States which do not comply with the stability pact."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0081/2004) by Mr Gröner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council – Follow-up to the White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth – Proposed common objectives for the participation and information of young people, in response to the Council Resolution of 27 June 2002 regarding the framework of European cooperation in the youth field."
"Mr President, we have indeed got through the agenda rather faster than usual, but youth has, I think, caught up with us."
"Our future lies in young people and one can see how much a society values them by how many possibilities it offers them and how closely it involves them in plans for the future."
"A dynamic society must offer its new generation prospects and security, both in terms of material things and social acceptance and in terms of a sense of cohesion."
"I am glad to see that the Commissioner, too, took a different estimate of the time. The White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth saw the light of day in November 2001 after much consultation with all concerned and two long years in which to mature; we do now need to think about how we can keep it alive."
"I think that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are all on the right path here."
"We need to integrate the 75 million young people between 15 and 25 in a European Union that will soon include 25 Member States, by bringing young people and youth organisations into the political arena."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and through my work in connection with this White Paper, I have followed the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of years and listened closely to what young Europeans have had to tell us."
"My conclusion is that young people want to be taken seriously, and we should not disappoint them by failing to do this."
"We have succeeded in boosting youth policy among young people, youth organisations, non-governmental organisations, political representatives in the EU and the Member States."
"If we see the White Paper as being about open coordination and mainstreaming, then the Commission’s communication on the follow-up is more about participation and information."
"Young people must be integrated more, and at an earlier stage, so that they can participate in representative democracy at the regional, national and European level."
"We particularly need to show our interest in integrating young people now as we approach the European elections, but unfortunately we are discussing this important matter at a late hour in a House that is almost empty."
"Young people communicate on the Internet and the Commission has therefore opened a youth portal but this falls far short of what is needed, which is information that is local and has been specifically developed for them."
"They need to experience equal opportunities and non-discrimination, for example in youth councils made up of equal numbers of young men and young women."
"Where no such councils exist, we need to set them up."
"Formal and informal education have to be networked with youth work to a greater degree."
"Youth programmes are already allowing hundreds of thousands of young people to meet and these, together with the thousands of voluntary work projects, lead towards social skills and a European outlook."
"If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economic area in the world, we must make every effort to ensure that no young people are excluded."
"Those who are considered to be disadvantaged – female immigrants, girls, and young men – and on the fringes of the European Union and of society, are the ones whom we most need to integrate."
"Regional cooperation, culture and sport all serve as a bridge to help overcome prejudices and solve the problems of tomorrow."
"In November 2003, the Council stipulated some common objectives."
"The first evaluation of the new action lines’ implementation will be carried out at the end of 2005 and the Commission will then draw up a progress report on the basis of the reports submitted by Member States."
"The first European Youth Week took place last year and was widely supported."
"Under the motto ‘overcoming exclusion’ we are now starting to work on the ‘Youth’ action programme and in other new areas and are trying to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient financial resources both to meet the growing demands of globalisation and to create spaces in which young people can concern themselves with future European policy."
"With the broad synergy that we have achieved between the Commission, Parliament, the political groups and even Member States, we should succeed not only in speaking to young people but also in integrating them."
"It is our goal to keep the momentum going, to support young people and strengthen youth policy in Europe."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 February, the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport unanimously adopted the own initiative report submitted by Mrs Gröner."
"That committee was right to adopt the report unanimously, because it is an excellent piece of work."
"It is the work of someone who knows young people, who likes young people, and who would like young people to be much more involved than they are at present in this Europe which we are in the process of constructing."
"We laid the foundations for this Europe, which we are in the process of constructing for and with young people, with the famous White Paper, which proposed common objectives for two priority areas, namely the participation and information of young people."
"Moreover, it was young people themselves who identified these two priority areas as the key elements in any future policy to be pursued both at European Union level and at Member State and regional level."
"I welcome Parliament’s support for the proposals aimed at ensuring that the participation of young people at all levels of democratic life and at developing accessible, appropriate quality information become a reality."
"These proposals, as Mrs Gröner has said, form part of a broader approach which is aimed at developing projects which are specific to youth policies and at the same time improving the extent to which the interests of young people are taken into account in the context of other policies."
"With this in mind, we are preparing proposals for action lines concerning voluntary activities which, as you have quite rightly said, are one of the preferred ways in which young people can become involved and assume their responsibilities as citizens."
"Personally, I believe that the creation of a real European voluntary service, with a critical mass and therefore with visibility, will give new impetus to our youth policies."
"In order to get there, however, we will also need new funding, because young people are not rich."
"We have to help them to put their idealism into practice."
"In this sense, the new financial perspectives are the ideal framework in which to find an answer to our questions."
"Moreover, I have also suggested guidelines for a future ‘youth’ programme funded in such a way as to ensure that it can reach the critical size."
"This political communication which I am currently preparing is due to be submitted to the European Parliament before the elections, if all goes according to plan."
"I believe, Mr President, that the parliamentary initiatives which have been launched for and with young people provide an excellent response to what we frequently hear at grass-roots level, where the refrain is constantly repeated that Europe does not pay enough attention to youth policy."
"Well, I would like to see lots of young people, and lots of those who are responsible for policies with young people as their main theme, read the own-initiative report by Mrs Gröner and the European Parliament, so that they can see for themselves that that is not true."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would firstly like to say, on behalf of the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Zissener, that our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is in favour of this report provided that the principle of subsidiarity is respected."
"I believe that participation and information for young people is an issue of the utmost importance and I have always said, since I joined this Parliament, that it is the young who are important, not those of us who are not so young, because they are the future of Europe and it is in them that we must invest and apply all our efforts."
"I have a lot of contact with young people and I truly believe that they are much more receptive than adults or the elderly."
"We must take advantage of this situation."
"According to the new poll by the Eurobarometer for the coming European Parliament elections, an average of just 30% of the population is expected to vote."
"This seems to me a ridiculously low figure and we must make a great effort to increase it."
"It is not enough for all of us to sit here saying how very worried we are; we must really prove this through action."
"It is furthermore clear that we are doing something wrong."
"I will tell you an anecdote, ladies and gentlemen, concerning a situation in which I was involved right here this very afternoon."
"You are all perfectly aware that 2004 is the European year of education through sport and, although it is directed at all European citizens, it is in particular directed at young people."
"Nevertheless, this afternoon I went to see a visiting group of young Spanish students from the south of Spain, from Andalusia, from my region, and in the brief chat I had with them I asked them whether any of them could tell me what European year 2004 was."
"Not one of them – not one of the 30 young people in the room – could answer me."
"When I told them, they were rather surprised because they all realised it was something directed particularly at them."
"This is a sign that perhaps we are doing something wrong and we must correct it as soon as possible."
"To do so we need greater cooperation between youth organisations and public authorities."
"We must work hard to achieve this and I believe that the report by Mrs Gröner is an initial step towards providing more information for young Europeans."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of young people’s involvement in society cannot be overemphasised."
"In the future young people will have greater responsibility as the age structure of Europe’s population alters and the proportion of young people diminishes."
"The Commission’s communication on objectives relating to the participation of the young and providing them with information is an important step forward in the strengthening of cooperation at EU level in youth policy."
"It is gratifying that the draft Constitution also recognises the importance of involving young people."
"Our rapporteur, Lissy Gröner, who with very good reason personifies Parliament’s youth policy, has once again done an excellent job."
"I, for my part, also want to thank the Commission for the work it has done for young people."
"The large-scale consultation process that preceded the White Paper relating to youth policy was a considerable effort that eventually inspired youth organisations to work at EU level."
"Now we have to ensure that support for the involvement of these organisations continues and that the results of their work are also visible in the Community’s youth policy."
"I am pleased that there was general agreement with my proposal to increase appropriations to youth organisations in this year’s budget, and the multiannual action programme to finance youth organisations now being finalised is also welcome as it at last guarantees a legal basis for them."
"The rapporteur’s call for young people being encouraged to take part in the first European elections of the enlarged EU is of primary importance."
"To make young people more active with regard to voting, alternative ways of casting one’s vote still being developed should now be exploited."
"The young are avid Internet users and voting this way could draw more young people to the ballot box."
"Although the procedure has many shortcomings in terms of election secrecy and freedom, it should not be totally ruled out."
"At least young people might become more pro-active in their voting habits if electronic ballot boxes introduced in a few Member States were located in places which are popular with the young."
"Enlargement will highlight the importance of pluralism in the European Union and, likewise, that of intercultural learning."
"The future youth programme will make it easier for young people to come into contact with one another and therefore help overcome prejudice."
"I wish in this connection to stress that intercultural learning should not just mean investment in cross-border cooperation between Member States."
"The Member States of the EU, both the current and the future ones, must provide opportunities for building contacts between young people from the predominant population and those from national minorities."
"Europe cannot afford to let nationalism and xenophobia grow."
"Mr President, I would like to stress the importance of the renewed attention being paid in this parliamentary term to the 75 million people aged between 15 and 25, who from 1 May, will be part of the enlarged Europe. If we extend the parameters to include those aged 30, this figure will clearly be even higher."
"Indeed, in Italy and in other countries of the European Union this is the only age group that actually enters the labour market on a permanent basis."
"One basic view is that young adults are no different to adults, but they are adults in a different way."
"They therefore have rights and duties, some of which are different to those pertaining to other citizens and some are similar."
"On the basis of exhaustive and extensive research, the Gröner report proposes a commitment that is also a challenge: to increase the participation and information of young people in politics."
"The information that we must manage and provide for them must be clear and specific."
"Achieving the participation that we are hoping for will not be easy, but learning to participate and learning to provide information is the best approach to developing the awareness of active citizenship that not all adults are putting into practice."
"If we agree that those who do not have a past do not have a future, then the only choice we have is to pass on the founding values of our past to young people, who are our future."
"In this way, these updated and revised values will be the seeds for tomorrow’s growth."
"We are totally in favour of the European Youth Week because it also symbolises the priority commitment that is being given to a new drive for European youth that can count on several assets, such as intercultural learning, environmental protection, sport and art, to give just a few examples."
"We are redoubling our efforts as adults on social exclusion and xenophobia because it is not words but practical deeds and actions that have the greatest educational impact."
"Thus, working on young people and for young people also becomes a way to work on ourselves and we should thank young people for this opportunity."
"Mr President, I should like to join with other speakers in congratulating the rapporteur on her work."
"As per the title of the Commission's White Paper on the topic, youth policy can certainly be given a new impetus."
"I am pleased that the Irish presidency has also taken up the challenge contained in the White Paper and that youth issues form an important element of the presidency priorities."
"Indeed, Ireland will shortly host a major conference involving youth ministers and young people themselves, and which will have as its main theme 'young people in politics'."
"Colleagues are all aware that in a few short months the citizens of Europe will have an opportunity to cast their votes in the elections for the European Parliament."
"Recent surveys of public opinion and interest in the elections are, I have to say, disturbing, particularly the low numbers of young people who say they intend to vote."
"After the ten new countries join, the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 25 will rise to 75 million."
"Many of these young people will be able to express their political will as first-time voters in the European elections."
"The rapporteur identifies participation and information as key areas for development in the context of EU youth policy."
"These are both key in the European elections, and we as public representatives have a vital role to play in informing young people about Europe and what it is doing for them, and encouraging them to make their voice heard."
"In each of our Member States we need to take a hard look at ways of improving the active participation of young people in political life."
"This goes beyond voting in elections, and includes membership of political parties, political movements and various non-governmental organisations."
"We must strive to convince our young people that they can make a difference and that they can bring change to our society."
"A failure on our part to do so will lead to levels of apathy which will gradually erode all our democracies."
"Mr President, this is the longest speech I have made as a MEP."
"I have never had three minutes’ speaking time, and now I – the representative of the Italian Pensioners’ Party – have been given this length of time to speak on a report that concerns young people."
"I support and agree with the report on the participation and information of young people. A short while ago, however, when I was listening to my fellow Members speaking about the reports on the budget and other subjects – I do apologise – but I nodded off."
"In my state of drowsiness two questions popped into my head: Are young people really different to the elderly?"
"Are the elderly really different to young people?"
"It is said that young people want love, but old people also want and need love."
"Young people want to have money, but old people also want to have and need to have money."
"Young people want to travel and dance, but old people also want to travel and dance."
"No, there must be some difference!"
"In 45 years of working for the elderly, I have heard them say many times – and I regret this – that growing old is terrible."
"As a result, I am sure that the European Parliament has not just thought about young people but also about elderly people and has prepared several different reports and communications for them."
"I will have to listen to them all in the final months of this parliamentary term because I am sorry to say that, to date, very few have been presented."
"I have also been thinking about other matters."
"Is it right to get young people more involved in political life and in the decisions that affect them?"
"Is it right that young people are the best placed to draw up regulations and laws that concern them?"
"Are women the best placed to take decisions concerning their problems?"
"Are old people the best placed to take decisions concerning their problems?"
"I do not think so, Mr President."
"The answer that I came up with will surprise you."
"I agree that young people must take decisions and have power over everyone and over everyone’s lives."
"How else could I justify the fact my daughter Elisabetta Fatuzzo, at 32 years old, is at this very moment preparing to give a speech on Lombardy television, on the subject of pensioners and the elderly?"
"This would not be possible if we thought that old people were better at talking about old people than young people are, and vice versa."
"I therefore call on the Commission to make every effort to ensure that Europe continues to help young people and draw them closer to Europe so that they are also in a position where they have more say in matters concerning men and women of all ages."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0080/2004) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the role of schools and learning at school in giving the greatest number of people access to culture."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, access to culture is a for the all-round development of any human being."
"It is, additionally, an essential requirement of any Western European-style representative democracy, a factor in eliminating inequality and an increasingly important factor for progress and development."
"Culture must, therefore, constitute one of the most solid platforms supporting a Europe of the citizens."
"It is no longer possible, as Jean Monnet would have wished, to make culture the starting point, which could be a contentious notion at a time when we are concerned primarily with the priorities of economic intervention."
"We must instead pick up the baton of culture and meet the challenges set by European integration by celebrating the variety of cultures and the cultural dimension of Europe."
"We live in a globalised society, in an enlarged Europe, in a time of various crises, faced with the new, streamlined and stimulating presence of the national identities and traditional cultures of almost 400 million citizens. In this context, politicians must give serious attention to issues of access to culture and of constructing a European worldview, an image capable of incorporating differences into its procedures, whilst ensuring that these differences are respected and valued, in a pluralistic, tolerant and dynamic way."
"We therefore call on the Members of this House to rethink and revive the role of the school in access to culture, not only in terms of the basic skills that schools can teach and of the key components in each national identity that each Member State feels should be a part of its programmes, but also in terms of Europe’s enormous cultural heritage, in its almost infinite variety of language, literature, fine art, music, theatre, tradition; in other words, everything that provides each of us with our essential mechanisms for relating to and identifying with the world."
"Schools cannot, of course, be encyclopaedias, nor should they conform to stereotypical international standards, or merely churn out hackneyed clichés."
"They must offer citizens a major opportunity for access to culture and must inculcate, in everyone who attends school, from the earliest ages onwards, respect, enthusiasm and a taste for cultural expression that can help citizens to reflect on what it means to be part of Europe’s rich panoply of civilisation and culture."
"The steps that can be taken towards this end are many and varied and, as far as we are concerned, must begin with specific elements of school life."
"This report, in which many suggestions from members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport of every political hue were taken on board, has this very aim: to express the desire, on behalf of Parliament, that we should meet this challenge, because if we do not, European integration will make little sense and will not be worthy of the name."
"If citizens are armed with a knowledge of European culture, it will surely be impossible for them to remain indifferent towards the values that characterise it."
"It would be a contradiction in terms to comply with the Lisbon Strategy and at the same to pursue the aims of a knowledge-based economy, if culture were limited to the status of poor relative in this area."
". Mr President, Mr Graça Moura, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and above all its rapporteur, Mr Vasco Graça Moura, for a clear-sighted report which stresses the interface between schools and culture."
"I should like to broaden the scope of the discussion so as to include, as well as schools in the strict sense of the word, the school of life which is the family."
"That is where it all starts, and later it continues at school."
"I am very happy to see, Mr President, that as always Parliament not only supports what the Commission is doing but also adds to the new ideas being developed by the Commission, thereby helping it to forge ahead."
"You are right in saying that we cannot build Europe solely on the basis of the economy and finance."
"Europe is constructed on the basis of men and women, and therefore of cultures."
"I agree with you in recognising that education systems ought to guarantee that, by the time they complete their secondary education, students possess the knowledge and skills which are necessary for them to prepare to assume their roles as citizens in Europe."
"I say ‘ought to’ because the reality is somewhat different, as we are all well aware."
"Even though students sometimes learn about their own regional or national roots, they are still a very long way off from learning about the roots of others, the roots of their neighbours."
"During a previous debate on the subject of youth, I gave you a figure."
"It referred to the Comenius programme, which links together schools in the European Union, so as to enable young people to participate in joint projects, thereby learning about the cultures of neighbouring countries."
"Well, despite the fact that two million students took part in this programme, that represents only one per cent of the population of our schools."
"We are therefore still a long way from achieving our aims."
"We are doing the right thing, but we are not doing enough, and we need to be aware of this."
"Our education programmes are therefore trying to respond to the desire of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Culture, and to the need which lies behind that desire, i.e. that our young people should learn about the real world in which they live."
"In this context, our cultural programmes prove to be valuable instruments for making Europeans aware of cultural diversity."
"Once again, however, this is not enough to reach all our citizens, or even the great majority of them."
"In the world of cinema, there is the MEDIA programme, which also helps to make people aware of cultural diversity through the medium of film, and which is obtaining good results."
"I would also ask you to remember the first major pan-European cultural event, Cinedays, the aim of which was above all to teach young people about cultural diversity through the cinema."
"There again, it was a good thing but it was not enough."
"I should therefore like to say to you that I shall need all your support in order to reinforce this aspect in the financial perspective and in the new programmes which I intend to submit to you shortly."
"We are already doing this, though our efforts are a mere drop in the ocean."
"In saying that, I am thinking about the Culture 2000 Programme and the RESEO project, which brings together the educational services of the major European opera companies with one aim in mind, to enable children and young people to discover opera through its cultural roots."
"I am also thinking about the CLIOH's Workshop, which is setting up cooperation between many European universities with a view to producing teaching material on European history."
"Yes, these things exist, but there must be a willingness at national level to make them an obligatory component of history syllabuses and of cultural education."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to announce that an initiative has been launched with a view to carrying out a major study to produce an inventory of best practices in bringing together culture and education in Member States, candidate countries and third countries in the European Economic Area."
"The next Parliament will have the results of that study at the beginning of 2005."
"We are not, therefore, content just to sit and complain."
"We are making progress, even though we know that that progress is very limited."
"Mr Graça Moura, you will understand, in these circumstances, that your report comes just at the right moment and is grist to our mill inasmuch as it gives us ideas, it supports our actions, and it points us in the right direction, which will be very useful at a time when, as you know, education and culture are increasingly regarded as major elements in the construction of European citizenship."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to say a big thank you to Parliament and to its rapporteur, for this important contribution towards the future of our young citizens."
"Mr President, I have three minutes to make a speech about the importance of culture for our children and the future of the education systems across the European Union."
"As a famous French historian might have commented, : this is not a subject which should be treated lightly."
"Commissioner Reding is absolutely right that our own national governments should be encouraged to support the initiative of the rapporteur, supported by the Commission, that when it comes to programmes and projects affecting education, they might consider a certain generosity of spirit and indeed financial generosity towards the programmes that we are commonly working to support."
"At the base of this misunderstanding is the notion that culture is purely national."
"Of course a part of culture is national, but as the rapporteur points out, we have many identities; we have a local and a regional identity and indeed a European identity."
"It is not a historical accident that the rapporteur’s country and my country, England, share the same patron saint – St George."
"Unhappily perhaps, this may have something to do with the fact that England and Portugal, allies of old, founded this union in battle – a crusade – in the Iberian Peninsula."
"Our children must of course learn about conflict and disagreement and their disastrous consequences, but they should also learn about what brings people together: commerce and trade, for example."
"Between England and Portugal there is the cork trade and indeed the port wine trade."
"What role do our schools have in sharing the upbringing of the young?"
"As Commissioner Reding has pointed out, it is not only schools – and I speak as a former teacher of young children."
"I was always conscious, however, that the lasting impressions had been made way before school by families; by parents and grandparents."
"A minister of propaganda in a European dictatorship said, 'When I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver'."
"That sounds as if it is meant to be a flippant comment, but we know what tragic consequences dictatorship brought to human lives in so many European countries."
"I would hope that the Council of Ministers, when it next discusses these matters to which the Commission has drawn our attention, will have sufficient generosity of spirit to say that it will increase the education and culture budget – not simply in terms of finance, but in also terms of expertise, interest and political support – and that we will learn about our neighbours and about our common culture and heritage."
"Egypt, Crete, Greece, Rome and so on are of course part of England's experience, as indeed that of Portugal, Germany and everywhere else."
"But unless our children are given a sound basis of knowledge and understanding, then perhaps later on in life it will become harder for them to gain a successful career and sufficient financial resources."
"Sound knowledge, however, may bring them a little wisdom in times of difficulty."
"I hope that wisdom may be shared in the Council of Ministers."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Graça Moura has submitted a report that shows how the school can indeed provide public access to culture."
"As you rightly pointed out though, Commissioner, there is a large gap between the theory that we have before us and the practice in European schools."
"In order to close this gap, we need to be more aware that in our changing and complex times, schools play a crucial role in creating cultural openness."
"This does not mean that we disregard the national cultural heritage, rather it means creating a wider cultural openness in which we live together beyond the bounds of borders and without hostility having a chance even to arise."
"Looking back upon my own school days, I have a very clear memory of a school exchange that took place with Sweden. At that time, the war had just ended and Germany was not a popular country."
"The Swedes were however willing to engage in a cultural dialogue with school pupils from my country."
"This left a lasting mark upon me, and I think this is the right way to go about it, so, in the amendments I have tabled – and which have happily been approved – I emphasise that today more than ever before the school is a place of intercultural dialogue."
"In my day we did not have any Turks or Italians at school."
"Today however, it is quite normal for there to be a mixture of different nationalities and this represents a great opportunity for intercultural dialogue and for conveying values such as respect for others and equality in spite of differences."
"This idea is reflected in the report and we must endeavour to see that it is implemented."
"These fine words must not be left to stand alone; those who are responsible for the education policy in their country must now make them their own."
"Commissioner, you pointed out that families have a part to play here, and this is also something that I have taken up."
"It is imperative for parents to work with the school and to have some personal involvement so that the overall concept finds support from everyone."
"And finally, I hope that this report will be approved by the majority and will eventually be transposed into policy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura warmly on his initiative in discussing the role of education in relation to culture and its dissemination, and, schooling, being compulsory across Europe, is a good instrument to bring culture, including common European culture, to citizens of the future."
"Education can play a significant role in this and make the parents, and with them the children, aware of what culture has to offer."
"Europe is not only an economic project but also, above all, a cultural project; what unites us is culture and cultural diversity."
"Moreover, I think that it is in the interest of enlargement that the different perspectives of culture are discussed; the accession countries have a different view of our history, and there is still a long road ahead of us before we can all acknowledge and recognise what we have in common."
"I would like to point out, though, that education is, of course, a matter of national concern."
"We in Europe may be able to make recommendations and provide information about European culture, but it simply is not up to the EU to do as some of us are proposing and force the Member States to include this information in their curricula."
"My group will certainly distance itself from that."
"I do share Mr Graça Moura's view that the emphasis within education should not only lie on the academic subjects, but that due consideration should also be given to creative subjects."
"In that respect, I should like to stand up for music education, including classical music and opera."
"Both boast a long tradition in Europe, but are more or less disregarded in schools."
"In addition, access to culture is important."
"Children who grow up in families where little is done about culture have difficulties."
"Ideally, parents should adopt the role of guides, but schools can also play an important role in this."
"I should therefore like to point out that schools should involve the parents."
"In that way, education in creative subjects can receive additional support, and far more interest in culture be generated."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, for all the work he has done on this report."
"I believe it is vitally important to provide greater numbers of citizens with access to culture."
"Schools, for good reason, must play a very important role in this regard, although I must also say that I completely agree with the Commission that this is not just the responsibility of the schools."
"It is also the responsibility of families."
"It is also vital that children have the opportunity to know what surrounds them, both at local and at regional level, at national level and at European level. This is where we have to be much more involved and play a more important role."
"In Spain we often get the impression that children have little knowledge of their national culture, let alone of European culture."
"We all know that it is important that children identify with their city, their town, their region and their country, but it also important – without in any way undervaluing what other speakers have said – that children have some sense of identity as Europeans, and this is one of the objectives that we here must fight for."
"It is difficult for us to feel European if we do not know Europe, and knowing it means being aware of its history, its geography, its economy, its literature, its philosophy, and also its sports."
"It would be very positive if this could be a common subject in all the schools in all the Member States, and also if we could promote student exchanges more so that what they learn they learn ."
"We often say in my country that a picture is worth more than a thousand words."
"I would like to say finally that it is essential that the educational services of museums, theatres, libraries, etc. which are available to the public, are available in more than one official language of the European Union. And if possible in several, so that we can all identify with what we are going to read."
"Of course, all of the things we are talking about tonight cannot be carried out unless there is the Community budget to do so, and this is going to be our first great battle and we must fight for it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what exactly is the role of public schools?"
"How far does it extend and in what does it consist?"
"In his report, Mr Graça Moura deals very well with these questions."
"He considers the extent to which culture should be taught in schools and also at how far this should be financed and supported."
"These issues are, of course, mutually dependent."
"I think it is very important to teach culture in schools if we want young people to be aware of and confident about their identity, and capable of becoming active European citizens."
"We need to work on this and introduce young people to cultural exchange as early as possible."
"We also need to learn how to teach young people about conflict resolution, as this is something that we would expect schools to include in their lessons on culture and is a prerequisite for achieving the goals set in Lisbon which have been mentioned many times already today."
"We cannot ignore the fact that European culture and cultural history form the foundation of the common economic area and that we therefore need to invest much more in education than we are presently doing."
"The EU average for public expenditure on schools is 4.94% of GDP."
"Although in Sweden expenditure is 7% and in Austria 5.75%, these figures are both declining."
"It just cannot be right that in many countries, less is now being spent on education instead of more."
"I wonder what the culture ministers and government officials are thinking when they lend their support to the goals set in Lisbon and at the same time reduce the means for implementing them."
"This is wrong and needs to be put right."
"We must, therefore, continue to point out that cuts in the field of education – even in the arts – lead to very serious deficiencies."
"After all, if creativity is not taught and not given any room to develop, how can young people learn to deal with the constant changes that will be demanded of them in their careers and personal lives?"
"The first step should be to increase investment in art, culture and knowledge, not reduce it."
"Instead of merely preserving our much-praised cultural diversity, we need to promote it and allow it to enjoy a successful future."
"Mr President, I must congratulate Mr Graça Moura because this document is the result of a common conviction, of a professional approach dedicated to culture."
"To advocate common learning in schools at a time when nationalist arguments are increasing seems to me to be courageous and worthy of our gratitude."
"I say it is worthy of praise because fundamentally, although this document appears to be written with a light touch, it defends the universality of knowledge and wisdom to the hilt."
"We also note a degree of rebelliousness against an exaggerated interpretation of subsidiarity."
"We in this House argue that education for an integrated Europe does not end simply with the euro or other common economic aspects, but that it must be the result of a sense of belonging, of a common project which must be based on history, on knowing who we are, what our common foundations are and, above all, where the principles and values of our times are to be found and what the thinking behind the united Europe we are moving towards is."
"Furthermore, I believe there has been an unbalanced development of the European system."
"Common policies have been enhanced every day, but there has been fear of making progress on the creation of common store of knowledge."
"Nationalisms – I repeat – with an inbred, small-minded and egotistical interpretation of the administration of knowledge and education have increased the suspicion of the creation of common information, which could be shared by all European educational establishments."
"I have tabled an amendment calling for an active policy in favour of re-evaluating our common cultural heritage."
"An active and lively policy which helps the weakest and creates common criteria."
"Likewise, I have called for there to be information signs in museums in more than one language of the Union, in several languages of the Union."
"I think that looking at signs in our own cities and in our own languages is a concept that must be overcome."
"I have tabled an amendment calling on the Commission and the Member States to promote research projects on the great cornerstones of European civilisation, such as common law, the history of the institutions, education, forms of co-existence and common rules, social and anthropological practices, as well as artistic expressions."
"I believe and advocate that if we study the history of our civilisation and culture or of our institutions we will be able to rebuild foundations which existed, which exist and which unite us."
"To put it another way: we are the result of a constant exchange of ideas, of models of life, of solutions and concepts which allow us to say that Europe has been preparing for centuries to be Europe."
"Europe has worked hard for a common heritage."
"This is why it has been so easy to build Europe."
"Municipal life, the concept of human dignity, of individual rights, of people’s freedom, of the family is the principal social nucleus and of municipalities as the broadest framework of rights and co-existence, solidarity, the concept of the State, they are all European concepts, as well as the concept of secularity."
"Furthermore, the very differences which make up what we so often call our cultural diversity demonstrate the wealth of interpretation and ways of living with a single common heritage."
"Let us offer young people the opportunity to know all of it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, although education in the Union is the responsibility of the Member States, there are many channels in the European Union for the support of cultural education in schools."
"The main ones are the multiannual programmes, such as Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Culture 2000."
"They all encourage cultural creativity and mobility, intercultural dialogue and knowledge of the history of the European peoples."
"The learning of languages, something which is closely tied to cultural skills, has an important role to play in Union policy."
"In 2001 we celebrated the European Year of Languages."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur highlights the importance of knowledge of European history and cultural heritage in his report."
"The history of our continent is not only wars and bloodshed but also a fruitful interaction that has enriched our national cultures."
"We can see that many artists who have been essential to the identity of independent nation-states have at the same time been important European players."
"With enlargement of the Union there will be a need to raise awareness of the culture and history of the new and the old Member States, as the report quite rightly states."
"I believe it will strengthen our sense of alliance, as the countries of the Baltic and Central Europe that are now joining the Union are firmly rooted in a common European cultural heritage."
"Culture, education and research occupy a central position in the Commission proposal in the financial frameworks for the period 2007-2013."
"Investment in these is crucial to success in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, but culture and education have a broader function than just economic success."
"They create a framework for people’s intellectual growth and mutual understanding."
"I therefore welcomed the report’s recommendation that the Commission and the Member States should ensure that in European research programmes encouragement is given to projects concerning the fundamentals of European civilisation such as common law, the history of institutions and education, the rules of coexistence, social and anthropological practices and forms of artistic expression."
"I hope that the objectives set in the report are duly taken into consideration when the Commission is drafting new multiannual programmes relating to culture, education and youth exchange schemes."
"Similarly, the report contains the ingredients for negotiations among the EU Ministers for Education and Culture regarding common educational and cultural-political objectives."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0017/2004) by Mrs Frahm, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directives 79/117/EEC and 96/59/EC."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, for the intensive work that has been done on the report on the Commission proposal for a regulation on persistent organic pollutants."
"I am grateful for the support given by the Parliament and the rapporteur to the rapid handling of this legislative proposal."
"I am also very pleased about the effective cooperation between the Parliament and the Council, which makes a first reading agreement possible."
"A prompt adoption of this regulation should enable the Community to ratify the Stockholm Convention at the time of its entry into force in May 2004."
"Furthermore, the regulation will allow those Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention to do so promptly."
"Most importantly, the regulation will ensure that the European Union as a whole can meet its international obligations relating to persistent organic pollutants."
"These substances persist in the environment for decades, accumulate in living organisms and travel over borders far from their sources."
"Most of these substances are known carcinogens, or are otherwise toxic."
"It is evident that global action is essential to tackle the risks posed by these substances."
"However, I would like to draw the attention of the Parliament to an important issue raised in the draft report, namely the legal basis of the regulation."
"The Commission is proposing that the regulation be based on Article 175(1) – environment – and Article 95(1) – internal market."
"In the draft report, it is proposed that the regulation should be based on a single legal basis, namely Article 175(1)."
"While the Commission can otherwise fully support the compromise reached between the rapporteur and the Council, the Commission cannot accept the change of the legal basis."
"The legal basis as proposed by the Commission is justified by the fact that the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 in the proposed regulation – concerning production, the placing on the market and use of intentionally produced POPs – are relevant to the functioning of the internal market."
"Furthermore, these particular rules are meant to be transferred to the future REACH regulation on chemicals, which is based on Article 95(1) only."
"Mr President, to start with, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs here in Parliament, particularly the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, for their sound and constructive cooperation on the POP proposal, and I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Irish Presidency, which is unfortunately not here this evening, for having worked so energetically to get this proposal implemented."
"Finally, I also wish to thank the Commission which, despite the disagreement concerning the legal basis, has done a very constructive and valuable piece of work in order to get matters in order."
"You will notice that there are a total of 121 amendments to the report, but that is not the basis on which we shall be voting tomorrow."
"We shall vote in three blocks, and I hope that Parliament will adopt the first block straight away, thereby making the second block superfluous, and finally vote in favour of the third block."
"If we do this, we shall have an agreement with the Council at first reading."
"One of the most important things in the report and the agreement is that we have succeeded in amending the legal basis, so that we now refer to protection of the environment and human health instead of protection of the internal market, which were the terms in which the Commission’s original proposal was couched."
"This is an important victory for Parliament on this issue in particular, but also in more general terms, since there is an ever increasing tendency for the Commission to deal with environmental proposals in terms of the internal market."
"I hope that the forthcoming Parliament too will stand by the principle that environmental issues must be dealt with as such."
"We have managed to get a ban introduced on the production, use and placing on the market of POPs."
"We have also managed to get some very ambitious objectives of the regulation introduced, so that unintentional emissions too must cease – at least in the longer term."
"This is a complicated matter."
"We have, however, made clear references to, for example, the Rio declaration and the precautionary principle, as Parliament wished."
"We have achieved a ban on lindane with immediate effect, so that it has been moved from a list of restricted substances to a list of banned substances."
"That is also an important victory."
"The exemptions that are otherwise contained in the regulation are quite clearly exceptions that must only be applied in quite extraordinary cases, and a high level of scientific evidence is required before they can be applied."
"We have had restrictive control provisions introduced for both existing and new chemicals containing POPs."
"That too is important, I think, especially since progress is now unfortunately slow in the work on REACH."
"We have drawn up provisions stating that all stocks containing POPs must be destroyed and treated as waste."
"We have also had some very restrictive monitoring provisions introduced for POP stocks, so that the limit value at which a duty of notification comes into effect has been halved from 100 kg to 50 kg."
"We have had a number of international commitments drawn up to the effect that the Member States must cooperate on providing technical and financial support to developing countries, so that the latter too will be in a position to comply with the Stockholm Convention."
"We have had a number of general provisions introduced, stating that those producing or storing waste must prevent the waste becoming contaminated with POPs."
"We have had provisions introduced to the effect that, as vigorously demanded by the Council of Ministers, permanent storage can only be regarded as an exception."
"We emphasise that it is an exception that can only be applied if it proves that this is the best possible solution for the environment."
"It is not a permanent exemption."
"It was our wish that it should not be possible to extend it automatically, and I think that Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council of Ministers and industry, since Parliament listened to the Council’s arguments."
"We listened to arguments from industry in this area, and now we also think that industry and the Council of Ministers – that is to say, the ministers in the Member States – must show themselves to be responsible."
"Money must be put into research and development so that methods are continually improved."
"The aim is, after all, for the exemptions not to be extended when they are reviewed in 2009."
"Time will, of course, tell, however."
"It is up to the Council, industry and Parliament to follow up this matter."
"We reject the limit values initially put forward by the Council of Ministers."
"We believed they were too high."
"Instead, we have now agreed that they will be set in 2005 and we shall ensure that a high level of protection is afforded in this area too."
"We have emphasised that something must be done to involve the population in the implementation of the POP rules."
"Information must also be drawn up that is directed particularly at vulnerable groups, and we have a requirement that infringements of the rules must be published."
"When preparing an agreement, there are, of course, also things that are not obtained, and these are things about which I do not really have enough time to say anything."
"Perhaps it is fortunate that I only have time to say something about the successes, but I hope and believe that Parliament will adopt this proposal with a large majority."
"Thank you, therefore, for your constructive cooperation on this matter."
"Mr President, I would like to make an initial reference to the issue of the legal basis of this report and to the debate it has given rise to."
"I sincerely believe that it would not be the best approach to confront internal market interests and the interests of environmental protection or the health of the citizen's."
"What is more, it seems to me a serious mistake and I personally believe precisely the opposite."
"I believe we must adopt an integrated and complementary approach, I believe that when we talk about the environment, we must also take account of the interests of the internal market and the possible difficulties it may bring with it and I believe that, when we talk about the internal market, we must take account of environmental interests."
"That is sustainable development, that is integration of the environment, the economy and employment and that is what has been advocated in the proposal for issues to deal with at this year’s forthcoming Spring Council."
"I believe that, if we really do not believe in these three pillars of integrated and joint sustainable development, and to the same degree and with the same weight in all our considerations, we would be making political statements with a view to our summits and our communications as Community institutions which are entirely erroneous and false for our citizens."
"And I frankly do not believe in this."
"I believe in this integrated approach and I am, therefore, concerned much less about the legal basis of the reports than about the real focus of their content and about how cooperation is undertaken between the various Community committees and institutions."
"In this regard, and in relation to this report, I would like to say that during the Italian Presidency very considerable progress was made on this Regulation and also the creation of general guidelines on it was provided for."
"It was not approved because there was a significant problem in relation to POP waste and in particular the alternative methods for its destruction."
"I believe that this issue has been resolved in the new Annex IV(a), which is the outcome of negotiations during the Irish Presidency."
"In this regard I believe we should congratulate Mrs Frahm because she has done excellent work in terms of reaching a consensus, firstly amongst the parliamentary political groups and secondly also with the Council, so that we can approve this report at first reading."
"That is why, although I am not completely in agreement with her in terms of emphasising environmental aspects over everything else, and I believe we should achieve the balance which is what we in the European Union and the Member States are really advocating, I do believe that it is a good piece of work, I do believe that she has had difficulties reaching agreements on issues such as waste or the specific exemption of the manufacture of dicofol, a substance accepted under very specific restrictions, in an industrial process which is also very specific and which is carried out in a manner which is confined and absolutely isolated from the environment."
"I also agree with the revision clause, which states that the Commission will review the very specific situation of dicofol at the end of 2008 and I believe that what is being done with it is to apply, once again, in a reasonable manner, the precautionary principle, making industrial activity truly compatible with the maximum protection of the environment and safety for the citizens."
"With regard to Annex II, which lists substances which can be used subject to restrictions, I believe it has been right to maintain the structure of this Annex – I know that the rapporteur was not in favour of this – but I believe that, although at the moment it does not list any specific substance, it does leave the door open to future substances which may emerge and which both the Commission and Parliament, through its approval, believe should be used, produced or marketed under certain restrictions."
"With regard to the issue of lindane, I believe that it is very good that it has moved to Annex I as a prohibited substance and that its use may be permitted under certain also very strict conditions, as proposed in the agreement."
"Finally, I believe we should stress what I mentioned earlier: compatibility is important and we must never lose the reference of sustainable development with its three aspects: economy, environment and employment."
"With that reference I believe that Europe and the Member States can go far."
"Mr President, when I arrived in Brussels this morning, I found I had received a letter from the World Nature Fund, saying that I should soon receive the results of the blood tests I took a few months ago, designed to ascertain which chemicals we have in our blood."
"I assume that many of us took this blood test."
"This test will probably show that, in common with everyone else, I have a majority of quite foreign chemicals in my blood, and some of them will probably also be such persistent organic pollutants as we are debating today."
"The fact is that we know relatively little about what this means for our health and fitness, but we know enough to be concerned."
"We have been presented with a series of alarming reports to the effect that different chemicals produce diseases and that they can, for example, affect our ability to have children."
"With that as part of the background, this proposal is very welcome, and not only the proposal but, above all, the compromise."
"The fact is that this compromise that has been negotiated is a significant improvement upon the proposal presented by the Commission."
"I should, above all, like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm for her work."
"I should also like to draw attention to a number of points I see as crucial improvements."
"The first is the legal basis."
"I think that the Commission’s tendency to treat environmental issues more and more as issues concerning the internal market is very unfortunate."
"From an ecological point of view, it is quite irresponsible to proceed in this way."
"It also reduces the Member States’ opportunities to introduce more progressive legislation."
"The EU is in that way preventing countries that wish and are able to take the lead from doing so, and that is unacceptable."
"We hope that, when it presents proposals like this one, concerning the environment, the Commission will be influenced by these considerations and stick to the legal basis for achieving environmental objectives."
"I also think that the core of the proposal – the clear ban on production, use and marketing – is very important."
"It is particularly good that the ban on hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH),including lindane, is included in the proposal."
"This reminds us that the EU’s chemicals policy does not in practice work."
"We know that it is a very small portion of the chemicals on the market that really have been tested and whose effects are really known to us."
"A small part of chemicals policy is covered by this proposal, and we now need efficient, uniform chemicals legislation within the framework of the REACH system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals."
"It is a proposal that is now being attacked quite vigorously, but we need to find out what these chemicals entail, even when, as is the case with many chemicals, they exist in relatively modest quantities."
"If too many of these chemicals are exempted, we shall be without an effective chemicals policy."
"I think this work shows that it is only right to take proper decisions when it comes to issues concerning chemicals, and it indicates the way ahead prior to the discussion of REACH."
"I wish again to thank the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Frahm and perhaps by offering a few congratulations to those of ourselves who participated in these negotiations with the Council."
"We have succeeded in reaching an agreement with the Irish Presidency on this regulation and on the implementation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants."
"There were perhaps not so many people who believed we would reach an agreement, but Mrs Frahm handled the matter extraordinarily well."
"Even if everything that has been achieved is not ideal and exactly what we should have wanted, it is still perhaps the best that could have been accomplished, given what is possible politically."
"I am very pleased."
"As others have also said, it is important for the regulation now to be implemented as soon as possible, because persistent organic pollutants are in the rogues’ gallery of dangerous chemical substances."
"They do not break down, but accumulate in our bodies and in the whole food chain."
"The levels are now so high that they are a danger both to public health and to the eco-systems and their functioning."
"The objective must be to put a complete stop to the discharges of persistent organic pollutants by banning their production, use and import."
"We must therefore go further and, in a number of cases, much further than is indicated both by the Stockholm Convention and by the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution."
"This must also apply to the new Member States that are to join the EU in May of this year."
"In some cases, requests have been made for exemptions for HCH and lindane, for example, but these cannot under any circumstances be accepted."
"I am often very surprised at how difficult it is for the Commission, the Council and perhaps sometimes also Parliament’s more conservative sector to get things through in relation to protecting people’s health and the environment and at the fact that there are repeated delays, postponements and hold-ups."
"In this area, the precautionary principle must apply fully, meaning too that new substances must be included on the list for banning or controlling these substances."
"When it comes to the legal basis, I do not understand the Commission. Nor do I understand why there has to be this kind of debate."
"The legal basis must be Article 175 of the Treaty establishing the European Community because these decisions are being taken in order to protect people’s health and the environment."
"The whole of chemicals legislation is, of course, designed to do just that."
"The fact has also been discussed from Chester onwards that it is because we cannot otherwise protect public health and the environment that we must take sound decisions in terms of a comprehensive and overall view of chemicals legislation."
"In conclusion, I think that this agreement with the Council is extremely commendable, as is the fact that we have reached it at first reading, because it is so important that we implement the agreement as soon as possible."
"– Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal."
"POPs are substances that put the public and the environment at risk, and so we should treat them with care."
"With regard to the legal basis, I share the rapporteur's view that we should opt for Article 175 on its own."
"This is what we did in the past, in respect of similar treaties such as those of Rotterdam and Basle, and so we should be consistent in this."
"The recommendation by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also supports the choice of Article 175."
"I am, in fact, curious to see whether the Commission will once again go to the Court of Justice, as happened, to everyone's surprise, with the Treaty of Rotterdam."
"Can Commissioner Monti shed light on this?"
"In addition, the standards of concentration in Annex IV should be laid down as soon as possible."
"An empty annex is of no interest to us."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to set to work in this matter."
"All things considered, I will be backing the compromise package."
"It successfully addresses my remaining objections to the Commission proposal."
"Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, for the work that she has done."
"It was a difficult issue, and one that she has brought to a successful conclusion, in close cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs."
"Mr President, persistent organic pollutants – POPs – are chemical substances that persist in the environment, accumulate through the food chain and pose a risk to human health and the environment."
"As these substances accumulate in fatty tissue in animals – including humans – by definition some of us are more at risk than others!"
"These pollutants are atmospherically transported across international boundaries, far from their sources, even to regions where they have never been used or produced."
"The ecosystems and indigenous people of the Arctic are particularly at risk because of the long-range environmental transportation and biomagnification of these substances."
"They are largely man-made toxic pollutants produced by and used in a variety of industrial sources, for example, as agricultural pesticides, in wood preservation and industrial chemicals."
"POPs include pesticides such as aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, myrex and toxaphene; industrial chemicals such as PCBs and hexachlorophine; and unwanted by-products of combustion and industrial processes, such as dioxins and furans."
"Considerable controls already exist within EU policy and relevant directives such as the WEEE Directive, the RoH Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Seveso Directive and various hazardous waste directives."
"The proposed regulation before us aims to tidy up existing legislation on the marketing and use restrictions on eight POP pesticides and to make a slight amendment to the PCB Disposal Directive."
"These measures will make it easier for states, as parties to the Protocol to the Aarhus Convention, and particularly the Stockholm Convention, to ratify both these international agreements."
"48 countries have already ratified the Stockholm Convention, including 8 Member States and 2 accession countries."
"Ireland has yet to ratify."
"The overall compromise package for this first reading agreement with the European Parliament was approved at Coreper on 13 February, and then by all political groups."
"I understand that no further amendments have been tabled."
"I congratulate Mrs Frahm on the work she has done together with the Irish presidency and the Italian presidency which preceded it."
"The proposed regulation is a temporary measure because in the medium term these substances will be covered by the REACH Proposal."
"POPs waste, like all hazardous waste in my own country, Ireland, is exported mainly to Germany."
"Germany has substantial involvement in storing POPs waste in salt mines without any processing."
"It imports POPs waste commercially for disposal in this way."
"To facilitate these operations it has sought provision to allow continuation of this practice, which I fully support."
"The issue of the disposal of POPs-contaminated waste has been at the centre of the difficulties in finding a compromise. There has been much dispute about the methods of disposal: incineration, burial in deep storage in rock or in salt mines and landfill, to name but a few."
"Under the requirements of the Stockholm Convention there are two principal methods for the treatment of POPs waste, namely destruction or irreversible transformation."
"Under this regulation there are options for the management of low content POPs waste under the provisions of the Waste Framework Directive."
"A third option, which applies to POPs waste generally, has also been agreed upon in negotiations between Parliament and the Council."
"In cases where destruction or irreversible transformation is not the environmentally preferred option, POPs waste can be stored."
"This storage can take place in disused salt mines, deep rock formations and hazardous landfill sites."
"All three forms of storage are carefully defined in existing EU legislation."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Frahm on her excellent report and also those involved in reaching a compromise."
"As my colleague Mrs Schörling pointed out, persistent organic pollutants – POPs – are chemical substances that persist in the environment."
"They accumulate through the food chain and they pose a risk not just to the environment but also to human health, causing adverse human health effects."
"These pollutants, as has been mentioned, can cross borders: they can end up far from where they originated, and indeed they have been found in areas where they have never been used, so there is a serious threat to the environment here."
"The European Community and all the Member States have signed the Protocol to the regional UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on POPs, in 1998, and the global Stockholm Convention on POPs in 2001."
"While all Member States have signed both of these, many states, including my own, have not yet ratified them."
"I The Environmental Protection Agency in Ireland is setting in place measures to have them ratified, and I welcome that."
"While most of the listed POPs are not produced or used in the Community, there is still the problem that legislation does not prevent them being placed on the market."
"As Mrs Frahm pointed out, the change of the legal basis is very important in relation to ensuring that this is an issue of public health and the environment: it is not just an internal market issue."
"Lindane was a substance used in shampoo to get rid of nits in children's hair."
"Many parents did not realise that the continual use of something like that, which contained a serious chemical, affected their children, and many people even within this Parliament have actually used these shampoos."
"There was no warning in relation to what the effects would be, and as has been pointed out, little is known about what the long-term true effects are, despite the fact that these POPs have been found in our bodies."
"This report is very welcome; the work done on the issue by Mrs Frahm is something for which we must congratulate her."
"I am also very glad to hear that the Irish presidency has been very constructive on this issue and in trying to help to get this package through, and that is also to be welcomed."
"Mr President, the Commission’s proposal really needs tightening up, and toxic POPs should have been gone from our everyday lives long ago."
"That will not happen as a result of the Commission’s proposal."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that, in her report, Mrs Frahm makes an energetic attempt to tighten matters up, and I support all the rapporteur’s proposals."
"A much more radical plan is needed, however, if we are to experience a noticeable phasing out of harmful chemicals, including the highly toxic POPs."
"Such a plan, which removes all the superfluous chemicals from our everyday lives, is not appropriate as a change to this regulation."
"I therefore wish to submit it in relation to the debate on the Commission’s proposal on chemicals, known as the REACH programme."
"As part of the phasing out of toxic chemicals, action should also be taken in response to the polluter pays principle, established by treaty."
"A duty should be imposed on the chemicals in order to finance the monitoring, assessment and remedying of damage caused by use according to the rules, as well as in order to finance the development of alternatives."
"The first substance on which it would be appropriate to impose such a tax is PVC."
"Investment must also be made in real ecological alternatives, which either already exist or are on the way, as a replacement for most chemicals."
"These include the pesticides dealt with in this directive."
"Just as, in Parliament, we have discussed the labelling of genetically modified products, labelling arrangements should also, in the interests of free consumer choice, be introduced for the many toxic chemicals."
"I am sure that the day we label conventional milk ‘milk with pesticides’, there will be a decisive shift in consumer demand in favour of the organic alternatives."
"Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the PSE Group I thank the rapporteur for her work and also the presidency for its cooperation."
"This has been very a useful exercise in achieving a second reading agreement on an important proposal, one which is tackling a persistent, organic and very long-standing problem."
"We believe that this report is now a very satisfactory one and we are very happy to vote for it."
"I am very pleased that a number of the outstanding issues have been resolved."
"The whole issue of the legal basis has now been resolved, and I am satisfied with that. On the issue of POPs waste, we have come to a pragmatic realisation of the difficulties of completely abolishing waste containing POPs and we think that the appropriate proposal here will meet with the inevitable residual problems that we find with POPs being in waste and in other places."
"As regards some of the other issues, such as the problem of stockpiles, and technical and financial assistance, we have all come to reasonable agreements, and the rapporteur can be very proud that she has made a very positive step forward, which I do not think will take long to implement."
"The great thing about a second reading agreement is the willingness to take it forward into legislation quickly, which we are all waiting for."
"Naming and shaming is something which may or may not be necessary in this proposal: it is already contained in the Aarhus Convention."
"This is something we need to revisit, but a point that the rapporteur was right to raise."
"The whole issue of compatibility with the REACH Directive is one that we must all have on our minds at all times."
"That new proposal on REACH is going to be very important, but it must be comprehensive in its scope."
"We must find a way in which we can ensure, for example, that whilst POPs are outside the REACH Proposal, chemicals that contain POPs or might produce POPs as a residue are inside the proposal."
"This would be a very important step forward."
"It will certainly tighten up any potential loophole that might be created during the time in which we are going to work on that very important proposal here in the autumn."
"The PSE Group will be voting for this proposal tomorrow."
"We thank the rapporteur for her work, we thank the Commission for its proposal and cooperation, and finally the presidency for its willingness to find a second reading agreement."
". Mr President, I would like to re-emphasise that the Commission very much supports an early agreement on this regulation, except for the change of the legal basis."
"The Commission can fully support the compromise package negotiated between Council and Parliament."
"The adoption of this compromise package will enable the Community and the Member States to ratify the Stockholm Convention in good time and a resolute majority tomorrow will send a very clear signal."
"On the issue of the legal basis, the provisions on prohibitions and restrictions of intentionally-produced POP chemicals will affect the functioning of the internal market and therefore these measures should be based on Article 95(1) of the Treaty."
"The fact that these bans or restrictions are introduced in order to protect human health or the environment does not mean that these provisions cannot be adopted on the basis of Article 95."
"Article 95(3) states clearly that the Commission may propose legislation concerning health or environmental protection based on Article 95(1) if these measures have any impact on the functioning of the internal market."
"Thus it is appropriate that the regulation be based on both 175(1) and 95(1)."
"Furthermore, it should be noted that the Commission also proposes to transfer the production and use bans from the POPs Implementation Regulation to the future REACH Regulation on chemicals, which is based on Article 95."
"If the legal basis were different, this move would have an effect on the option for Member States to adopt more stringent measures."
"Therefore, the Commission considered that it was more appropriate to base these provisions on Article 95."
"Mr Blokland wondered whether the Commission would appeal to the European Court of Justice: I can only draw the House’s attention to the fact that the Commission published a declaration in the Council minutes clarifying its position in that respect."
"On the point of waste management, which Mrs Frahm, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo and Mrs Doyle mentioned, it is important to note that the amended proposal clearly stipulates that for waste, destruction or irreversible transformation is a main rule, whereas other waste management operations can be allowed only in specific, clearly-defined cases."
"Especially in regard to the high-content POPs waste, the Commission points out that permanent storage or other operations can only be allowed if destruction of the POP content is not the environmentally-preferable option."
"This is fully in line with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention."
"Moreover, the modified provisions lay down additional conditions and a procedure to ensure that the derogation is not misused."
"On these grounds the Commission can accept the compromise."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, and Parliament for this very important piece of legislative work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0056/2004) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1177/2002 concerning a temporary defensive mechanism to shipbuilding."
". Mr President, I regret that Mrs Randzio-Plath is not able to be here with us this evening."
"I would like to congratulate and thank her for the work which she carried out so promptly and smoothly."
"In the light of unfair competition from Korean shipyards and the failure of Korea to implement the provisions of the Agreed Minutes relating to world shipbuilding, signed by the EU and Korea on 22 June 2000, the Commission adopted a twin-track strategy to tackle these unfair practices in the shipbuilding sector."
"This strategy involves two instruments: the initiation of an action against Korea before the WTO and the authorisation of temporary and limited contract-related operating aid under the Temporary Defensive Mechanism – TDM – to assist Community shipyards in those segments where adverse effects have been suffered owing to unfair Korean competition."
"From the outset, a close link was established between the TDM and the action of the EU against Korea before the WTO."
"As these WTO proceedings are taking more time than originally foreseen, and as Korea continues to fail to implement the Agreed Minutes, the Commission now proposes to prolong the application of the TDM Regulation until 31 March 2005, when the final decision of the WTO appellate body is expected."
"The TDM Regulation was adopted by the Council on 27 June 2002."
"It provides for contract-related state aid up to 6% of the contract value, benefiting the shipyards hit by the Korean unfair competition."
"I would like to underline that from the outset the mechanism was strictly limited in scope and time."
"Regarding the scope, only those market segments where it has been demonstrated that the EU shipbuilding industry has suffered adverse effects as a result of unfair Korean competition are eligible for aid: container ships, chemical and product tankers and liquefied natural gas carriers."
"As for the timing, the defensive mechanism was to be applied only until the conclusion of the WTO proceedings against Korea, or until the suspension of these proceedings on the grounds that the EU considered that the Agreed Minutes had been effectively implemented."
"In any case, the support mechanism was to expire on 31 March 2004, the expected date of conclusion of the WTO proceedings."
"The Commission strictly limits its proposal to this extension and does not propose any other changes such as extension of the scope."
"I fully agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath that it would be counter-productive to weaken the EU strategy tackling Korea’s behaviour in the shipbuilding industry at the crucial moment that the satisfactory conclusion of the WTO proceedings is expected."
"I am delighted that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs called for the adoption of the proposal without amendments."
"I also am grateful that Parliament has accepted that this urgent matter should be dealt with via an accelerated procedure."
"This will allow the extension to be adopted before the expiration of the existing instrument."
"I would like to conclude by reiterating that the defensive mechanism is an exceptional measure, closely targeted – and I am closely targeting this remark! – at the trade problem with Korea."
"I therefore hope that you will be able to support the extension of the mechanism for one year with the aim of restoring normal trading conditions in the international shipbuilding market."
"Mr President, excuse me for laughing but we are not alone anymore, Mr Monti!"
"I can see two other Members arriving!"
"I thought we could have been alone, but another time maybe!"
"Mr President, unfortunately I have to say that it was I who asked to have this point debated, and for one simple reason."
"I find it difficult to understand why a temporary – and, I repeat, a temporary – subsidy arrangement must now suddenly be extended."
"As rapporteur for Parliament’s statement on the original regulation, it is fairly clear to me that I asked the Commission for a guarantee that this arrangement would only be temporary."
"The Commission assured me of this, as did you too, Mr Monti."
"For the same reason, the regulation was also limited in time."
"The regulation contained, moreover, a mousetrap clause whereby the regulation would cease immediately in the event of the dispute with South Korea being resolved."
"When an expiry date was placed on the regulation, it was precisely because there was no wish to see this arrangement become permanent, regardless of whether or not the dispute with South Korea was resolved."
"For me, this was a mitigating circumstance, since at no time have I been convinced that South Korea does in actual fact compete on unequal terms."
"On the contrary, I am afraid that this regulation has only helped to distort competition internally within the EU."
"I would therefore take the liberty of asking you, Mr Monti, whether the regulation is, in reality, on its way to becoming permanent, and whether you do not see this as a backward step in the fight against direct production subsidies. Could it perhaps be said that a promise has been broken in this case?"
"I am therefore rather tired of the matter this evening."
"You are no longer my favourite Commissioner, Mr Monti, but you can change that if you give me the right answer tonight!"
". Mr President, we are talking about temporary events and I know that being the favourite Commissioner of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen is at most a temporary situation – it may imply an in and out evolution in this lucky status."
"I believe I continue to deserve that status, not only because of the inherent generosity of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, but also because I believe – and I say this in front of witnesses! – we are sticking exactly to the promise made to you and to others in Parliament."
"Why was this mechanism adopted as temporary?"
"First because the Commission – and I in particular – was totally against the re-introduction of an unlimited, permanent mechanism on operating state aid for shipbuilding."
"It therefore had to be temporary."
"Temporary means two things; it is not permanent and it must have a logical criterion to define how temporary it is."
"The logical criterion there was the reasonable expectation about the duration of the procedure before the WTO."
"We might be accused of logical incoherence if, after having proposed this – it was also decided by Council and Parliament – we were now to depart from that logical criterion."
"To be more direct, I confirm that this is not by any means meant to be the re-introduction of a permanent mechanism."
"It continues to be strictly related in time to the conclusion of the WTO procedure."
"I should like to further clarify – and I am sure Riis-Jørgensen will appreciated this – that in spite of other views, no extension of the scope of application to other market segments has been introduced."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1)"
"(1)"
"Mr President, I see we have two clocks in this Chamber, and they seem to be completely out of sync."
"When I look at the clock over there, the impression is of Parliament’s having ground to a halt and of its no longer moving."
"That is how it has been for quite a long time, and I think we should do something about it."
"Mr Rovsing, I have been informed that the wall clock that you mentioned is indeed broken, and perhaps has been for a few months."
"We do, though, have another clock that works but which is located behind you."
"You will therefore have to turn around to check the exact time."
"We will, however, have the technicians carry out the necessary repairs and so prevent you from having to speak again on the same subject."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0053/2004) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations."
". – Mr President, the intent of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations is clear – a partnership that is truly worthy of the name."
"Accordingly, a strengthening of these mutual relations rather than growing mutual separation is what is required."
"Looked at in a matter-of-fact way, that is also what our many common interests require."
"In all fairness, however, relations between the EU and the Russian Federation are anything but ideal, and for this both parties are to blame."
"That is, therefore, the angle of this proposal for a recommendation: European self-criticism and criticism levelled at Moscow."
"In the autumn of last year, that is the very course on which this House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy embarked."
"To our satisfaction, we can conclude today that the Commission, according to its communication of 10 February, is more or less on the same wavelength, and so, apparently, is the Council."
"Incidentally, the Council should, in the view of this House, aspire to achieve more transparency in such an important and comprehensive area of policy as relations with Russia."
"This current European consensus with regard to Russia is undisputed, but what matters is its concrete implementation, and that is where Europe's self-criticism comes in."
"Differing positions have been adopted on Kaliningrad, Chechnya and the Yukos affair."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is why I cannot wait to hear about new agreements for new consistent policy."
"Yesterday, the press once again confronted me with confusing accounts from a prominent European statesman."
"A second point of important self-criticism is broached in Recital S and paragraph 2 of the proposal for a recommendation."
"The EU-Russia partnership is based on common values of respect for democratic principles and human rights."
"Parliament has expressly advised the Council and the Commission to apply this guiding principle consistently to all areas of cooperation with the Kremlin."
"In any event, the situation in Chechnya is completely at odds with the principle of the EU-Russia partnership. This is a wholly depressing situation of rampant violence and lawlessness at the expense of, in the main, a defenceless civilian population."
"At the same time, the Chechen tragedy is a problem that is avoided in international politics, as the title of a thorough recent study aptly suggests."
"In paragraph 13, this House recommends the Council in all seriousness to emphatically refute this shameful analysis."
"In the final analysis, the internal and external effects of the Chechen impasse affect the European Union's values and interests just as much."
"To start with, the Council should lodge a vigorous protest with President Putin against the disappearances, tortures or, worse, the killings of Chechen citizens who had the courage to lodge complaints with the European Court for Human Rights."
"Talking of disappearances in the Chechen region, I would refer to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the fate of my compatriot Arjan Erkel."
"I fully subscribe to the amendment tabled as No 25, which I will quote: ‘reiterates its deep concern once again about the fact that to date, no political solution has been found in the case of Arjan Erkel and regrets the fact that no progress whatsoever has been made in the direction of a solution, insists therefore on a determined political move on the part of the federal and local authorities in Russia, the Commission and the Council to ensure that Mr Erkel is released safe and well’."
"Much more so than Chechnya, there is another obstacle to the EU-Russia partnership that is receiving political and public attention: the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreements to include all new EU Member States from 1 May 2004."
"Parliament is supporting the Council unconditionally in its position, according to which it will not enter into any negotiations with the Russians in this respect."
"Could the Council perhaps tell us whether a provisional solution to this difference is in the offing?"
"Good neighbourly relations and, above all, good partnership, should be accompanied by Russian foreign policy that reinforces stability on the continent."
"If anything, though, the failure to sign or ratify the border agreements between Russia and its Baltic neighbours, Estonia and Latvia, has a destabilising effect, as do, and to an even greater degree, Russia's unfulfilled obligations to withdraw its troops from Transnistria and Georgia at long last."
"The present proposal for a recommendation urges the Council to stand firm on these sensitive security issues."
"I could mention many other areas of concern with regard to the development of the EU-Russia partnership, as is evident from a careful scrutiny of the proposal for a recommendation, but I would add that it was certainly not our intention to draft a catalogue of complaints."
"The intention is quite simply to define the mutual frictions, to facilitate and maintain debate on them and join together in seeking a solution."
"It is logical in this connection that the European Union should set out its priorities unambiguously and repeatedly and should indicate its so-called red lines during negotiations."
"This practical approach is reflected in the Commission communication."
"This gives me, as rapporteur, real satisfaction."
"The relatively considerable attention received to date in the Russian media by the proposal for a recommendation gives ample reason to rejoice."
"It appears that our message is well received by the Russian Federation, to whom it is also addressed."
"I am indebted to you, the MEPs concerned, for this response."
"I found your thoughts and contributions indispensable."
"I would repeat this praise for the excellent assistance from the secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in the person of Mr Dag Sourander."
"Together with him and my personal assistant, Henk-Jan van Schothorst, we have, over the past few months, poured over these complicated EU-Russia relations with much dedication, because this House sets great store by a partnership that functions right across the board."
". Mr President, those Members of the House who read the or indeed the will recognise that EU-Russia cooperation is not always as straightforward as it could be."
"I have to say that I regret that deeply."
"Why?"
"Because a stable and constructive relationship with Russia is essential to the EU, and also because a stable and constructive relationship with the EU is essential to Russia."
"It is clearly in our interest to try to promote close ties with an open, stable and democratic Russia, acting, we hope, as a reliable partner which can uphold European values, continue reforms, implement commitments and, in cooperation with the EU, play a constructive role in the newly independent states."
"The communication which the Commission adopted on 9 February, a communication which heavily influenced the report discussed by foreign ministers on Monday of this week, took as its starting point the interdependence of the EU and Russia and our wish to build a genuine strategic partnership, based on shared values and driven by our evident common interests."
"There are positive elements to the relationship, but, overall, we have to accept that the results of five years of increasingly intensive cooperation are not as positive as we expected. We have to do something about that."
"There were three important outcomes from the review of EU-Russia relations discussed on Monday."
"First, a strong, clear and public message was passed to Russia that we expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to be extended to the ten acceding Member States without pre-condition or distinction by 1 May."
"The Commission has held intensive discussions with Russia."
"We hope that we have been able to convince our interlocutors that the question of extending the PCA must be rapidly settled."
"The EU, for its part, is ready, in parallel to the extension of the PCA, to discuss any of Russia's legitimate concerns over the impact of enlargement."
"I hope that our attempt to resolve this issue as rapidly as possible will not be affected by the formation of the new government of the Russian Federation, with which we will look forward to working in due course."
"Second, the Ministers confirmed the importance of the EU's relations with Russia."
"It was agreed that the EU should engage with Russia, that we should be ready to discuss all complex issues of mutual interest, and that as part of this approach, the EU should stress that its partnership with Russia is not only driven by common interests but also founded on shared values."
"This implies discussing frankly Russian practices that run counter to European values, such as human rights in Chechnya, media freedom and cooperation on the environment."
"It also involves not hesitating to defend EU interests vigorously."
"Third, the ministers recognised the need for the EU to change the way in which it does business with Russia – to become more 'joined up', to use the bureaucratic terminology."
"It was agreed that the EU should establish clear, agreed objectives and positions ahead of every meeting with Russia."
"If we wish to build what can honestly be described as a strategic partnership, EU messages must be balanced and coherent, and our ambitious political declarations must be matched by progress on substance."
"This requires better coordination between policies defined at EU level, and the approach of individual Member States to relations with Russia."
"Why, for example, is it that the EU subscribes to joint statements with Russia, in which we agree to step up cooperation on crisis management, yet the EU is unable to convince Russia to work with it to resolve the very real problems in Moldova and the southern Caucasus?"
"Why, in addition, do we see individual Member States agree to facilitate visas for Russia, at the same time as Russia is blocking conclusion of a readmission agreement?"
"Many of these views are shared by the report which the honourable Member has presented so eloquently this morning; the report is a welcome contribution, in my judgement, to the debate on our relations with Russia."
"Our task now is to translate words into action and to establish a more coherent, strategic approach to Russia, reflecting the views of the enlarged Union."
"It is important that the EU can make real progress in its work with Russia."
"This matters to business people wishing to gain access to the promising Russian market – we should remember, after all, that after enlargement, more than 50% of Russia's trade will be with the EU."
"It also matters to importers of energy, given Russia's position as a major supplier of oil and gas."
"And not least, it matters because, if we are to tackle cross-border problems such as environmental pollution, illegal migration and organised crime, Russia will have to shoulder more of the burden than it has previously."
"Discussions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council reaffirmed the interest of the EU in promoting integration in the long term, through the creation of a series of common spaces within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"The Commission has advocated strongly that, once agreement is reached on PCA extension, the EU should be ready to present a draft joint action plan to Russia covering all these four spaces, consistent with our neighbourhood policy and incorporating relevant elements that are of common interest to both the EU and Russia."
"This would help to establish an issues-based agenda, focused on substance, and be a further step towards the strategic partnership that we genuinely want with the Russian Federation."
"I would like to thank the honourable Member once again for presenting such a thoughtful report and I am sure it will contribute to the outcome that we both wish to see."
"Mr President, a terrible war is going on in Europe."
"The Second Chechen War is now into its fifth year."
"It will soon have been going on for as long as the Second World War did."
"Every day that the war continues, the leaders of the Russian State demonstrate their inability and unwillingness to bring the civil war to a peaceful end."
"The war has become self-perpetuating."
"European leaders and the EU must be more active in pursuing peace in Chechnya, and we must demand that the Russian army comply with the rules of war in their dealings with the civilian population."
"There must be an end to so-called mopping-up operations, which amount to nothing other than robbery and kidnappings, and Russian soldiers who do violence to the civilian population must be brought before the courts."
"With the collapse of totalitarian Soviet Communism, there were high hopes and expectations of the way in which Russia would develop and draw closer to the rest of Europe."
"Now that we see how developments have taken another direction in certain parts of the country, we must make demands and not just express expectations."
"State-controlled media and a so-called controlled democracy have no place in a modern, democratic constitutional state."
"President Putin announced the departure of the Russian Government a few days ago."
"He quoted as a reason for forming a new government the fact that it would work more intensively on developing democracy in the country."
"That sounds all well and good."
"We must hope that it will also become a reality."
"It is unacceptable to the EU that, prior to enlargement, Russia has not approved agreements drawn up with Estonia and Latvia on the delineation of borders."
"It is also unacceptable for Russia to oppose an extension to the partnership agreements."
"Russia has huge environmental problems. This is in large part a legacy of the Communist era when the environment had very low priority."
"The greatest risk of an environmental disaster that might also hit the EU area is presented by the outmoded and oldest nuclear power stations of what is termed the Chernobyl type."
"They exist in Sosnovy Bor, not far from Estonia’s border with Russia, and in Kursk, near Moscow."
"We must clearly emphasise to the Russians that the continued operation of these first-generation RBMK reactors is unacceptable."
"They should be phased out as quickly as possible, and other nuclear power stations in Russia must be upgraded from a safety point of view in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) safety standards."
"EU cooperation with Russia on upgrading the safety of nuclear power must become more effective."
"This report is no doubt of its time and has come in for a lot of attention."
"I wish, in conclusion, to thank Mr Belder for his constructive cooperation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia has to accept the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"The European Commission has decided to threaten Russia with a trade boycott if it does not agree to extending this agreement to the future Member States."
"There will not be much cooperation left if we end up squabbling over the partnership in this manner!"
"Our policy on Russia has failed badly."
"Nothing concrete has been achieved for several years, apart from the Kaliningrad question."
"The eastward expansion of the EU and NATO will reduce Russia’s sphere of influence and its trade by hundreds of millions of dollars."
"Given this situation, Moscow has mentioned 14 areas of concern, such as transition periods for customs tariffs."
"We, the old Member States, are now imposing transition periods with regard to the workforce in the new Member States."
"The Union has not agreed to one of these."
"To reciprocate, Russia will not sanction the Kyoto Agreement and is putting pressure on relations with the minority in the Baltic region."
"A trade boycott would cause great harm to certain Member States as a result of an increase in the costs of raw materials."
"Other countries would suffer less, some not at all, but my country, for example, would, as the share of trade with Russia is enormous there and we also have some experience in a history of dealing with difficult relations."
"Now Russia is actually up against the wall as a result of this trade policy threat, while at the same time there are two kinds of expansion taking place."
"We are pushing our way into Russia’s trading zones."
"The country has just voted in a more nationalistic parliament than ever and the current presidential election campaign smacks of the same."
"The EU ministerial troika now has to take the initiative and make a suitable proposal to resolve this issue prior to the summit, because this is an area of cooperation where we have to find new approaches."
"We cannot force democracy on Russia: it will come about through wider channels of cooperation."
"The best and most effective approach of all is to try to have an influence directly on President Putin, who has a key role in everything that happens, as was said just now."
"This again will require cooperation, not boycotts."
"I understand the criticism regarding Chechnya and Sasnovibor, for example, but they are part of the very cooperation that we must now build and eventually obtain results from, so that the benefits are discernible on both sides and in order to end all these peculiar threats, which are inappropriate with regard to the sort of cooperation we need in this day and age."
"– Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very satisfied with Mr Belder’s report on Russia."
"We are nevertheless prepared to accept some amendments."
"On the other hand, we hope there is support by the other groups for our own amendment, which concerns the position of national minorities in Russia."
"Recently we in the European Union have been pondering our relations with Russia."
"The conclusion we have jointly come to is that the formally adopted strategy has not worked satisfactorily."
"The main reason for this is that the Union has been incapable of showing any united front in its dealings with Russia, but instead some Member States, the bigger ones in particular, have been inclined to go their own way."
"This situation has to be rectified."
"There is, however, another key reason for our failings, something that has been given too little attention in our deliberations."
"In the Union there is insufficient knowledge or understanding of the political situation in Russia."
"Russia, at least up till now, has not complied with the diplomatic and political principles that we and other Western countries take for granted."
"This has been evident, for example, in the fact that Russia has been adamant about not agreeing to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States of the EU."
"Perhaps the threat of sanctions would not have the desired effect either, but might instead lead to a trade war in which the Member States of the EU might come off worse than Russia."
"I have not noticed any such threat being made as yet, however, although it has perhaps been discussed at times."
"Calm and patience are needed in relations with Russia."
"To be able to realise our own objectives effectively and keep a watch over our own interests, we always have to consider the special political circumstances that obtain in Russia, hard and wearisome though that sometimes is."
"– Mr President, my group strongly endorses the critical positions set out in the Belder report."
"There is an unacceptable situation in Chechnya, where the Russian army is engaged in gross violations of human rights."
"There are disturbing internal political changes within Russia, with what is termed ‘managed democracy’ increasingly taking on authoritarian characteristics, and we also take a highly critical line on Russia’s dealings with the new Member States of the European Union."
"The European Union formerly adopted a two-track strategy in its dealings with Russia; underlying it was the fact that Russia is – and must be – one of our most important strategic partners."
"A two-track strategy does not of course mean that we refrain from criticism – on the contrary; it is when strategic relationships are being developed that there has to be a central role for engagement with our canon of values, for the upholding of democracy, of the standards associated with the rule of law, and of human rights."
"At the same time, though, it was also our concern to achieve the sustainable mutual interconnection of Russia and the European Union, and not only by means of the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"I think this would not be the moment to put question marks against this strategy; in so doing, we would be letting go of the opportunities we have for really getting to grips with internal political developments or with the situation in Chechnya."
"Moreover, I believe, we ought to be far more serious about concerning ourselves with social conditions in Russia."
"The life expectancy of men in Russia has decreased by ten years over the past twelve years – a tragic development, and one that characterises the situation in many parts of that country."
"Although I endorse Mr Belder’s criticisms of Russian policy, I would have liked the report to have made more explicit what he said in his speech just now, with his trenchant criticism of the Council’s actions and of the European governments whose dealings with Russia are based on economic rather than strategic considerations."
"Ever since 11 September, many governments – and not only Mr Berlusconi’s, but also the German Federal Government – have been allowing the war in Chechnya to be trivialised as part of the war on terrorism, and so we keep quiet about it."
"I do not think it is enough to think of Russia as a strategic partner only in the economic sense or in terms of securing our borders and preventing trafficking in human beings."
"Our relations with Russia have to be characterised by mutuality and interpenetration."
"– Mr President, I will continue what is very much a Finnish debate, although I am largely of the same opinion as Mr Brie, who has just spoken, although he is not my fellow countryman."
"The fact that relations between the EU and Russia are now more unpredictable than for a time is the fault of both sides."
"It would be worrying if Russia were to become our own Middle East, and, because of European dependence on energy, we were prepared to allow human rights violations such as those played out in the tragedy that is Chechnya to continue from one year to the next, and accept the increased risks attached to the transportation of oil, the collapse of nuclear safety, and the alarming restrictions on civil liberties."
"The crucial issue here is freedom of speech, and one only has to go by Russia’s track record on other political rights to reach a reliable conclusion on that."
"An independent media and judiciary are vital to allow a robust civil society to develop in Russia, which has never yet been a true nation-state."
"The EU does not seem to have any coherent or consistent policy with regard to Russia; neither are issues given any sort of priority."
"That is also shown by the way the Union’s Northern Dimension has been neglected, although it embraces regional cooperation, especially in Baltic and Arctic areas, which is vitally important for the stability of the EU’s neighbouring regions and the common stability that results from that, and although its importance will only increase as the Union is now expanding to include the Baltic countries."
"The Northern Dimension is certainly different from Kaliningrad, which is symbolised, for example, by the Sami people who live in the Arctic region that stretches from Norway to Russia and who at the same time are the EU’s only indigenous people."
"Ending on a positive note, let it be said that our land border with Russia has been remarkably peaceful and free of problems, and the EU does not really deserve the credit for that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to emphasise what Mr Brie has already said to us."
"We are discussing a recommendation to the Council in the Council’s absence, which is itself not a good sign of the Council’s potential interest in such an important question."
"However, I think we are having a rich debate, certainly richer than what the press is reporting today, noting the remarks made by Mr Chirac, who seems to think Europe lacks respect for Russia."
"But which Russia?"
"The Russia of the new parliamentary elections?"
"Elections where, as some of our fellow Members have pointed out, we have seen a virtual monopoly – even more so than in Serbia – of ‘nationalist parties’, as we say when we want to be tactful, although we know that, generally speaking, they are literally fascist parties."
"But we cannot say that because we are talking about Russia."
"I fully agree with what a number of other Members have said: Mr Arvidsson, Mr Brie, Mr Wuori and others, who listed a number of small things that are not going right, I do not think there is much that is going right."
"The elections to the Russian Duma have shown that."
"So far as the presidential elections are concerned, we cannot speak of an election campaign because no such campaign has taken place."
"We all witnessed the scandal of the Rybkin affair, a candidate who was kidnapped, abducted to a foreign country, drugged and sent back."
"There was the scandal surrounding the candidature of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is undeniably one of Russia’s greatest entrepreneurs."
"We would not have tolerated one tenth of one quarter of what was done to him."
"I think the Strasbourg Court will be bound to agree, but sadly it will be three years before then, by which time the fate of Mr Khodorkovsky’s business and of Mr Khodorkovsky himself will have been sealed."
"I have a question for Mr Patten."
"Mr Patten, at what point must we speak of a human rights violation?"
"When 20% of a population of a million people have been wiped out, is that a human rights violation, genocide or a disaster of biblical proportions?"
"I think we speak of human rights violations when we find a number of serious breaches of laws that are known and generally respected."
"But when, as we have seen in Chechnya, we find that 200 000 people have been killed in nine years, with tens of thousands of cases of torture and rape, that is no longer a human rights violation, it is genocide."
"I think a lot of honourable Members, myself included, are somewhat reluctant to use the word genocide."
"We all know why."
"What happened in Europe 60 years was genocide."
"What happened in Rwanda was genocide."
"And what is happening today in Chechnya is genocide, and, Commissioner Patten, has nothing to do with human rights violations."
"I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, and many other fellow Members who, I think, in the end were forced to admit that what is happening in Chechnya and in Russia is no longer about human rights violations and a lack of democracy."
"It is something far worse."
"– Mr President, Russia is a major and important partner for us, one with whom we are joined – or one could say, from whom we are separated – by two things: shared interests and common values."
"As regards the values, today finds us criticising the way in which democracy and the rule of law are developing, as well as the situation in Chechnya, but, in so doing, we must not lose sight of our many shared interests."
"Now that the European Union is enlarging, it is vital that the borders between the European Union and Russia should not become new barricades; instead, we should also use them as bridges and as a means whereby the partnership and cooperation agreement may be extended."
"Our provision of aid is important, for it also helps to promote liberalisation within Russia."
"It is important that Russia should be able to join the WTO – in the same way as everyone else rather than subject to special conditions – and, if the normal conditions apply, then we should also support it in doing so."
"We have shared interests in energy, security and the combating of terrorism."
"This, I think, is something we should make clear, and we should not allow the situation in Belarus to result in energy not being supplied to the European Union as contractually agreed."
"In many areas, the enlargement of the EU does not create a new situation, and we should not confuse the issues."
"The continuation of the partnership and cooperation agreement after the European Union is enlarged must not mean that we accept claims for compensation arising out of trade issues, for then the whole world could do likewise, and I do not believe that a precedent of this kind would be acceptable; the question also arises of whether the figures Russia has produced are correct."
"We also have to make it clear, though, that the Baltic States’ negotiation of accession to the European Union has helped to put minorities there in a position not shared by minorities in many other parts of the world and perhaps not in certain parts of Russia."
"The issue of the minorities cannot be an excuse for delaying the signature of the border treaties or, in any case, for delaying their ratification."
"This has to be done now, and for that clarity is needed."
"Both by means of technology and through cooperation, we should help Russia to establish exemption from visa requirements, but this must be done in such a way that the Schengen standards for the acceding countries can be maintained, in order to maintain internal security."
"In doing this, we should work for good relations with Russia, and recognise that it can be a factor for stability only if we accept that it, too, possesses territorial stability."
"This is something else we have to take on board."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the draft recommendation presented by our rapporteur after the draft was amended and supplemented by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is a document that I endorse and have no difficulty in voting for."
"I will not reiterate here all of the many points raised in the text."
"Mr Belder’s work was extremely thorough, in line with the Commission communications and Parliament’s previous resolutions on Russia."
"I will therefore limit myself to addressing two aspects contained in the report."
"The first is the lack of consistency between the governments of the Member States on this matter – a lack of consistency and a lack of coordination."
"When dealing with such a large and difficult partner as the Russian Federation, it is intolerable to hear EU ministers, even prime ministers or Council presidents, expressing differing opinions, for example on the painful war in Chechnya or on President Putin himself or on the elections."
"Such differing opinions, sometimes expressed only a few hours apart, weaken the Union and damage the credibility of its efforts to have a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name."
"The second aspect I wanted to mention is also a lack of consistency, but this time between the Union’s different actions with regard to Russia."
"Our partnership and our strategy have many facets, which are reviewed in the report, but it all needs to be put in perspective with priorities and much more consistency."
"It is true that the EU and Russia have set themselves the long-term aim of creating a common economic space, a common space of freedom, security and justice, a common space of cooperation in the field of external security and a space of research and education, including cultural aspects."
"That is all very well, but once again it needs to be done consistently, which will require a great deal of determination, organisation and know-how: in other words, we still have a long way to go."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the evermore authoritarian developments in Russia, linked to the person of President Putin."
"The sudden dissolution of the government is further illustration of this."
"Democracy appears to be in retreat, instead of the reverse being the case, and the presidential election resembles more and more a farcical one-man show."
"The terrible acts of cruelty in Chechnya must cease, and the EU must act in such a way as to help bring about a solution as soon as possible."
"There are huge needs in the environmental area, and we regret the fact that Russia is unwilling to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"The EU needs to have a strategic partnership with Russia."
"We wish, are able and ought to play our part, but such a partnership is not unconditional and cannot be dictated by Moscow."
"In this area, the ball now lies largely in Putin’s court."
"I also wish to thank Mr Belder for a very constructive report, which we can without difficulty vote in favour of."
"Mr President, quite a few people, including Mr Patten, have said that EU-Russia relations have not always been ideal, and right now can probably be characterised as being quite strained."
"As several people have said, there are good reasons for this."
"Last Monday, we were able to ‘commemorate’ the 60th anniversary of Stalin’s deportation of the Chechens and, thus, also the 60th anniversary of a genocide that has never been properly acknowledged."
"We have also, in the last few days, been able to see how journalists of a critical disposition have been denied visas for Russia."
"These are journalists who wish to cover the election and who are not therefore being given an opportunity to offer a critical analysis of what is happening."
"We see other things."
"Mrs Malmström mentioned how, with a snap of his fingers, Putin dissolved the Russian Government."
"All these things mean that the situation is extremely worrying."
"There are good reasons for being very critical of what is happening in Russia."
"I sincerely support Mr Belder’s report but, conversely, I have, in recent days, been astonished that we can talk so clearly about Russia but so unclearly about China."
"I do not understand how, on the one hand, we can pursue a critical line – which I think is correct – on Russia and, on the other hand, consider lifting the arms embargo against China which, in my view, is more or less as difficult, troublesome and unreasonable as Russia in its behaviour."
"I believe that genocide has taken place, and is continuing to take place, in Tibet."
"I believe that the oppression of the Chinese people is without parallel."
"I believe that we are here seeing problems similar to, and in reality still greater than, those in Russia."
"Nonetheless, we are considering lifting the arms embargo."
"In one way or another, the EU must ensure that its foreign policy is adjusted in such a way that the policy lines adopted are commensurate with the behaviour of the countries with which we work."
"I do not, moreover, think that this is the situation at present."
"Mr President, I do not want to address the entire issue of relations between the Union and the Russian Federation, and so I will confine myself to the Chechen issue, by recalling that human rights, in the sense of the rights of individuals, have been discussed more than once in this Chamber."
"This is entirely reasonable, but it seems that we have now forgotten another fundamental right, and that is every people’s right to self-determination."
"Whilst this is still considered blasphemy, or something that should never be uttered, it will not be possible to resolve issues such as those of Chechnya or Tibet that we have just raised."
"Mr President, Russia is a vast country and its contribution -historically speaking – to European culture is immense."
"It remains a major military power and deserves recognition on the global centre stage."
"Although economically it has shrunk, it is a vital source of gas and oil to the EU and has a common enemy in international Islamist terrorism."
"I believe that Mr Putin will win the presidential election, and that we must recognise his democratic mandate to rebuild a strong Russian state."
"I do not accept calls to expel Russia from G8 because of its handling of the Yukos affair."
"Only two weeks ago the Russian courts handed down a lenient sentence to one of its executives convicted of tax evasion: hardly the signs of judicial bias."
"I sympathise at the loss Russia faces with the ending of the bilateral free trade agreements with the acceding EU states, but overall, the tariffs drop from 9% to 4% and Russia cannot fail to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements to the Baltic Republics because of disputes over ethnic Russian minority rights there."
"The Kaliningrad question is settled now and work on visa-free or flexible travel to the EU should commence once a readmission agreement is struck."
"Russia sees the EU as muscling in on its sphere of influence from Georgia to Ukraine, hence its attempts to reconstitute some of the binding elements of the former Soviet Union in the Yalta agreement with Ukraine, Belarus – a country where Russia could use its special influence to do more to encourage democracy – and Kazakhstan."
"I also urge Russia to withdraw its troops from Transnistria, allow a peaceful reunification of Moldova and consign the Tiraspol gangster regime to the dustbins of history."
"Lastly, I am concerned that there has been mass migration west of ethnic Russians away from the far eastern territories, where Russia is attempting now to forge close links with Japan and Korea on resource exploitation."
"These ethnic Russians are being replaced by illegal Chinese migrants, a situation which may cause tensions in the future in that vast, under-populated but resource-rich territory."
"– Mr President, it is a positive move that the General Affairs Council signalled collectively that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia should automatically extend to cover the new Member States."
"There is no reason to have separate negotiations on that."
"If there are problems in economic and trade relations between the enlarged Union and Russia they can then be discussed separately between the Union and Russia."
"Russia is the EU’s most important neighbour."
"It is in the interests of both the Union and Russia that relations between them develop favourably in all areas of life."
"Furthermore, we must be able to discuss sensitive issues such as human rights."
"We must ensure that the Union is consistent in its policy on Russia and that in Russia they understand that the EU cannot be split politically."
"From the beginning of May, the Baltic countries that join the EU will form just as solid a part of the Union as the old Member States."
"Their condition for membership was fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria regarding such matters as human rights and the rights of minorities."
"These conditions have been met."
"Moreover, Russia is committed to compliance with human rights as a member of the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe and the Council of Europe."
"It is very important that there are assurances that the work of the OCSE in Chechnya can proceed."
"Strategic cooperation based on common values has been spoken of with regard to relations between the EU and Russia."
"Perhaps such grand-sounding aims should move a step closer to something a bit more concrete."
"There are good grounds for that, too, as the EU will account for 55% of Russia’s foreign trade."
"The EU needs oil and natural gas so there is a need for cooperation on energy to be developed."
"The environment must play a part in that, whether it is a matter of energy production or its transportation."
"One of the areas of cooperation mentioned at the St Petersburg Summit was research, education and culture."
"I am a firm supporter of more exchange programmes for researchers, teachers and students and cooperation between educational institutions."
"If we are to build sustainable cooperation our citizens will need to network with one another."
"Here too we will have to provide young people with the right facilities and opportunities."
"They cannot bear the burden of a divided world."
"Mr President, there is a subject that raises concern when we talk about Russia."
"It is the subject of freedom of the press, and I am pleased that Commissioner Patten mentioned this."
"We know that, according to Russian law, there is freedom of the press in Russia, but there is a big gap between the law and everyday practice."
"The organisation Journalists Without Frontiers has published a list in connection with press freedom on which, out of 158 countries, Russia is in 148th place. Moreover, the situation is getting worse."
"Journalists are being murdered in Russia."
"According to the International Federation of Journalists, four journalists were killed in Russia last year alone and, since 1 January 2002, thirteen have been killed."
"Obstacles are placed in the way of journalists’ work."
"I saw this for myself in St Petersburg in the run-up to the election for Governor when, for example, it was forbidden to show pictures, or quote the names of, candidates in the election."
"Recently, a Danish journalist was denied entry to Russia."
"Her crime was to have written critically of Russian conduct in Chechnya."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to take press freedom seriously when the negotiations with Russia are begun."
"The attacks on freedom of expression that take place in Russia are unacceptable!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Austria currently enjoys perfectly trouble-free relations with Russia, as demonstrated by the most recent state visits and President Putin’s fondness for skiing in our country."
"It is for that reason that I find this picture of the European Union’s relations with Russia all the more regrettable."
"The EU’s relations with Russia are not a one-way street."
"They need to be optimised if the interests of the enlarged EU are to be given the same weight as Russia’s."
"It is also an indispensable requirement – let me repeat, an indispensable requirement – that the partnership and cooperation agreement, which has been in force since 1998, should now be extended to cover the European Union’s ten new Member States."
"What formerly stood in the way of this was the objection that the enlargement of the EU would put Russia at a disadvantage on the market, so that it demanded that compensation be paid."
"This line of argument really is questionable, as the enlargement of the European Union will automatically create, for Russia too, a market with a great deal of purchasing power, and that cannot fail to be good for its economy."
"Cooperation in decommissioning nuclear power stations that are ready for scrapping, or in the disposal of nuclear waste off the Kola peninsula and in the North Sea leaves something to be desired, to say the least, and it is far from clear why Russia has so far turned a deaf ear to the demands for safe tankers in the Baltic."
"What makes it astonishing that the alleged difficulties of the Russian minority in the Baltic states keep being brought up is the fact that both the OSCE and the Council of Europe believe that the problem is no longer there."
"By way of contrast, the OSCE was barred from entering Chechnya."
"The fact that most of the asylum seekers and refugees in Austria are Chechens can only be taken as an indication of how appalling the situation there is, although I do not want in any way to downplay the crimes committed by terrorists against the public in Russia."
"And, even though the EU has been very accommodating with regard to Kaliningrad, there has not to date been any agreement to take back refugees or illegal migrants."
"With presidential elections now in the offing, I deliberately do not now want to discuss Russia’s internal politics – reference has already been made to ‘managed democracy’ – even though they must inevitably have an effect on relations between Russia and the EU."
"Even so, it does not make sense to keep quiet about problems when dealing with them cannot fail to help promote good relations between Russia and the EU."
"Mr President, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, for a very well written and politically well balanced report."
"The controlled democracy that characterises Russia is a source of great concern."
"We are all aware that democracy has not secured a foothold in Russia and that a climate of fear has been created in which people who express independent political views in relation to President Putin are exposed to threats."
"People with considerable financial power have, in particular, ended up in difficulties with the judicial system."
"I wish to emphasise that the administrative resources and control of the media were such that the parliamentary elections for the Duma on 17 December 2003 can scarcely be said to have complied with international standards."
"An independent judiciary is required if it is to be possible to refer to Russia as a fully-fledged democracy."
"At present, the prosecuting authorities have no independence from the executive."
"Russia must act internationally to close down its current military bases in Georgia and Moldova without delay."
"Russia must act constructively in the conflict in the South Caucasus, and I wish to issue a special appeal to the Russian Government to solve the protracted conflict between Turkey and Armenia and to promote reconciliation between the peoples of these countries."
"Turkey should also recognise the genocide to which the Armenian people was exposed between 1915 and 1918."
"Russia has a special responsibility for developments in Belarus, a new neighbour of the enlarged EU, which can scarcely be described as a democracy but, rather, as a country under the authoritarian control of President Alexander Lukashenko."
"Last of all, I want Russia to promote freedom of religion in a much more open and tolerant way."
"– Mr President, in the aftermath of the profound changes in Europe, relations with Russia have become very complex."
"Dialogue and cooperation have been enshrined in a plethora of treaties and agreements in many international institutions, and partnership and cooperation agreements make meetings between the EU and Russia at the highest level a regular, and indeed fixed, occurrence."
"I increasingly get the impression, though, that this comprehensive dialogue is becoming a fossilised and predictable ritual."
"I think it was Commissioner Patten who, a few months ago, told the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that he had the impression that the speaking notes prepared for him on Russia had not substantially changed for some considerable time."
"Politics is, of course, always the art of the possible, and that means that one will always have to take an approach to a large country like Russia that differs from the approach one would take if a small country were misbehaving itself."
"In terms of proportion, one can certainly compare atrocities against civilians in Kosovo and in Chechnya, but it is obvious that our response to Russia will be different – as it indeed is."
"I would, however, ask the Council, as a matter of urgency, to address the issues that have not been satisfactorily resolved and are still on the agenda rather than dodging them – which is what it is doing, in a sense, by the mere fact of being absent from this debate."
"There can be no compromise where partnership and cooperation agreements are concerned, nor in relation to their adoption by, and extension to, all the new accession countries;"
"Russia can, for example, take a good look at how customs tariffs change from what they were before, at a time when we had bilateral agreements with some of the candidate countries."
"Once they are in the EU, customs tariffs will fall."
"It follows that these countries’ accession to the European Union does not have only detrimental effects."
"Many references have been made to Chechnya."
"There too, I believe, we should not merely allow ourselves the luxury of making appeals or of ignoring it outright."
"I have always taken the view that we have to find different ways of targeting the funds that we appropriate for cooperation with Russia."
"We must try to prop up the weak structures of civil society in Russia, in order that this society may undergo democratic change from the bottom up and not in the lamentable way we have seen in recent months."
"Mr President, Mr Belder’s report makes a number of comments and proposals in line with the recommendations from the Council concerning relations between the Union and Russia."
"I support the two main lines pursued in the report."
"First, the reaffirmation of the desire to develop the vital partnership between the European Union and Russia."
"Russia is a big country and it is essential to develop economic relations with her in the areas of industry, research, health and energy."
"Common ambitions and objectives must be set, as the rapporteur proposes."
"They are of strategic and political importance."
"We must set priority objectives, such as cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, defence of human rights, democracy, independence of news media and the rule of law, cooperation to resolve conflicts in the region and disarmament; we must also promote improvements to public health and social development."
"The second line pursued in the report seeks to be more critical, especially concerning basic freedoms and democratic rights in Russia."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he deplores the weakness of the Union’s role in the Chechen conflict, which has caused more than 200 000 deaths in ten years and is really genocide."
"The report calls on the Russian authorities to investigate the disappearances, torture and all violations of human rights."
"In November 2003, several of us intervened following President Berlusconi’s statements justifying the Russian military’s intervention policy."
"Europe must indeed play a much greater role in strongly and clearly condemning Russia in its handling of the war in Chechnya."
"There will not and cannot be a military solution in Chechnya."
"The desire for a partnership between the European Union and Russia must follow a plan that includes peace and security for all peoples."
"Europe can no longer be content with mere rhetoric."
"It must act and, from that point of view, the report is a step in the right direction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"In addition to significant aid, we need an extremely ambitious European strategy and perhaps a broader mandate for Mr Heikki Talvitie, the European Union’s Special Representative for the South Caucasus. Commissioner Patten too has spoken about this, but I do not believe that the fight against corruption to reduce poverty and drug trafficking, or even the analysis of the elections can be enough to establish these measures as a strategy for the zone."
"The usual procedure sometimes calls for global objectives to be achieved with just one conference. I do, however, believe that, in the case of the South Caucasus, we need to proceed gradually, step by step, in the disputes and in cooperation; otherwise we risk obtaining a very poor result."
"The report by Mr Gahrton gives a very detailed description of both the situation and the needs, and I agree with the rapporteur that the South Caucasus region needs to be given a well-defined status in the context of the policy we call ‘Wider Europe’"
"If stability is to be achieved, then it is essential that Russia is involved. President Putin – having the day before yesterday dissolved a government that has always maintained considerable ambiguity towards the countries of the former Soviet Union, and in particular, towards the South Caucasus – will also have to indicate some direction for the Caucasus."
"The meeting between the European Union and Russia, which will take place next March, could be an opportunity for this to happen."
"The interests and values that are all necessary for cooperation must be clarified in both form and substance. Furthermore, we must consider the fact that the opening, in two years, of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline will be of enormous strategic importance."
"We do not know if the billionaire Mr Khodorkovsky, for example with his company , intends to conclude agreements with the US company and nor do we know to what extent the new President Putin would be in favour of such a development. Similarly, we do not know what the chain reaction would be in either case."
"During the cold war, the planning of the pipelines sought to avoid Soviet territory, but the situation is now changing. I do, however, believe that the report by Mr Gahrton expresses appropriate concerns about this and other unknown factors in the region."
"Thanks to oil resources, Azerbaijan will be rich and Georgia will have transit rights whilst Armenia will have nothing."
"This is how the new sources of wealth can create new imbalances, which can be smoothed out only though political mediation."
"One simply has to realise that the future situation will not allow a stalemate, or status quo, to continue for long in areas where conflicts rage."
"Mr President, I would advise Mrs Banotti to follow the advice once given to me by the Station Master at Crianlarich, when I pointed out to him that the two clocks, one on each platform, showed different times."
"He replied, 'What good would it be having two clocks if they both told the same time?'"
"We now continue with the vote."
"Mr President, in the English version the word ‘regrets’, the correct translation of which should have been ‘ has been translated by I would like the services to note in the Minutes that the Italian translation of the phrase, as we believe it be in the report, was ‘and not"
"The services will ensure that all language versions correspond."
"Mr President, the fact is that Russia has not signed the agreement made on the delineation of the border with Estonia and Latvia, and the agreement cannot thus be ratified."
"I therefore propose that paragraph 6 be worded as follows:"
"'Recommends the Council to demand that Russia immediately sign and ratify the already negotiated border agreements with the accession states Estonia and Latvia.'"
". – Mr President, an irritating error has crept into Amendment No 26 under the second indent. In the original text, the following was written ‘sociological characteristics of Chechen society’."
"Mr President, if the Duma is to be able to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the matter must be put before the Duma, and that has to be done by the Russian President."
"I therefore propose that recital F should be worded as follows:"
"'Whereas the delay in transmitting the Kyoto protocol for ratification to the Duma is preventing this treaty from entering into force.'"
"That concludes the vote."
"- Report: Daul (A5-0082/2004)"
". I support this report and agree entirely with its condemnation of the limitations on liability for nuclear accidents which create a privileged position for nuclear energy as against other energy sources."
"Ireland is not a party to the Paris Convention to which this report relates."
"However everyone in Ireland is acutely aware of their vulnerability should there ever be a major incident at the nearby Sellafield plant, or should there ever be an incident involving the shipments of dangerous waste materials which are brought to that plant through Irish territorial waters. In fact the single greatest threat to the Irish environment comes from Sellafield so it is absolutely outrageous that the European Union has so far failed to apply the 'polluter pays' principle to nuclear accidents."
"It is high time the European Union adopted a more comprehensive stance in relation to the dangers of the nuclear industry. We certainly cannot afford to have any gaps in the application of international conventions and Community legislation to the area of liability for nuclear damage."
"This readmission agreement between the European Community and the Macao Special Administrative Region forms a part of the more wide-ranging strategy for fighting illegal immigration defined at the Tampere, Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki Summits, and is the second such agreement negotiated and concluded with a third country. The signing of these agreements at EU level forms a specific part of the objectives of the overall plan for fighting illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings identified as a priority since the Laeken Summit."
"With specific reference to the readmission agreement with Macao signed in Brussels on 18 October 2002, that agreement forms part of the political agreement reached in December 2000 when Justice and Home Affairs Ministers decided to exempt Macao passport holders from the visa requirement. Alongside those agreements, standard readmission clauses were adopted for inclusion in association agreements or cooperation agreements concluded by the EU."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"The purpose of this proposal is to update the implementing regulation for the EU’s own resources following the Council Decision of 29 February 2000, which increased the contribution of the ‘GNP resource’ to the financing of the Community budget and codified the so-called ‘British cheque’ with adjustments in its financing for the main net contributors – Germany, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands – with a consequent increase in the contributions from the remaining Member States, including Portugal, which is unacceptable."
"We always advocate that imbalances in terms of net transfers cannot be resolved on the income side of the equation and that the principle of ‘’ should not be regarded as sacrosanct. National contributions to Community financing should, at the very least, be equivalent to the share of each country in the Community GNP, or else there should be a harmonisation of effort per inhabitant in the Member States for this financing."
"The central issue in the report is the inclusion of a revision clause for a general review of the system, with a view to introducing European taxes to replace the present system of national contributions, before the approval of the Financial Perspectives. Indeed, this idea is supported in the Commission proposal."
"."
"I record my support for this motion calling on the Irish presidency and EU to clarify and strengthen their position on the non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."
"Recent revelations about the murky black-market trade in nuclear know-how and weaponry emphasise the urgency of achieving the aims of the IAEA and UNMOVIC."
"The Irish presidency should prioritise this call to encourage third states to accede to the IAEA protocols and liase with Member States to clarify how adequate financial resources can be released to support specific IAEA projects. We must push our demand for nuclear disarmament and make it a permanent item on the agenda of the Transatlantic Partnership Dialogue."
"I welcome the support expressed for the international campaign for nuclear disarmament initiated by the Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Recent appalling experiences of the unjust and illegal acts perpetrated against the Iraqi people must at least teach us the urgency of achieving a peaceful world – where there can certainly be no place whatsoever for nuclear weapons."
". Nothing is more important than the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, because nothing is more apocalyptic than the threat of such weapons, nor more suicidal than their original design."
"We call for a consensus of parties and nations to rally behind the EU objective of eliminating all such weapons; in particular, we call on the European Council to strengthen the declaration stipulating that the Non-Proliferation Treaty be maintained in its entirety."
"Only by remaining constantly aware and vigilant will we be able to restore confidence in international security through salutary nuclear de-escalation. That will require sustained cooperation between the EU and its international partners to completely deny terrorist organisations access to weapons of mass destruction and other states access to nuclear weapons."
"All the EU’s partners, even – especially – the USA, must sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the CTBT, which could then enter into force."
"Constructive joint dialogue is required with the urban populations and their elected representatives who are potential targets for annihilation."
"Let us here pay heed to the call by the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a timetable for eliminating nuclear weapons, bearing in mind the Prepcom 2004 meetings and the NPT Review Conference in 2005. The rejection of the Greens’ amendment, urging nuclear disarmament on the part of France and Great Britain, is regrettable, but we will certainly persevere with this aim."
"Regarding the 2004 Spring Summit, the Commission has missed a good opportunity to give its opinion by stressing real priorities that have been neglected for too long, the urgency of which should have been the basis of this resolution."
"The decay of basic environmental features caused by decades of the West’s unsustainable obsession with productivity, ignoring a number of indicators, including environmental ones – is ever more obvious in terms of climate disruption, a fall in biodiversity and a marked increase in diseases linked to pollution."
"These phenomena are all the more alarming in that they now appear to be irreversible. They are so globalised that it is imperative that, from now on, they be at the centre of an exhaustive management of Community policies, radically overhauling the specific economic, financial or social dimensions that are now obsolete."
"The Spring Summit must set the seal on a change of era and recognise the need for energy restructuring where ‘renewable’, ‘sustainable’ and ‘economical’ are the key words."
"Changing tack from the traditional, overused and toxic approach would open up a new generation of jobs: public service jobs and jobs in the tertiary and social economy, free from the pressures of working hours set in stone, increased job insecurity in certain sectors and outdated discrimination."
"Symbolising the end of these obsolete patterns of thought and work, a reform of the eco-tax on the basis of an adjustment to tax practices makes a new common economic policy essential, breaking this collusion between economic growth and the use of resources."
"Four years ago the Fifteen promised in Lisbon to make the European economy the most dynamic and the most competitive in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth together with a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater cohesion."
"European jargon can be used to paint a glowing picture of a brighter future but it cannot hide the hard truth."
"The Lisbon strategy was nothing but a barrage of attacks on employees. The European Union has shown itself to be incapable of preventing stock market redundancies, social plans and the closure of undertakings."
"It is even more scandalous that public money was used to inflate shareholders’ dividends, for example at STMicroelectronics."
"The European Union has never found ways of combating rogue managers, such as those at ParmalatOn the contrary, the EU continues to protect tax havens and banking secrecy."
"Lisbon, though, is primarily about structural reforms of the labour market based on flexibility, precariousness and salary reduction. Finally, it is about the commercialisation of public services to the detriment of citizens."
"This is why the 2004 Spring European Summit must make a radical break with the Lisbon process. Since the joint resolution refused to do this, I voted against it."
"In 2003, the Commission was forced, for the third year in succession, to revise its economic forecasts downwards."
"The European economy is in poor shape, and three countries, including France and Germany which together account for half the eurozone’s GDP, had budget deficits in excess of the limit of three per cent of GDP defined in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The rapporteur emphasises the importance of not bringing the Stability and Growth Pact into question at a time when the European economy is only just ticking over. The report expresses support for complying to the letter with the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is absolutely crucial to people’s confidence in the regulations that the criteria should be clear, measurable and objective."
"I could not, however, support paragraph 19, which ‘requires an increase in budgetary allocations at European and national level’, that is to say further increased taxes."
"That is hardly the right medicine in a situation of economic stagnation."
"This explanation of vote is intended solely to highlight what we see as a reversal of priorities as regards the budget, something that this report might be said to illustrate very fully indeed. First and foremost, it is only possible to discern the limits of budgetary restrictions once we look at how they operate and can be improved, and, almost importantly, how to deal with both existing and new requirements."
"Mr President, the fact that we voted in favour of this report by Mr Belder does not imply any interference in Russia's internal power structure; the European Parliament must respect Russia's sovereignty."
"The European Union cannot choose its neighbours, but it can choose those countries with which it wishes to cooperate."
"This report should be a wake-up call for us, reminding us about the lack of progress made in cooperation with Russia, about the difficult situation that persists in Chechnya, where it is almost impossible to reconcile respect for human rights and the fight against terrorism, and about the fragility of certain key aspects of constructing democracy in that country."
"No, quite the opposite! What is at stake here is the need to find ways of making the partnership between the European Union and Russia more effective, not only politically speaking, but also in terms of economics, security and European and world stability."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"Colleagues, on your behalf I should like formally to thank President Mesic once again for his address to the House at a moment when we, together with the Commission, will enter a new period of reflection on our relations with the Republic of Croatia."
"I declare open the 2004-2005 annual session of the European Parliament."
"The next item is the report (A5-0449/2003) by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on official feed and food controls [COM(2003) 52 – C5-0032/2003 – 2003/0030(COD)]."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks for all the hard work that has been done by members of the committees concerned with the proposal for a regulation on official feed and food controls."
"I acknowledge in particular the admirable efforts made by Mrs Paulsen on this important initiative."
"The Commission's proposal establishes rules on the organisation of official controls on feed, food and live animals to be respected by the Member States and it defines the tasks of the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office."
"It takes into account the principles of a risk-based approach to a comprehensive and integrated food and feed chain from farm to fork, including controls within the Community as well as controls on feed and food imported from third countries."
"It streamlines the primary responsibility for food and feed safety at the level of the business operators and it strengthens the role of the competent authorities through stricter enforcement mechanisms within the existing control systems."
"Above all the proposal aims to improve the efficiency of controls undertaken by both the Member States and the Commission."
"It defines tougher enforcement measures."
"It also creates a framework to support developing countries in meeting important requirements and provides for a financial framework to organise activities that enhance food and feed safety."
"I underline in particular Mrs Paulsen's strenuous efforts to adopt the proposal at first reading."
"I share the very same aim and hope that it succeeds."
"Cooperation between the three institutions on this proposal has been excellent and again much of this is due to Mrs Paulsen, the driving force in bringing the three institutions together."
"The Council and the majority of the European Parliament are now taking a convergent view on this text, which I am glad to accept in its entirety."
"– Mr President, I would like to mention that I have only just received the amendments in my own language – and there are 229 of them."
"I would therefore like to ask for more time so that I, and everyone else, can work through them, and to ask you to postpone the vote until tomorrow."
"Mrs Klass, this is not the right time to make this request, not least because any request of this type will be put to the vote and submitted for decision in plenary."
"Such requests cannot be made at every stage in our work."
"You will, therefore, be able to put forward this request before the vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course hard to try to bring about an agreement at first reading."
"Will, knowledge and cooperation are required."
"I wish to thank all those of my fellow MEPs who have contributed their opposition to, and support for, this process."
"It has been hard, but it has been extremely constructive."
"I shall address some of the aspects that are most important to me about the proposal."
"One such aspect is its scope."
"I am exceptionally fortunate that the inspections now extend to include animal health and welfare."
"That probably constitutes Parliament’s greatest success in this hugely sensitive area about which the electorates in all our countries are extremely concerned."
"Another aspect is the transport of animals through Europe, and it is important that this is at least included in the control programme."
"Parliament has also contributed the control of labelling while the inspections are under way."
"The Member States’ own control programmes must state that the inspectors’ tasks include that of checking that the labelling on food packets is correct, that it complies with the rules and that the contents and declaration of contents do in actual fact correspond with each other."
"That is a crucially important point for us as normal consumers when, on an ordinary Thursday afternoon, we are to do a bit of quick shopping for the evening meal."
"The fact that the whole chain is to be included – right from the field to the shop, dining room and restaurant – is the principle that of course permeates the whole of the food safety legislation."
"Another aspect, about which I am both disappointed and pleased, is transparency."
"A clear majority of the committee demanded a name, shame and fame system."
"It was not possible to implement this because the Member States invoked legal and constitutional reasons why it should not be."
"As a Liberal, I perhaps eventually realised that it is probably not the state’s and the authorities’ task to say that the one producer is good and the other bad."
"With the system of transparency that now exists in this regulation, we have handed over this name, shame and fame function to civil society."
"A consumer group, animal protection group or local media organisation will be able to request the inspection reports and thus be responsible for this function, telling people how things appear behind the scenes."
"The funding of duties is a very controversial issue – not between the Commission, the Council and myself but within Parliament."
"Some people want to see a permanently fixed duty, which is set in stone and the same for everyone."
"That would perhaps be very good, but it has been tried and has failed."
"Not all countries within the EU are exactly alike."
"The same basic conditions do not apply from Portugal to Finland or from Ireland to Hungary."
"I do, however, think that the proposal now before us is nicely balanced."
"Duties are to be collected, but it is clearly defined which duties are to be included."
"Special account is also to be taken of small, traditional companies, something I think is very important."
"It is important for us in the European Parliament to protect the small producers of unusual products that are the essence of Europe’s cultural heritage in the area of food."
"We must defend them and give them a chance."
"They must not be exempted from the thinking about safety, but less harsh duties might in actual fact be imposed upon them in the context of this control."
"I would appeal to you all firstly to vote today despite all the problems that exist and, secondly, to fall in with my compromise vote list."
"Finally, I wish again to extend my many thanks to the Commission and the Council and, above all, to the Italian and Irish Presidencies."
"Thank you very much for your fantastic cooperation."
"Since you too, Mrs Paulson, referred to the hope that the vote will have a positive outcome, I would repeat that, as regards whether or not to decide on the vote – referring to the speech made before by Mrs Klass – there will, if necessary, be a vote in plenary to decide whether or not to accept the adjournment of this vote."
". Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Doyle, who is unable to be here this morning."
"We welcome the feed and food controls in order to ensure healthy animals and good meat for people throughout Europe."
"However, we must give the industry time to develop a uniform approach across Europe."
"I would like Commissioner Byrne to explain in more detail how we are going to enforce the same kind of controls on feed imported into the European Union."
"It is very important that the same stringent controls are applied not only to our feed in Europe but also to imported feed."
"Animal welfare is also extremely important."
"Mrs Paulsen mentioned labelling."
"We have to ensure that consumers can tell from the labelling which products have met those high animal welfare standards in Europe."
"Consumers should also be able to see from the labelling which products have not met those high standards."
"The cost of inspection within the EU and fees charged to each feed company have to be looked at, because if one country is charging significantly more for inspections than another, it causes distortions throughout the single market."
"In broad terms, we must welcome these controls, but we have to be careful that we do not over-regulate."
"Mr President, I am speaking this morning on behalf of my colleague Mr Schnellhardt, who unfortunately cannot be with us."
"The regulation on feed and food controls before us is one of the EU measures to improve food safety."
"There is a common thread running through all the arrangements in this area, and that thread is the principle of universal controls, from the farm to the shop counter to the table."
"The participation of stakeholders in the food sector in food safety has been extended, responsibility has been clearly defined, and official controls have been shaped on a more scientific basis and clearly structured."
"This regulation on feed and food controls represents a piece of framework legislation in this context."
"It has to be said, unfortunately, that the treatment given to this regulation in this House is not in line with the usual parliamentary procedures."
"The text to be voted on today was largely worked out in the European Council and is significantly different from the Commission proposal."
"It has not been possible to consider and discuss the text before us in depth."
"We in this House have been endeavouring for years to extend our powers in relation to the legislative process."
"The procedure adopted for this regulation runs very much counter to those attempts."
"Although we welcome the inclusion of animal welfare in this regulation, we are critical of the nature of the provisions relating to it."
"The regulation very much opens up the way to transferring certain official control activities to third parties."
"I believe, however, that official control activities, if their independence is to be ensured, should be engaged in by state institutions."
"The same applies to the proposed financing procedure."
"The proposal will of course provide a uniform basis for calculating the fees for inspections in Europe, but it does nothing to eliminate the distortion in competition resulting from enormous differences in the level of fees, something that has been criticised for years."
"Just the opposite, in fact: this approach makes it quite possible that companies in the same administrative district will have to pay different fees because of their different geographical distance from the administrative authorities."
"Yet official controls are intended to promote health and should therefore be charged at approximately the same level for all companies involved."
"The inadequate reference to national control plans and to the financing of ad hoc controls means that this procedural approach exposes companies to financial risk."
"Lastly, I would like to specifically emphasise that we support many of the ideas put forward here."
"However, the unconventional way of producing the legislative text that has been imposed upon us, with new drafts repeatedly being published at short intervals, and with the final version of the amendments only becoming available in our own languages this morning, has unfortunately made in-depth consideration of the text impossible."
"It cannot be ruled out that possible shortcomings and critical points will go unnoticed because of this haste."
"For this reason, our unreserved support cannot be taken for granted."
"Mr President, I am speaking today on behalf of Mrs Corbey, and should like to express five comments."
"First of all, transparency in food safety and the controlling of this are of course extremely important."
"More rules and greater control are not in themselves a guarantee of improved food safety: we can only put an end to tinkering with food if we also demand transparency."
"Information on businesses that have a rather casual attitude to food safety must be made public."
"Those who tinker lose customers."
"Transparency is an important condition for food safety, and we welcome the compromise reached."
"Secondly, the financing of the controls must be fair."
"We must combat unfair aid to businesses and unfair competition."
"Granting small businesses a discount enables us to accommodate this category of business, which is very important within the food sector, to some degree."
"My third comment concerns the proper, fair application of this legislation."
"Our group has been advocating equivalent controls and equivalent methods throughout the EU."
"It must not be the case that a cargo is rejected in Rotterdam on food safety grounds yet subsequently enters the EU via a different route."
"Our question to the Commission is as follows: can the Commission assure us that, in the interests of European citizens and of fair competition, it will monitor the proper implementation of this legislation closely?"
"Fourthly, our group warmly welcomes the assistance that the EU is planning to give to developing countries to help them build capacity in order that they can comply with European food safety rules."
"This kills two birds with one stone: the EU increases the safety of imported food products, and developing countries obtain important assistance in taking measures capable of improving their food safety situation and thus their trading position."
"Food safety must not be a cover for protectionism."
"We also have to keep current events in mind here."
"In view of the outbreak of avian influenza in Asia, it is important that food safety is controlled right from the countries of origin."
"Can the Commission confirm that this and other Community legislation offers the EU effective protection against carry-over of contagious diseases such as avian influenza?"
"Finally, it remains for me to make a comment of a general nature."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should again like to thank Mrs Paulsen, and also the Council and the Commission, for their constructive work."
"We hope that this milestone brings an important piece of work over the past five years to a conclusion, and we look forward to hearing the Commission’s answers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise that has been reached among four groups ensures that this Regulation on controls can soon be published in the Official Journal and can largely enter into force on 1 January 2006."
"It was a great pleasure for my group to take part in the discussions on the compromise, not least on account of the reference to criminal law in Amendment No 206."
"I now hear that the Council is very reluctant in this regard."
"I regret that the Council is not currently taking part in the debate or expressing an opinion on the compromise that we have reached among four groups."
"Consequently, I support the request by Mrs Klass, albeit for reasons other than language, to postpone the vote until tomorrow. This will give the Council another chance to deliberate and express its opinion on the reference to criminal law in Amendment No 206 to the plenary sitting."
"I should like to emphasise a number of elements of this Regulation that are important to our group."
"The first, of course, as the rapporteur herself has said, is the extension of the scope of the Regulation from feed to animal welfare and animal health."
"The second is the explicit statement of the need for controls to be carried out without prior warning."
"The third is the need for official checks on self-monitoring and labelling controls."
"The fourth is, very practically, the avoidance of conflicts of interest among controllers."
"In Belgium, we have learnt that those still exist."
"There are still self-employed veterinary surgeons, with their own practice, who are carrying out controls."
"The fifth is the imposition of quality conditions on laboratories."
"The sixth is the need for cooperation between national and regional authorities, as the MPA case has taught us."
"Finally, since international networks are very often active in this field, international cooperation between control and customs services, and also between authorities, is tremendously important, as is the introduction of liaison bodies."
"I believe that we are taking a major step forward in the form of this Regulation, and I hope that we can adopt the compromise of the four groups by a large majority."
"Mr. President, I would like to join with the other speakers in complementing the rapporteur for her work on this very important report."
"The food scares experienced in recent years must never again be allowed to reach proportions which threaten European consumers, farmers and the agrifood industry."
"I believe that great credit is due to the Commission, in particular Commissioner Byrne, for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each of the issues that needed to be tackled to guarantee our consumers a safe and traceable product, from farm to fork."
"This particular proposal addresses some clear weaknesses which have been highlighted in the control services."
"Tremendous effort has been made to facilitate a first reading conclusion of this dossier before the end of the legislative period."
"The Commission initially sought to introduce criminal sanctions, but faced with the Member States' unanimous opposition to this approach, the Commission wisely decided to settle for a statement on the matter."
"As regards the issue of scope and whether the proposed regulations should take in all aspects of animal health and welfare, or only those aspects impinging on food safety, I am glad that in the final analysis the Council accepted the wider scope that was urged by Parliament."
"The fees issue was also hotly contested."
"The latest text allows a situation whereby the collection of fees will continue to apply to those activities that are currently subject to fees – i.e. meat and fishery products inspection, veterinary residue testing, and controls on live animals."
"– Mr President, following the succession of food scares we have experienced, such as foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, action must be taken, but not at any cost."
"It seems to me that, pursuant to Article 175 of the Treaty, it would be illegal to impose penalties of the kind that the Commission is proposing."
"Further, together with my colleague Mr Blokland, I tabled an amendment for their deletion before the Irish Presidency lifts the penalties for intentional actions or serious negligence."
"I do not think it is acceptable for the cost of inspections to be harmonised by means of a European fee."
"Firstly, it is already difficult enough to implement such a measure, given the diverse modes and costs of production in the current 15 Member States."
"How could this function in an EU of 25 Members, given that this fee may not differ by more than 10% from the average within the Community?"
"Secondly, in legal terms, it is not for Parliament to decide on the introduction of a European tax. I would remind you that such a measure depends on a unanimous decision by the Council."
"In addition, it is necessary to remain firm on import controls."
"It would be difficult to justify imposing strict controls on European Union operators if those from third countries were able to avoid them."
"In addition, special provision must be made for primary producer installations. The continuity of family businesses producing much-appreciated traditional products that made their areas famous must not be threatened."
"To conclude, the Commission does not have the competence to assess the extent to which national measures conform to the regulation under discussion."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen for all the work she has done to come to this complex compromise."
"Whilst welcoming the animal welfare aspect of this proposal, I agree with Mrs Klaß that maybe we are rushing a little and we need time to look at every aspect of this rather complex deal."
"I am also worried that once again we may be coming up against the law of unintended consequences."
"You may recall that when the original slaughterhouse regulations came forward, the UK Government got hold of them and goldplated them."
"This resulted in very high costs for some small slaughterhouses which, faced with those costs, closed."
"That then resulted in animals having to travel very large distances to slaughterhouses."
"As regards charges, in the case of this particular proposal, whilst it is true that different charges being levied in different countries is a distortion of the free market, common charges would not reflect the differences in cost of inspections in, for example, Lithuania as opposed to Germany."
"We now seem to have a balance where the cost will reflect the actual cost of those inspections, but it is possible that there will be loopholes, particularly in the way that some countries define 'small operators'."
"Yes, I support exemptions for small operators, but I can see how some countries that want to subsidise production in certain remote areas would use that definition."
"Secondly, on the issue of 'naming and shaming', nobody could be against freedom of information – we are all in favour of transparency and openness – and not to be in favour of it would be to support secrecy."
"We need to be careful, for example, to look at the situation in the UK, where if you are prosecuted you appear in the paper, but if minor infringements are discovered, such as a cracked tile in a slaughterhouse or a piece of mouse dirt in a restaurant, this does not appear on the front page of the local newspaper."
"In conclusion, whilst I appreciate the good intentions, we need to look at this more carefully to make sure that we do not once again come up against the law of unintended consequences."
"Mr President, we are in the presence of the old hands today – that group of Members who have tried to deal with the questions of food safety and hygiene in cooperation with the Commissioner throughout this parliamentary term."
"I want to pay personal tribute to Mrs Paulsen, who has brought through a number of complex, difficult measures of this kind."
"Mr Goodwill said that these measures have unintended consequences."
"I would remind him of the principle of 'unright time', according to which people always say that the time is not right for doing something."
"Well, it is high time to be doing what we are doing in this area."
"The institutions have come together."
"There have been significant changes in the proposals for sanctions, financing, transparency and import controls."
"That, with the input of the Council, has made this a good proposal, and a very good one for Mrs Paulsen to end on, because I know this may be her last report in Parliament."
"She deserves all our thanks."
"The main issues that have been raised and which I wish to touch on are, first, how the balance of fees is being struck in a way that is fair to small operators, as Mr Goodwill said, but nevertheless does not allow exploitation and evasion of the rules by some."
"Second, how far we can specifically assist developing countries in meeting EU standards."
"How are these standards going to be applied and what assistance are we able to offer?"
"Most of all, how can we guarantee the system of prior notification for high-risk products at ports that have the necessary facilities to deal with them?"
"There is a big question mark concerning these ports of entry and recent experience shows that we have to deal with this issue."
"Finally, I am particularly glad that we have reached some agreement on the issue of sanctions."
"Sanctions as originally proposed were unwise and would not have worked."
"I am pleased to say that the route we are now taking, which has been agreed by most of the main players, is likely to lead to success."
"Mr President, although it is consumer protection that interests people most when we talk about Europe, it has to be said that little has been done here, and that this framework directive too will fail to provide any guarantees that the food scandals of recent years will be a thing of the past."
"Unfortunately, food controls are still a farce."
"This directive is indeed successful in many areas, and we Greens are particularly pleased that animal welfare has finally been incorporated into food controls."
"The intensity of controls has also been improved, so that national control reports are now also required."
"Nevertheless, an investigation carried out in Germany has just highlighted the fundamental problem, which is that not enough controls are carried out in practice."
"We need much more funding for food controls, so that controls can be carried out more frequently, and so that anyone breaching food regulations runs a genuine risk of punitive action."
"That remains the weak point in all the Member States."
"We would also like to have seen laboratory methods brought in line, with some harmonisation of how controls are implemented in the Member States."
"What we also urgently need – and I have not given up hope, Commissioner, and would be pleased if you could say something about this – is for a consumer information directive to be brought in at last, mirroring the environmental information directive."
"That would mean that just as consumers, the public, have the right to know what is happening in the environmental world, they would also have the right to know what is happening in the food sector."
"My very last point is this: I hope that the Council will stop playing hide-and-seek and tell us today in the clearest possible terms what the position is on fees and fines, so that this is clear when we come to vote, because we cannot demand more food controls and improved animal welfare if the Council is secretive about this point and there is a lack of transparency towards this House."
"That is all we want."
"Because what we need is food controls …"
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her report."
"Some very important aspects have been included, as many other people have mentioned."
"I am especially pleased with the inclusion of animal welfare."
"Some people dismiss this as an issue but I think it is very important."
"On the issue of controls, this is something that relates not only to this issue but also to a vast area of legislation in the European Union, where legislation is in place but it is not enforced; there are no controls."
"It is important that if you have legislation and rules, they must be enforced."
"You cannot do that without proper and adequate controls."
"I am most concerned about the issue of sanctions; it is regrettable that they are not included."
"You will not force Member States and companies into complying with the law if there are no adequate sanctions in place."
"We have seen in the past that companies responsible for feed scandals never go to jail; those responsible within those companies are never properly penalised."
"There are derisory fines which are no deterrent to any continuation of these kinds of offences."
"We are not going to find a way forward without sanctions, because we need both the carrot and stick approaches to ensure that the legislation is complied with."
"Mr President. I am grateful that Parliament has accepted our proposal on official feed and food controls so favourably, and that it has endorsed the need to ensure an improved monitoring system of the food and feed chain at national and Community level."
"Allow me to underline once more my appreciation for the intense and productive contribution of the various committees and to stress the importance and sensitivity of the issues under discussion today, which have been raised and explored as a result of Mrs Paulsen's excellent work."
"I understand the emphasis put on certain aspects, such as increased transparency and the recognition of the efforts of good businesses to produce safe food and feed."
"The Commission regrets that its proposal to introduce penal sanctions is not supported by Council and Parliament."
"The Commission considers that the use of penal sanctions would be an important strengthening of controls on food and feed operators."
"The Commission disagrees with Parliament's and the Council's view that Article 55(2) and (3) relate to the third pillar."
"On the other hand, it notes that this issue has already been submitted to the Court of Justice for determination in another case."
"In these circumstances and taking into account the overall political context of this procedure, the Commission is prepared to withdraw Article 55(2) and (3) of this proposal, awaiting the Court's determination of the issue and reserves the right to propose again measures providing for criminal sanctions in this field."
"Mrs Paulsen raised the question of sensitive treatment of small enterprises and I would refer to the provision in the legislation that provides for a special case to be made in respect of small enterprises."
"I know from her extensive experience in dealing with food safety issues in this House, that she will be aware that similar sensitive provisions have been included in the hygiene regulation."
"She will also be aware from Commissioner Fischler's recent review of the CAP proposals that special provision has also been made there for the funding of small and medium-sized food enterprises, particularly in rural areas, throughout the EU."
"Mr Parish raised the question of import controls."
"Third countries must give guarantees on compliance with EU law."
"If these guarantees are not given, imports will be submitted to special controls, or not be allowed at all."
"Imported food and feed will be submitted to import controls upon arrival."
"That control system is based on risk: the higher the risk, the more intensive the import controls."
"For example, food that may contain certain toxins will be checked intensively."
"Mr Whitehead then raised the question of how we can guarantee that the prior notification system works properly."
"There is already a system in respect of veterinary controls, where there is a form that deals with this issue of prior notification."
"A modest adjustment will be made to the existing provisions in relation to the veterinary controls to take this particular system into account."
"Thought has been given to this; my officials have noted this issue as one requiring attention and it will be dealt with at a technical level."
"Mr Parish also raised the question of animal welfare."
"As he probably knows, animal welfare aspects are not included in the WTO (World Trade Organisation) sanitary and phytosanitary code and there is therefore no international consensus on the organisation of controls in respect of animal welfare rules with our trading partners."
"The Commission's proposal is to conclude agreements with third countries on animal welfare."
"The Commission has also raised the matter in the OIE in order to bring the matter on to the international agenda."
"There was a conference in Paris a couple of weeks ago that I attended, where the OIE has clearly indicated its intention to upgrade the whole question of animal welfare in international trade."
"This legislation also provides for national control measures to be put in place so that the FAO can inspect them and be satisfied that they work properly."
"Concern was expressed about the deflection of trade from one harbour to another and whether this would arise or not, owing to different levels of inspection and the application of less expensive control measures, thus creating an advantage for food business operators."
"For this reason, the proposal provides for a standard level in the veterinary sector."
"With regard to control measures, the proposal will contribute to reaching a harmonised level on import controls."
"I believe that the essential elements to avoid deflection of trade are included in the proposal."
"Mrs Klaß raised the question of the system of inspection fees and why they cannot be regulated at a more central level."
"There are a number of reasons for this and some have been referred to by a number of speakers earlier today."
"The inspection costs, for instance, are different across Europe."
"This is due to differences in salaries, energy costs, etc. The fees in several Member States are regulated at local level, which results in different fees within a single, individual Member State."
"It is impossible for the Commission to exercise its control powers in view of the complicated methods for auditing national or regional financing systems."
"Therefore, the proposal on the table is believed to be the appropriate response to this somewhat complex issue."
"To conclude, I confirm that the Commission accepts a substantial number of the amendments that have been tabled."
"A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament, and I trust this will be included in the record of this session(1). In the event that there are amendments tabled that are not part of the package, the Commission will not be able to accept them."
"Thank you Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0468/2003) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures and procedures to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights [COM(2003) 46 – C5-0055/2003 – 2003/0024(COD)]."
". Mr President, this proposal for a directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights represents one of the main elements of a Commission action plan of November 2000 to combat counterfeiting and piracy, and complements the recent customs regulation."
"Counterfeiting and piracy are on the rise."
"They harm business, society and governments, as they are detrimental to innovation and creativity and can be very dangerous to public health and safety."
"Counterfeiters and pirates undermine legitimate business and culture as they copy end products that have involved considerable investment."
"Consumers and rights-holders are not the only ones to suffer."
"Member States are deprived of considerable amounts in lost taxation, and employment suffers when the business world is not flourishing."
"There is also a genuine threat to public order."
"Counterfeiting and piracy carried out on a commercial scale are nowadays believed to be even more attractive than drug trafficking, and its perpetrators are linked more and more to large-scale organised crime."
"This proposed directive is the Community's answer to this threat."
"It is not an easy proposal since it touches upon issues which involve many interests, sectors and different ministries in Member States, for instance culture, trade and industry, economy and justice."
"There has been some very sensitive, sometimes emotional, lobbying both for and against this directive, and I appreciate the sense of responsibility that Parliament has shown in the face of this pressure."
"However, the need for action is clear and not in dispute."
"The Commission believes that, with the text agreed by Coreper on 16 February, we have reached the right moment for a positive decision."
"The compromise text constitutes an appropriate balance among all interests involved, including rights-holders, commercial users, consumers and intermediaries."
"This balance has been achieved in a different way from that in the Commission proposal, but it has been achieved."
"The proposal constitutes a considerable degree of harmonisation and it will provide us with an effective level playing field on sanctions and remedies."
"This will be essential for creating a business environment where legal players are not disturbed by counterfeiters and pirates."
"This fulfils the commitments made by both the Commission and the European Parliament in a communication of November 2000, which resulted from consultations carried out in the context of a Green Paper in 1998."
"It also contributes to the achievement of the Lisbon agenda."
"In view of the safeguarding of the necessary balance and effectiveness of this proposal, the Commission supports the text on the table today, as proposed via the compromise amendments jointly tabled by four political groups."
"The compromise text is thus the result of joint and very intensive efforts from all three institutions."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament as a whole for the interest it has shown in this important piece of legislation and its very constructive contributions, many of which can be found in the text before us today."
"In particular, I would like to thank the very competent rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, the shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for their very professional and efficient guidance within their institution."
"Both the Committee on Industry, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have given the issues at stake great thought, the fruit of which now lies before us in the form of amendments to be voted in this plenary."
"Consequently, the Commission endorses the amendments that go along the lines of the agreed compromise text: Amendments Nos 1 to 52 and 56 to 100."
"Amendments Nos 53 to 55 and 103 to 113 deviate from the text and must be rejected."
"The Commission feels that these amendments would not contribute to the balance and effectiveness that has been achieved in the compromise and, in particular, would not be in conformity with the horizontal approach."
"The directive should apply to infringements of all intellectual property rights."
"In recognition of the harmful nature of counterfeiting and piracy, time should not be lost."
"The Commission would encourage the European Parliament to vote favourably on the Council compromise text so as to avoid any delay that would otherwise arise and would only serve the purpose of those trying to profit from illegal practices."
"Time will not improve this text."
". – At a time when, as Commissioner Byrne states, counterfeiting and piracy crimes are currently rocketing, it is essential, in the interests of our economy. to put in place appropriate instruments to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights."
"I would remind you that the Commission presented its text in January 2003. This initiative had been expected ever since 1998 when the Green Paper was published."
"Parliament demonstrated its determination to act against counterfeiting and piracy on a number of occasions, notably by voting unanimously on a resolution on this Green Paper and by signing a written declaration."
"Being aware of the need to which I have referred, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted on 27 November 2003 the amended report on the respect of intellectual property rights by 28 votes with 3 abstentions. Time is of the essence."
"On the eve of enlargement, there is also an urgent need to establish harmonised legislation so as to ensure respect for intellectual property rights, innovation and creativity in the 25 Member States. Accordingly, an original procedure was used."
"At the behest of the Presidency of the Council, an informal three-way discussion was established to seek a compromise. The discussions took three months."
"In addition to the Council and the Commission, your rapporteur, the draftsman of the opinion, the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the shadow rapporteurs also participated in this process. I would like to thank them for their help and for their diligence."
"The Irish Presidency’s extraordinary commitment made it possible for this agreement to be reached in advance of the deadline, and I would like to extend special thanks to them."
"I am also grateful to the Commission, which did everything in its power to offer us continual assistance."
"The amendments tabled today on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group reflect the text of the Council compromise in every detail."
"The text is extremely balanced, equitable and proportionate, reiterating our stance on the importance of intellectual property law, taking account of the concerns expressed by Parliament on behalf of a range of sectors, and now containing many safeguards to protect the interests of both right-holders and consumers."
"In accordance with international agreements into which the Community has entered, the scope of the application of the directive is broadened to cover all infringements of intellectual property law."
"From now on, however, only acts committed for commercial purposes will be regarded as punishable."
"The definition of commercial purposes excludes acts committed by consumers acting in good faith who do not gain direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage."
"This extension of the scope of the application does not undermine any of the sectoral directives already adopted on copyright, electronic commerce and computer programs."
"The exception made for private copying is actually strengthened."
"The other important points of the text relate to the need to take account of the rights of defence."
"Notably, Article 8 on the provisional measures guarantees the right to defence by imposing a time limit, thus limiting the entitlement to institute legal proceedings, and byproviding for the defendant to be compensated."
"The protection of personal data is strengthened. All measures taken must be justified and proportionate."
"They must not create barriers to legitimate trade or to competition. The judicial authorities must assess the specific features of each case."
"They must also assess whether or not the infringement was intentional. All measures envisaged are civil and administrative sanctions."
"Providing as it does for revision of the directive, especially in line with changes to Community legislation, this is a forward-looking compromise."
"If you support the proposed compromise amendments, this directive can be adopted at the first reading, within the life of this Parliament. This will show how efficiently the three institutions can work."
"It will send out a positive message on integration to the enlarged European Union. It will strengthen confidence in the internal market."
"This is what is needed to meet the challenge of the Lisbon objectives. It is what is required to ensure that Europe’s economy, characterised by its innovation, can become the most competitive economy in the world."
"Thank you, Mrs Fourtou; if I am allowed, I will also add my personal congratulations, given that you spoke about an early conciliation."
"Myself and the other two Vice-Presidents of the Conciliation Committees will therefore have less to do."
". Mr President, please allow me to remind you that this is a codecision procedure and that this Parliament is a co-legislating body."
"And perhaps you are not aware of this obvious fact because I am doubtful whether, in this case, the European Parliament has fulfilled its duties properly."
"In December, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for a text, which is not going to be approved today, but rather certain amendments are going to be approved which differ radically from what was voted for in that meeting of the committee."
"Why was there this disparity?"
"Because what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for responds to the honourable Members’ will, while the ultimate paternity of the text we are going to approve today corresponds to the Council."
"Please do not imagine that what I am saying is in any way a criticism of the rapporteur; far from it."
"Mrs Fourtou has done good work trying to reconcile positions, but in the end she has been faced with an inflexible position on the part of the Council, which has said ‘if you want the Directive to be approved, you must approve what we say’."
"And since we are aware of the need to approve the Directive, what we have carried out – and Mrs Fourtou in particular – has been an exercise in responsibility."
"But sometimes we should ask ourselves whether we also impose this exercise in responsibility on the Council."
"There can be no doubt that this Directive is necessary, but nevertheless, it is doubtful whether the text approved will resolve the problems which have been raised."
"I believe it is no mistake to say that the text approved is going to be the laughing stock of commentators and is going to cause many difficulties for the Member States when it comes to incorporating it into their internal law."
"The Council’s desire to prevent the European Commission’s initiative from containing, for example, criminal law provisions, has created such confusion between civil sanctions, administrative procedures and administrative sanctions, that I cannot imagine what the Member States are going to do when it comes to applying it."
"We are clearly going to approve this text, but with great scepticism."
"At the same time, the Spanish Socialists at least are going to support certain amendments in order to reflect the fact that the Council, with the enforced cooperation of the European Parliament, has completely undermined what was originally a very good Commission initiative."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to very warmly thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, for her excellent work."
"I am sure that it was really not easy to reach agreement on this complex dossier not only between the groups but also with the Council and the Commission."
"The text now before us, which is to be voted on tomorrow, is a good compromise that we should all accept."
"We are all familiar with fake, cheap Rolex watches, Lacoste shirts, with the cheap imitation Levi Strauss jeans, Louis Vuitton bags, and many other products besides. Music and films on CD and DVD are being pirated."
"When you see everything available on the market, you might well think that product piracy is a trifling offence."
"But it is not, ladies and gentlemen, far from it: counterfeiting and product piracy certainly are not minor offences."
"They cause losses running to millions in Europe every year and they are consequently a threat to our economy and above all to jobs in Europe."
"The object of the directive is to create uniform ground rules for combating product piracy."
"On the eve of EU enlargement, it gives the right signal at the right time."
"What is the directive intended to achieve?"
"It is of course intended to have a deterrent effect on product pirates and counterfeiters."
"The directive provides a process-based framework here."
"It does not actually introduce anything new, but it attempts to provide a new framework in terms of process, so that we can take action against product pirates across Europe in accordance with uniform rules."
"What should the directive not be allowed to do?"
"It should not of course be allowed to criminalise or stigmatise young people who occasionally download some music from the Internet, but the directive has also made provision for this."
"The criminal penalties originally included in the draft have been taken out again – also thanks to the pressure exerted by our rapporteur – and the directive stipulates that sanctions should only be applicable in a fair and proportionate manner."
"There are provisions that go beyond these mechanisms in order to prevent young people from being criminalised."
"The directive makes this clear and it will not come to that."
"One point that Mrs Fourtou also mentioned, and with which I agree, is that the directive should not of course create any barriers to competition."
"It is not acceptable for competitors to be kept out of the market by relying on alleged infringement of copyright."
"A recital has been specially included in the directive to the effect that this should not be the aim of the directive."
"The directive, including the amendments we are to vote on tomorrow and which I hope will be accepted, provides a good, fair compromise between the interests of all the parties involved, and I urge you to support the line taken by the rapporteur."
"Mr President, we all know that counterfeiting and product piracy has reached epidemic proportions."
"The lack of harmonised enforcement rules means that counterfeiting is a low-risk business where for a low investment counterfeiting pirates are guaranteed enormous profits."
"The UK's Anti-Counterfeiting Group has estimated that as many as 4 000 people lose their jobs as a result of this trade and that the GBP 1.75 billion lost in VAT alone could build four new hospitals a year."
"Clothing and footwear companies suffer the greatest losses and consumers are the victims."
"Their health and safety is put at risk with fake medicines, foodstuffs, toys coated in toxic lead, flammable children's clothing and fake alcohol containing high levels of methanol which has led not only to people being hospitalised but also, in one case in Scotland, to the death of a woman."
"In my own region, north-west England, trading standards intellectual property groups' seizures of counterfeited pirate goods is on the increase."
"Here is one example: this is a Manchester United football shirt, coveted by many youngsters."
"It is a fake, but was sold to consumers on the high street at full price."
"Far from a bargain."
"This is a packet of Viagra, now available over the Internet."
"50 000 such packets were seized at a house in Oldham."
"They are imported from Thailand and distributed by a vast network of counterfeiters across the region."
"There is also a more sinister side to this counterfeiting and piracy."
"The Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland has reported that nearly half of all organised crime groups are involved in IP crime."
"Two thirds of these groups have links to paramilitary organisations, so the draft law we are voting on today should be seen in context."
"It is not as ambitious, radical or draconian as many opponents would like to portray."
"Nor is it a panacea for rights holders."
"It is a first modest and cautious step in an EU-wide commitment to fight counterfeiting and piracy."
"I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency for having agreed a text which is balanced and proportionate and whose actions are focused on tackling genuine and serious acts of infringement. consumers engaged in acts on a commercial scale have nothing to fear from this new EU law, as consumers acting in good faith are excluded from its scope."
"A further safeguard is that commercial scale is defined as acts resulting in commercial and financial gain."
"Moreover, action can only follow, as a result of a justified and proportionate request by the claimant, on the authority of a competent judge or court and only for intentional infringements on a commercial scale."
"Contrary to the hysteria and misrepresentation spread by certain sections of the EU press, there is no question of dawn raids on teenagers in their homes."
"The law has no criminal provisions."
"It is restricted to civil and administrative remedies."
"There are no double damages."
"The directive reinforces judicial discretion and ensures that remedies are fair, equitable, proportionate and justified."
"This is an enforcement directive and one that cannot write IP law."
"Nor can it rewrite it or change e-Commerce law, in particular the responsibility of ISPs as defined in Articles 12 to 15 of the e-Commerce directive."
"It cannot undermine the right to private copying as provided for in the Copyright directive, and in fact reinforces that right and protects the right of privacy."
"The actions taken must guarantee compliance with data protection laws."
"Article 23 provides for an assessment of the impact of the directive and Parliament will take that seriously."
"The intention is to show that it is applied in a balanced and proportionate way and it should be stressed that the directive must not be used to abuse the right of legitimate competitors to enter the market place, in particular that for generic medicines."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her willingness to compromise, and the Irish presidency for its determination in forcing all parties to come to agreement."
"We must today take the bold step of voting this law onto the statute book."
"We must send a signal to counterfeiters and pirates that we are serious about closing the enforcement loopholes that they exploit."
"We must give judges and courts in the enlarged EU the option of a range of enforcement tools."
"It is time for the EU to get tough on counterfeiting and piracy."
"It is time we stopped allowing counterfeiters a free ride at the expense of consumers, legitimate businesses, EU jobs and the EU's competitiveness."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Fourtou, all the shadow rapporteurs, and also the Commission and the Council, for the structured, constructive cooperation that we have enjoyed over the past three months because, to my mind, the way in which a compromise has been achieved on this Directive is exceptional."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took a rather different view, but, ultimately, I think that this compromise is a start, and indeed I hope that it is adopted."
"We finally have recognition of intellectual property rights throughout Europe."
"Although there were already various directives and laws in existence, for example regarding copyright, e-commerce, and software, there was no discussion – or at least insufficient – of enforcement, and as a result we in Europe find ourselves with a hotchpotch."
"In that regard, it is good that we now have a kind of umbrella legislation for harmonised implementation, throughout the EU, of all the directives already in existence in the field of intellectual property rights."
"As many have now said, counterfeiting and piracy within Europe are growing hand over fist."
"We are seeing criminal organisations switching from drug trafficking to counterfeit goods because the chance of being caught is minimal and there is just as much money in it, if not more."
"I think that we must call a halt to this."
"I think that we need a harmonised approach, not only because criminal organisations are earning money illegally from these goods, but also in order to protect our economy, to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and ultimately, in particular, to protect consumers."
"Why so?"
"We are not just talking about pirated CDs, as some people think, but about a broad spectrum of products that are being counterfeited."
"I shall take toys as an example."
"I have seen toys that contain cadmium."
"Under the Directive on cadmium, this substance is prohibited in toys manufactured in Europe, but counterfeit products can still contain it, as they are illegally imported."
"Medicinal products are another example."
"There are examples of painkillers that contain talcum powder, and I think that this is unacceptable."
"Much money is to be made from it but, in my opinion, consumers must be protected."
"Even aircraft parts are being counterfeited, because there are large profits to be made from this."
"It is a good thing that something is being done to put an end to this."
"I was the one who, at the Green Paper stage, suggested including a reference to criminal law. The reason for this is that we would not buy a stolen bicycle, because it has been stolen – our principles would not allow it – but we would like a counterfeit Breitling watch or other counterfeit product, because it is cheap."
"If this is included in criminal law, and possession of a somewhat dearer counterfeit product becomes a punishable offence, there will no longer be a market for this, and there will no longer be an incentive for organisations to produce counterfeit goods."
"It is a shame that certain strict rules have not been included, as my colleague Mr Berenguer Fuster has already remarked, but I nevertheless welcome the compromise that has been reached."
"A large number of ambiguities that lobbyists have been using up to now as arguments for voting against it have been removed from the proposal."
"It is my opinion that this proposal is the beginning of the end of counterfeiting, and I hope that this will develop into a fully-fledged directive with fully-fledged means of monitoring compliance with it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to the different stakeholders in this directive and to the parties affected by it, to whom the Commissioner referred – consumers, industrialists and artists."
"I do not want them all to be put on the same footing."
"Firstly, as regards consumers, I regret that the Commission proposal has not been kept as it was. I regret it has been broadened rather too far, in that it holds consumers, as – shall we say – citizens, every bit as responsible for piracy as industrialists."
"This is my first point on consumers."
"Treating all European citizens as consumers in this way seems simplistic."
"The second very important point is this: If this directive seeks to combat something that exists now, how will things turn out in the future?"
"Over the last few years, discussions concerning intellectual property and industrial property have highlighted the difficulties relating to borders."
"Some say that intellectual property is the oil of the twenty-first century."
"They may be right."
"If intellectual property really is the oil of the twenty-first century, then of course it is important to talk about it. Nonetheless, the fact that this House has discussed such matters as the ability to patent living organisms or free software suggests how important the issue of borders will be in future."
"Even if this problem has not yet arisen, it definitely will in future. Not everything can become industrial or intellectual property."
"It is essential to raise this issue, but in a sensible manner."
"Borders will certainly be an issue in the near future and thereafter even if they are not yet one today."
"This leads me to speak on behalf of, or to speak for, those who use acronyms. I am of course talking about artists."
"Are artists happy to be equated with industrialists?"
"As a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I do my best to listen to all those sectors. From what I have read and from what I understand, we would do well to take account of artists’ views on intellectual property."
"If we take account of the views of industrialists and consumers, should we not also consider artists, especially as they are always referred to in connection with the need to combat piracy?"
"As regards artists, authors’ rights and intellectual property do not appear to be the only problem, and that – as music and music piracy are talked about so glibly – young artists and creative artists would like a different approach."
"It may be necessary to defend these artists appropriately in this regard."
"I do not believe that the House should allow all these various parties to be dealt with in the same way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Fourtou for her openness, which was exemplary."
"Right from the start all the shadow rapporteurs were involved in the discussions and also in the trialogue."
"That is something I have rarely experienced in this House."
"And she did that long before her family circumstances were seized upon by the press."
"I do not wish to comment on that now, I shall leave that to my colleague."
"So much for the form."
"There are problems, however, as has already been mentioned, particularly by the previous speaker."
"That this directive is needed is something on which everyone – including Members of this House – agrees."
"So do the players in the market, ranging from the telecommunications industry to consumer protection organisations, from the pharmaceutical industry to generic drug manufacturers, from artists to content producers."
"We need a good directive."
"I believe, though, that the compromise that we have negotiated has not entirely succeeded in addressing these many and diverse needs and concerns in a single directive."
"There are two specific policy areas where reasonable agreement is important."
"One is that we wish to limit the scope of the directive somewhat, to use for commercial purposes; the other area is that of patents."
"There is certainly scope for debate about patents and also about common practice in Europe."
"But it remains a fact that we do not have a European-level patent, and we do not want to use the implementing directive to pave the way for one through the back door."
"This needs to be discussed very carefully; it is not such a simple matter."
"I therefore urge you to give a large measure of support to these two amendments on patents and the scope of the directive."
"I believe that this directive, this compromise, will then have been sufficiently improved for us to jointly adopt it as a compromise before the end of this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, contrary to Mr Imbeni, I do not want to praise the procedure followed because an ‘early conciliation’, as Mr Imbeni put it, is not a good procedure."
"There is a good reason why the conciliation has its rules and its methods of proceeding: in order that a large number of MEPS, and Parliament itself, might be involved in the debate and in clarifying the uncertainties in the text that little by little takes shape."
"I, contrary to Mr Imbeni, do not consider this to be a good procedure."
"We then notice the implications in connection with this report."
"It is not true that this compromise clearly limits the scope."
"If this were the case, if this were also your intention, then you would, for example, be able to adopt Amendment No 101 – which we tabled with some other Members – which explicitly limits the scope to intentional infringements for commercial gain."
"The truth is that, even though criminal sanctions have been removed from the compromise, preventative measures remain that are very dangerous regardless of the outcome of the inquiry and the procedure."
"The risk is adopting a system which thus makes it simple, and even partly up to private companies themselves, to search, confiscate goods and take preventive measures that risk putting the market in a situation of uncertainty and instability, where those who are most organised in having lawyers and legal consultations – large corporations – will best succeed in scaring and blackmailing small and very small businesses and also the end consumer."
"It is not true that private copying is excluded from the scope of this compromise, because it is not excluded from preventive measures."
"Why all this?"
"Why was it necessary to do all this and to devise this type of special emergency legislation?"
"Perhaps because the laws on intellectual property are laws that have been superseded to a large extent by digital technology."
"The risk is that you, the very people who want intellectual property to be respected, in the same way as physical property – and this is also our concern – end up adopting laws that cannot be respected."
"It is not with policing measures and private policing that the desired objective is achieved."
"Such measures achieve the opposite, that is to say they delegitimise the power and value of the laws."
"Mr President, Mrs Fourtou tackled a very complex issue."
"In order to achieve framework legislation, I believe that a lot of work will have to be done in this Parliament’s next parliamentary term."
"I must congratulate my colleague Mrs Fourtou because I believe that she has put together the best of the possible compromises. As with any compromise, however, I did unfortunately find some shortcomings in this report."
"For example, even providing for potentially effective instruments to combat activities such as peer to peer or fair sharing, does not allow for the content provider to be fully protected, a situation which risks seriously compromising the reliability of any library."
"The report is directed solely at crimes committed on a commercial scale and not more generally at infringements of intellectual property rights regardless of how or by whom they are committed."
"A lot of attention clearly needs to be given to this point in order to find a point of balance."
"This was a long task that lasted many months."
"I do, however, remember that, from the outset, the objective in terms of protecting copyright was to combat and stop the phenomenon which, alongside counterfeiting and piracy, allows material protected by copyright to be used illegally to the detriment of the work of all content providers who are legitimately building up the value chain for the use of audiovisual products."
"Particularly in future, we need to reflect further on the issue of the amount of private use that has increased exponentially thanks to the impetus provided by digital technology via broadband or any other advanced technological platform."
"This will cause a significant and quantifiable commercial prejudice for all the content providers that base their operating model on the legal distribution of content, subject to contractual agreement with the parties entitled."
"In this area, too, we need to consider the consequences of the new legislation on telecommunications."
"In fact, not only does the wording of the proposal for a directive lose sight of some important aims, but it does not even constitute an effective deterrent against infringement because, in the long process in which the various proposals were made, the possibility disappeared of compensating for the two-foldprejudice in the form of loss of profit and loss suffered."
"I confirm that, in the short term, to obtain an effective instrument, we need to give maximum support to the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, and that, in future, we must do a lot of work in this area."
"I have two final remarks, one relating to Recital 22."
"This states that prohibitory measures can be taken against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties only to infringe industrial property rights and not, as provided for in Articles 10 and 15, intellectual property rights."
"Such a discrepancy between the text of the regulation and that of the Recital is not without importance, because it signifies an intention to support an interpretation whereby the term intellectual property contained in the text of the articles actually refers only to cases of intellectual property."
"I therefore call on Mrs Fourtou to table an oral amendment in which ‘industrial property right’ is replaced by ‘intellectual property right’."
"In this regard, I am thinking about Italian producers protected by geographical indications, who, in a situation of this type, could not obtain an injunction in other European countries against, for example, traders, carriers or advertisers who sell, transport and publicise counterfeit Italian products."
"A final comment on Article 16."
"I think that it is really important that the final phrase of Recital 23a is reintroduced as a final paragraph of this article."
"In the absence of such regulatory specification, you might think in many countries that if – after the person in possession of counterfeit goods in good faith has paid compensation – the judge waived the prohibition of the sale, and exclusion from the commercial chain, of these products, they would be authorised for any commercial use."
"If we think, for example, about the whole medical field, this becomes totally unacceptable."
"Mr President, this morning’s debate creates great confusion, because the positions we are hearing are very different."
"Some people tell us that Mrs Fourtou has achieved a wonderful compromise and others tell us that the big political groups have behaved like a kind of steamroller."
"We have heard speeches from Members of the different political groups, including the big ones, expressing very different opinions."
"Mrs Fourtou has tried to speed up the legislative process with what we could call ‘’, but I believe we should assure Mr Imbeni that the procedure remains in place."
"The problem is that the current procedure for approving legislation in the European Union, before the adoption of the European Constitution, is a truly elaborate, complicated and difficult procedure."
"The recently signed Interinstitutional Agreement intends to eliminate these difficulties, but we know that that is going to be very difficult to achieve in practice."
"And this is because if there is no clear identification of a legislative body – which I believe must be as unified as possible – we are condemned to continuing to adopt this type of legislation in which there are great contradictions."
"Mr Berenguer Fuster said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market reflected the views of the Members of Parliament."
"I disagree with that, because the majority of reports approved – including by a great majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs – are usually then rectified in plenary."
"In other words, as a result of its composition, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market does not currently reflect the will of the whole House."
"Mrs Fourtou has tried to achieve an agreement which does not reflect the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I do not know if she will achieve that agreement, because we do not yet know what the result of the vote will be."
"We are talking about a report with many amendments, with enormous amendments, and which, theoretically, should not affect substantive law."
"We are talking about a right relating to the application or implementation of the substantive content."
"Mr Berenguer may be right about the confusion between civil, administrative and criminal enforcement procedures, but it appears that the attention has been to eliminate criminal enforcement or, at least, the possibility of criminal proceedings, and this is due to the European Union's lack of competences in the criminal field."
"On the other hand, the scope of the directive has been extended – or it is intended to do so – so that it also includes the field of patents, which is a field in a degree of turmoil."
"My impression, Mr President, is that this first reading is going to produce a text typical of these Community institutions: a kind of camel – that is, a horse designed by a committee – and that it will probably only be the beginning, but I believe it is preferable for us to adopt this proposal for a directive as quickly as possible, at least so that we may have a departure point to work from, firstly in the second reading and then, no doubt, when further legislative proposals are needed."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her sustained efforts to achieve compromise amendments and, through the necessary contacts, to accomplish a compromise text."
"We shall thus escape a second or third reading."
"Reference has been made many times already to the adverse consequences of counterfeiting in all kinds of fields, and to the risks to public health and innovation."
"The situation has worsened over the past three years, and all kinds of product are now found, even current consumer goods."
"The extent of the phenomenon is becoming increasingly alarming, and organised crime is increasingly involved."
"An initiative at European level is urgently needed, therefore, particularly as these phenomena are largely based in the new Member States."
"The positive points in the report include the fact that the Directive is to apply to all infringements ofintellectual property rights."
"Member States must also ensure that any serious infringements of intellectual property rights are classified as criminal offences punishable by criminal penalties."
"It is well-known that creativity and innovation are the key trump cards in our European economy, and so they must enjoy sufficient protection."
"I should like to appeal for support for the rapporteur in her fight, therefore."
"Mr President, representing, as I do, a constituency which is associated with such products as Scotch whisky, Highland shortbread and Borders knitwear, I am fully aware of and sensitive to the points many have made about the evils of counterfeiting and piracy, which extend much more widely than just to products of the kind I have mentioned."
"I, therefore, strongly support the idea of introducing a directive of this kind."
"However, I do not agree entirely with Mr Byrne when he claims that a balance has been struck."
"That is not what we hear from the Generic Medicines Association, which is very fearful that extension of this set of remedies to patent law will damage its interests and thus the interests of the health services of Europe and beyond."
"A balance has not been struck."
"Patents must be excluded, and the point about the commercial scale must be extended to the whole of the directive, not just to some parts of it."
"Finally, I say with great personal sympathy for Mrs Fourtou that this case shows up a gap in our rules about declaration of interests."
"The issue of familial interests needs to be included."
"I say that without any personal discourtesy."
"Mr President, I wish to support my colleagues who have taken a very broad-ranging view of this important proposal."
"This is not specifically about the digital world."
"It is about the future of the European economy and about the ability of any manufacturer who has intellectual property rights, whether protected by patent, copyright or registered design, or indeed by any other form of ownership, over a creative work or design that they have genuinely originated, to be able to protect and sell their products in a legitimate way, reap the profits and create jobs within the European Union."
"We are talking about the procedure and timescale because we all know that as from the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May there will be major concerns about the inability of intellectual property owners to enforce their rights across the enlarged European Union."
"Many of my colleagues have given graphic examples of the problems associated with the counterfeiting on a large scale of physical goods that are being shipped into the European Union and essentially sold illegally, thereby depriving people of their legitimate livelihoods."
"Let us put matters into perspective, since this is the nub of the issue and is why we have supported Mrs Fourtou in her work with the Council aimed at reaching a genuinely balanced compromise that will be in place on 1 May, thereby ensuring we do not have to wait another six to nine months to deal with this problem."
"We are in the real world now, and this is not some theoretical piece of legislation but something that will actually protect jobs in our constituencies."
"As we move towards a world in which more and more goods are coming into the European Union from countries, such as China, that are new members of the World Trade Organisation and where intellectual property enforcement is at best very weak, we have to be able to protect ourselves in a legitimate and balanced way."
"That is what is at stake, and those of you who are contemplating amending this proposal with the result that it is not in place on 1 May will have to answer to manufacturers in your constituency when a container load of counterfeit goods from China arrives through an accession country on their doorstep in June."
"You will have to answer for the impact this will have on local jobs and local manufacturers."
"– Mr President, it is important that the common position clearly focuses on commercial activity and the work of professional criminals."
"Copying on a small-scale for personal use will then be left alone."
"We have no need or means to interfere when it is a matter of copying by private citizens."
"In the information society the invasion of people’s privacy is a most dangerous and mostly ignored problem."
"The counterfeiting of food products has risen by 75% and that of CDs by 15 000%, which is almost half of all musical recordings."
"Approximately 20 000 jobs are lost each year."
"It is important, however, that a distinction is made between conscious and unconscious infringement of copyright."
"This is also important because it safeguards product development in small companies by guaranteeing some sort of protection in the sea of patent legislation."
"I am happy that there will therefore no longer be interference in criminal law, an area which lies within the competence of the Member States."
"The different practices and laws that exist in the Member States would make it an especially awkward task."
"After all, the same package deals with patents and copyright."
"Piracy, the result of commercial crime, takes away jobs."
"Nevertheless, we should not interfere in the private lives of the innocent."
"Let us make additional improvements to the next directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Directive on enforcement that we are discussing today is completely superfluous."
"After all, there is already a directive in force regarding the harmonisation of copyright, and, besides, there is the Directive on e-commerce, which regulates, among other things, the rights and obligations of service providers."
"This new Directive threatens to cause disruption on account of the obligation to monitor what users are doing."
"The present compromise explicitly stipulates that previous directives remain fully in force, therefore, and that is the way it should be: why else do we make legislation here?"
"We do not want a US-style situation in which legislation is made according to the misconceptions of the day."
"This new Directive on enforcement officially declares people making illegal copies to be thieves, but everyone has known for a long time that pirating of software, CDs and DVDs is a punishable offence."
"We certainly do not need a new directive to do this, and especially not one that fails to define the scope of intellectual property rights."
"We in Europe have different criminal justice systems with different penalties, and we cannot harmonise legal systems with a single directive, particularly without a proper debate in this Parliament."
"I can say that I am pleased that the compromise now restricts the scope of the directive to piracy for commercial purposes, as copying for personal use must continue to be permitted."
"Nevertheless, I shall be voting against the Directive."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the House finds itself today face to face with a problem of political ethics."
"We are voting on a very important report, one that has a wide-ranging impact on economic affairs and on the citizens of Europe."
"How are we going to explain to the citizens of Europe that Parliament’s rapporteur, the person most directly involved with this dossier, happens to be married to Mr Fourtou, the chairman of Vivendi Universal?"
"Let there be no confusion."
"I certainly recognise that every man and woman has the fundamental right to hold political office."
"Mrs Kinnock is a Member of the European Parliament but she does not get involved with subjects relating to the portfolio held by her husband, Commissioner Kinnock."
"Mr Rovsing, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has interests in the media, but he refrains from voting on media issues."
"The credibility of the European Parliament is at stake here."
"I appeal to the President of Parliament and to the Chairmen of the political groups to find a solution to this problem by noon. Parliament’s honour is at stake."
"Any suspicion of personal interest must be eliminated if the citizens of Europe are to continue to trust the European institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank my colleague Mrs Fortou for the work she has carried out, work that was carried out with great endurance and great determination, precisely because the fight against counterfeiting and piracy must be one of the European Union’s priorities."
"In fact, creativity, which is one of the main factors of competitiveness in our economic system, is being prevented by counterfeiters because they are affecting the industrial and intellectual property rights. These rights ensure that creativity is adequately rewarded."
"Often, counterfeiting and piracy also end up affecting consumers, who are forced to purchase goods of a quality inferior to the original."
"The damage that they cause not only affects the individual holder of the right but the whole of society."
"The directive on the application of industrial and intellectual property rights is therefore an important instrument in combating the phenomenon and must be quickly adopted before the accession of the new countries, where counterfeiting and piracy are particularly widespread."
"The text negotiated with the Council, which Parliament should widely agree to, is a balanced compromise that should enable the directive to be adopted in just one reading."
"The current European and national legal framework on industrial and intellectual property is being respected."
"The conditions to effectively protect it and to more actively combat illegal trade are being created."
"The compromise rightly provides for the most important provisions of the directive to apply only to commercial practices."
"We cannot, indeed, plan to punish those who download music from the Internet just for personal use."
"A request for information from the alleged counterfeiter by the person declaring that a product is counterfeit must be justified and proportionate and should only be made by order of the judicial authorities."
"Furthermore, the directive does not influence the rules on confidential information and the treatment of personal data or the right not to testify against oneself."
"It specifies the administrative and civil sanctions that, directly affecting any illegal economic activity, have direct consequences on prohibiting counterfeiting."
"These sanctions should indeed be dissuasive but should also be gradual and proportionate to the crime committed."
"Mr President, firstly, and like other Members, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on her excellent work and also express my regret at the speech by Mr Turmes, who should not really worry about intellectual property since he has only come to criticise Mrs Fourtou and her relatives and has not been able to remain in this Chamber for the whole debate."
"I believe that the fact that certain Members of this House have family relatives – and I would be grateful if Mr Turmes would remain in the House – does not prevent them from acting in it, particularly since what we are discussing, this Directive in the field of enforcing intellectual property rights, does not exclusively affect right holders, but all consumers."
"It is also we consumers who have to ensure that the protection of intellectual property rights is guaranteed, because we want the products we buy to be original and authentic and we do not want to be deceived by people who violate intellectual property rights."
"I therefore believe that to try to use Mrs Fourtou’s relatives to discredit her work is not worthy of a Member of this House."
"There are two aspects which have been fully debated this morning."
"One of them relates to commercial purposes. It is true that we have modified the Commission's proposal, which was restricted to acts carried out for commercial purposes."
"We need to go a little further; I believe that the rapporteur’s proposal and the compromise amendments are balanced, and that we had to ensure that anybody carrying out any act against industrial or intellectual property could be prosecuted, whether that act was for commercial purposes or not."
"In reply to Mr Fiori, who spoke before me, the inclusion of industrial property is important, and in the case of Spain in particular, since the Spanish legislation in the field of trademarks and patents is considered industrial property rather than intellectual property."
"The definition has therefore been extended to both."
"With regard to the procedure, mentioned by Mr Cappato and Mr Berenguer, what we intended is something very important: to obtain a directive which could enter into force before 1 May 2004."
"It is therefore true that Mrs Fourtou has had to make certain efforts to reach agreement and that the proposal we are voting on today in this Parliament is not exactly the same as the one voted for in committee."
"Nevertheless, many of the aspects which were approved in the committee are included in what we are voting on today, apart from the two points I have referred to: commercial purposes and patents."
"There are many other aspects that we have revised from the Commission's initial proposal, such as, for example, the reduction of procedures and costs for the applicant, in order to speed up and guarantee respect for their intellectual property rights; the simplification of the guarantees to be provided by the applicant in the event of defending their industrial or intellectual property rights; the establishment of compensation in the event of an infringement of industrial or intellectual property and, finally, considerations relating to the destruction of objects used for counterfeiting or the counterfeit objects themselves."
"These are other aspects of the Commission's proposal that we have modified and which, as the Commission has said, make this directive sufficiently balanced for the times we are living in."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the third report (A5-0118/2004) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission communication on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment [COM(2001) 726 – C5-0108/2002 – 2002/2052(COS)]."
". Mr President, the Commission's communication of June 2002 on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment sets out the comprehensive action plan on which the Commission work on better regulation has been progressing over the last 18 months."
"Improving the regulatory environment to obtain concrete benefits for operators and citizens is a joint responsibility of the European institutions and the Member States."
"When launching its action plan 'Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment', the Commission therefore also called on the other institutions and the Member States to contribute to the achievement of the common objectives."
"To the great satisfaction of the Commission, the common objectives and joint responsibility for better regulation were fully recognised by the other institutions and in December 2003 the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking'."
"The interinstitutional agreement regulates and clarifies all the interinstitutional aspects of the work on better regulation."
"Before I turn to the specific issues raised by the present draft resolution, allow me to recall just two of the key initiatives of the Commission's action plan, which have also been integrated into the interinstitutional agreement."
"First, the Commission is implementing a framework for integrated impact assessment."
"2004 will be the second transitional year during which this framework will be further consolidated and improved, while keeping a balanced assessment of economic, social and environmental impacts."
"Secondly, the action plan launched an ambitious effort to update and simplify the Community acquis, for which the Commission proposed a rolling programme in February 2003."
"This programme will be implemented in respect of the legislative procedures and the interinstitutional agreement."
"The Commission welcomes the continued interest of the European Parliament in better regulation."
"The report prepared by the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, focuses on the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking' and, in particular, on the use of the alternative instruments of co-regulation and self-regulation."
"The interinstitutional agreement establishes a framework for 'soft law' instruments that should facilitate their future use while fully safeguarding the competences of all Community institutions."
"In fact, the three institutions have, for the first time, established a common definition of co-regulation and self-regulation."
"Moreover, the institutions have agreed on general limits and conditions to the use of such instruments, defining the role of each institution in the process and ensuring that the prerogatives of the legislative authority are respected."
"The Commission considers that the resolution is partly incoherent with the interinstitutional agreement and partly goes beyond the agreement."
"The Commission could accept some of the orientations, but only within the limits of the provisions already established in the interinstitutional agreement."
"Specifically, the Commission considers that paragraphs 5, 7, 8 and 9 of the draft resolution deviate from the word and spirit of the interinstitutional agreement and the limits and conditions laid down therein concerning co-regulation and self-regulation."
"The Commission considers that at this stage the real challenge is the full and proper implementation of the broad range of commitments set out in the IIA."
"It would not be appropriate now to go beyond what was endorsed by all three institutions only a few months ago."
"Rather than reopening the questions that have been settled by the interinstitutional agreement, the Commission invites the other institutions to implement the commitments made."
"For example, the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking' acknowledges the importance of simplifying Community legislation and commits Parliament and the Council, within six months of its entry into force, to modify their working methods by introducing, for instance, ad hoc structures with the specific task of simplifying legislation."
"These measures should, of course, fully respect existing Treaty provisions."
". Mr President, despite its brevity – it only has ten paragraphs of provisions and many recitals – my third report on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment is the result of reading many texts of at least ten years old."
"The Commission believes that this third report goes further than what was achieved in the interinstitutional agreement."
"My report is not aimed against the interinstitutional agreement, but rather it intends to strengthen it."
"However, by means of the long discussion between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the issue of improving the negotiation of Community legislation, myself and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which approved the report unanimously, wish to express our concern at a tendency which I would describe as technocratic in the legislative field."
"The legislative process is a political one, it is a process of political decision-making."
"It is true that as far as possible we must prevent the drafting of legislation that is irrational, complicated and which can be improved on."
"But the emphasis on exclusively technical considerations or on the economic weight of a certain legislative measure may not correspond to the need to adopt a piece of legislation."
"In other words, one of this European Union's faults is ‘over-technification’."
"The European institutions have been criticised for being bureaucratic."
"I do not like the word ‘bureaucratic’."
"I would say that what we have in the European institutions is a tendency to technify everything."
"And as a result of this technification we distance ourselves from the citizens thereby leading to their rejecting our form of adopting decisions."
"On approving the interinstitutional agreement, I and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market stress the danger of creating a decision-making process which is entirely out of line with the will of the citizens."
"And the only means – however imperfect – the citizens currently have to express their point of view on the Community's contribution is the European Parliament elections."
"If, for example, the European Parliament cannot oppose the technocratic procedures for adopting decisions by means of small groups in the form of self-regulation or co-regulation, I do not know what role it can play."
"Mr President, I would like to reassure the Commission by guaranteeing that I, and this Parliament as well I believe, which I imagine will adopt my report without too many difficulties, do not intend to undermine the progress which has been made in terms of simplifying Community legislation, but rather propose strengthening the political elements of the process of adopting legislation, pointing out that legislative delegations must always be subject to the popular will, by means of an institution with full legislative competence."
"As we know, the great difficulty is that the current Community legislation is the result of the accumulation of a series of international treaties which have continued to evolve and there will be no solution until a European Constitution clearly defining legislative powers is adopted."
"Once clearly defined legislative powers exist, the legislative power will be able to delegate, will be able to transfer duties to technical bodies; but these technical bodies must never replace the popular will expressed by means of direct elections to a legislative institution – the European Parliament, Parliament and the Council, whatever you want to call it – which wishes to adopt those decisions."
"I will therefore end by assuring the Commission that our intention is not to undermine the interinstitutional agreement but rather to strengthen it, introducing the necessary political elements into it so that our citizens believe in the European construction we are carrying out."
"Mr President, I am here today speaking on behalf of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in particular my colleague, Mr Doorn, who has been the shadow rapporteur for the three successive reports that our hardworking rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, has produced."
"In a way this is the end of the first phase of our cycle of work and, as the Commissioner said, we are now moving on to looking at further details of how to make the interinstitutional agreement work effectively."
"It is perhaps in that context we have the opportunity to make one or two remarks, rather than the specific points contained in this relatively short report."
"We have not really had enough debate in this Chamber about the whole issue of our role in better lawmaking or improving and simplifying the regulatory climate, as the Commission reminded us."
"I would like to reflect on what my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, said on the way in which we adopt decisions and the way in which regulation is developed and promoted within the European institutions."
"I agree with him that our citizens are genuinely concerned by the process."
"That is why they want us to do the job better and that is why those who are directly implicated in the process – whether consumers, citizens, or businesses, large and small – want to feel that they have been consulted and they have had their say at the right stage in the process."
"One of the crucial elements of doing the job better is improved development of our legislative strategies and early consultation in the process."
"One of the most important features of the Commission's action plan is that it is essentially a two-step process."
"Before we move into the detail of the extended impact assessment there is also a stage for considering the whole strategy of the legislation, its objectives, a clear definition of those objectives, and the tools by which those objectives would be achieved."
"This might possibly be regulation, but there is no reason at that stage why some form of self- or co-regulation should not be considered as a proper option."
"I know that my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, is concerned about the way that self- and co-regulation develops, but I would argue that, if we consider that as a genuine alternative at the beginning of the process and see how it is integrated and that safeguards are built in and check it against the alternative of heavyweight and intrusive legislation, this can only be to the benefit of simplifying and improving the regulatory climate."
"After all, we are looking for effective and efficient legislation."
"We are looking at outcomes."
"That is what we have just been discussing in connection with enforcement because the problem is that, however much we legislate at European level, if we cannot have consistent enforcement, the cost of the legislation falls on people who already have the systems in place and are doing the job."
"It does not squeeze out those who are breaking the law."
"This works to the disadvantage of consumers – an issue that I know is at the core of your remit, Mr Byrne."
"We should support this report, but this is only just the beginning of the process of working together with all the institutions to deliver what our citizens want, which is effective and efficient regulation or alternatives to regulation."
"Mr President, we know that our honourable friend, Mr Medina Ortega, has tremendous experience in this matter and, with his proposals to date, has helped a great deal with the job of simplifying and modernising the legislative work of the Community."
"We have the interinstitutional agreement which the Commissioner talked about."
"However, I should like to ask this question: despite what we have today, can we say that we have a simple action plan with a specific hierarchy of objectives, with a specific timetable, with a proposal for specific measures for each objective and with a clearly defined procedure for measuring objectives?"
"What interests us is to see quantifiable results in the wake of the interinstitutional agreement."
"With reference to the question, I ask you: are we in fact satisfied with the improvement so far in the quality of the regulatory environment?"
"I do not think that we should reply in the affirmative because pioneering measures are missing."
"In all events, and here I absolutely agree with Mr Medina, improving the regulatory environment means restricting the role of bureaucracy, for which the Commission is responsible."
"It also means rejecting the perception that efficiency or improvement go hand in glove with a reduction in democratic control."
"On these two issues, unfortunately, the Commission has not so far taken a clear stand."
"Having said that, I should like to emphasise that we, the European Parliament, have a huge problem."
"Here we have to combine the cultures of 15 – and soon 25 – states and, of course, the freedom of proposal from all sides."
"We face the phenomenon of an exponential rise in the number of amendments and how they can be coordinated and how they can result in a homogenous and clear text, no one knows."
"We therefore also have an endogenous problem which we need to address, and here I am of the opinion that, to date, we have been lacking clear-cut services to take care of the technical aspects of legislation and help developments."
"Nonetheless, the major problem remains the fourth stage in the overall regulatory framework, which is implementation."
"Unfortunately, even today, after so many reports on the implementation of law, a huge delay can be seen in control by the Commission of the method of implementation and the judicial and administrative authorities do not have assimilation mechanisms and have not assimilated Community law."
"So this problem needs to be addressed if we want proper implementation of Community law."
"Mr President, I will take as a starting point the final words of the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, who quite rightly said that the proposal under discussion and the whole of his report is not against the Commission but, if anything, seeks to harmonise – and I believe that, on this occasion, this term is more apposite than ever before – and regulate better law-making."
"As the coordinator of the parliamentary committee that reached an agreement on simplification of legislation (this interinstitutional agreement), I must say something about the importance of the debate that went on in my committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the report by Mr Medina Ortega."
"This debate began before we worked on the interinstitutional agreement and continued afterwards."
"The report which we are talking about was, therefore, a prerequisite for, and a consequence of, this interinstitutional agreement, which, had it been followed – please confirm this to me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen – by the European Constitution, we would, I believe, have had a parliamentary term characterised by this strong connection and this desire to take into account the three institutions (Commission, Council and Parliament) around which Europe really revolves: the European Community."
"I agree that the interinstitutional agreement is of course not everything: an agreement that prepares for a completely different role for Parliament, it is an agreement that must move forward."
"This is why, quite rightly, the rapporteur states that, in improving community legislation, it is necessary to go beyond the interinstitutional agreement."
"The interinstitutional agreement is, therefore, a condition, above all of the right to be consulted automatically – as Mr Medina Ortega rightly states in his report – in the areas of coregulation and self-regulation, that is to say a condition of Parliament’s right to be immediately informed by the Commission and to once and for all suspend the application of any voluntary agreement that it has not accepted."
"I believe that these are the two points that give shape to this report and on which there could be a further agreement in the next parliamentary term, in order to lay the foundations for a balanced relationship between the three institutions that represent Europe."
"– The debate is closed.The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four oral questions to the Commission on achieving the correct implementation of the EC/Israel Association Agreement:"
"- O-0019/2004 – B5-0067/2004 by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;"
"- O-0021/2004 – B5-0068/2004 by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;"
"- O-0024/2004 – B5-0069/2004 by Mr Watson on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;"
"- O-0025/2004 – B5-0070/2004 by Mr Sakellariou on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr President, I wish to move that the sitting be suspended until the Commission does us the honour of joining us in the Chamber."
"Mr Sakellariou, I would prefer you not to make such a request."
"Mr Liikanen cannot help it if his flight has landed late."
"He arrived at the airport on time, but his plane was delayed because of weather conditions, so it may be another ten minutes before he arrives."
"We must, however, avoid a situation in which instead of starting at 12 noon as scheduled, voting does not start until 12.15 or even 12.20."
"You are well aware that it is very irritating for honourable Members if voting starts late."
"I would suggest that we should give the floor to the first authors of the questions, as they are familiar with the subject, before the Commissioner joins us, and the Commissioner also knows what they wish to say."
"We can then continue once the Commissioner is with us, and he will be in a position to answer immediately."
"That is my suggestion."
"Mr President, I should like to support the proposal not to begin the debate until the Commission is present."
"Certainly, some of us have written our speeches, but what we talk about will, however, also depend upon the Commission."
"Otherwise, we should not of course have needed to ask the Commission to come and report on anything at all."
"I would prefer that the first speakers respond to the Commission’s contribution, which will form the background to my own response too."
"I do not think that we can go ahead with the debate."
"We must wait for ten minutes. Anything else would be absurd."
"We have a request then, an official request."
"Do you wish to pursue your request, Mr Sakellariou?"
"We have a speaker in favour of that request."
"So what I wish to ask now is whether anyone is opposed to our suspending the sitting, anyone who is in favour of our continuing this debate even if the Commissioner may not arrive for five or ten minutes?"
"Does anyone wish to speak against the request? It seems not."
"We need to vote on this then: could I please have a show of hands from those supporting Mr Sakellariou's request that we should suspend the sitting for ten minutes until the Commissioner arrives?"
"Those against please?"
"Are there any abstentions?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Parliament have been squabbling for years over products from the territories occupied by Israel, which are wrongly being given the same preferential treatment as products from Israel itself."
"Israel does not want to make this distinction, but the European Union does."
"Politics lies at the heart of the debate."
"The European Union considers the occupation of the territories in question illegal, and that is why we have made such a problem of this matter."
"However, the debate, which is in essence political, risks being overrun by scores of practical and legal aspects."
"The problem, and the reason I am asking these questions now, is that the Commission and the Council, tired of years of squabbling, are now threatening to go along with current practice."
"This would legitimise an illegal practice, and Member States would lose the legal basis for continuing to make a distinction between products from Israel and those from the Occupied Territories."
"Hence, I have two questions for the Commission."
"The first is: what steps does the Commission intend to take by November of this year, when a new Commission takes office, to put an end to the current practice, and when, precisely?"
"The second is: can the Commissioner guarantee that every decision he takes that could have an impact on the spirit, the letter or the practice of the Association Agreement will first be submitted to this Parliament for its opinion?"
"– Mr President, yesterday, on International Women’s Day, a group of Palestinian women were received here, at the initiative of my group."
"They spoke to us of their weariness and of their daily struggle to survive in the refugee camps. They spoke of their courage and of their undying and dignified longing for peace."
"In particular, they spoke of their expectations of the European Union."
"As you will be aware, the last few days have been particularly murderous in the Gaza Strip."
"Fourteen Palestinians, three of them children, have been killed; dozens have been wounded, including Israeli soldiers, as if the announced withdrawal from the zone had to be preceded by acts of destruction with increasingly irreparable consequences."
"Tomorrow, you are invited to meet Israeli pacifists. These so-called refuseniks have also courageously refused to participate in the occupation at the heart of the spiral of murder in which the Palestinian and the Israeli people are caught up."
"Clearly, we are today considering in particular Israel’s violation of the rules of origin within the framework of the association agreement."
"It is impossible, however, not to consider at the same time all those other blatant violations committed on a daily basis in the Palestinian occupied territories. These violations are also a complete betrayal of the spirit of partnership enshrined in the agreement signed."
"Consequently, for those who want to believe in a just peace, the debates on the rights or wrongs of the application of this agreement are indicative of what has unfortunately been seen as a reprehensible excess of caution on the part of the European Union."
"One is obliged to recognise that Israel treats with derision Europe’s reprimands relating to violations of Article 2 on the respect of fundamental rights, as well as those concerning the rules of origin."
"Let us consider the rules of origin."
"Since 1976, Israel has determined the origin of the products it exports without distinguishing between products originating within its territory and those originating in the territories occupied since 1967. In other words, there is no distinction between its products and those of its settlements."
"In this way, Israel has continually issued certificates of origin to products that are not eligible for preferential treatment according to Community law."
"Had it been committed by any other country, such a violation would doubtless have lead to stringent retaliatory measures."
"Due to Israel’s customs practices, however, it has thus far been impossible for Member States to prevent these preferential imports or to impose taxes."
"Neither did the Commission, at first, propose adequate measures to combat these practices."
"Subsequently, the Commission announced that it was going to get down to the task of coordinating the ineffective actions of the Member States."
"Then the Commission spelt out its position, a clear and lawful position. On 10 May 2001, Commissioner Patten stated in the House that, ‘preferential access to the Community market for exports from the Israeli settlements, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitutes a violation of the EC-Israel trade agreements’."
"The measures taken, however, have failed to put an end to this unlawful practice."
"Furthermore, the ongoing construction of that shameful wall can only exacerbate the situation."
"Olive and fruit trees have been uprooted before the villagers’ very eyes. Agricultural land has been rendered inaccessible to thousands of local inhabitants."
"Will this new illegal annexation lead to still more exports of products from these areas?"
"Last November, the European Union stressed before the EU-Israel Association Council the importance of resolving the problem of the rules of origin before any amendment of the protocol on these same rules."
"The Commission indicated that it has pursued these discussions with Israel since then."
"Nevertheless, the question still remains."
"I would like to ask you again, Commissioner, whether the Commission will accept a solution that does not require Israel to stop issuing certificates of origin to products from its settlements within the framework of the association agreement. Will the Commission use the legal instruments available to it?"
"The possibility of amending the agreement is now being put forward."
"If we accept this principle, however, and if Israel continues to violate the agreement, the European Union could forfeit all its rights to suspend the application of any part of this agreement in order to stop the violation. This would be unacceptable."
"It would amount to deliberately flouting international law. It would mean recognising Israel as the occupying power in the Palestinian Territories and recognising Israel’s practice of annexing and colonising them."
"Be that as it may, I would like to make it clear, once again, that it is absolutely essential to consult Parliament before the agreement is amended in any way."
"Will the Commission undertake to do so?"
"My conclusion is a general one. The European Union cannot continue to be complicit in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Mr Sharon’s government, in the theft of the produce of the land, in the confiscation of profits and in the denial to the people of the means of their existence and their very survival."
"The 1995 agreement followed closely on the heels of the Oslo process."
"It was designed to be a contribution to the peace process."
"The situation today is totally different."
"What type of cooperation can we be talking about?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, what we are discussing here is the 1995 Association Agreement."
"I have absolutely no objections to this agreement in itself."
"It contains fundamental standards and values that demonstrate respect and, in itself, we can support Israel as a democracy."
"That is not where the problem lies."
"What I find incomprehensible, however, and the reason I have asked these questions, is that the European Union has been allowing Israel to violate the rules of origin in the agreement for years."
"These rules of origin – this is child’s play for you, of course – state that Israel is not permitted to sell products from the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as though they originated from Israel itself; otherwise, the products from the illegal settlements would wrongfully benefit from favourable import duties in Europe."
"As Mr Lagendijk said, this is a political matter."
"I also know that the European Commission addressed Israel in this matter and, in reply, was told of Israel’s adamantine position that it considers the settlements to be Israeli territory."
"European governments are not responding, and are thus acquiescing in the violation of the agreement that they themselves adopted."
"This makes us jointly responsible for the continuation of the policy of colonisation, one of the greatest obstacles to peace."
"This is the crux of the matter, in my opinion."
"We must not share responsibility for this."
"Under the EC Treaty, the Community Customs Code and the Association Agreement, Member States are obliged to refuse to give preferential treatment to the import of products from the settlements."
"As the Commission and as guardian of the treaties, you must monitor Member States’ compliance with these obligations."
"These problems must be solved, and without delay, and so I ask the Commissioner whether he now genuinely intends to put an end to these matters and come up with a genuine legislative solution, so that a uniform verification procedure can be followed in the Member States."
"The Member States’ customs authorities will then be able to collect ordinary import duties for products from settlements without the importers being able to contest this."
"This would seem to me an extremely neat solution: not for or against Israel; not for or against the Palestinians."
"The issue is merely that we do not want to be jointly responsible for the problem of settlements, and I ask, therefore, that you submit any solutions to Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of giving preferential treatment to exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has now been with us for nearly 30 years and has been the subject of regular oral and written questions and debates in the European Parliament."
"Most recently, in a debate in November 2003 we reaffirmed that a solution finally needed to be found in order to bring Israel's repeated violations of international law to an end."
"Because of its practice of labelling products from the occupied territories as ‘Made in Israel’, Israel is not only violating the provisions on the territorial scope of the agreement, notably Article 83, the rules on origin and the provisions on cooperation and mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters, but in doing so it is continuing to display its total contempt for international agreements and for international law."
"The problem is, however, now more pressing than ever before."
"The European Union is planning to include Israel in the preferential treatment system of pan-European accumulation, which in this case means making corresponding changes to the EC-Israel Association Agreement."
"If that were to happen without the illegal application of the rules on origin for settlement products being corrected, it would imply acceptance of such illegal application."
"The European Union would accordingly be permanently depriving itself of the right finally to insist on legal application of the rules for preferential treatment of exports."
"The preferential treatment of export products from the occupied territories is, however, not only illegal and in breach of international law, it also means that the Member States continue to be faced with the thorny problem of controls and of achieving some degree of uniform treatment."
"Although the Commission has attempted to find a remedy, the problem has so far not been solved at all."
"The Commission has quite rightly informed the Israeli authorities that measures must be taken promptly to halt this illegal practice."
"Before there can be any further talk about amending the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I would like to call upon the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to resolve this situation before the end of its term of office."
"This is a very important issue, Commissioner, because it needs to go hand in hand with the amendment of the Association Agreement."
"The Commission should consult Parliament on this and thus prevent a situation arising, through inaction and a lack of political will, in which illegality is legalised."
". Mr President, under the terms of the EU-Israel Association Agreement that agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel."
"Therefore, products originating from Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem or the Golan Heights are not entitled to preferential tariff treatment upon entry into the EU, and any claims of preferential origin made by Israel for such products cannot be accepted by the Community's customs authorities."
"The Commission has explained in detail, for example in replies to various oral questions in May and November 2003, its position on this issue and the actions it has taken."
"The EU is taking every opportunity to find a solution to the problem of product imports from the Israeli settlements in question."
"Exploratory talks aimed at finding possible solutions have recently been held between the Commission and Israel, but these discussions have yet to lead to a formal proposal by Israel and the Commission therefore has yet to take a position."
"However, the Commission will not accept any solution that would mean preferential tariff treatment being granted for products originating from the Israeli settlements and imported under Israeli rules of preferential origin."
"As regards the involvement of the European Parliament, I can confirm that the Commission will act in full respect of the framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing in connection with this agreement between the European Community and Israel is more than just a technical one."
"It is not just about the legal arguments that have been exchanged with the authors of the four questions during this debate; what is really important is the political issue of whether we wish to promote peace at this point or not."
"It goes without saying that the occupation of the occupied territories since 1967 is illegal – that is the position of the United Nations."
"Resolution No 242 says that Israel should withdraw to its pre-1967 borders."
"This debate has now been going on for over 30 years."
"During that time, settlements have been built, and the signing of the Oslo Peace Accord has brought the two sides closer together."
"So the question now is this: what will most assist the peace process?"
"For example, would immediate withdrawal from the occupied territories really serve the cause of peace?"
"Everyone – including the European Union and the United States – now knows that we need to include steps towards that peace in the road map."
"Simple withdrawal tomorrow would not serve the peace process and would lead to fresh conflicts."
"Any signal that we as the European Union give at this point is crucial."
"We need to remember this: the agreement was concluded in 1975, the Oslo Peace Accord was signed in 1993, and from that moment on the European Union has supported the independence of the Palestinian Autonomy Authority, it has given it over EUR 2 billion and has done very good work."
"In Oslo both partners agreed that both areas, the different zones, including the Autonomy Authority, were parties to trade with the European Union."
"So regardless of whether the settlement policy is right or wrong, the area in which the settlements are located is an EU partner, either through the agreement with the Palestinian Autonomy Authority or through the EC-Israel Association Agreement."
"The comments made by the honourable Member from the political left who spoke first are therefore spurious."
"No one on the Palestinian side is exploited through the Association Agreement."
"Quite the opposite: if we were to suspend it overnight, the Palestinians who work there would be the first to suffer again."
"It is not just settlers who manufacture products there; a good many Palestinian jobs also depend on it."
"I think that the Commission's position is very well balanced in making it clear to Israel that this does not imply any recognition of the occupied territories, but that solutions still need to be found, so that an agreement of this kind is made to work and so that we do not pour oil on the fire again."
"I welcome the fact that Israel is once again handing over to the Palestinians the tax and customs due to them, and we in the European Union should not give the wrong signal and suspend the agreement as some people have suggested."
"That would certainly not help the peace process."
"Mr President, Israeli Government circles are continuing to fuel a political campaign aimed at representing the position of the European Union and the institutions as unbalanced and, therefore, geared to sympathising with, and supporting, the rights of the Palestinian people rather than those of the Israelis."
"All this is wrong, and it is a fact that Israel has occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 and that the European institutions, including this Parliament, have repeatedly called on the State of Israel to respect the rules of international law."
"The European institutions’ basic preference was for a constructive partnership, with the hope of attaining the best results by going along this road."
"As long as there are forces such as those that created the Geneva agreements, we must continue to foster this hope and invest politically in this future possibility."
"In fact, since 1995 the EU-Israel partnership has developed within the framework of an association agreement that provides, amongst other things, for preferential treatment of Israeli products on the European market."
"Since 1976 Israel has, however, determined the origin of its products without making any distinction between those from its territory and those from the territories occupied in constant and repeated violation of Community law, international law and the Geneva Convention."
"Today we are at a critical point in this affair."
"In fact, the protocol on the rules of origin is also being modified to allow for, on the one hand, pan-European enlargement and, on the other hand, for an Israeli-Jordanian trade system."
"Is it possible, however, to imagine this enlargement without having resolved the serious dispute with Israel?"
"In 2000, the Council reaffirmed the need to respect international law under the Fourth Geneva Convention in trade relations with Israel."
"In 2001, Commissioner Patten described the continued exports from the settlements on a preferential basis as violations."
"In 2003, the Council decided to reach a bilateral agreement with Israel."
"At this point, Commissioner, I wanted to ask you three questions, but given your reply, I will ask two."
"The first is that it seems to me that you said that the Commission cannot accept any agreement that does not provide for this illegal practice to stop; yet, how does the Commission intend to tackle this debate with the Council, given that it seems that some Member States are not of the same opinion?"
"Finally, is the Commission prepared to consult Parliament before taking any decisions in this area?"
"– Mr President, only a small proportion of Israeli exports come from the settlements. The figure is definitely under 5%."
"All the attention paid to this issue reflects the strong anti-Israeli sentiments of certain speakers. It is important to set the debate in context and bear in mind that the Oslo accords provide for unified customs arrangements."
"The real question, therefore, is whether certain products are to be identified in a particular way. The Israelis seem ready to accept this."
"Negotiations leading to an arrangement of this type will certainly resolve this problem, which is actually a relatively minor one."
"Regarding the establishment of a special category, I believe that 60 years after the liberation of Europe, we must still guard against imposing a new yellow Star of David, even if it is only to apply to goods."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the whole of this debate goes against the history, culture and identity of the European left wing."
"Why are we talking about such an issue, for what reason?"
"We are not talking about something in order to contribute to the peace or to bring the sides to the table, but rather we are talking about a legal loophole with no repercussions, not even economic."
"What will this lead to?"
"What should we do tomorrow morning with the new labels?"
"Do you think, then, that tomorrow morning there will really be a major violation of international law on this matter?"
"Or, should we then talk about the violation of international law in the form of the claims made by Abu Ali in our institution a few days ago, when he defined Hamas as a normal and general political force, rather than as a factor contributing to international terrorism?"
"That constitutes a violation of international law and not a debate on subjects of this nature."
"Furthermore, the hard-fought-for settlements that have been brought to the table so often in this discussion about associated products are not helping to put an end to peace, that much is certain."
"It is certainly terrorism that prevents the parties from coming to the negotiating table."
"Now we are talking about something serious."
"I say to everyone: let us contribute to peace."
"I say to the Commission: let us not make absurd allegations when discussing this, when we still have to clarify the issue of funds allocated for humanitarian aid: where did they really go?"
"I believe that when we start to discuss legal matters in this House, the dialogue ends; or we hide behind legal pretexts."
"So then, let us avoid this."
"Mr President, it is quite incredible that the Commission has still not found a solution to the issue of the export from Israel of goods with preferential access and that, knowing how Israel has so far insisted upon its own interpretation of its own area, the Commission wants now, into the bargain, to leave it to Israel to propose a solution enabling the Member States to identify which goods have been produced in the illegal settlements, so that duty can be claimed on them."
"If we continue not to claim duty on goods from the occupied territories, we have recognised Israel’s occupation of them, and that is something that, as the EU, we cannot do."
"Moreover, the EU has a duty to comply with its own trade agreements and, unless Israel very quickly comes up with a proposal that makes this possible, I think that the only solution to this issue is for the Commission to inform the Member States that they must subject all Israeli certificates of origin to a verification procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that not just in Mr Turchi’s speech, with which we certainly agree, but also in the speeches by Mrs Morgantini and Mr Laschet, I detect a different mood from what we have seen to date."
"The Commissioner’s speech is a speech that I would say, automatically to some extent, confirms the Commission’s position."
"I fear that the Commission would have said the same if we had been discussing the situation in Vietnam, and would have done so on the basis of its usual course of action, that is to say one whereby, instead of monitoring rights and the law, it would have monitored and protected relations with Vietnamese power, murderous as this was."
"Today, however, it seems to me that the Commission’s tone is to some extent justified by the very reasons stated by Mrs Morgantini and others."
"The desire to narrow the focus within the framework of a complex situation that is slipping from our graspis, I believe, an error of method."
"What I detect is not a love of the truth, but passion of the kind exhibited by the French Communist Member, who speaks about the wall of shame."
"There are many scandals which your party, which has been silent up until 2004, should denounce."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this parliamentary term, the real problem – and I am winding up here – is the fact that we continue to forget that the historic reasons that allowed us to make the progress that we have made in Europe to date have their origin in the statement – excellently summarised in the Ventotene Manifesto by Altiero Spinelli – according to which the self-contained nation state cannot produce democracy, freedom, progress or truth. It is by imagining that it can that we continue, for example, mistakenly to posit the national State of Palestine as the problem we have to resolve on behalf of the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"I believe that Israel too is lacking in imagination, strength and rigour in this area."
"The Israeli parties too are like yours; they are European."
"I would like to conclude by saying: let us hope, at the end of this parliamentary term, that the federalist ideals and the federalist method will very quickly prevail,with the accession to the European Union of Israel and of a Palestinian state of the kind you want to see: one founded on freedom and not on the abuse of power."
"Mr President, as the debate has shown, this is a complicated and sensitive subject."
"I agree with the previous speakers in this respect, in particular my colleague Mr Laschet."
"Clearly, serious questions arise about preferential access to the Community market for products originating from the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."
"As far as I understand it, the preferential import from these territories constitutes a violation of Community law."
"Now I understand that the European Union wants to amend the Association Agreement with Israel with the addition of a pan-European cumulation of origin, and also the implementation of Jordanian-Israeli cumulation of origin."
"The question is, however, whether a cumulation system such as this is even possible without a solution to this problem of the preferential import of products from the Occupied Territories."
"In my opinion, it is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament be consulted in good time before any part of the existing agreement is amended."
"I agree with the previous speakers: it is important that this take place before the end of the present Commission’s term of office, if possible."
"We set great store by a clear explanation of these problems by the Commission."
"Does the Commission envisage possibilities for resolving the problems that have arisen with Israel within a reasonable time?"
"I thank the Commissioner for his initial response and look forward to his second."
"As the previous speaker remarked, this is indeed a measure that is neither for nor against Israel."
"Mr President, we are facing an absurdity, a paradox."
"We are discussing the legality and legitimacy of products originating from entities, the settlements, which international law considers to be illegal."
"Established by military force in occupied territories, the withdrawal from which the European Union, the United Nations, the United States, and practically the entire international community consider to be essential in order to create a viable Palestinian State able to live in peace alongside the State of Israel."
"With regard to the issue on which this debate is based, achieving correct application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I do not mind what is done nor how it is done and I do not mind what law is applied nor how."
"But it must be made clear that Israel cannot continue to unilaterally apply the Association Agreement to settlements which must disappear in order for peace to be possible."
"To allow this to continue in a unilateral fashion would be another absurdity, an insult, a humiliation which this Parliament at least must combat."
"This is not the time, and nor do I have the time, to once again condemn the Sharon Government’s lack of political will to achieve peace."
"It is sufficient at this point to insist on the issue which we are dealing with this morning, and that is that the Israeli Government cannot issue proof of origin to products which, in accordance with Community law, are not eligible for preferential treatment as a result of originating from the colonies established in the occupied Palestinian territories."
"We must remember once again the Commission’s clear statement of 10 May 2001 that exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, within the framework of preferential treatment, are violations of the commercial agreements between the Community and Israel."
"If only for tactical reasons, it would do no harm to remember that on 10 April 2002 this Parliament approved a resolution on the Middle East, paragraph 8 of which calls on the Commission and the Council to suspend the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between Israel and the European Community."
"Mr President, it is clear that if EU law is to be credible it should be enforced properly."
"Under the Geneva Conventions the Occupied Territories are not part of Israel and, therefore, products from the settlements cannot be considered covered by this agreement."
"If the Commission is going to come forward with new plans – as it should – then it should do so before Parliament rises in June to give us time to scrutinise them properly."
"However, I agree with those who say that it is time to look at wider measures to do with suspending this EC-Israel association agreement, because that agreement contains an important human rights clause that states that if there are human rights abuses on either side of the agreement, then that agreement should be suspended."
"The EU prides itself on inserting these human rights clauses into trade agreements."
"However, if they are there we have to act on them – they have to be credible."
"Therefore it is time to suspend this agreement, because of not only the human rights abuses associated with the settlements but also those associated with the new apartheid wall, which has nothing to do with security and everything to do with an illegal land grab."
"It is destroying lives and livelihoods."
"If the EU does not suspend this agreement, it is guilty not only of an injustice to the Palestinian people but also of undermining its own laws and legislation."
"Mr President, quite right, I made a totally ridiculous remark and I would like to correct it immediately."
"I had thought and imagined that Mrs Morgantini could speak like Mrs Napoletano."
"I apologise, Mrs Napoletano, and let us attribute to Mrs Morgantini what she said."
"She continues to portray the war, from which we want to pull out, from a point of view that I do not agree with."
"An example of Italian , elegance and courtesy."
"Mr President, I hope to give an example of Dutch common sense."
"On 4 September 2003, this House was already debating the proper application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement."
"On that occasion, I quoted the conclusion of the Dutch Foreign Minister that ‘in the case of most of the products that carry Israeli proof of origin, the Netherlands can assume that the conclusions by Israeli customs regarding their origin have been reached in a lawful manner."
"This means that they meet all the conditions of the rules of origin protocol’."
"Last year, I asked the Commission whether it could subscribe to this conclusion from the Hague for the other EU Member States too."
"No answer came at that time."
"Perhaps today’s representative of the Commission will be rather more forthcoming."
"I shall not lose heart, however, and shall ask a second question."
"Is the demanding of additional customs duties from importers of products presumably originating from Israeli settlements a unilateral policy?"
"What is the Commission’s view on this?"
"Mr President, I am surprised that, since Commissioner Liikanen has said that the European Union is going to rigorously apply the rules in force, we should have any doubts about the review of the agreement with Israel which is taking place at the moment."
"I have no reason to doubt that the rule will be applied, but I do very much doubt whether this Parliament – or a minority within it – wishes to promote peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel."
"I have always been convinced that, if we want peace, we cannot play at being the bad guys and constantly penalise one of the parties."
"If we want to have credibility, we should play positively, and if we want to replace or, at least, compensate for the influence of the United States – which many here talk about – over Israel, and if we want Israel to trust in Europe, what we cannot do is always seek to castigate."
"If the occupied territories are soon – and we hope this is the case – going to pass into the hands of the Palestinian Authority, why leave them in ruins? Why ruin them?"
"Because there is a lot of falseness here."
"The Palestinian area does have a preferential system, just like the Israeli area."
"The problem is that there is this contradiction, this illogicality, that this territory is both Palestinian and Israeli, as the Israelis believe."
"We must seek points of agreement, we must seek peace."
"We must be credible to the Israeli people, and I do not believe we are going to achieve that through a ‘scorched earth policy’."
"Furthermore, with a policy of this type, subsequent investment by the Palestinians in order to incorporate these territories will be much greater."
"So I would repeat, why do we not seek points of agreement?"
"Why does Europe not stretch out its hand to Israel?"
"I must repeat that I do not understand why we do not do so."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, products from the Occupied Territories are, according to the Association Agreement, not Israeli products."
"That is how we need to view this dossier."
"It is symbolic, and symbols are important in issues of war and peace, especially now."
"The wall that Israel is now erecting is more than a symbol."
"It has nothing to do with preventing terrorism, but everything to do with denying the Palestinians the water and water resources on which they rely for their agriculture and for surviving in their villages."
"The right to water is a human right, and because this human right is being violated, together with other human rights, I am asking for this Association Agreement to be suspended."
". Mr President, I will make a few general remarks followed by replies to specific questions."
"The Commission takes every opportunity to reach a satisfactory solution to ensure correct application of Community law and to protect the Community's own resources."
"That is why the Commission works in close cooperation with the customs authorities of Member States and maintains a constructive dialogue with the Israeli authorities."
"This approach is generating results; duties are being recovered on goods from the settlements."
"Somebody asked where the customs duties go."
"They go to the general revenue side of the Community budget."
"Israel is willing to cooperate to reach a satisfactory resolution."
"Finally, I want to remind you that EU policy towards Israel lies in partnership and cooperation."
"A specific question was raised about amendment of accumulation of origin."
"I want to reiterate the statement of the Association Council last November, recalling that in July 2003, at the third Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting, ministers endorsed a new protocol on rules of origin which allows the extension of the pan-European accumulation of origin to the Mediterranean countries."
"The next stage will be amendment of origin protocols in the current bilateral association agreements in order to insert the changes necessary for the application of diagonal accumulation."
"I particularly want to emphasise that the EU notes Israel's support for this project."
"The EU stresses the importance of solving the bilateral issue of rules of origin before the original protocol is amended."
"The EU's position is clear."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the vote.(1)"
". – Mr President, the first amended budget for 2004, which is to be voted on shortly, relates to the accession of the new Member States on 1 May this year."
"The Committee on Budgets has already approved this budget unanimously and, in principle, Parliament as a whole rubberstamped everything as long ago as December last year."
"For legal reasons, we now have to make this official, which can be done presently."
"I should like to point out that the observers in the Committee on Budgets have played a very active and constructive role in drawing up the budget with regard to the new countries, and we as the Committee on Budgets have increased certain payment appropriations."
"Some people in the Council always think that Parliament is too generous when it comes to money and has, so to speak, a hole in its pocket."
"I should like to draw your attention to the fact that with the enlargement through the accession of ten new countries, the percentage of the gross national income that is spent on the European budget is 0.98%, the lowest percentage since 1990."
"This leads me to think that Parliament is good with money."
"If you will be voting ‘yes’ – and I hope that you will do so in large numbers – then nothing will stop us financially from including all new Member States in the European Union on 1 May of this year."
"Mr Mulder, we would never have expected a Dutch rapporteur to have a hole in his pocket!"
"Mr President, the minority opinion that was delivered, in accordance with procedure, in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs does not appear in the Matikainen-Kallström report on the suppression of illicit drug trafficking."
"I would therefore ask that this minority opinion that does not appear in the final text be reinstated into the report."
"Let me check the committee record, but if it was adopted by the committee, then it will be published."
"Mr President, I simply wanted to recall that since 1996, with the Nassuer report, this Parliament has rejected all the Council proposals concerning Europol, because the Council does not agree to communitarise Europol and to finance it with the Community budget."
"This has led to Europol not being subject to any control, whether democratic or jurisdictional."
"Given that the Council is not here and that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is calling, as it has already done, for the Council proposal to be rejected in accordance with Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I ask that we immediately proceed to vote on the proposal."
"Mr Turco, I take note of your suggestion."
". Mr President, scarcely less important than passing wise laws is seeing that they are actually implemented and it is, therefore, encouraging to read the Commission's report, which my report addresses."
"However, as my report suggests, there is a real problem about the non-compliance with Community law among big states."
"The worst example – which is cited in the explanatory statement – concerns the treatment by the Italian State of a group of university lecturers, who, after 14 years, have still not had their rights enforced, despite two resolutions by this House."
"I have just received information that, despite the European Commission's decision to ask the European Court of Justice to impose fines of EUR 309 750 a day, the Italian Parliament has just passed legislation which enhances the illegal discrimination against these citizens."
"I find this outrageous."
"I hope the House will support my report."
". Mr President, I just wanted to ask you and all of us what good the privacy rules are, if even as the European Union we allow them to be completely disregarded."
"My report does not propose amending legislation on privacy, because there is no problem with the legislation, but with its application."
"One example that many of you are familiar with: for a year the European Union and the Member States have allowed the United States security services access to booking terminals for transatlantic flights, with no information, authorisation or control."
"Therefore, many of us get annoyed with the United States when in reality the problem lies with the rules we have and could and should ensure are respected, but which we do not enforce, and Commissioner Vitorino has disclosed that we will shortly be setting up a European system to do the same thing."
"We can therefore see why we do not enforce the rules: because we are already preparing to adopt those mechanisms which infringe privacy."
"I therefore hope that we will unanimously vote for a report condemning these situations."
"The problem is that when it comes to having recourse to the Court of Justice and enforcing the rules, the European Commission, Member States, privacy protection authorities and, I am afraid, also Parliament, prove to be extremely weak and inadequate."
"Mr Cappato, the issue to which you refer – the passenger name records system and data exchange with the United States – will be expressly dealt with under the Boogerd-Quaak report on Wednesday of the next part-session."
"Mr President, I would simply like to tell the House that, in agreement with Mr Turco, there is a correction to the explanatory statement."
". Mr President, I just want to reassure the House that this is largely a tidying-up exercise."
"However, it will, at the same time, provide us with a new ordering for our Rules of Procedure; it will plug a few gaps and deal with a few technicalities that have been spotted and it will allow the newly enlarged Parliament to have a new set of Rules that has been adapted for enlargement, not least pursuant to Rule 180(8)."
"Mr President, the report's title is misleading."
"I would like to say to colleagues that one of the amendments to be voted in relation to the Corbett report proposes a rule that makes it very hard to set up temporary committees."
"This applies to the second vote, so be careful what you do, colleagues."
"I know it is very late, but please take into account that this will mean that good work such as that carried out in this Parliament on the issue would not be possible if we were to adopt this amendment."
"There is a separate vote on that amendment."
"This is voting time, not a debate!"
"Mr President, we are voting on the Paulsen report today. It was only this morning that the amendments to this report became available in all languages."
"I regard this as a very important report and there are a great many amendments."
"I am not in a position to adopt a clear position on this report today, and I therefore request that the vote should be postponed until tomorrow."
"Mr President, we have been in a position to discuss Mrs Paulsen's report since last week."
"The Council has not given us any indication that it still thinks there is any room for manoeuvre."
"I therefore see no reason for postponing the vote today."
"We are well prepared and we also want to vote today."
"Mr President, I think that we are voting now."
"We have had an opportunity to debate, and I have had close contact with the shadow rapporteurs and the groups that have been interested in contact."
"What is the opinion of the chairman of the committee, Mrs Jackson?"
"Mr President, the only observation is that if you postpone this vote today, you will run into the problem that my committee will be producing an avalanche of reports in the future, so it might be as well to deal with it now."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order touched on in the debate this morning."
"It concerns declarations of interest in this House where an interest is a familial one rather than a direct personal one."
"This has been the subject of various newspaper articles, including a leader in the London – which at least to be a serious newspaper."
"Mrs Fourtou has behaved with extreme honour and goodwill throughout, but has been put in the invidious position of bringing forward a report and then being accused of not having declared an interest."
"We must have clarity as to whether and when familial interests have to be declared."
"Mr President, I should like to comment on what Mr MacCormick said."
"The European Ombudsman has asked the Commission to carry out an investigation for the purpose of clarifying these financial declarations."
"I would ask the Commission to reply to the European Ombudsman, for matters are as Mr MacCormick described."
"There are things that are extremely unclear, and these must be clarified when the new Parliament meets."
"I would ask the Commission to reply to the Ombudsman’s enquiry about the same issue."
"Mr MacCormick, you have raised a valid question, which I will bring to the attention of the Bureau, irrespective of what the Commission or other institutions may choose to do."
"Mr President, I wish to point out a linguistic problem with Amendment No 83 before the vote."
"The English version says ‘seizure of the infringing goods’."
"The Italian version says‘seizure of the contentious goods’. Therefore the English version refers to goods which are illegal, and the Italian version refers to those which could be illegal."
"I do not feel we should add, in the hasty way with which we have been forced to act by the procedure followed, a further restriction to measures which already appear restrictive enough."
"The same goes for ‘judicial authorities’, which in English means judges who pass judgment, whereas in Italian, it can also refer to investigating judges."
"We should therefore clarify whether we are also conferring powers of investigating judges, which I hope is not the case, or only powers of adjudicating judges."
"All these issues, without the rush, which we would have had to ..."
"We will make sure that all language versions conform to the English text, which is the original."
"Mr President, I too would like to say, in relation to Amendment No 53, that the English version is the valid text."
"‘Parasitic copies’ is therefore the correct wording."
"I take note of that."
"Once again, we will ensure that all language versions correspond to the original text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council intends to establish a border protection agency."
"This House has developed an alternative model, but we all know that the Council will disregard it."
"Above all, I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Committee on Budgets to the fact that this agency, in addition to the 27 staff working there, is also to be controlled by 27 members of the Management Board and also by an Executive Board consisting of five members."
"The Commission and the Council really are creating a bureaucratic monster here!"
"I wish to ask the Committee on Budgets, before it approves the funding for this agency, to enter into a further in-depth discussion with the Council."
"No matter how much we support progress in this field, we simply cannot work like this in Europe."
"I hope the Committee on Budgets will back us on this."
". Mr President, there is an arrangement with the Socialist Party that Recital G should be deleted and that it should be part of a package including Amendment No 7."
"Now that Amendment No 7 has been approved, the deletion of Recital G should be approved."
"Indeed, Amendment No 2 proposes that Recital G be deleted."
"That concludes the vote."
". I voted in favour of this report, which proposes, without amendments, the approval of a Commission proposal intended to codify Council Decision 78/774/EEC, concerning the activities of certain third countries in the field of cargo shipping."
"This Council decision aims to establish a set of information systems that will enable the various European institutions to be kept informed about activities of the fleets of third countries whose practices could be harmful to the maritime interests of Member States, and, most importantly, about the extent to which these fleets may adversely affect the competitiveness of those of Member States taking part in international maritime trade."
"These systems must also facilitate the provision and consultation of information at intra-Community level."
"So as not to destroy the substance of the acts to be codified, the Commission’s proposal is limited to compiling them and putting them together in one document, subject only to the formal amendments required by the actual codification process."
"This process should also serve as clarification, given that Council Decision 78/774/EEC has been substantially amended several times."
". This report approves the Commission’s proposal for a Regulation, which aims to prepare the countries of the Western Balkans for future accession, by familiarising them with the policies and working methods of the EU."
"More specifically, all natural and legal persons from the Member States covered by Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 are permitted to take part in tenders organised under the pre-accession Community assistance programmes."
"This proposal thus gives added impetus to the stabilisation and association process."
"These measures address what was approved at the Thessaloniki European Council."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
". The introduction of the new financial regulation required basic instruments to be adopted for a number of grants that have been financed to date without needing their own legal basis."
"The purpose of this proposal for a Council and Parliament decision is to establish a Community action programme for Commission grants in the field of protecting the Community’s financial interests – the HERCULE Programme."
"This programme will ultimately finance specific measures and will cover grants to bodies working in this field."
"This report improves the proposal for a decision, and as such deserves our support."
"Firstly, the report is in line with the decisions of the budgetary authority agreed at the end of last year, in other words, an action programme for 2004-2006, which will be funded to the tune of some EUR 12 million."
"It proposes that the grants should subsequently be staggered in line with the aims (technical support, training, exchanges of specialised staff and seminars and conferences) and that reporting by OLAF, on the execution and aims of the current programme, is to be brought forward."
". This proposal for a decision aims to establish a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community’s financial interests (HERCULE Programme), and I am naturally in favour of this."
"This programme covers, on the one hand, grants allocated to occasional activities, such as study schemes, conferences or training and, on the other, operated grants allocated to bodies working in this field, such as associations created to promote the protection of the Community’s financial interests."
"Indeed, the current process of reforming the Commission, and in particular the adoption of the new Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, requires basic instruments to be adopted for a number of grants that have been financed to date without being covered by a specific basic instrument."
"Of the grants that will in future need to be covered by a basic instrument, there are several that have been made by the Commission to protect the Community's financial interests."
"The purpose of this proposal is to establish that basic instrument by setting up a Community action programme for Commission grants in this field."
"The purpose of this proposal is to constitute a basic instrument of this kind, establishing a Community action programme for the allocation of grants by the Commission in this field."
"To be more specific, the measures required in the fields of prevention and combating fraud against the Community’s financial interests, in accordance with the provisions of Article 280 ..."
". In December, Parliament approved the budget for 2004 – both the Community budget for the EU of 15, and, in collaboration with the Council, indicative values for enlargement to ten new Member States."
"The focus was, therefore, on a Community budget for 25, even though enlargement does not actually take place until May."
"The aim of this Draft Amending Budget is to establish fixed amounts for the EU of 25."
"The issue here is not merely technical, yet nor is it primarily procedural."
"The key issue is the content of the first budget of an EU enlarged to include countries in which average incomes per head are substantially lower than the current EU average; a budget with payment spending raised to the level of inflation; the lowest budget, in real terms, since 1987; a budget that is not only incapable of contributing towards economic and social cohesion, but also institutionalises discrimination towards the new Member States; a budget that sets a bad example of Parliament’s role as a budgetary authority, as, year after year, it accepts cuts and redeployments, which, in spite of worthy protests, tally with the objectives of the ‘Charter of the six’."
"This budget does not augur well for the 2007/2013 financial framework."
"It is characterised by political aims that are dominated by the obsession with competitiveness, and in which social issues are replaced by military and security issues."
"It would be difficult for a budget to be any more explicit."
". The forest fires last summer in Portugal left a trail of death and devastation – 11% of forests and 5% of Portuguese territory caught fire."
"This clearly illustrates the need to fund forest fire prevention measures that will preserve the EU’s rich and extensive forest heritage, particularly in southern Member States and the Mediterranean fringe, which are affected by such fires every year."
"Appropriate measures are also required, however, at Community level."
"The new forest protection programme, Forest Focus, which was approved last year and which runs until 2006, includes measures for combating forest pollution."
"Measures required for preventing forest fires, however, are consigned to rural development, thereby undermining the continuity of measures funded thus far."
"It should not be forgotten that, in various resolutions, Parliament has asked for increased funds for the forest protection programme and for fire prevention measures to be included."
"We therefore regret that, when the reference amounts for the programme were being adapted, the opportunity was not taken to consider the needs of enlargement, in order to adjust aims and increase appropriations."
"In spite of the large increase in the forest area of the EU, only EUR 4 million for the ten new Member States has been added to the already paltry EUR 61 million for this period ..."
". During the budgetary procedure for 2004, it was agreed that we would revise the reference amounts for the 29 Community programmes adopted under codecision, in order to take account of the needs of the ten new countries for 2004-2006, since these amounts had only been set for the fifteen current Member States."
"At the conciliation meeting of 24 November, the Council and Parliament reached an agreement to increase reference amounts by EUR 2.58 million, only around EUR 30 million short of Parliament’s original proposals."
"This cannot, however, be seen as a victory, since Parliament’s original proposals were in line with the limits set out by the financial perspectives."
"Many of these programmes adopted under codecision had become underfinanced for the fifteen, and we should have taken the opportunity to make some general corrections to the programmes and, in some cases, to the actual aims themselves."
"We refer to complementary programmes to the actions of Member States in fields such as the sixth research and development programme, the framework programme in favour of culture, Forest Focus for the protection of forests, Life III, public health, youth, education, including Socrates, and many others."
"This report, one of five, validates an agreement that falls short of what is required, with Parliament’s direct complicity, and we condemn this."
". Around 15% of the population of the EU – over 57 million people – live close to the poverty line."
"In Portugal alone, more than two million people – over 20% of the population – live close to the poverty line."
"While nothing is done to alleviate severe income inequality and major unemployment, which affects over 14 million people, the risks of poverty and social exclusion will increase, and will increase still further with enlargement to include ten countries in which the average income is lower than the Community average."
"It is, therefore, regrettable that the Community programme of measures to combat and prevent exclusion receives just EUR 75 million in funding for the 2002-2006 period, in other words, an average of EUR 15 million per year for the current 15 Member States."
"Worse still, the adjustment made to take account of the needs of enlargement is only EUR 10 million, or EUR 2 million per year."
"Parliament’s complicity in this state of affairs is regrettable, given that fighting social exclusion and poverty ought to be one of our key priorities, even bearing in mind the limited objectives of the current programme."
". I voted in favour of the package of Commission proposals before us (one proposal for each type of legislative act in question: decision, decision, regulation, and another on the proposal to adapt the reference amount of the sixth Euratom framework programme) aimed at amending the reference amounts of programmes adopted under codecision, to take account of enlargement."
"By revising the financial perspectives for 2000-2006 to take account of enlargement, Parliament and the Council must – at the end of the budgetary process for 2004 and in line with the process of codecision – revise the reference amounts for programmes adopted under codecision, within the maximum limits of the aforementioned adaptation and revision of the financial perspectives."
"I feel that the extra amount proposed – EUR 2.58 million, on top of the original budget of EUR 26.7 million – meets funding needs arising from the current enlargement process, for this vital package of programmes adopted under codecision and financed under Heading 3 of the financial perspectives (internal policies)."
"Results were in some cases excellent and therefore worthy of the highest praise and, accordingly, of our unequivocal support."
". At present, under the current legislation, when an official vessel of a Member State detects and pursues on the high seas or from the high seas, a vessel suspected of illicit drug trafficking, which is flying the flag of another Member State, it cannot take any action against it without obtaining the prior authorisation of the flag Member State."
"Given the need for prior authorisation and the time taken to obtain this, many anti-drug-trafficking operations end in failure on the high seas."
"The basic aim of the Spanish initiative needs to be viewed against this background."
"That aim is nothing other than to step up cooperation between EU customs administrations in combating trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances by making it possible, in particularly urgent circumstances, for an official vessel of a Member State to take action on the high seas against a vessel flying the flag of another Member State, where there is good reason to believe the vessel is being used for illegal drug trafficking, without having obtained prior authorisation from that Member State."
"While this initiative is restricted to offences arising from illicit drug-trafficking on the high seas and in view of the amendments added by the rapporteur – albeit not all of them welcome, in our view – I voted in favour of this report."
". There has been a dramatic increase in illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in recent decades."
"We therefore need to find fresh ways of combating this type of crime."
"It is important to pay special attention to the situation of the victims of this type of crime."
"They must be afforded protection and help, especially if they are minors or from a similarly vulnerable group."
"These immigrants are exploited by gangmasters, and given their illegal status, it is very difficult for them to escape, since they are often afraid to contact the relevant authorities."
"I endorse this Directive, as I feel that it will make a welcome contribution towards both helping the victims and catching the criminals."
"Short-term residence permits are to be granted to victims of an action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities."
"Overall, the proposed amendments are aimed at improving the situation of the victims."
"The idea has been suggested of a reflection period, to enable them to consider whether or not to cooperate, which may be difficult in view of the difficulties they may have, not only in speaking about their situation, but ..."
". I support the idea of helping victims of human trafficking."
"However, this is not at all what this directive is about."
"It simply forces victims to co-operate with police authorities by means of the threat of expulsion."
"Instead, comprehensive victim protection must ensure a permanent residence permit, thus granting full access to medical and social support without preconditions."
"A clear distinction must be made between 'trafficking in human beings' and the smuggling of migrants."
"Trafficking simply means helping immigrants to illegally enter Fortress Europe – for profit or as a benevolent activity."
"Trafficking is based on a decision to migrate, but it often ends in exceptionally exploitative capitalist conditions of work later."
"'Illegal immigration' is nothing more than the understandable reaction to EU-efforts to fence itself off from migratory flows resulting from global poverty, war and capitalist exploitation."
"'Illegal immigration' is usually the only way to reach EU-territory at all."
"If you really want to help victims of trafficking and exploitation, you should not hide behind the interests of European law enforcement authorities and fob victims off with short-term residence permits."
"Instead, free access to the EU must be part of a free world so that people can move freely."
"The Commission’s communication, on which this report is based, is intended to improve the monitoring of the application of Community law, in view of the need to pre-empt the natural increase in tasks arising from enlargement and to take account of the extension of the Community acquis."
"The Commission proposes various actions designed to improve the monitoring of the application of Community law."
"The communication details what is covered by the prevention carried out in close and reciprocal cooperation between the Commission and the Member States; it then describes the conditions of effective management of monitoring and of how infringements are dealt with, which will become even more significant after enlargement; finally, it looks into the possibility of gradually changing the culture of monitoring, by introducing the dimension of preventing such behaviour."
"There are, of course, both positive and negative aspects to Mr MacCormick’s draft report."
"Among the good points were Recital L: ‘Failure by the Community legislature to achieve good quality in law-making can itself be detrimental to the correct understanding and application of Community law’; and‘its desire to see enhanced cooperation between parliamentarians in the European Parliament and Parliaments of Member States’"
"These points were sufficient for me to vote in favour."
". As the report states, the most effective guarantee of the proper implementation of Community law begins with the quality of its law-making."
"It is only with high-quality legislation that the law can be understood and applied correctly."
"Appropriate monitoring effectively depends on information that is both qualitative – concerning the practices adopted in actually applying the law – and quantitative, reporting on numbers of directives whose transposition or effective application is delayed by reference to established deadlines, or otherwise deficient."
"It is important to underline, as regards this measure, the importance of close and reciprocal cooperation between the Commission and the Member States."
"As the Commission’s communication rightly points out, simply punishing infringements will not be sufficient; it is also essential that we prevent such infringements before they happen."
"Such pre-emptive action must involve closer collaboration with national parliaments and meticulous compliance with the principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and appropriateness."
". The question of biological and chemical agent attacks against EU Member States has been the subject of debate, particularly since the terrorist attacks of 11 September."
"A joint programme has been adopted, which is intended to improve cooperation between Member States in the areas of evaluating chemical risks, alerts, intervention, the storage of means of intervention and in the field of research."
"We must, however, be realistic and rational with regard to the measures that we decide to take were we to be faced with the threat of this type of attack."
"I feel that the adoption of budgetary and legal initiatives must be based on a clear risk analysis demonstrating a genuine probability of terrorist attacks in the EU."
"Consequently, I support the recommendation that a realistic analysis should be carried out of the threat posed, which will form the basis of an EU response."
"This will make use of European cooperation between national police forces involving Europol and take into consideration the results of cooperation between intelligence services in the fight against terrorism."
". This question achieved almost complete consensus in committee, with only two Members voting against."
"The report aims to improve preparedness and response to biological and chemical agent attacks."
"It concludes that an effective system against such attack would be based on four pillars: effective early warning system; effective reporting system; a well-developed public health care system; and emergency planning in the event of a disaster."
"What is in fact required is an effective response framework in the event of a disaster, way beyond being a mere stockpile of vaccines, which may seem at first glance to be a simple solution, but which offers no guarantee of success."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Since the events of 11 September, terrorism has become a genuine threat."
"Due to its unpredictable nature, combating terrorism must take the form of prevention."
"I congratulate Mr Schmid on his report, but I should also like to suggest a somewhat different approach; measures should be taken actually to thwart biological and chemical attacks."
"Citizens will be safe from terrorist attacks of any type, if such attacks could be neutralised in time."
". The report before us poses such a vast array of questions that it would be impossible to cover everything in this short explanation of vote."
"Nonetheless, while I do not agree with the thrust of some premises and proposals contained therein, the report deserves praise for the criticisms it makes of the current repression of rights and of safeguards of privacy and the protection of personal data – as a consequence of measures adopted in certain countries under the pretext of the ‘fight against terrorism’ – which are undermining fundamental rights and freedoms."
"I should like to highlight criticism in the report of the agreement being negotiated between the EU and the USA concerning the transfer of transatlantic passengers’ personal data, which it deems illegal."
"The report also criticises the attitude of the Commission and of some Member States ‘to connive at this violation of the law and the principle of legality’."
"As a result, personal data are, without informing and obtaining the consent of the data subject, transferred or accessed directly or systematically by a third party."
"I should also like to point out the need for effective monitoring of Europol and Eurojust, the concern with strengthening SIS and with projects to extend the capacities and competences to SIS II and the anxiety regarding the development of the use of personal biometric data."
". While I do not agree with the wording of certain parts of this report, I feel that the report does contain a set of proposals intended to uphold the dignity of people held in the various EU countries, to improve the conditions in which they are held and to help them to reintegrate into society."
"The report begins with an alarming picture of the situation in various parts of the EU in terms of aspects such as prison overcrowding, the increase in the prison population, the increase in the number of detainees awaiting definitive sentencing, drug addiction and rising suicide rates."
"The report makes various general recommendations, which I welcome. Among these are the prisoner’s right to have access to a lawyer, the prisoner’s right to health and safety, to decent conditions of detention, to professional and social reintegration; the recommendation of protection for juveniles and special protection for pregnant women and mothers of young children; and the recommendation that prison staff should receive training and enjoy decent working conditions."
"If implemented, these recommendations will help to solve the serious problems that exist."
".– Prison conditions in Europe are alarming; the report before us today highlights the increase in the prison population, overcrowding, the increase in the numbers of foreign prisoners and the increase in the number of prisoners awaiting sentence."
"A Council of Europe report also refers to the persistence of ill treatment and unsuitable and insufficient prison buildings, as well as mentioning the inadequate activities and care provided, and of the increase in drug addiction."
"I support the drafting of a European Prisons Charter containing binding rules for Member States."
"We call on the Member States to release funds to modernise prisons and to provide more suitable training for the police and prison staff."
"We propose more widespread use of alternatives to prison sentences. We would also like to increase opportunities for Members of the European Parliament to visit prisons."
"All the amendments I tabled in committee were adopted. They seek to strengthen several aspects of the report."
"All inmates must be able to take part in schemes designed to help them reintegrate back into society, so that fewer of them re-offend."
"It is essential to strengthen measures to prevent violence between fellow prisoners and prevent suicide."
"Special protection must be given to juveniles and women, particularly pregnant women and mothers of young children."
". I am, naturally, in favour of the fundamental rights of prisoners and I am aware of problems such as overcrowding, the rates of death, suicide and ill-treatment and the inadequate nature of prison facilities, which force us to consider the need to take certain measures in this area."
"This area, however, is strictly a competence of the Member States."
"Consequently, due to the subsidiarity principle, I voted against."
". The common position submitted by the Council tallies with the positions previously adopted by Parliament."
"It does, however, contain two points that we should like to see amended, so that the second phase of the Daphne Programme (2004-2008), which is already some months behind schedule, may get under way."
"Firstly, the Council’s proposal places too much emphasis on the perpetrators of violence, which creates a further target group on the same level as the victims of violence."
"We endorse the need to set up treatment programmes that are also aimed at perpetrators of violence, and as such we ask that these should be referred to only in the paragraph on treatment programmes that are aimed both at victims and people at risk and at those who have perpetrated violence."
"The second point is the establishment of a support centre for NGOs, so that they may be able to improve their projects, set up links with other partners and enjoy the benefits of the Daphne acquis."
"The provision of technical support is essential during this second phase of the programme, especially for those NGOs taking part for the first time, in other words, those from the new Member States."
". Even though most of Parliament’s proposals on extending the Daphne Programme until 2008 had already been accepted, and even after funding had been increased to EUR 50 billion, we voted in favour of the rapporteur’s position."
"We must implore the Commission to maintain the balance of its proposal with regard to victims and attackers, and to ensure that these are not placed on the same level."
"We also agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to ensure that new Member States can also benefit from this programme, not least through the creation of a support centre aimed at helping NGOs to plan their projects and establish links, especially those taking part for the first time."
"It is essential, however, that governments in Member States pay particular attention to this problem and do not leave the violence prevention campaign solely to the NGOs."
"Indeed, a recent programme on a French television channel criticised the fact that no awareness-raising campaign against violence has been launched on that channel."
"There is such a campaign in Spain, yet more than sixty women have died in previous years, and this year is following a similar pattern."
"Portugal is in exactly the same situation as Spain."
". This Parliament has long supported the development of the second phase of this programme designed to fight violence against women and children and to combat trafficking of human beings with a special focus on women and girls who might fall victim to abuse."
"The fact that the Council has given its support to this programme and has taken on board some of this Parliament's strengthening amendments (including the increase in budget) is to be welcomed."
"I support the Women's Rights Committee's text and trust that the plenary will accept a well balanced report which should ensure that the new Member States can fully benefit and that their specific needs will be taken into consideration."
". – On the day after the day devoted to women’s rights, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament is also taking this issue to heart."
"No fewer than three reports on the subject are to be put to the vote today."
"Unfortunately, however, the reports only contain general and commonplace statements."
"The report on combating violence against children, young people and women is no exception."
"To combat this type of violence effectively, it is necessary to focus on those who perpetrate violence, not just on the victims."
"Above all, it is essential to be able to understand the social, family, economic or even religious reasons why individuals lose control and resort to violence. In truth, all this report does is to state that there has been an exponential rise in these types of violence."
"It fails to deal with the real causes of such behaviour. In fact, all this violence tends to result from the same causes."
"Violence against women cannot be eliminated without addressing the factors that contribute, directly or indirectly, to women being in a submissive position."
"I am thinking particularly of the status of women in Islam. In Islam, women are perceived as inferior and submissive."
"Under no circumstances are women’s rights a secondary consideration."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in today's vote on the copyright directive I voted for Amendments Nos 101 or 55 and 53."
"What is involved here, to all intents and purposes, is the introduction of stronger copyright laws through the back door, further strengthening the hand of large suppliers, while, as a consequence, many small suppliers will be unable to operate successfully in the marketplace."
"The reason being that they cannot afford long-drawn-out procedures and patent rights."
"What is at issue here, moreover, is the scope of the directive, which is intended to cover breaches of copyright."
"I believe that this applies when we are talking about commercial objectives with direct and indirect economic advantages."
"That is why I voted for Amendment No 53."
