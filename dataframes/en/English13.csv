"Text"
"That is clearly demonstrated by the texts submitted to the IGC, despite the extreme difficulty of the subject matter, and I really do sense a genuine determination to succeed on the part of the Fifteen."
"Good progress has been made on qualified majority voting, which could be extended to another thirty areas, if some Member States make the effort to confirm this."
"Some countries still have major problems regarding the coordination of social security systems, tax, asylum, visa and immigration matters and trade negotiations on services - a very important issue."
"But we will approach Nice with a positive attitude, determined to make progress as many aspects of these sensitive issues as possible."
"The role of the European Parliament is naturally one of the important elements in the debate."
"In many areas where qualified majority voting would be introduced the move to codecision already has majority support, and that goes a long way towards meeting your expectations."
"The Fifteen are now close to agreement on making enhanced cooperation more flexible."
"You discussed this on 24 October, and on several points the Intergovernmental Conference is reaching solutions close to those advocated by Parliament."
"The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause allowing appeal to the European Council, which currently constitutes a real right of veto, would be replaced by a power of retrieval."
"Parliament has made proposals on its role in triggering enhanced cooperation in the Community sphere."
"These will be discussed."
"As regards the CFSP, several Member States have emphasised its specific nature which, in their view, warrants special mechanisms, and they have been stressing that particularly in the last few days."
"We will be discussing this at next Sunday' s conclave."
"On the Commission, two options were on the table at Biarritz: capping the number of Commissioners, or a Commission made up of one representative from each Member State."
"But a third solution has emerged from the negotiations which might allow everyone' s concerns to be taken into account."
"This would involve setting a ceiling on the Commission, to come into play once enlargement reaches a certain numerical level."
"That ceiling would be linked to a system of equal rotation."
"This at least provides a serious avenue to be explored in Nice, one that still remains to be defined and clarified but on which a clear majority of the delegations is ready to work. Progress has also been made on increasing the powers of the President of the Commission and a possible increase in the number of Vice-Presidents."
"Finally on the weighting of votes in the Council, there are also two main options on the table since the Biarritz declaration: either a double majority or a simple reweighting."
"There is perceptible movement - I say that with caution because several Member States may not yet have determined their final position - but support has begun to emerge for a simple reweighting whose exact scope and conditions remain to be defined, of course."
"Several scenarios have been considered and studies carried out."
"It will be up to the European Council to decide."
"Let me add that we have not yet reached agreement on the distribution of seats in the European Parliament."
"Your own proposal has obviously been submitted by the Presidency and is one of the two options on the table."
"There too, a solution will have to be found at Nice."
"To end this brief report on the negotiations, we have also made good progress on strengthening Article 7 of the Treaty which should in future provide for an early warning system in the event of a threatened violation of the European Union' s fundamental principles."
"On the other hand, the idea of a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6, championed by the European Parliament in its recommendation of 14 November, and placed on the table at the IGC by the French Presidency, was vigorously rejected by several Member States."
"Some even asserted that such a reference would jeopardise the Charter' s proclamation."
"It may be regrettable, but I have to recognise the position."
"Finally, a word on the Court of Justice."
"The work is almost complete."
"All the delegations agree on giving the European Parliament the possibility of seeking the Court' s opinion on a draft international agreement."
"On the other hand, even though the Presidency has also proposed extending to Parliament the right of appeal to the Court under Article 230, several delegations are against that at this stage."
"I want to be as objective as possible about the situation before this very important Council."
"In Nice, as you know, our aim is to achieve a good agreement, which naturally means compromise, but compromise that is constructive, not regressive."
"At Nice, the Heads of State and Government and the ministers will devote all the time that is necessary to that discussion."
"They have even arranged for the Council to continue through Sunday if that is absolutely essential."
"Finding an agreement which will enable the Union to operate after the new accessions currently in active preparation is vital for the future of the European Union and indeed the enlarged Union."
"The Nice European Council will also be tackling other major issues on which the French Presidency has worked with a great deal of determination."
"First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I am glad the European Parliament approved the Convention' s draft by a large majority. It was also accepted by the Heads of State and Government in Biarritz."
"The conditions are now in place for the proclamation of this Charter by the three institutions at Nice."
"We will therefore have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the Cologne European Council and the European Union will have at its disposal a very strong benchmark, clearly setting out the rights and values in which it believes."
"The discussion on a possible legal status for this Charter will be pursued after Nice and could form part of a broader, longer term debate on the future of the European Union."
"The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement."
"You yourselves debated this on 3 October."
"As you know, back in July, the French Presidency asked the Commission to step up the accession negotiations and move forward to the crucial issues, the heart of the matter, the problem areas, and prepare a detailed assessment of each candidate' s state of preparedness, the progress of all the negotiations and problems still to be resolved by and for each country."
"Our objective was to prepare an overview of the process and decide how to take it forward from this point."
"At the General Affairs Council of 20 November we had a very good debate based on the excellent documents the Commission had forwarded to the Council."
"I think the stepping up of the negotiations has been widely welcomed and at the next General Affairs Council, and then at the European Council, we will be able to adopt a clear and ambitious line for the continuation of the discussions on the basis of the principles set in Helsinki, which should lead directly to the desired outcome."
"At Nice, the European Council will be preceded by a summit meeting of the European Conference."
"A meeting of that conference has just taken place at ministerial level, at Sochaux."
"At the Nice meeting there will be an exchange of views with all the candidate countries on the reform of the European Union' s institutions, and more generally on the outlook for the future of Europe."
"Your President is invited, of course."
"By bringing the existing Member States of the European Union and the countries which will eventually belong to it together around one table, I believe the European Conference plays a unique and valuable role."
"I hope we can profit from it even more in the future, notably by opening it up to other European countries."
"A brief mention of the European defence system: some important decisions will be submitted to the European Council, but I will come back to that later, in the debate on Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report."
"Finally, the Nice European Council will reflect the priority the French Presidency accords to economic and social issues and all the issues where the European Union can really respond to the concerns of Europeans."
"The many statements the Presidency has presented before Parliament have clearly demonstrated this priority."
"Several goals had in fact already been set under the Portuguese Presidency, in Lisbon and Feira."
"They should be fulfilled, in economic terms, by building on the efforts to make the European Union give greater priority to growth and employment."
"The Lisbon European Council approved guidelines designed to promote an innovative and competitive European economy."
"The aim was, in particular, to enrich the broad economic policy guidelines and ensure better coordination with the employment guidelines."
"So a report will be passed to the European Council which will finalise the definition of performance indicators in spheres such as employment, innovation, economic reform and social cohesion."
"Similarly, employment guidelines are to be forwarded to the European Council together with an Autumn 2000 employment package."
"As you know, last Monday the Ecofin Council reached a decisive agreement on fiscal harmonisation."
"These matters had been under discussion for several months, not to say several years, arousing strong reservations on the part of some Member States."
"So this is a very important step forward by the whole Fifteen, and the European Council will certainly take formal note of it."
"The development of Europe' s social dimension is a vital complement to the considerable advances on the economic front."
"In this sphere, following on from Lisbon, the French Presidency made the adoption of the social agenda one of its priorities."
"The Presidency invited all the institutions concerned - this Parliament, but equally the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, European social partners and the intergovernmental organisations - to contribute to drawing up this agenda."
"This social agenda, largely inspired by a Commission communication, was approved yesterday by the Employment and Social Affairs Council."
"This has been a good week for working conditions in Europe."
"The social agenda draws together the objectives and initiatives which need to be taken over the next five to ten years, particularly in the areas of labour law, social protection, social mobility, lifelong training, and the fight against discrimination and exclusion."
"It will be forwarded to Nice, where we naturally hope it will be endorsed."
"The protection of employees' rights and improvement of their working conditions have also been high on the French Presidency' s agenda."
"The European Council will thus be informed of the state of progress of the negotiations on the directive on the information and consultation of workers, and on the European company project, assuming these issues have not already been settled by then, as unfortunately they are running into persistent opposition."
"Following on from Lisbon, the French Presidency had also set itself the objective of strengthening Europe' s knowledge-based society."
"Here the Council has approved a plan of action to remove obstacles to the mobility of students, teachers and researchers."
"This action plan will also be forwarded to the Nice European Council. So you can see that I am certainly not exaggerating when I say we have an important agenda and a very full agenda for the Nice Council."
"Moreover, on the basis of the Feira conclusions for the implementation of a Commission Action Plan ""e-Europe 2002 - an information society for all"" , the Council has worked on progress indicators."
"A report on the measures the Presidency has taken in this area will be presented to the European Council in Nice."
"Consumer protection is an increasing concern for Europeans, for obvious reasons which I need not expand upon."
"The French Presidency set itself the objective of improving the definition of the precautionary principle."
"A group was therefore set up at the beginning of the presidency' s term in order to work on this."
"The resulting resolution will be examined tomorrow by the Internal Market Council, again with a view to the Nice Council."
"Current events mean that the subject of food safety and, in particular, the establishment of an independent European food agency will be discussed extensively by the Heads of State and Government in Nice."
"Another increasing source of concern for Europeans, related to the development of maritime traffic and the occasional disadvantages arising form this, is the safety of maritime transport."
"A first package of measures was approved at the October Transport Council."
"The Biarritz European Council took note of the Commission report on the necessary additional measures."
"I know that the European Parliament is working on the first package."
"You know, moreover, the importance which Member States attach to adopting texts quickly."
"Without prejudice to Parliament' s prerogatives, the Presidency has in addition called for the implementation of these measures to be brought forward, where possible."
"This entire area must be given fresh political impetus in Nice with a view to the final Transport Council on 20 and 21 December, for it is true that the French Presidency does not come to an end in Nice."
"The French Presidency wished to support the updating of the Commission' s 1996 communication on the services of general economic interest with some consideration of the place of public services or, to use the accepted term, general interest services in Europe."
"The Presidency wanted to restate the basic principles governing the Community' s approach in this area, including primarily the freedom of Member States to define and organise their own public services while respecting the rules of the Treaty."
"These principles will be highlighted in a statement which the Presidency wishes to annex to the Nice conclusions."
"Finally, we have prepared a statement for the European Council on the specific economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social functions in Europe."
"You can see that we have a very full discussion programme for Nice."
"Your President will naturally have the opportunity to express the views of your institution on all these subjects and to discuss them with the Heads of State and Government."
"Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, next week the European Council meets in Nice."
"This summit gives the Heads of State and Government an historic opportunity that they cannot afford to miss."
"It will, indeed, provide the opportunity to address a range of issues: to focus on the road map for enlargement, to consolidate the Lisbon process and a social agenda and to proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"These are all important issues, but today, at your suggestion, I want to focus on the important decisions to be taken in Nice."
"There are several aspects to this debate, and I will touch briefly on three of them: firstly, the need to close the Intergovernmental Conference by adopting a treaty that has genuine added value; secondly, our security policy on crisis management; and finally, the need to mark out the way beyond Nice."
"First, then, a new treaty."
"The primary purpose of a new treaty is to ensure that the Union will continue to be able to function after enlargement."
"Our institutions, originally designed for six Member States, will soon have to manage a Union nearly five times that size."
"We must be ready for this dramatic enlargement."
"Any left-overs from Nice would hamper our progress. We require the candidate countries to meet all the criteria before accession: we too must live up to our obligations."
"This means ensuring that the Union can take effective and democratic decisions which fulfil the expectations of Europe's citizens."
"Throughout last winter, the Commission devoted a lot of energy to explaining why and on what specific issues the initial agenda of the IGC was to be extended."
"In particular, in our written opinion at the end of January, we established the minimum degree of ambition necessary to secure a successful outcome for the Conference."
"I am now pleased to say that the negotiators are close to an agreement on the provisions governing, for example, closer cooperation, the Court of Justice, the democratic values of Article 7 and deepening the involvement of European political parties in the democratic life of our Member States and institutions."
"I sense that we are approaching a reasonable compromise on the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council."
"Provided that a number of basic principles are respected, I believe that the Conference can go ahead and reach an agreement on those issues that satisfies the expectations and needs of both large and small countries."
"Whatever the number of Commissioners, the important thing is to give the President of the Commission all the powers needed to run the College effectively."
"Similarly, any change in the weighting of votes in the Council must also guarantee that decisions cannot be taken against the will of the majority of Member States."
"And the simplest and best way to do so is through a double majority system, even if we are aware of the difficulties this will entail."
"So we are slowly moving in the right direction."
"However, there is one issue on which our lack of progress causes me great concern, and in the view of both our institutions, it is the single most important issue facing us as we prepare for enlargement. It is the issue of qualified majority voting."
"If the Union is to be effective, the Conference must make substantial progress on this, and that also means extending the codecision procedure."
"(Applause)Member States naturally find it politically difficult to give up the right of veto in sensitive areas such as social policy, asylum and immigration, common trade policy, cohesion and taxation, even when this relates only to the technical changes necessary to make the single market work."
"However, if everybody sticks to their position, we will all be worse off."
"Indeed, mathematics and 50 years of experience show beyond a doubt that even modest enlargements make it far more difficult to reach unanimous agreements."
"In a Union of 27 or more Member States, the unanimity requirement will, quite simply, paralyse progress in every area where it is maintained."
"Mark my words: if the Member States' veto on justice and home affairs is maintained, we shall be severely delayed in implementing the programme agreed at Tampere or even unable to do so."
"And I shall say so loud and clear to the Heads of States and Government at Nice. They must be under no illusions about this."
"The particularly sensitive areas I have been talking about include trade policy."
"This is a subject I would like to dwell on for a moment, because the House made a point of highlighting it on today's agenda."
"As you know, modern economic activity revolves around services."
"Under the present rules, certain aspects of negotiations on services are covered by the unanimity requirement, precisely because our Treaties were originally commercial treaties governing goods and not services."
"The problem currently plaguing our trade policy is that, because negotiations cover a wide range of sectors, including services, any progress whatsoever in goods as well as service sectors is almost inevitably held up by unanimity voting."
"Our trading partners or, in some cases, we could say our adversaries, are delighted because they can count on 15 potential vetos, and, with enlargement, there will soon be many more."
"The situation is then made even worse on those occasions when one of the Member States places conditions, sometimes financial conditions, on its assent."
"The simple and natural solution - and this has, in fact, been a majority view during the Conference - would be to change the present rules so that qualified majority voting applies to all aspects of such negotiations, including services."
"Regrettably, the Conference's existing text is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long with its two Protocols, and yet, despite its length and complexity, it is also very weak."
"It does not provide the simple answer we need to the simple problem we have been facing for so long."
"Much remains to be done if we are to find a suitable solution."
"For us, the final outcome of Nice will depend largely on the conclusions reached by qualified majority voting."
"I am committed to doing whatever it takes to reach an agreement that provides added value."
"Inevitably, the question we shall be asked the next morning is: ""Are you satisfied with the outcome?"""
"The Commission will answer that question frankly and directly."
"At the next plenary session in Strasbourg, I shall tell this House whether, in my view, the enlarged Union we are all determined to achieve will be able to act effectively or not."
"When all is said and done, that is the criterion by which Nice must be judged."
"(Applause)"
"Important decisions will be taken in Nice to ensure that the European Union is able to assume its own responsibilities in the world."
"The prevention of conflict and crisis management are traditional areas of Community activity."
"It is our task to fulfil our commitments against the backdrop of new ambitious objectives which the Union has set itself."
"This means that the Union must develop an autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO itself is not involved, to launch and conduct military operations under Union command in response to international crises."
"In this connection, it will be particularly useful to develop fruitful cooperation between the European Union, the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"I would stress that this in no way detracts from the fact that, for the Member States concerned, NATO remains the basis of the collective defence of its members and will continue to play an important role in crisis management."
"As we saw in Kosovo, crisis management is not just about imposing a cease-fire. It is also about keeping warring factions apart, rescuing and evacuating European Union citizens, caring for large numbers of refugees, supplying food and medicine, imposing and maintaining law and order, restoring calm after chaos."
"However, crises do not usually erupt overnight. They are the culmination of a process of rising tension in a country or region."
"Therefore, one of the key aims of our common foreign and security policy must be to defuse tension and prevent it form turning into armed conflict."
"The Community already has many tools for this job. We have had them for a long time."
"For example, almost all our external aid programmes are geared to supporting democracy and stability."
"What we have to do is coordinate them better and make them more effective, and that is why the Commission is in the process of adopting the necessary internal measures."
"The Commission is convinced that only an integrated approach to crises can guarantee the consistency and efficiency necessary for the Union to be able to play its full role on the international scene."
"Crisis management requires the Community to show an increased capacity to react, but this must be translated into action in a way that fully respects our institutional framework as established by the Treaties."
"We will, of course, need to cooperate with the other institutions and with the High Representative for the CFSP."
"In any case, we will have to make decisions about this framework now, because a crisis is the worst possible moment to set attributions and responsibilities."
"The discussion which took place within the Conference itself demonstrated that there were issues that were ripe for debate after Nice: the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Community legal system, as Mr V√©drine said; the reorganisation of the Treaties on the basis of existing texts to present the aims and working methods of the Union to the public in a clearer way; making a clear distinction between the competences of the Union and the competences of the Member States; and last, but by no means least, if I am not mistaken about the tone of the debate and about the outlook for Europe's future, the issue of what the balance between the European Union's institutions should look like in the future, in the spirit of an institutional model, the Community model, which has stood the test of time."
"We will undoubtedly have much to do after Nice, but that we will have to leave until later."
"For now, let us look to the immediate future under the French Presidency and focus on the priority of bringing Nice to a conclusion and paving the way to enlargement."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, may I say to the President of the Council that his country is confronted by a Herculean task, both as the EU presidency and as the French Republic."
"It has been stressed on several occasions - and I can endorse everything that President Prodi has said - that a formidable challenge awaits you on the issue of majority voting."
"If the reports are correct, France is the country that is still hesitant about a switch to majority voting on matters relating to trade in services."
"Mr President of the Council, how can you expect Germany to give ground on asylum and immigration policies?"
"How can you expect Spain to give ground on the cohesion issue?"
"How can you expect Austria to give ground on transport policy?"
"How do you expect the United Kingdom to give ground on fiscal policy, when the presidency, the French Republic, is not budging?"
"I urge you to move forward, so that you can encourage others to follow suit."
"If an acceptable outcome is not achieved on these issues, we shall not hesitate to specify exactly where the responsibility lies in the wake of the Nice summit."
"We also believe that, with regard to issues on which we fail to agree to majority decision-making at this stage, you could lay down in the Treaty that the switch to majority voting may be made by a unanimous decision of the Council, for if it is enshrined in the Treaties in that way, there will be no need to revise the Treaties and engage in a lengthy ratification process for each and every extension of majority voting."
"You spoke of codecision by the European Parliament."
"I welcome that on all issues which are subject to majority voting."
"But this means that the right of codecision must also apply to fundamental matters of European agricultural policy, where majority decision-making already exists."
"On the reweighting of voting rights in the Council of Ministers, I emphatically endorse what Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, has said about the double majority being a democratic system, and it really ought to be an acceptable option for the French Republic to operate in this way in its relations with another Member State in a particular coordination process."
"So we do need a reweighting of voting rights with a view to ensuring that a majority of states which are home to a minority of the European population cannot ultimately make the rules; the unequivocal democratic principle must certainly prevail here."
"We have been astonished to see the way in which the large countries have practised a policy of arrogance in recent months - and the term is not my own but has been used quite frequently by members of my group from smaller countries."
"The large nations have seen fit to exert pressure on the smaller ones so that the latter will agree to give up their permanent representation on the Commission."
"May I say to the President of the Council that it is certainly possible to discuss rotating membership of the Commission, but the small Member States' permanent seat on the Commission will only become negotiable once the office of President of the Commission has been strengthened, once he has been given the right to dismiss a Member of the Commission, for example. What we need now in the first instance is for the Commission to be strengthened as an organ of the Community; if you do that and furnish proof that we are not regressing into mere intergovernmental cooperation, if you strengthen the Commission, we can then start thinking one day about how to create a new system of representation."
"But we must heed this warning: respect the dignity of the small countries, because the small countries have always borne the brunt of disputes between major powers throughout the history of our continent; for that reason, we must uphold the dignity of Europe's small countries."
"(Applause)"
"As far as enhanced cooperation is concerned, I agree with what you have said."
"We are pleased that the secretariats are no longer on the agenda, and even our British friends, who normally adopt quite different positions to the majority of our group on questions of institutional development - while still remaining good friends - fully subscribe to our view that these secretariats must not be created but that all cooperation between Member States must be conducted within the framework of Community procedures."
"The Commission must be involved, Parliament must have a say, and nobody may be excluded."
"Finally, let me deal with the question of the Charter."
"The majority of our group take the view that the Charter should not only be ceremonially proclaimed but should also become European law."
"I know and regret that this will not be achieved in Nice."
"Further steps, however, will have to follow."
"We shall arrive at a result in Nice, Mr President of the Council, but let me say categorically that, if we only obtain a minimal result, the words of President Jacques Chirac will be fulfilled and we shall have no treaty."
"If the result is a poor treaty, a rather unambitious, minimalist treaty that does not lay sound foundations for enlargement of the European Union, the failure of Nice should be admitted and the baton handed over to the Swedes and later to the Belgians so that we can then achieve a result which, if all goes well, will be a good basis for enlargement."
"We truly desire a result in Nice, but it must be a result that sets out ambitious aims, and my wish for you is that we achieve such a result, that we set an agenda which transcends Nice and focuses on issues such as the basic governmental structure of Europe and the division of powers, in other words what the responsibilities of the Union are and what are matters for the individual nation states."
"This is something else that we need for the future."
"One last remark, which I make with absolutely no polemical undertone, is that in Strasbourg in January 1995 I heard Fran√ßois Mitterrand speaking."
"As we all know, he belonged to your family of political parties, and when I follow some of the party congresses in your country, I often wish that the European enthusiasm of Fran√ßois Mitterrand could be found in his successors."
"I wish you some of that enthusiasm, so that we can obtain a good result in Nice, a good result for all of us and for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the progress report of the President-in-Office of the Council, and now we are entering the home straight."
"I would like to make an appeal to the President of the Council, because we in the European Parliament are not mere spectators to what is happening; we are key players and we want Nice to be a success. Having heard your report, however, we must express our deep concern at the state of progress in the Intergovernmental Conference, especially given the objective of making possible an urgent commitment - enlargement - and, furthermore, making our institutions function in a democratic and effective way."
"I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will not object if I remind him of an occasion when the French Presidency, under President Mitterrand, was able to produce a final flourish: the Strasbourg Council at the end of 1989."
"I hope that now the French Presidency, under President Chirac, a fellow member of Mr Poettering' s group, will be able to do the same thing."
"I am going to refer to two positive points of progress."
"I am pleased with the progress that is being made in Article 7, in Article 191, with regard to the European political parties and to qualified majority voting in certain articles."
"Nevertheless - and I refer to what the President said - firstly, we are very concerned because, in an Intergovernmental Conference in which Parliament is not asking much, many things are being denied us."
"I would like the Council to comment on the fact that the cooperation procedure is being replaced by consultation in relation to economic policy (Article 99(5)), and yet unanimity is being maintained in Article 13 (anti-discrimination)."
"With regard to enhanced cooperation, we believe that in the first pillar there should be assent from Parliament and, in commercial policy, I repeat our concern and our request for a strengthening, not a weakening, of Community competence."
"Secondly, we believe that there should not only be progress with regard to qualified majority voting, but that there should always be codecision in relation to legislative issues."
"With regard to the composition and functioning of the three institutions, my Group agrees with the proposal of the joint resolution."
"We believe that Parliament, the Commission and the Council must have a joint and global solution based on dual legitimacy, which is able to ensure a balance."
"We cannot reach a balanced solution for one institution and leave another aside."
"I would like to say to Mr Poettering, who has become the advocate for the so-called small countries, that we are all small here, Mr Poettering, there is no large country: if there were one large one it would try to dominate the others."
"I would have preferred it if what he asked of the Council had been advocated by his Group when we discussed the distribution of seats in Parliament."
"(Applause)I am going to refer specifically to an issue which is of great concern to Parliament - I noticed that the President of the Commission made no reference to it - which is the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This is an absolutely key issue."
"Every day we talk about the fact that we have to be closer to the citizens."
"The document which brings us closer to the citizens and which offers them guarantees, not only to the citizens here but also to those who may join us through enlargement, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We feel proud of this Charter and we do not understand the kind of negotiation that permits statements such as those which the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to, i.e. if we insist that the Charter is linked to the Treaties, then that is going to negatively affect its proclamation."
"I believe that this would even go back on what was agreed in Biarritz."
"I think this is completely unacceptable and, of course, it is a good argument in favour of ending the closed door method for the Intergovernmental Conferences, which has had its day, so that we can hold discussions in public and find out who could say such scandalous things."
"(Applause)"
"I also hope that the President will not mind if I repeat that we believe it is important that we can advocate the Charter with dignity, regardless of what we do after Nice."
"Then we will even be able to discuss - as suggested by President Chirac in the Bundestag, not here - the European Constitution."
"We are prepared to do that and we believe that it may be an important step, but, of course, let us take steps forward, not backwards."
"Madam President, I would like to make a final comment in relation to international policy."
"I listened carefully to what the President-in-Office of the Council said and I believe it is important that we maintain a sustained effort in relation to the dramatic situation in the Middle East and I would also like to welcome the progress that has been made in our foreign, security and defence policy."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I believe that we must make an appeal - and I do not wish to be over-dramatic - for Nice to be acceptable to everybody."
"I must of course say that we would pay a heavy price if in Nice we approve agreements in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been thrown in the dustbin."
"(Applause)"
"I agree totally with the sentiment of President Prodi that this is an historic opportunity and one that should not be lost."
"The Summit at Nice bears a responsibility for Europe and should in part fulfil a contract which we made at Helsinki last December and which we should deliver on."
"Two things were said at Helsinki to candidate states in Europe."
"Two locks were placed on the door of enlargement."
"One was that those candidate states themselves must adopt and implement the 'acquis communautaire'; that is their task shared with us."
"The second lock on the door is that we ourselves, as fifteen, needed to recognise the fundamental need to reform how we do business in order to continue to do business effectively, indeed to begin to do business even more effectively than at present."
"That is the unavoidable and minimum requirement of Nice and it is a major and central target."
"We in this Parliament will be required at the end of that process to give or not to give our assent."
"It is a major responsibility."
"I speak for a group which is totally committed to the earliest feasible enlargement of the European Union."
"I also say that we will listen with great care to what Mr Prodi and the Commission say by way of analysis of the Nice Treaty and to the candour which he promises."
"We ourselves will go through a very candid analysis."
"My appeal to you, Mr President-in-Office, is to present us in this Parliament a document worthy of this Parliament's assent and a document worthy of the scale of the historic challenge we face in Europe."
"That challenge is the reunification of our old continent; that challenge is an enlargement unparalleled in scale and that is what Nice must prepare us for."
"To do less than that is to fail Europe and this House, when it reviews Nice, cannot allow Europe to fail."
"I should like to say, with regard to a number of the specific points, that my group believes that, at this stage of evolution of the European Union, having one national for each Member State of the Commission still remains a sensible proposition and enhances the legitimacy of the Union."
"It should not become an issue which traduces the Union into a false contest between the interests of the large and the small, when the common European interest should be the central goal."
"My group, at this stage, would prefer a reweighting of votes, the double majority, but you have explained that other issues are under review."
"We support enhanced cooperation but insist that it must be open-ended and open to all and not exclusive and must be based and rooted in a way which respects the 'acquis communautaire'."
"We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want simply to declaim the Charter."
"If we proclaim it as something with meaning, it must find roots, and we still commend to you to root it in Article 6."
"We commend to you to give the proclamation a meaning in substance, even if it is not yet fully and completely in such a case judiciable."
"We support the review of Article 7 because the Austrian lesson has taught the need of it."
"Nice is a test to see if our old continent is ready for a new, continental-scale enlargement."
"I believe that we can succeed but, Mr President-in-Office, we need your Presidency to mobilise the Council for Europe by animating the Nice Council to achieve something which is genuinely historic."
"There should not merely be constructive compromise, those were your words, there must be significant achievement."
"We will set the bar high and I hope together, Council, Commission and Parliament, we can clear that bar."
"I say this today, if the bar is compromised and is too low, we will refuse to consider it and we will do so for Europe and we will do it in good conscience."
"Madam President, the most important aim of the Nice Summit is enlargement of the European Union and the EU' s preparation for this enlargement."
"I might also add, on behalf of my group, that we are fully committed to enlargement taking place as soon as possible."
"However, it is important at this stage to discuss what is to happen post-Nice."
"For this we need vision, and this vision has been expressed over the last few months."
"Our group strongly supports constitutionalising the European Union Treaties, and this also means that the reform of the Treaties should be open, with civil society being able to participate in this process."
"We consider the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a success."
"It certainly could have been worded better, and, indeed, it can be honed and polished after Nice."
"No doubt in time it will come to form a part of the European Union' s constitution."
"But we wish there were at least a reference to it in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, as our citizens should be already benefiting from this Charter."
"As regards decisions that are at present closer to us, we cannot emphasise enough the importance of qualified majority decisions."
"The Nice Summit cannot succeed unless the system of qualified majority voting is extended."
"It is very important that the European Parliament is closely involved in the codecision procedure, as, otherwise, it will be even more difficult than before to decide on legislation. The European Parliament will bring transparency to this decision-making process."
"Let us take the example of environment taxation."
"In our discussions on climate policy we often criticise the United States of America for not wanting to compromise its sovereignty and enter into international agreements on climate protection, but there are Member States among us which also insist on keeping what they imagine is their sovereignty intact, and which do not wish to switch to a system of qualified majority decisions, for example, in the matter of environmental taxation."
"We have to break free from this."
"President Prodi spoke on the subject of trade policy."
"We all certainly want the European Union to have a strong role in the globalising world, but, Mr Prodi, our group sees trade policy becoming open and transparent as a precondition to the Commission having more powers, and, at present, that is not the case."
"Finally, I would also like to say that it is important at present to ensure that the European Union does not become a community just for the big Member States."
"One issue Parliament has had problems with is that we should realise that Parliament' s size in the future cannot be categorically limited to 700, as this would also limit the manifestation of pluralism here in Parliament."
"That would result in a shift towards a two-party system, and that cannot be democratic."
"I would appeal to Mr Bar√≥n Crespo for understanding in this matter, as I have a feeling that the other Group Chairmen do support this aim to leave the matter of the size of the European Parliament to some extent open."
"This would be a very important position for Parliament to adopt, and we will be able to vote on it tomorrow."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I do not believe that the Governments of the 15 Member States have covered themselves in glory."
"The euro bobs feebly up and down in the shallows, responsibility for BSE is shuttled about in a deadly game of pass-the-parcel, and, as the Union prepares to face the greatest challenge in its history, the governments, instead of vigorously addressing the urgent problems, are still embroiled behind closed doors in petty squabbling about the so-called Amsterdam leftovers."
"The moment of truth is approaching in Nice."
"The summit will only be a success if it opts for truly comprehensive reform of the institutions and sends a clear signal that this Union is capable of enlargement."
"This means that there must be an efficient and strengthened Commission which is able to perform its function as the engine of integration."
"It also implies a balanced distribution of voting rights among the large and small states in the Council, and it means that majority decision-making in the Council must become the norm, even for key policy areas such as taxes, social policy, justice and home affairs."
"If democracy is to be strengthened, this naturally implies that majority voting must be accompanied by a right of codecision for the European Parliament."
"But success in Nice also means that there must be more than mere proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I find it quite intolerable that several governments have simply brushed aside the question of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty."
"Let me say clearly, just as other Members before me have done, that in my view a reference to the Charter in the Treaty is just as indispensable as a broad public debate with the people of the Union."
"To the Presidents of the Council and the Commission, may I say that the Union has no need of a military reaction force or of arms modernisation programmes that devour billions."
"The real success or failure of Nice will be measured by whether governments finally begin to take people's concerns and needs seriously."
"It is a good thing that thousands will be taking to the streets of Nice and actively demanding a socially responsive Europe."
"The European Union must attach foremost political priority to the struggle against unemployment, poverty and social exclusion."
"I note that the French Presidency of the Council intends to devote itself to this cause, but please, Minister, convey to your colleagues that deeds, not words, are what will count."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a week away from the Nice European Council, we are forced to note that it is still not very clear what institutional measures are going to be adopted."
"It is highly like that, on the last night of the Council, measures will be adopted which our national parliaments will not have discussed properly and which they will then be required to ratify for the sake of a forced compromise."
"This is not an appropriate method."
"Matters are particularly vague regarding the, to my mind, key issue of the potential extension of majority voting within the Council, particular on two truly vital issues."
"Firstly, Article 67 on the free movement of persons and on immigration policy."
"Commitments were made at the time of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the effect that this matter would not be opened for discussion again for five years."
"As usual, however, commitments have not been kept."
"As much as we think international cooperation is essential, we find it unacceptable to use majority voting to force the hand of one or more Member States on such issues of sovereignty."
"Another avenue must be explored, one that is more flexible and more respectful of the decisions of each Member State: the avenue of 'differentiated cooperation' ."
"There is another area of uncertainty involving the extension of the Community procedures of Article 133 to the negotiation of international agreements on services, intellectual property and investments."
"Trade talks have already been communitised, but if the Commission is indeed speaking with a single voice, then this voice is not sufficiently controlled by the Member States."
"The disastrous consequences of this became apparent in the Uruguay Round."
"Let us not start again tomorrow with a new multilateral agreement on investment or new talks on agriculture post Seattle."
"In trade policy, the key issue today is not extending majority voting but rather restoring the Council' s authority over the Commission and establishing proper scrutiny by the national parliaments. In a word, Mr President-in-Office, stand firm on this."
"Let us first step up democracy and restore the control of the Member States, then we shall look into transferring jurisdiction."
"Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the radical Members of the Group."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it appears that all the speeches, including the last one, although from the most extreme positions opposite to my own nevertheless come to the same conclusion, and that is that, just a few days away from the Nice Summit, we are not on the finishing straight but, rather than resolving our problems by this antiquated intergovernmental conference method - which, as has been stressed, must be changed - rather than approaching good solutions, we have complicated matters and proposed solutions which are frankly unacceptable."
"I refer, of course, to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a Charter upon which we abstained precisely because we knew that you were bound to sweep it under the carpet after the Nice Summit, having deceived our peoples into believing that it was a binding document protecting and promoting rights."
"You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside."
"We are also concerned by the future of the Commission, the driving force of European integration which, when expanded to 20, 25 or 30 members, will clearly be reduced to an administrative secretariat, a technical secretariat of the Council, a body unable to play even the tiniest role in the institutional balance intended by the founding fathers."
"Over qualified majority voting and weighting, there will, in all probability, be vetos from all sides which will paralyse the demands of Parliament and the public for a move towards democratisation of our system, towards making majority voting the general rule."
"I therefore appeal to President Prodi, who has rightly promised that he will tell us in Strasbourg whether or not the Commission will be able act effectively, whether or not the Union will be able to act effectively after the Nice Summit."
"President Prodi, you are going to take part in the Nice Summit, you will in a way be the expression of the will of Parliament, albeit a timidly expressed will, the will which tomorrow will become clear when we vote on the document which has resulted from the compromise between groups and which we have not signed."
"Mr Prodi, present your objections to the Summit, assume the responsibility, not of establishing a role for us as the post-Nice panel of judges, but of playing right to the very last the card of defending first and foremost the European institutions, the Commission and Parliament in particular."
"Mr President, the draft Nice treaty is more like a constitution for a federal State than an agreement for an association of States."
"As a rule, the European Union' s laws are to be adopted by qualified majority voting so that all democracies in the individual countries can be voted down."
"There are still 65 categories of legislation requiring unanimity according to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is now proposed that decisions should be made by qualified majority voting in 49 of these areas."
"We are therefore approaching the point of no return, beyond which a unitary State is unavoidable."
"The powers to be given to the EU by the Treaty of Nice treaty go beyond those exercised at federal level in many federal States."
"The inner sanctum of the national States is now being penetrated, with majority decision making on aspects of social policy, labour market policy, taxes, industrial policy, culture, supranational parties and even our own salaries, so that we are becoming the EU' s highly paid representatives in the Member States instead of the voters' representatives in the European Parliament, duly taxed in our own countries."
"Home affairs and legal policy are to be subject to majority voting as from 2004."
"Trade policy will make the EU countries resemble a State."
"We shall have to speak with just one disagreeable voice in the WTO."
"Decisions on foreign and security policy are also to be adopted on the basis of majority voting."
"Only on the subject of defence is unanimity still to be required."
"Otherwise, the right of veto will not figure very prominently in the new treaty, and countries without the right of veto resemble constituent States more than independent nations."
"Majority voting internally and joint representation abroad - this is clearly the blueprint for a State."
"What has been deferred to the constitutional conference in 2004 is not the content of the text but merely the icing on the cake of a text which may also come to resemble a proper constitution, that is to say a text containing firstly the Charter of Fundamental Rights, then the ground rules and, finally, an appendix listing the individual policies to which changes may be made without the need for tiresome ratification."
"All that is missing is democracy."
"Democracy was forgotten en route."
"And that is the essential problem with the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice."
"More majority decision-making in which officials and ministers can vote down the electorate and elected representatives."
"In democracies, it is the other way around."
"Majority decision-making will destroy the right of veto for the Member States as parliamentary democracies, but the EU will not itself become a parliamentary democracy."
"With enhanced cooperation, the right of veto over treaty changes is also destroyed - not formally, but in practice - because a qualified majority will in future be able to ignore resistance from, for example, Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain or other places in which the undemocratic idea might arise of asking the electorate what it thinks."
"The federalists can achieve their desire for more integration, and the governments in Sweden, Great Britain and Denmark can ease their countries into the new arrangements once the decisions, binding in practice, have been taken."
"Nice will transfer so much power from the electorate that it ought to be treated as a genuine constitutional change and only come into force once it has been approved in referendums in those countries in which referendums are possible."
"Mr President, the very title of this item on our agenda indicates the importance of Article 133 in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting."
"While its extension to trade in services is an understandable aim, it has little to do with the main issue of institutional reform, which needs to be resolved as a matter of priority; the demand contained in point 7 of the joint resolution regarding the extension of external negotiating competence in the field of trade to cover investment has even less to do with this main issue."
"In view of the rather dim prospects of success, I do not think it would be a wise move to burden the Intergovernmental Conference with another complex and controversial topic."
"Given the current state of negotiations, it is doubtful whether even an extension of the conference to the Sunday, along with the customary extra hour that is gained when the clocks go back, would be sufficient to ensure that this question, along with all the others, will be properly resolved."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, what matters most as far as the PPE-DE Group is concerned, is for the IGC to reach a successful conclusion."
"We believe this is crucial if we are to take a major step towards rapid enlargement of the European Union."
"Just imagine what the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are making of the events in Nice."
"Elections have just taken place in Romania, and we have been shocked at the outcome and the rise of a very extremist party."
"Elections are due to take place in Poland and Bulgaria early next year, and how are we to motivate the people of these countries if the European Union should prove unequal to the task of producing a sound treaty in Nice?"
"The European Union needs some good news."
"A poor agreement would prove that our Heads of Government do not attach any priority to the enlargement of the European Union."
"How can we invest with a view to gaining broader support among EU citizens for further enlargement, if our own Heads of Government should prove unable to negotiate a sound treaty?"
"But according to our heads of government, it is also a question of demonstrating that there is no adequate solution to the major issues confronting us in the European Union."
"BSE, security, foreign policy and defence, Europe' s competitiveness vis-√†-vis the United States; it is no longer possible for any issues of this kind to be resolved at national level."
"It is therefore no way to tackle the fact that the decision-making process within the European Union is still akin to wading through treacle."
"Mr President, Europe needs leadership, clarity, choices and decisiveness."
"That is what the people actually want to see."
"In view of the extent to which public confidence has been undermined with regard to the euro, people need to see that we are taking steps forward."
"So I feel it is the weighty task of the French Presidency to at last whip up some enthusiasm for Nice."
"It is extremely sad that a situation has developed where large and small countries have come to take opposite sides."
"I feel it is a psychological error of the first order that such a huge amount of distrust has been generated."
"I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive."
"We believe the Commission' s role to be essential."
"The Commission is, and remains, the driving force, and if the Commission does not emerge from Nice in a stronger position then it will be a black day for Europe."
"So I think what we need to do is work more with the Commission and less at intergovernmental level."
"We will assess the outcome of Nice on the basis of whether it leads to enhanced effectiveness, and efficiency, greater democracy and transparency, and that is what is on the agenda."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Parliament is required to give its opinion on essential matters."
"Well, as far as Parliament is concerned, the issue of the weighting of votes within the Council and the number of Commissioners are essential matters."
"Even so, Mr President-in-Office, on this point we trust you to reach the best agreement."
"We understand that not all the elements are on the table yet, but I trust that wisdom will carry the day at the Nice Summit."
"For us Members of the European Parliament, the essential thing is primarily to make our voice heard where it might be useful."
"There are two points where it is useful and necessary."
"On the Charter, first of all."
"As practically everyone who has spoken before me here has said, we want a reference to the Charter in Article 6.2."
"Do not underestimate Parliament' s determination to achieve this."
"We do not find the principle of blackmailing into proclamation acceptable with regard to the conclusions the Biarritz European Council, even if it was an informal one."
"We still have a few days left to convince all European Union citizens, including those living in countries that sometimes feel that Brussels is plotting the worst, those for whom the development of a common foreign and security policy and an area of freedom, security and justice should be specifically incorporated into a code of values. We have a few days left to convince these people that the best safeguard against the Brussels behemoth is precisely, perhaps, to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties."
"Otherwise there would be the political paradox that a good development for the European Union is not acknowledged in the Treaties."
"There would be the legal paradox that the European Union had provided itself with a code of values and then agreed to carry on living with a treaty which makes reference to the values of another organisation."
"The second point I should like to stress is, obviously, the scope of qualified majority."
"Mr Poettering condemned the responsibilities of parties on all sides."
"I, however, would like to remind us of our responsibilities: we cannot blow the case out of all proportion."
"If we want to actually overcome the deadlock on qualified majority in order to enable the European Union to accommodate new members, then everyone has to make some small concession."
"In that respect, there are various proposals on the table."
"Regarding trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined."
"We are in favour of developing democratic responsibility in this area."
"However, while we feel that this proposal needs to be examined carefully, it must also enable all parties to conserve the elements that make up their identity, particularly, no doubt, Europe' s cultural identity."
"As you know, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we shall also examine qualified majority voting according to the yardstick of extending the scope of codecision."
"In that respect, let me draw your attention to one specific point: the extension of codecision to the common agricultural policy."
"If we trust to democracy, then it is not normal for 45% of the EU budget to lie outside the scope of codecision."
"It is even in the interests of agriculture, at a time when health and the environment are areas covered by codecision."
"The recent decisions of the European Parliament show that it has some sense of responsibility and concern for the interest of the citizens of Europe."
"Its voice would be stronger yet and that of the ministers defending an agriculture that promotes sustainable development would also be stronger within the Council if it were to be based on decisions taken in this place under the codecision procedure."
"(Applause from the left) These, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are the criteria according to which we shall assess the outcome of the Nice Summit. Let me also mention how highly we value the point you raised concerning services of general economic interest."
"Yes, we do think that the Nice Council conclusions should include a request that the Commission should draw up a framework directive in this field."
"The IGC still seems to be experiencing problems with the extension of qualified voting within the Council."
"Perhaps we should shift the focus to the issue of extending codecision with the Parliament."
"Parliament has proved itself a mature partner with the Council in the codecision procedure where it presently pertains."
"Parliament has also proved itself a serious partner within the drafting of the Charter, and it would be especially refreshing should British Prime Minister Blair publicly recognise that fact."
"At present the spread of codecision is neither logical nor does it accord with precise criteria."
"Although the previous Treaty made some progress in extending the formula, it also brought in the crazy formula of codecision plus unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of the self-employed and also cultural policy."
"The Treaty of Nice should stop that practice and extend codecision to some thirty further policy sectors, including competition policy, farm and fisheries, structural funds, state aids, trans-European networks, research and development and also citizenship."
"At a time when crude balance of power questions are proving fairly problematical for the IGC, surely it is sensible for it to focus on building up cooperation and trust with the Parliament and developing post-national European democracy as fast as possible."
"Mr President, here we are on the eve of another European Summit which will see many of us out on the streets of Nice together with millions of citizens. Like them, we will be unable to influence the outcome of the negotiations."
"Mr Prodi, I am extremely concerned at what might be the outcome of the final night of the negotiations, that night when the victors are usually those with the greatest resistance to tiredness and boredom, that night which everyone sees as the last chance to resolve the points which are still without solutions."
"This is the most negative, most undemocratic part of the intergovernmental method: the whims of the human element, the results of last-minute bargaining and the obligation to achieve a result at all costs."
"I am extremely afraid that we will end up with some rather strange measures such as a Senate of national Members of Parliament, a Mr Euro or a Mr WTO, further diminishing of Parliament's powers or further marginalisation of Parliament, or some other protocol such as that proposed on the WTO which, if it were adopted, would reduce the Commission to a puppy dog on multiple leashes held by many different owners, each one pulling in a different direction."
"Those who are in Nice, out on the streets and in the dozens of forums and meetings scheduled will, in my opinion, at least be able to push for one result, namely that this will be the last IGC, that the hazy reflection on the future of Europe Mr V√©drine spoke of will translate into the launch at Nice of a process which will establish the time frames and methods for drawing up and adopting a democratic European Constitution."
"One last word on the subject of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and the bold words we have heard this morning."
"Be careful lest we repeat the painful fiasco of the last enlargement when, after months of threats, the European Parliament gave in to the governments."
"I hope that this will not be the case this time as well."
"Mr President, I was involved in securing Denmark' s positive vote against the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992."
"I shall adopt a position on the Treaty of Nice when I see the outcome of the negotiations, but there is a somewhat schizophrenic feel to the debates here."
"At one moment, we talk about bringing the European Union closer to the people, and the next moment we are in the throes of developing a European State, which is out of step with what the people want."
"In my view, the most important thing to do at the Nice Summit is to set a timetable for when and how the EU is to become ready for enlargement."
"We are focusing far too much on how prepared the applicant States are, and we all too often ignore the fact that, for example, the EU' s agricultural arrangements and Structural Funds are enormous obstacles to enlargement."
"A decision in Nice to the effect that, for example, the applicant States must have the opportunity to participate in the next elections to the European Parliament could help put the necessary pressure on the EU itself, so that enlargement can become a reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his declaration of 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman stated that: ""Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"It will be built through concrete achievements, which first create a de facto solidarity."" ."
"I think that it is timely, on the eve of the Nice Summit, to question the current state of this spirit of ""de facto solidarity"" , without which, European integration can be clearly neither genuine nor authentic."
"With regard to the conclusion of the IGC, what must take place in Nice is that an agreement must be reached which whilst correcting the deficit in the functioning of the European institutions, does not affect the existing balance between Member States and, of course, between these States and the Union."
"The very fact that this issue is being debated now is in itself a clear sign of the failure of a policy to strengthen ties of mutual trust between the countries that comprise the Union."
"We are not the only ones to say this; the French Presidency has also said as much through its minister, Mr Moscovici, who acknowledged in a recent interview that the positions that have been adopted during the course of this year, particularly by President Chirac and by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Joschka Fischer, on the future organisation of the Union have had the direct effect of heightening a climate of mistrust between small and large Member States, which will inevitably be reflected in the results of the Nice European Council."
"I am talking here about the idea of creating a vanguard of countries centred on the Paris¬≠Berlin axis, which would culminate in a remodelling of Europe or in a dangerous confusion between a heterogeneous Europe, which is healthy, and a two-speed or multi-speed Europe, which is dangerous."
"Furthermore, the text of the proposal for a compromise resolution that we will be voting on reflects this unease to a certain extent, because its generic nature is clear to see."
"It is also, however, a text in which its authors, even in the knowledge that they risk predictable political failure, reveal a vision that is focused above all on the powers and competences of the European Parliament itself, and call for ever greater resources for parliamentary intervention without dedicating a single word to the crucial role of national parliaments."
"The reality is nevertheless quite different."
"We all know that the purpose of the Nice Summit is to finalise the work of a conference held between governments, who are accountable not to the European Parliament but to their own national parliaments, which categorically demonstrates the sovereign nature of this process of revising the Treaties."
"To conclude, Mr President, I wish to express the desire that the Nice Summit is a success from the point of view that I have been talking about, which is that its conclusions should express a joint formulation of the various national wills that come together and work together in an ongoing quest for cohesion and development, ultimately taking a few more steps towards the ""de facto solidarity"" of which Robert Schuman spoke."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, today at talks in the House, the President of Latvia directed this reproachful remark at us: ""We have been doing our homework!"""
"The question is whether the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have been doing their homework too."
"This raises a huge question mark at the present time."
"In Amsterdam, the Heads of State and Government failed their exams, and now they have to go to Nice to resit them."
"A failed resit has to be regarded as a crisis in any school career, and I fear that another mass failure may well be on the cards."
"Let me use another metaphor."
"European unification is a marathon in which we have successfully stayed the course over the past few decades."
"The stadium is now in sight."
"Do we have the strength and determination to complete the final lap, or shall we miss the entrance to the stadium because we have lost our bearings?"
"This is the question that has to be asked in Nice, and I hope that we have the strength to emerge from the enlargement process with a robust Union, because enlargement must not weaken the Union."
"For this reason, the European Parliament believes that two conditions must be fulfilled."
"The first is that qualified-majority voting must be extended, but this extension must not focus on areas of relatively minor importance."
"Forty areas can be listed in which voting by qualified majority is to be introduced, areas such as the appointment of members to the Committee of the Regions."
"I would gladly give up these 40 extensions if we could achieve majority voting in five areas where substantive progress can be made, such as trade, social policy, justice and home affairs, structural policy and taxation, to name the most important."
"Our appeal to the Heads of State and Government is that each of them should put his playthings into the communal toy box, so that the others will do likewise, rather than each waiting for the others to make the first move and then nothing happening at all."
"This, quite simply, is the situation in which we have been stuck for months at the Intergovernmental Conference, because none of them are willing to give up their toys."
"I hope that, at the start of the ministerial meeting of the intergovernmental conference, someone will have the backbone to give up his toys in order to pressurise the others into making a move."
"Secondly, the democratic deficit must not start to widen again."
"In Amsterdam, it was decided that qualified-majority voting should always be accompanied by codecision."
"Any derogation from this rule will fuel the democratic deficit and undermine the progress made in Amsterdam."
"I hope this will not happen."
"There are also a few leftovers to be tidied up in the fields of competition policy, monetary union and agricultural policy, so that a right of codecision can be established in these areas too."
"At the Intergovernmental Conference, we must also strike a fair balance between the large and the small nations."
"I should like to emphasise that the population of Europe consider themselves to be represented in the European Parliament, and Parliament must reflect this."
"If the disparity between the large and the small members of the Council becomes too great, we face the risk of a legitimacy crisis within the European Union in a few years' time, because the small countries will no longer feel comfortable in the Council, fearing that they might become unable to defend their own identity."
"I believe that, if the two conditions, namely the creation of an effective Union and the reduction of the democratic deficit, are not fulfilled, the European Union could be confronted for the first time with a situation in which this European Parliament refuses to ratify a treaty."
"(Applause from the right and centre)"
"Mr President, the Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Affairs has followed the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference month by month since it started in February, attentively and with commitment and confidence, confidence particularly in the French Presidency."
"It is now the eve of its conclusion and we are aware of the progress which has been made, the partial results which have been achieved, but frankly, over almost ten months of a major Intergovernmental Conference, there has been no rapprochement of the positions, Mr V√©drine, and no definition of agreements, not to mention the fact that some of the topics indicated by Parliament in its resolution of 13 April, ranging from the regulation of the economy to the institutional implications of the common defence policy, have not even been debated."
"All this is serious cause for reflection on the tortuous and sterile nature of the method followed, a lengthy, repetitive, predominantly technical dialogue lacking the more weighty clarifications and negotiation endeavours at political level which did not take place until much later, in October, and then only on one occasion, at the Biarritz Council."
"The experience of this year has convinced us that, looking beyond Nice towards the future of Europe, the process of constitutionalising the Union must not be carried out by means of the - now dysfunctional - method of negotiations between government representatives."
"Nice must not be the occasion for the announcement of another Intergovernmental Conference, for this would generate misunderstanding and alarm rather than agreement and hope."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has made its contribution in the form of the resolution adopted on 21 November, which draws attention to certain points which are truly vitally important if the outcome of the Conference is to be successful, and I will not go back over them."
"I will simply say that these points are deemed absolutely essential by those who believe that it is necessary to advance integration into a larger Union and not to dilute or paralyse it."
"We are starting to doubt whether anybody, even at the highest levels, is fully aware of what is at stake."
"Recently, Mr President, we have, in fact, witnessed the emergence of an increasingly clear, worrying contradiction which very few governments appear to want to avoid: the contradiction between the courageous decisions which have already been taken, such as those on the single currency, common defence and the major, historical enlargement of the Union, and the reluctance to accept the institutional implications."
"If this contradiction is responsible for the negative outcome of the Conference, it will mean a crisis for European integration."
"Therefore, it would be better and healthier to have a clear-cut crisis arising from the failure to reach agreement at Nice, than an ambiguous crisis caused by deception aimed at concealing the Conference's failure to deal with points which are vital for the Union's enlargement."
"Mr President, even Paris is divided over Nice."
"The French President and the First Minister seem to be more obsessed with their own political future than with that of Europe."
"The French Presidency has shown little enough consistency, and where it has this has mainly been in terms of its lack of neutrality and the preferential treatment it has given to the large Member States, and that at a time when the Union has never been more in need of a President who looks for consensus."
"In order to make room for the newcomers, all Member States need to move a little closer together, but they only do so when they really cannot put off the evil moment any longer."
"It seems as if some governments are already reconciling themselves to a new IGC for enlargement."
"The governments have lost sight of the urgent need for reforms because they are concentrating too much on their own position of power in the new set-up."
"For example, many a country will emphasise that majority decision making must become the general rule, but at the same, will come up with so many exceptions that precious little remains on balance."
"If majority voting does not become the general rule then decision-making will become irretrievably deadlocked, as Mr Prodi rightly commented a moment ago."
"If this does not go hand-in-hand with codecision then democracy will be further undermined."
"The weighting of votes in the Council must do justice to the population numbers in the Member States, which means that it is quite acceptable for there to be some corresponding differences between the larger and smaller countries."
"All Member States must retain one Commissioner of their own during this enlargement round."
"Only afterwards should we decide on a new system on the basis of the experience we will have gained by then."
"If one thing is for certain, Europe is going to undergo radical change, and so let us not run ahead of a situation that we are unable to take stock of as yet."
"It would be very desirable to introduce a hierarchy into the Commission, i.e. Vice-Presidents, Commissioners and Under-Commissioners."
"In addition, this would afford Parliament more opportunities to discuss issues with politically responsible members of the Commission rather than officials who read out actual texts that they could just as easily have sent."
"The Charter does not deserve to be left in a vacuum, with no clear status."
"In failing to incorporate the text into the Treaty and only subscribing to it in political terms, we are opening the door to major problems of legal interpretation."
"Hence the Charter must be incorporated into a treaty text as soon as possible."
"I have this to say to the Heads of Governments: making concessions at the forthcoming summit is not a political defeat but a political triumph: the triumph of the new Europe over the old."
"Do not allow any shadows to fall over Nice, and let Paris be the City of Light again."
"Mr President I would like to remind the Council and Commission, and indeed the House, of a resolution that we carried on 26 October in relation to better law-making."
"We there said that ""in accordance with the subsidiarity principle and the political and national diversity of the European Union, the amendments made to the treaties should specifically include recognition of, and respect for, the political and legislative powers of the Members States' internal political units in their executive, legislative and judicial relations with the European Union institutions."""
"That aspect of subsidiarity has not been heard in our debate today but it is very important."
"It bears also in a most important way on the question of the size of this Parliament."
"The nations and regions which the parties of the European Free Alliance represent are deeply concerned that if we apply together the maximum of 700 and the current idea of digressive proportionality, the people whom we are able to represent here at the present time will effectively cease to be represented in this House."
"That will be a huge loss to European democracy and it will take the institutions further from the people not closer to them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a youngster like me, Nice certainly represents a great hope for a new Europe, in political as well as institutional terms."
"Indeed, the wide majority vote returned only yesterday in the Italian Parliament is evidence of the unity of intention and preparation for this Council."
"However, we certainly consider it essential that the list of topics to be voted on by qualified majority voting is not extended and that the principle of one Commissioner per Member State is followed when establishing the composition of the Commission."
"Another essential factor is that the irreplaceable role of the national parliaments is retained in the Treaties, precisely because this will facilitate the establishment of the new Europe."
"It takes no great genius to work out that 700 Members of Parliament can no longer be sufficient for a Europe of 27 or 28 nations, or the smaller countries will be at an unfair disadvantage."
"On the other hand, I would stress the considerable importance of providing our Europe with strong institutions to fill the institutional void being created by progress on the economic front with the euro."
"As a result, the high dollar is benefiting NAFTA, Mexico, Canada and the United States."
"Having said this, in my opinion, Nice needs to be an historic Council, for ourselves, our nations and the very future of Europe."
"Mr President, in this Parliament, which is a pluralist parliament, we have today achieved an unusual degree of unanimity amongst the Members who have spoken."
"I believe that all the speakers are very concerned about the results of the Nice European Council."
"This is not a question - despite what my friend, Elmar Brok, has said - of two exams that we have to pass; Amsterdam and Nice."
"No, this is a much longer-standing issue."
"I remember the enlargement of 1995, when the question of institutional issues was already being raised, and I remember a letter from Chancellor Kohl in which he told us to approve enlargement and then the rest would be resolved immediately."
"We did so, the enlargement of 1995 went ahead, the discussion group presided over so well by Carlos Westendorp was created, Amsterdam arrived and now we are going to have Nice and practically nothing has changed, Mr President, we go round and round in circles on institutional issues and never find solutions which will allow us to cope with this hugely ambitious task of enlargement to 27 members."
"This is what worries us and it worries all this afternoon' s speakers."
"This is the message that we wish to send to the European Council through you, Mr President."
"You should be aware that we are not going to judge this French Presidency on its considerations of the economic services of general interest, which is a very important issue."
"No, we are going to judge it on the mandate of the Nice Conference, which is the same as it was in Finland plus enhanced cooperation."
"There are two aspects of this issue that are absolutely fundamental to this Parliament: How will qualified majority voting be extended?"
"And with this extension, when the decisions are legislative, will there always be codecision with Parliament?"
"That is the first consideration."
"The second one, Mr President, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Institutional issues are not of interest to many people, because they are complicated issues."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights - I have had the opportunity to talk about this in many places - is of interest to people, because they understand and feel strongly about fundamental rights."
"I believe that in the Convention we produced good work."
"I believe that we have a good Charter and that this Council is going to waste a great political opportunity because, in the proposal you are making, Mr President, the proclamation - the one which my friend and group Chairman, Mr Poettering, calls a freierliche Proklamation - is a proclamation by stealth."
"You tell us to proclaim it and leave it at that."
"You do so as if you were taking care not to disturb anyone."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is the great political task of this European Council."
"If you fail to take advantage of it, I fear that you will return here after the European Council in Nice, other presidencies will come around and this Parliament will be tempted to follow Oscar Wilde' s advice, which was that the best way to avoid temptation was to fall into it, and therefore not approve the Treaty of Nice when the time comes."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, As soon as Nice has finished, it will the European Parliament's turn to reply to two historic questions, questions which affect both the future of the European Union and its own political credibility."
"The stated aim of this review is to design more efficient institutions which will be able to cope with an enlarged Europe and, at the same time, to reduce the democratic deficit which certainly exists."
"Unfortunately, the text of the Treaty, as formulated to date by the Intergovernmental Conference, does not satisfy either of the objectives of the review and, consequently, does not satisfy either of the two evaluation criteria set by the European Parliament."
"In order to ensure that the institutions operate more efficiently, we called for Council decisions to be taken by qualified majority rather than unanimously, although we did, of course, exclude all issues of constitutional significance."
"This has borne only meagre fruit, as Elmar Brok and Mr M√©ndez de Vigo explained earlier."
"However, the European Parliament is especially disappointed as regards the major issue of the democratisation of the European Union."
"From a democratic point of view, it goes without saying that qualified majority voting in the Council should go hand in glove, as far as legislative acts are concerned, with codecision on the part of the European Parliament."
"This does not always hold true."
"In the case of enhanced cooperation, no agreement has yet been reached on making provision for assent by the European Parliament in order to start the procedure."
"Finally, not only has the Charter of Fundamental Rights not yet been incorporated into the text of the Treaty; it has barely even been agreed to mention it in Article 6."
"Of course, I am delighted about the positive aspects, such as the issue of European political parties and Article 7, which have already been commented on."
"However, Nice will not be accepted on the basis of these positive aspects."
"Obviously, we shall be under great pressure to accept Nice come what may, with talk of the threat of institutional crisis if there is no Treaty."
"However, I fear that the crisis will be worse if the European Parliament caves in and accepts as adequate what is clearly an inadequate Treaty."
"The national parliaments are waiting for our opinion."
"We have an historic responsibility."
"Let us not compound the disappointment which Nice will cause if it is unsuccessful by giving the people huge cause for disappointment in Parliament."
"Nice, if it is unsuccessful, can make amends, but if Parliament proves to be unreliable, it will take years to wipe the slate clean."
"A European Union without a credible parliament is a transient and a poor state of affairs."
"Mr President, the debate on Article 133 and commercial policy needs to be part of a much wider effort to bring transparency and democracy to the EU' s decision-making on trade."
"This sector is currently one of the most centralised and untransparent."
"That was one of the main criticisms of the protestors at Seattle and it will continue to be one of their criticisms at Nice."
"Many of us believe that any shift of competence from Member States to the Commission can only be contemplated after a complete restructuring of the EU' s trade policies and processes as a whole, to infuse them with far greater democracy and transparency, and to ensure that they are based on true social and environmental sustainability."
"That means it is not only a question of the Parliament having a much greater role in decision-making on trade."
"That is, of course, important and I am surprised that others have not mentioned it as it has occupied much of our time in the committee."
"But it also means restructuring the Committee 133 itself: making it far more accountable; ensuring that its agenda and conclusions are accessible and that its composition is broad and inclusive."
"Only then, President Prodi, will some of us be happy to entrust the Commission with the hugely important areas of services, investment and intellectual property."
"Mr President, the EU summit at Nice will hopefully be a further positive step on the road to European integration."
"The recent Commission report on the progress of the countries from Central and Eastern Europe who have made application for membership is encouraging I must say."
"While not in any way detracting from the aspirations, and indeed the entitlement, of some of those countries to join the Community by 2002, it would not, I believe, be in their best interests, or indeed the interests of Member States, to achieve this deadline without first ensuring an orderly transition with minimum disruption to the economies of existing Member States."
"We must not forget that our ultimate goal is to create the economic and social environment to enable the EU to become a dominant player in world trade with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe playing their full part and benefiting from a peaceful and stable European economy."
"We have demonstrated in the past that this goal is achievable and as someone from a Member State that has benefited from a planned transition to membership, I look forward in a positive way to an enlarged and peaceful Europe."
"However enlargement of the European Union must not dilute or dissipate the influence of smaller Member States with key national interests which must be protected."
"From an Irish perspective it is clear that we want to retain our right to nominate one member of the European Commission which controls the administration of the common agricultural policy, fisheries policy, transport policy and other important EU policy areas."
"I also believe it is important that we keep control over decisions concerning our tax affairs and social security matters."
"Mr President, I am speaking not just to the President-in-Office of the Council but also to all the governments of the Member States when I say that if agreement is not reached in Nice on these difficult issues those issues will not go away."
"They will not become easier to solve after Nice, they will become more difficult."
"So a final major effort is necessary over the next two weeks."
"This is no more so than on the issue of qualified majority voting."
"Every government is saying we need more qualified majority voting, but they all have their list of exceptions."
"The problem is if you put the lists of exceptions next to each other you will find there are very few areas of substance where it is agreed to switch to qualified majority voting."
"Everyone will have to sacrifice some of their cherished exceptions if we are to reach a result in Nice."
"Of course some governments will be attacked in their Member States by opposition parties, by euro-sceptics, saying, ""you are giving up the national right of veto"" ."
"But it has to be understood that if you have the right of veto then so does everyone else."
"So in a Union of 27 Member States for every veto you trade in, 26 other vetoes are being given up at the same time."
"Consequently, things that you want will no longer be vetoed by others."
"Everyone can gain from a system of qualified majority voting."
"If we are to have more qualified majority voting on legislation it must go hand in hand with codecision, not only for the new areas which will come to qualified majority voting but also for the existing areas that already come under qualified majority voting."
"This is essential for democracy at Union level."
"To adopt European legislation you must pass two tests: acceptability to the elected governments meeting in the Council, and acceptability to the directly-elected MEPs in the European Parliament."
"These are two safeguards for the quality and the acceptability of European legislation."
"It is nothing to be afraid of."
"The working of the codecision procedure over the last year shows that it works."
"In more than three quarters of the cases we do not even need the Conciliation Committee; the two readings each in Council and Parliament are enough to reach agreement."
"If this is working here let us make it work across the whole spectrum of legislation."
"Finally, there is the question of the number of seats in the European Parliament."
"We know that a definitive solution must be in place for the parliament to be elected in 2009, which will, after all, last until 2014."
"By then I am sure we will have enlarged to at least 27 Member States."
"But a first transition will also have to be made for the parliament to be elected in 2004 because at least some new Member States will come in before or during the Parliament to be elected in 2004 which will last until 2009."
"We must make some room now for enlargement in that Parliament."
"If a lot of states come in maybe we will exceed temporarily the limit of 700, but a first adjustment must be made now."
"It is easier to make two small steps in this regard rather than one big step so I urge the President to persevere and I urge all governments to make the necessary compromises in Nice."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen. My dear friend Elmar Brok referred in the House just now to examinations and what students do in order to pass them."
"Of course, one of the things which students do in order to pass examinations is to revise beforehand."
"I should like to tell you which points I think you should revise if you want to pass your examinations with flying colours."
"The first thing you have to do in Nice, Minister, and I say this to you and through you to all your colleagues, is to adopt an agreement which maintains the correlation of powers - large and small - and interinstitutional balance."
"Secondly, as far as the matter of the Commission is concerned, you know full well - we all know full well - that the problem with the Commission is not one of numbers."
"The problem with the Commission is a qualitative problem. In other words, we want a new Commission with 27 Commissioners, but we want a Commission which has a political role, which again has a political role, and the president of which has the powers needed for the Commission to do its job."
"As far as voting in the Council is concerned, I think that the double majority is the best system because it is more representative and more objective."
"As far as extending qualified majority voting is concerned, we are agreed that, unless we make some sort of move in this direction, we shall encounter a great many problems."
"So I think that, as a first move, it should already be agreed that trade policy needs to come under qualified majority voting."
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we now live in Mr Solana's bright and beautiful world and let me tell you - if we leave the common foreign policy solely within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation, then we shall be making a big mistake."
"The common foreign policy needs to be fully integrated into Community procedure because only then shall we have the necessary safety valves."
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must, of course, mention the Charter, which affects millions of European citizens."
"I take the view that Nice must at least accept the compromise called for by the European Parliament, i.e. for the Charter to be combined with Article 6, paragraph 2."
"Mr President I wish to focus my speech on three basic points."
"The President-in-Office of the Council addressed the issue of closer cooperation and said that we are on the way to reaching consensus on this matter."
"I should like to ask both Mr V√©drine and President Prodi what role is envisaged or what role they advocate for the Commission in the field of closer cooperation in the second and third pillars."
"The second issue concerns the overall agreement already considered here by my colleague and Chairman of the Socialist Group, Enrique Bar√≥n Crespo, which is, fortunately, part of the resolution that the European Parliament will surely adopt tomorrow."
"Today, neither in the Council nor in Parliament do we have distribution of power that is proportionate to size and to the number of citizens in each Member State. What we have is a balance underpinned by the principle of the dual legitimacy that exists between the Union of States and the Union of citizens."
"According to how one sees the matter, however, what is being prepared now is a change to this balance and an increase in the representation of the larger countries, both in the Council and in Parliament."
"This is neither fair nor acceptable."
"I therefore wish to insist once again that within the Council, it is the double majority method that should be adopted for decision making, since it is not only more understandable but also fairer. I would also reiterate that the current method should be maintained in the European Parliament and that this linear reduction should be implemented when new Members enter Parliament."
"I believe that this latter approach is more balanced, fairer and takes account of an historical reality which those seeking to integrate Europe cannot ignore. This historical reality is that the Member States exist and there is a relationship between these states and their citizens, whereas there is not such a strong relationship between the citizens and Europe itself."
"Lastly, there is the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The President-in-Office of the Council spoke with sincerity, for which I thank him. He said that some countries or governments even say they will not formally recognise the Charter if it is incorporated into the Treaties."
"It is unacceptable that such a statement should be made."
"What is a member of the European public supposed to think when they hear that governments are prepared to draw up certain documents but do not agree on these documents having legal force and status?"
"What kind of message are we sending to candidate countries if we say to them that in order to join the single market they must accept whatever we impose on them, and yet we do not require them to ratify the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"In other words, we are sending them the message that in Europe we treat consumers better than we treat the citizens of the European Union themselves."
"We therefore encourage and urge the Presidency once again to make every effort to ensure that there is at least one reference to the Treaties in Nice because this would be the best tribute we could pay to the work of the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission and even the representatives of the governments involved in the Convention on drafting the Charter."
"Mr President, today the President of Latvia visited the European Parliament."
"The story of Mrs Vike Freiberga is illustrative of the courage in adversity shown by the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe."
"As a seven year-old girl she was forced to flee her country before the advance of the Red Army, a fugitive hiding in ditches to avoid being strafed by Soviet aircraft."
"We might also choose to remember the heroism of Solidarnosc in Poland, the President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel, the generations in Hungary since 1956 who have sought to restore their freedom and independence."
"On the one hand, Mr V√©drine, we see courage and even heroism; on the other we look at the Council of Ministers, the IGC about to assemble in Nice: Do we see courage, resolution, determination to succeed?"
"At the moment, as your address has demonstrated, we see disunion, squabbling and the prospect of failure."
"Will you be able at Nice to support the European Parliament' s resolution which calls upon the preparations to be secure so that the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe may vote in the next European Parliamentary elections in 2004?"
"Will you, President Prodi and your colleague Commissioner Verheugen, instruct the Commission to open those chapters for the applicant countries who have achieved everything we have so far required so that at Nice we can look the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe in the eye and say: yes, we have succeeded in making the necessary reforms and within the lifetime of one Parliament you will also take your place in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"I do not believe that failure is an option."
"We have been talking about Amsterdam leftovers."
"Our public in the EU and the public in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of Nice leftovers, of a second IGC in 2004."
"I hope that we are in a position to congratulate the French Presidency for its success; but if you fail, we shall be harsh in our condemnation."
"Mr President, on the face of it, the Nice Summit is all about making the necessary adaptations and dealing with the leftovers in the light of enlargement."
"But there is far more than that at stake."
"The Nice Summit will not just address the issue as to whether the Member States are prepared to give up their Commissioner, it will mainly be concerned with their willingness to give shape to the type of European political cooperation that promotes the interests of the European citizen, transcending national interests."
"It has frequently come to our notice of late that this political cooperation is totally absent."
"A brilliant example is, of course, the nationally motivated measures, and the reaction to the unrest over the high diesel and petrol prices; where concerted action could have given a huge boost to the credibility of European political cooperation in the eyes of the citizens."
"Bearing in mind the need to deepen the Union, the Heads of Government must change tack and extend qualified majority voting to a substantial degree."
"If we are serious about deepening European cooperation then it is absolutely vital to exercise effective democratic control over the European decision-making process."
"That is why qualified majority voting must always go hand in hand with Parliament' s right of codecision."
"Eighty per cent of all amendments tabled by Parliament in past months were adopted by the Council."
"So we evidently make an enormous contribution in qualitative terms."
"As Mrs Ber√®s said, it is of course untenable to draw a distinction and give us codecision rights in consumer affairs on the one hand, but at the same time, only give us consultation rights in agricultural matters."
"Let us just think back to the recent BSE-crisis."
"Just what are we supposed to tell our citizens?"
"Mr M√©ndez de Vigo has just made reference to the Charter, and rightly so."
"This is a subject that is, of course, very dear to Parliament' s heart."
"It is the embodiment of the citizen' s Europe, this Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"But now that this Charter is to be incorporated in the Treaties in Nice, certain governments have evidently given vent to their opposition."
"We consider this to be unacceptable, because by incorporating this document into the Treaties of the European Union, fundamental standards and values of the constitutional state and the social welfare state are being embedded in the European structures."
"I would warn our Heads of Government against taking an over-minimalist stance in Nice."
"As the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, said, qualified majority voting, together with codecision - Article 62 linking the Charter with the Treaties - is to be the litmus test for our Heads of Government."
"We have a saying in the Netherlands that goes: 'if you set the standard too low you will trip over it' ."
"Our European project must not be allowed to trip up in this way."
"Should we falter, this will provoke Parliament' s condemnation."
"So we are banking on success, but it is up to you to make it happen."
"Mr President, you certainly have to hand it to the United States these days."
"They are facing the greatest constitutional crisis they have had in a hundred years and all they keep saying is that their being able to have such a crisis shows how well-designed their system is."
"If we could only take a leaf out of their book, i.e. put a little less emphasis on the things that are going wrong in our part of the world, and a little more emphasis on the things that are going well, then we would be a good deal happier than we are now."
"I agree with everyone who has said that the Council must be put to the test."
"I also have my doubts."
"I hope they actually do what Elmar Brok has advised them to do."
"If they follow his advice then they will make a success of it."
"If they do not, then they will fail."
"It is particularly important, to my mind, for social policy and the Charter to be recognised in the Treaty by some means or other."
"But why is it that we always think we are doing so much worse than others are, even though there are no objective reasons for this?"
"I think that to some extent it is down to a certain insecurity on the part of Parliament, and also on the part of the Council and the Commission, when it comes to putting across the message, but on the other hand, it is also a sure fire consequence of the below the belt attacks launched by the so-called 'sceptics' ."
"They have nothing to offer."
"What they offer is a Balkans type scenario, which is the worst thing imaginable."
"The Balkans is the sceptics' ideal."
"To hear Mr Bonde talk, the Balkans is his ultimate ideal."
"We can expect no better of him."
"If we then see that these people have absolutely no alternative, would only bring us misery and would bring our industry into a much worse state than it is at present, then far too much notice is being taken of them."
"I feel it is also up to the Council to try to act not just for the sake of national interests but also for the sake of the common European interest, because united we stand, divided we fall, and we had better not forget it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, greater power for the European Union to act in the field of foreign trade and payments is one of the fundamental demands of the European Parliament and of the Commission too, as you, President Prodi, emphatically underlined earlier today."
"Although we now see the French Presidency, Mr President of the Council, playing a decisive part here, it is also plainly evident that we are still at square one today, just a few days before the IGC ministerial meeting."
"You bear responsibility for the success of this project; you, the President-in-Office of the Council, also have the power to make things happen."
"We should include not only trade in goods but also the corresponding trade in services, as well as investments, intellectual property and competition, in the range of matters which are subject to qualified-majority voting in the Council of Ministers and amend Article 133(1) of the Treaty accordingly."
"That is our basic demand."
"We in the European Union account for 40% of trade in goods and services in the world, compared with the US share of only 20%."
"We therefore bear a worldwide burden of responsibility for the establishment of more open markets as well as having the opportunity to export our technological systems and services to many countries of the world."
"I have seen at first hand in our Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the great majority of government representatives support the reinforcement of the role played by the European Union and are demanding that."
"Apparently, however, it is the French Government which is needlessly stonewalling on this issue."
"Let us not forget that France, as a major economic power in the European Union, benefits directly whenever the EU is able to speak with one voice and successfully defend its interests in negotiations with representatives of the world's major trading areas - the United States, Canada and the countries of Asia."
"We proceed on the assumption that France will defend with justifiable vigour her own vital interests with regard to her cultural identity, which is also related to the cultural identity of Europe as a whole."
"We are urging a compromise, with provision for unanimity where these interests are affected, but I believe there is some way to go before we can start to move forward."
"Mr President, the omens have never been good before any Intergovernmental Conference."
"Unresolved issues have predominated, and the common ground has been narrow."
"Now, very few days before the ministerial meeting of the present Intergovernmental Conference, the signs are once again unpromising."
"This time, however, it is paradoxically the prospect of an emerging consensus that is causing us political headaches."
"As the days go by, it is becoming ever likelier that the agreement the ministers will reach, while not representing the lowest common denominator, will be a rather low common denominator, indeed a very low common denominator."
"Many of us therefore fear that what Nice will offer in the way of institutional reforms will not really enable the Union to implement a major enlargement process involving the accession of twelve or more new Member States, unless further, more extensive reforms are implemented."
"I venture to doubt whether consensus will be easier to achieve in the new extended family than it is now."
"One can but hope."
"Besides, the overall result of the coming IGC ministerial meeting, another small but unfortunately far from delicate detail is causing me some concern."
"In the resolution on Nice that we are discussing here, the last clause in point 6 says in essence that Parliament too should have a right of initiative in procedures under Article 7 of the EU Treaty (breaches of the principles of democracy, respect for human rights, etc.)."
"In general terms, this would impinge upon the central role of the Commission."
"The fact that the Commission has the sole right of initiative is an essential element of our Union."
"Granting the European Parliament a right of initiative in this highly sensitive domain would throw the door wide open to party-political despotism."
"Do the European Socialists, who tabled this proposal, intend to react to every election in which the Left loses its majority by initiating a campaign of European ostracism against the new government?"
"I advise the House to beware of such a move and ask you to vote against this clause tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through the active commitment of Mr Chirac, the French Presidency of the Union has drawn Europe's attention to a series of issues which are of major importance for our future."
"This is why the work awaiting the protagonists of the Nice Summit will be challenging and high level, commensurate with the ambitious nature of the projects."
"President Prodi, it will not be easy for you, just as it will not be easy for the Heads of State and Government together with whom you will have to find a solution to the many issues under debate, including the vital enlargement, the reform of the institutions and the replacement of outdated mechanisms, and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is the first real step towards the European Constitution in which we believe."
"With regard to freedoms, individual rights and scientific research, the peoples and their representatives who are present in this and the national parliaments must have the final say."
"That, Mr President, is why we are launching an appeal in this House to prevent Brussels and Strasbourg being reduced to forums for national party political issues."
"We are here to build the Europe of the future which will completely reform outdated mechanisms and to establish a social market economy which will create employment and generate development."
"We cannot do this without the involvement and firm support of the peoples, who must see the European institution as the defender of their rights and the guarantor of their future, not as the seat of the bureaucracy and petty feuds of a limited, primitive political system."
"Let us all endeavour to ensure that Nice is not the end of the line but the launching pad for a major project."
"In short, we must all aim high, and, in order to do this, we must believe implicitly in what we are doing."
"Mr President, we Members of Forza Italia and the European People's Party believe in this project and we will be protagonists alongside you in the construction of a Europe of the citizens."
"Mr President, I wish firstly to thank the Members of the European Parliament for a very high standard of debate."
"A truly important and truly difficult European Council is coming up, and at such times a kind of tension can be felt generally. Sometimes it can even be discerned in certain newspaper articles and it comes as no surprise to experienced Europeans."
"This debate has been of a very high quality, very concise and very useful."
"It was also what I really came here to listen to."
"I shall take as much account of it as I can."
"I definitely intend to pass on the information to the President of the Republic, who will be chairing the Nice European Council, the Prime Minister, and my colleagues on the General Affairs Council next Monday."
"So in that respect it has been very useful."
"Despite that, although this exercise is also very useful because it raises many relevant questions and suggestions, I have to say that I found the overall tone excessively negative."
"I do not think the general tone of the speeches, while they were incredibly varied and rich in detail, genuinely reflects what Europe is really like today. Europe is in fact making progress, considerable progress."
"Of course I hear your concerns and respect them, but they do seem to some extent to be at odds with that considerable progress."
"To take the example of the agreement which has just been reached on fiscal harmonisation, and it was unanimous, that is an agreement we have been trying to get for years."
"I think it was first mentioned in 1989 actually."
"So - as one of you said, referring to American optimism and the way Americans talk about themselves - we should also be capable of valuing what is working well and what is making progress."
"As regards method, I honestly do not see what else the country holding the Presidency can do."
"Holding it does not give us any extra power or allow us to act in the place of the others. It brings responsibilities which we shoulder as best we can."
"I do not see what method could be adopted to deal with issues as complex as institutional affairs, other than taking the problems one by one, seeing what everyone' s position is, trying to identify what room there is to manoeuvre, asking everyone how flexible they can be, and making proposals which take account of that."
"All that can be done, but if the Presidency feels that its approach and ambitions are being blocked, it cannot disregard the positions of the Member States."
"That would not be democratic."
"Take the Charter - you are fully aware how active the French Presidency has been on that subject."
"Well, several Member States were against the very existence of the Charter if it were to have legal force and that had to be recognised."
"Some Member States were even against mentioning social affairs or new rights."
"So we had to move on, we had to compromise, remembering that Europe' s history is littered with political texts that have had major impact on political ideas, thought and progress, in some cases even when they do not have, or do not yet have, legal force."
"This is a perfect example of constructive compromise."
"Once we had reached agreement on a text - and this is a good text, very well drafted by the Convention, it reads well, it has style - some countries then said we must incorporate it into Article 6."
"As a country we support that view, but what do we do as a Presidency?"
"We proposed that during the discussions and several countries opposed it, threatening to withdraw their agreement to the very principle of the Charter if we insisted on Article 6."
"So it is not at all a case of not proclaiming it, and it is not a problem of transparency."
"Everything that is going on is totally transparent."
"Nothing is being concealed."
"Everything is being widely debated."
"You know everything about everything, but some countries only agreed to the text of the Charter on condition that it remains purely political."
"What can the Presidency do?"
"The countries making this an absolute condition cannot be excluded from the discussion."
"The Presidency must be democratic."
"You are always talking about democracy, but you have no monopoly on it. There is democracy in the General Affairs Council too, and in the European Council, at all the meetings, in all the debates."
"We have to take it into account."
"That is not a lack of ambition, in fact it is precisely because we have been very ambitious that we have been faced with strong resistance throughout this whole affair. It shows considerable ambition to tackle institutional reform."
"That strong resistance would not exist without strong ambitions."
"It is all related."
"We are doing our best, if I may say so."
"Consequently, I doubt if there is any other way of making progress apart from clarifying the position of each country on each issue and coming to the European Council with the most honest possible presentation of them, after trying to get them to shift of course."
"I would also say that I do not think there is a problem between 'larger and 'smaller' countries."
"I use those terms for convenience, but I never normally use them."
"I do not regard any country that belongs to the European Union as a small country, whatever its size, because its membership means that it too has influence over all the great issues, so the classic distinction is no longer entirely relevant today."
"The sense in which the press uses the terms is quite clear."
"In the matter of the Intergovernmental Conference, the only issue where people said there was a disagreement between larger and smaller countries lay with the Commission."
"That is inaccurate too, because the proposals made were not proposals by the larger countries to penalise the smaller ones."
"There was an appeal for everyone to make sacrifices, small, medium-sized and large countries."
"That was the starting point for the theory that there was a confrontation between the larger and smaller countries."
"That is groundless; that is wrong."
"It is not true on any of the three other important issues at the IGC and it is not true on any of the other issues at the Nice European Council."
"So that picture is inaccurate, and I think the sensible thing is to put it behind us."
"As regards what has been said on qualified majority voting, Mr Poettering will forgive me, but I thought it was a little bit facile to name just one country and act as if that country' s shift in its position relating to its own problems was sufficient to bring about a large shift in the others."
"That is exactly what we did as regards the Commission."
"In developing the idea that it would be advantageous in the future to have a Commission that was not too large to be effective and retained its full capabilities, especially its power of initiative, we demonstrated that we too were ready to make that sacrifice."
"Equal rotation affects big countries too, as actually at any given time they might not have a commissioner, just like everyone else."
"There is no discrimination."
"That shift in position did not spread."
"It did not prompt sacrifice by others."
"The same applies to qualified majority voting issues."
"At present twelve of the fifteen countries think there are issues where they cannot move to qualified majority voting, not now."
"They accept it in principle, they accept it for the long term, but they have legitimate democratic interests to defend, and in their view the right conditions are not yet in place."
"That is the situation the Presidency has to recognise."
"There is no link between the positions of the various parties."
"If one country has an internal problem, that does not make another country' s internal problem disappear."
"We have recognised that difficulty, regardless of our ambitions, and as a Presidency we have returned to it many times, at many meetings - we will return to it again at Sunday' s conclave - but I am here to tell you what the situation is."
"I cannot tell you exactly what you want to hear."
"I have to tell it like it is."
"We have done a great deal of work, but we have run up against the same old problem and I do not think a shift in a single country can start the ball rolling, because yet again we are faced with very tough national, political and democratic situations in twelve of the fifteen countries."
"Of course, we must try to make progress, because this is not satisfactory."
"It is not enough and between now and Nice we will make further efforts to identify what room there is for manoeuvre. All the same I wanted to make that point."
"I do not want to take up too much time."
"This has been a very interesting debate, but it has been a long one."
"We have another interesting debate ahead of us."
"I would simply appeal to you not to make a premature scapegoat of the Presidency-in-Office. There is no justification for that when the Council has not even taken place yet, and disappointment itself is premature because it is too early to come to any conclusions."
"I understand all about the waiting, the impatience, the hopes and ambitions."
"I understand all that, I am listening, I am taking account of it and I will try to ensure that we bear it in mind and apply it to the political decisions we face in the course of the difficult negotiations in Nice."
"It is not the French Presidency that is going to succeed or fail in Nice."
"There is nothing in the Treaties to say that the Presidency-in-Office can annexe the prerogatives and responsibilities of the other Member States, or the Commission, or Parliament, or anyone else. At Nice it is the Fifteen who must take responsibility."
"The Fifteen decided to start accession negotiations with twelve countries that want to move forward and want a more effective, stronger Europe at all levels."
"It is the Fifteen all together who will or will not find the clear, transparent and democratic answer to today' s problems."
"I am sure the Fifteen will find a solution to many of the problems you have raised with the Presidency."
"Thank you again and I know we can find the solution together."
"I think Parliament will be able to witness the establishment of the improved institutional mechanisms needed to handle the future development of the European Union which unites us all."
"Mr President, I would just briefly like to thank the President for presiding over the debate, Mr V√©drine for his speech and the Members of Parliament for this high-quality debate."
"At this point, I would just like to mention a few specific aspects of the next few days and emphasise the Commission's determination to achieve a high level Summit which will, at last, make it possible for our institutions to function properly once the great process of enlargement that we are undertaking has been accomplished. I would stress once again that this is one of the few major political decisions that the world is expecting in the near future."
"I would further stress that the Commission's determination will target not only the points we have just discussed but also the consideration and the attention that will be given to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I am quite aware that it will not become a Constitution overnight, but I also know full well that it will be a constant reference point for us from Nice onwards with regard to the principles according to which the European institutions are to proceed and the principles which the European peoples are to follow to unite in preparation for future cooperation."
"This is why it is so important that the Community method is consolidated at Nice, together with the value of the European institutions - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - and their ways of working together."
"Here, today, we may be showing too little regard for the fact that we are bound in a single process, that we are not a separate part of a system but a unifying element in the future Europe."
"To sum up, Mr V√©drine, you mentioned that the situation here appears to be too tense, and you also spoke of a certain pessimism."
"Well then, I would like to reply to your appeal with an appeal of my own."
"I am well aware that 15 countries will make the decisions at Nice and that the role of the Presidency is not to be a one-man-band, but I have also learned through experience what the role of the Presidency and the responsibility of the French Presidency are."
"In recent weeks, we have with great confidence and responsibility presented the French Presidency with a series of major decisions to be taken, aware of the role that France has consistently played in advancing the progress of the European institutions."
"Although, as you rightly said, we cannot place all the responsibility upon France, we do know that France must demonstrate its great leadership abilities as a driving force by example."
"There are two points, which it is my responsibility to stress unequivocally for they emerged this evening as very heated and very important."
"With regard to the reweighting of votes, it is France's responsibility to propose what is to be the fundamental balance between large and small countries, the balance between the population and the strength of each individual country: it is France which must find the way forward in the construction of a Europe which is the Europe of both peoples and nations, and this is what we expect from the Presidency."
"But we also expect something else from France."
"We are quite aware that France is not the only country in the deadlock of incompatibilities and decisions."
"There are France, Spain, Germany: all the countries save Belgium and Italy have reasons for being unwilling to change from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting."
"However, in my opinion, the Presidency's role is of fundamental importance in this case as well, because I am quite aware that, if France is able to interpret the general interest with regard to the decisions on Article 133, none of the other countries will be able to resist the change."
"We are all awaiting this step forward for it is not a step forward just for France but for the whole of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"This Minister, is what we expect from France, inspired precisely by the great confidence which we have in your country and in the leadership ability that we know France can display at difficult times in Europe's progress."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much Mr President of the Commission."
"To conclude these statements, I have received nine motions for resolutions from eight groups, in accordance with Rule 37, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure.."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"As the President, Mrs Fontaine, announced at the beginning of the sitting, we will now proceed to the debate on the procedural motions."
"I wish to refer to the disgraceful demonstration that took place in the Foreign Affairs Committee of this Parliament yesterday morning when the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs was involved in discussions with us."
"A number of members of a Marxist-Leninist group tried to disrupt the meeting and threatened the Chairman."
"This was an abuse of this Parliament's proceedings, a gross discourtesy to a distinguished guest and an event that could have had very serious consequences."
"Mr President, will you please instruct the Quaestors to identify the culprits, to identify how they obtained access to the Parliament and ensure that they are banned from future access."
"Will you also take steps generally to tighten security in appropriate ways so that there could be no recurrence."
"It is sometimes difficult to get legitimate visitors and groups into this building but those with malign intentions seem to have no difficulty."
"We began this session by expressing our condolences for the latest victim of terrorism in Spain."
"It would seem that those responsible for the demonstration in the Foreign Affairs Committee may have connections with a Turkish terrorist group."
"I am sure that all in this House will join me in condemning all terrorism whatever its alleged motivation."
"In relation to Turkey, we are making many demands of the Turkish Government and people as they embark on the long road to accession to the European Union."
"At the same time, we expect that opposition groups in Turkey will resort exclusively to peaceful means."
"I shall be placing a declaration to this effect before the House and I trust all Members will give it their support."
"Mr President, I would be grateful if you would report back to the House on the points that I have raised."
"Mr President, I should like to endorse Mr Van Orden's statement."
"Yesterday, two people broke into the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee, interrupted the proceedings and threatened our guest, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, both verbally and physically."
"It was a dangerous situation."
"As far as I am aware, the two intruders obtained access to the House on the authority of a lady Member of Parliament."
"I shall give the President the name of the Member in question and ask her to investigate the matter and to take appropriate measures with a view to preventing such disruptive and aggressive individuals from entering the House. The shocking thing is that this incident took place with the aid of a Member of this House."
"I find it absolutely scandalous that Members of Parliament can stoop to such methods."
"I should like to put a second point to the Bureau."
"In our present situation, we shall continue to have problems with the safety of our guests."
"I believe that we must take action, which we certainly have not done to any extent hitherto, in order to ensure that the guests of Parliament can feel like guests in this House and that they need have no fear of being subjected to threatening behaviour."
"To that end, we must put the requisite organisational and security structure in place, which also means our guests being directly protected by people who are trained for that purpose, because we naturally cannot employ foreign security staff to escort our guests."
"I believe we face a new challenge here, to which I ask the Bureau to respond."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to express our wholehearted support for the Chairman of the Committee."
"It is not a matter of curbing the right to demonstrate - absolutely not - nor do we intend to make the House into a high-security wing; it is a matter of establishing an essential minimum level of security."
"We shall not have any more foreign guests at our committee meetings if we cannot offer them the minimum security cover that will guarantee their safety."
"We had both the President of a nation and the Foreign Minister of Turkey at our committee meeting when this incident occurred."
"Please take this very seriously, so that we can continue to receive guests in future and so that we can treat them as guests ought to be treated."
"Mr President, I was not aware of this incident."
"I am totally opposed to anyone at all threatening an invited Minister, even a Turkish one."
"Since we are talking about Turkey, however, I should like to point out that a Member of Parliament from my group, Mrs Uca, was representing my group until yesterday at the congress of one of Turkey' s Kurdish parties, HADEP."
"She was unfortunate enough to utter a few words in the Kurdish language before coming to her national tongue, which is German."
"The Turkish police force immediately prevented her from speaking not just in Kurdish, which in any case she had ceased to do, but even in German, and there had to be negotiations before she was able to pass on a message of greetings from my group in German."
"Virtually the same day, a leader from the Cypriot Parliament, who has, moreover, already visited the European Parliament, Mr Christou, was refused a Turkish visa even though he was travelling, if you can believe it, to a tripartite meeting in Istanbul between Turks, Greeks and Cypriots, in a totally peaceable context."
"I therefore urge you, Mr President, to please ask Mrs Fontaine, as President of Parliament, to send a letter to the Turkish authorities, certainly in order to apologise for this shabby treatment of one of their representatives but also to remind them that Members of the European Parliament or indeed members of the candidate countries travelling to their country should not be treated in this way."
"Hospitality over here and hospitality and respect over there."
"I would like to associate my group with this complaint about this very serious and indeed frightening incident."
"I would say to Mr Wurtz that it is a part of the process of trying to open up the prospect of European integration for Turkey that we show them the sanctity and power of parliamentary democracy."
"If we cherish it inside this place, we should certainly be prepared to welcome and secure our guests in a very much more credible fashion than we showed ourselves able to do yesterday."
"If we are not proud of our Parliament, we cannot expect the Turks to copy us."
"Mr President, I should like to draw both your and the House's attention to the incident which Mr Wurtz referred to, i.e. the fact that the Turkish Government refused a visa to the Cypriot member of parliament and parliamentary representative of AKEL, Andreas Christou, who was due to attend a meeting of Turkish, Greek and Cypriot parties in Istanbul."
"Andreas Christou, I may add, is the deputy chairman of the Cypriot parliament's delegation to the EU-Cyprus joint parliamentary committee."
"I would like, on behalf of the Communist Party of Greece, to express our outrage and horror at the latest act of provocation on the part of Turkey, a candidate country for membership of the European Union, and to join in the call for a protest to be made in the name of the European Parliament."
"I can inform you that Mrs Fontaine - this has just been communicated to me and I should like to echo the sentiment on behalf of the Bureau - deeply deplores this grave incident."
"It goes without saying that we in this house of European democracy must guarantee the safety of all our guests and anyone who spends time within these four walls."
"Naturally, freedom of expression must be respected too."
"Our President, Mrs Fontaine, has now asked the Secretary General for a report."
"This report will, of course, be considered as quickly as possible."
"Based on the findings of this report, the President will not hesitate to take the required measures and also to involve the organs of this Parliament that need to be involved, such as the quaestors or the Bureau, for example."
"Mr President, a few days ago, in Bari, the capital of the region of Puglia, which is one of the most important regions of Italy, the President of the Regional Council, Mr Raffaele Fitto, who was a Member of this Parliament until June last year, was attacked and beaten up."
"This is evidence of the way verbal violence leads to physical violence."
"I feel that, in addition to expressing sympathy towards a leading figure, an important Italian political leader who has also been a Member of this House, Parliament must firmly condemn such incidents and show its solidarity with the victims."
"Thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani."
"We will duly take note of what you have said."
"Mr President, I am just taking the floor to inform you that a delegation of workers from Telecom Italia is present in Parliament today."
"Telecom Italia is a leading company in the telecommunications sector."
"These workers have come to Parliament to present a petition bearing over 10 000 signatures, calling precisely for the support of the European institutions."
"This is because they have been made redundant by their company despite the fact that it is economically sound and that it has been expanding for some years."
"Telecom Italia is therefore a company which raises its prices and cuts jobs."
"In recent weeks, in recent days, we have been discussing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the rights of workers."
"It would therefore be appropriate for Parliament to endeavour to avoid there being such a huge discrepancy between its fine declarations of principles and harsh reality."
"Therefore, what we want from Parliament and the Commission are greater endeavours to protect workers and fight unemployment."
"Mr President, there was an extremely serious occurrence in Italy yesterday."
"On the grounds that pills do no harm and that ""Marijuana is a treatment for tumours"", the Minister for Health undermined the dignity of the individual by calling for the drug to be legalised."
"All this has happened while we are preparing for Nice with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the preamble to which affirms that the European Union is founded on the indivisible, universal principle of human dignity."
"The incident also coincides with a Community action programme on the prevention of drug addiction which, precisely because it is a preventive action, identifies the drug as a phenomenon which should certainly be avoided and, I feel, should not be supported."
"Pino Arlacchi, Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the UN Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, condemned the Italian Minister for Health's speech, for the Minister was clearly ignorant of the good news on prevention recorded in the United States, Spain and even Bolivia and Peru, and Mr Arlacchi called upon the Italian government ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"At the beginning of today's sitting, Madame President paid homage to the memory of Ernest Lluch."
"In 1966, Ernest Lluch, his brother and myself, with more than 60 other members of the teaching staff were expelled by the Francoist regime from the University of Barcelona."
"From that time on, in spite of our different political opinions, I recognised the sincere commitment of Ernest Lluch in the struggle for dialogue and understanding, even facing the authoritarian position of the present government."
"The best homage to Ernest Lluch and to his memory would be to respect his message - d√¨aleg in Catalan - can we all give this a chance in the Basque country?"
"Thank you very much, Mr Gorostiaga."
"Would you please sit down and remove that sign."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the President' s attention to a letter that we sent in connection with the Statute for Members of Parliament."
"In this letter, Mrs Hautala made mention of our support and sympathy for the efforts undertaken by the President, Mrs Fontaine, to set up negotiations on our own Statute as MEPs."
"It is therefore a matter of the deepest regret to us that a meeting that was planned for 30 November was cancelled."
"We urge you in the strongest terms to call another meeting before the end of the French Presidency, so that the discussion about the Statute can be brought to a successful conclusion."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Maes."
"I will communicate this to Mrs Fontaine, who will take the necessary steps."
"Mr President, last year the Council took an excellent initiative to create the first European Union forum on human rights."
"This excellent initiative was repeated this year and the second forum will be held on 12 and 13 December in Paris, which is to say at the same time as the European Parliament' s part-session in Strasbourg."
"This is, at the very least, poor manners with regard to the European Parliament, if not an outright snub, and, allowing for the possibility that the Members of the European Parliament have nothing to say about human rights, even though they have voted, by a very large majority, in favour of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, they will be absent from this European Union forum which many of them attended last year in order to debate with NGOs and institutions."
"I would therefore urge that, in response, our official representatives are not sent to this forum, and that, next year, a date should be agreed when Members of Parliament may attend, which means the dates of the Strasbourg sittings should be avoided when scheduling this important meeting."
"You are right, Mr Cornille."
"This must be arranged differently in the future where possible."
"Mr President, when Mr Gorostiaga uses the word ""dialogue"" in his tribute to the murdered Ernest Lluch, he is insulting his memory and insulting the ideas for which ETA murdered him."
"Mr Gorostiaga, I have profound contempt for the terrorists of ETA, but the people who use this democratic Parliament in a cowardly fashion to justify the murders they commit deserve the same contempt."
"Mr Gorostiaga, you are a disgrace to this Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to debate a single issue here."
"On the other hand of course, everyone can have their say."
"Mr President, I do not want to get involved in controversy, but I feel that I really must mention the fact that, on a day when we have kept a minute' s silence to mark another murder by ETA, there is somebody in this House who wishes to defend dialogue with the very people who murdered Mr Lluch."
"I think it is disgraceful - as Mrs D√≠ez has said - that the memory of Ernest Lluch should be used in this way."
"I think that this House now knows perfectly well what it can expect from Mr Gorostiaga, from the group he represents and from his terrorist friends."
"However, I would like to ask Mr Gorostiaga whether he still has a sufficient trace of personal dignity, of dignity as a man, for us to ask him to respect human life."
"I want to answer the awful action of both colleagues in this Parliament who presented ideas opposite to those of Ernest Lluch."
"He was always fighting for dialogue, he desired dialogue."
"I would say only that every action of ETA prompts ..."
"Mr Gorostiaga, I am going to interrupt you there."
"We have now said enough on that score."
"Common foreign and security policy - Afghanistan"
"The next item is the joint debate on two reports and two oral questions:"
"(A5-0340/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy;"
"(A5-0339/2000) by Mrs Lalumi√®re, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the establishment of a common European security and defence policy after Cologne and Helsinki (2000/2005(INI));"
"(B5-0549/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan."
"(B5-0550/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Commission, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council - whom I address today in your capacity as President of the Council of Defence Ministers - Commissioner, I believe that the development of our foreign, security and defence policy has generally been extremely encouraging over the past year."
"Since we are always taking the Commission and the Council to task here, let me say from the outset that I should like to congratulate them today, because the manner in which this week's decisions have gradually implemented the Cologne and Helsinki declarations is the result of some excellent work, for which I wish to compliment all participants."
"Following our painful experiences in the former Yugoslavia, experiences which showed that peacekeeping and civilian crisis management are ineffectual if they are not accompanied by a clear message that they can be enforced by military means if the need arises, the Governments of the fifteen Member States, the Council and the Commission learned their lessons and have now made considerable progress."
"I hope that the implementation of these decisions will not remain a mere paper exercise but that it will also be reflected in the appropriations in national budgets, which is where the executive power lies in this case."
"There is no use in having a hundred thousand troops if they are all lame and blind."
"Our troops are rendered lame by the fact that the European Union and its Member States do not possess the necessary transport capacities."
"They will be blind for as long as we do not have the essential intelligence facilities, such as satellite systems, which would make it possible to deploy these troops as wisely and effectively as circumstances dictate."
"At the same time, we also agree that the sequence of responses is correct."
"The use of military force is the last resort."
"Our main task is to ensure, by means of a judicious policy of prevention and astute civilian crisis management, that it is never necessary to use military force."
"To this end, I believe that we must also initiate close cooperation between the institutions of the European Union and the Member States."
"The Community is largely responsible today for civilian crisis management and prevention as well as for all the associated instruments."
"The European Union has four times as much money in its budget for foreign aid as the United States."
"Many important aspects of trade policy lie within the purview of the Commission."
"I believe that, if this interaction between the civilian and military authorities is to work, we must ensure that there is no institutionalised duplication of effort or duality of purpose but that the civilian and military efforts are yoked together."
"In point of fact, before Amsterdam both the European Parliament and the Commission took the view that it would be best to have a Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for foreign policy who would also assume the role of the High Representative and would have a special obligation to and link with the Council."
"This did not prove to be politically acceptable, which is why we now have two figures, both of whom perform sterling work in their own way."
"The problems do not lie with them, but rather in the institutional ramifications, and we must try to keep such problems to an absolute minimum."
"This view, moreover, also relates to the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament very much wants to be involved in the formulation and pursuit of this policy, as the Treaties prescribe - and perhaps the Treaty of Nice will improve the relevant provisions - and as is laid down in the interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on the budgetary responsibilities of the European Parliament in matters of foreign and security policy."
"To be precise, civilian crisis management also lies within the budgetary responsibility of the European Parliament and, naturally, of the Council too, whereas defence policy remains a budgetary responsibility of the national parliaments, because the armed forces are not yet European forces but are still subject to their national governments and parliaments."
"Mobilisation orders are also a national responsibility, because each country takes a sovereign decision as to whether or not it will participate in a joint operation."
"Now that this division of responsibilities is crystal clear, we must ensure that we create a negotiating level between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, so that we as parliamentarians, through exchanges of information at various levels, are able to monitor the national executives in an appropriate way."
"Decision making on foreign, security and defence policies is the task of the executive branch."
"We decide on the money and check whether it is being spent wisely and whether prudent policies are being pursued."
"I believe that a sound strategy will be developed on this basis."
"Talks are already taking place between the European Parliament and the national parliaments on this subject with a view to ensuring that the system develops in a rational manner."
"When I speak of organisation, I also mean that the European Union, which makes such strenuous efforts in this field, should be given a corresponding degree of responsibility."
"I can see that things are not working sufficiently well in Kosovo, for example, and that we shall soon need a coordinator for the coordinators, because so many institutions are involved - not the European institutions but many others - and we must get that under control."
"I only included this as one small aspect of my report; it is covered by Mrs Lalumi√®re's report, which focuses far more sharply on this point."
"But we know that, in many parts of the world, such as the Middle East or Southern Asia, where the Kashmir conflict is a potential tinderbox, the international community is waiting for the European Union to be able to engage in mediation, so that there will be more shoulders to share the burden of responsibility in this domain."
"For this reason, we bear a high degree of responsibility for safeguarding peace, both here in Europe and in the world at large."
"I hope that this new mechanism will gradually enhance our ability to meet that responsibility."
"In this context, Mr President of the Council, I also believe that in Afghanistan in particular, a country we ought to speak about here, we should play our part in ensuring that firstly a stop can, at long last, be put to the trail of murder which has plagued that country for decades and which a barbarous regime is now pursuing against its own people and secondly in ensuring that the people in Afghanistan are able to live in a rational, peaceful and socially just world."
"We should try to make our contribution there too."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, Commissioner, in dealing with European Security and Defence Policy this afternoon, we are, as President Brok just said, in a field where we can be optimistic about the construction of Europe."
"Since the Cologne European Council, at Helsinki and Feira and tomorrow, I hope, at the Nice Council, we have been able to follow the progress of this new policy with pleasure."
"Things do not often turn out that way, Minister, and we are delighted."
"On 15 June before the Feira Summit, the European Parliament passed a resolution, and tomorrow, on the eve of the Nice Council, it has to vote on a text summarising its position."
"Obviously I hope a clear majority will support the motion for a resolution."
"I already know the vote will not be unanimous and that is not surprising, because this is difficult ground where differing political options are expressed on the role of the European Union as opposed to that of its Member States, on the place of the soldier as opposed to the civilian, on the place of the European Union as opposed to NATO and the United States, on the role of the European Union in the world and the choice it has to make between pacifism and non-intervention, on the one hand, and the will to deal with crises, on the other."
"These choices sometimes divide us, but now gradually a majority is taking shape."
"Barring accidents, that majority should support the line taken for a year and a half by the Council of Ministers, the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Commission, especially in Commissioner Patten' s area of responsibility, in charge of civilian crisis management resources, but associated with that support, which I hope is clear and lucid, there are many questions, sometimes warnings, and I shall consider some of them here."
"First, a brief comment on a crucial issue: the relationship between the new European policy and NATO."
"We have discussed this at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"The proposed text confirms the decisions of the European Council."
"This is not about competing with NATO or usurping its responsibility for defending our territory, it is about turning Europe into a credible partner of the United States by establishing a new balance in the Alliance and giving the European Union a margin of autonomy in the event of a crisis."
"Secondly, you will note that the resolution affirms Parliament' s clear intention to place the security and defence policy squarely on two complementary pillars: civilian crisis management and, should that fail, military crisis management."
"This concern for balance means Parliament will be monitoring the fair division of financial resources carefully, although we are well aware that the first comes under the Community budget and the second is still covered by national budgets."
"Thirdly, we are glad to see the CESDP starting off with a tangible achievement, the Rapid Reaction Force."
"And we are pleased with the work done so far, especially at the recent Capabilities Commitment Conference."
"All that has the merit of making this policy credible."
"This is also the time to take an inventory of the state of our armies and consolidate the will for reform, which I noted recently in Berlin as regards the German army."
"On the institutional reforms you have undertaken, I would like to stress that we want the European Union to have a coherent, clear and effective chain of command."
"It is not enough to create bodies like the PSC, the Military Committee and the Military Staff; the vertical and horizontal links between the various bodies must also function properly and in real time."
"We do not feel entirely reassured on this point and in particular we would like to have the crisis powers of the Commission, the Council and the High Representative specified precisely."
"Briefly, Mr President, I would like to mention a major problem for the credibility of this policy - budgetary resources."
"Of course, savings must be made, but we cannot exclude the need for new resources if we want to fill the gaps found in the inventory, especially in high-tech areas."
"Mr President, like Mr Brok, I would like to stress the role of the European Parliament and the parliamentary institutions."
"There is so much more to say, but I want the Council' s representatives to know that the European Parliament is keen to adopt this unfamiliar culture of security and defence, and we hope the Nice Summit is a great success."
"In discussing Madame Lalumi√®re's comprehensive and interesting report on the common European security and defence policy in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we concentrated on the institutions and decision-making procedures. In particular the need for parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability."
"The development of the ESDP is a major new departure for the European project and therefore needs to have the existing institutional framework clarified."
"Whether there are legal arguments that existing powers are adequate is not really the issue."
"It should be clear that the parliamentary dimension should be introduced."
"No member of a national parliament would consider for a moment having limited and anything but transparent democratic scrutiny of security and defence."
"Within the limits of operational security even the US Senate and House are closely involved with the operations of the Department of Defence."
"Because of the particular nature of the possible developments of the CESDP, we also believe that Treaty changes will be needed so that such developments can be conducted openly and democratically."
"Similarly the status of the High Representative must be clarified in relation to the existing triangle and the Commissioner responsible for external relations."
"Mr President, you will be aware perhaps that my Party in the UK have considerable reservations about the thrust of this policy but I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Constitutional Affairs Committee for guiding me into producing an opinion that I hope will be acceptable to this distinguished House."
". (FR) Mr President, given our late start and my commitments afterwards, I shall try to make the speech that I had prepared a little shorter."
"It was to be quite long, but I shall endeavour not to omit anything crucial."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the publication of the reports by Mrs Lalumi√®re and Mr Brok gives me the opportunity to present you with a preliminary assessment of the major developments that have taken place over the last few months in these areas."
"First of all, in the field of foreign and security policy, I shall assess the main institutional developments and more specifically issues relating to the European defence system and Mr Alain Richard, Minister for Defence, will speak in greater detail about all the aspects to do with military capabilities."
"I shall then give a summary of the main results of the CFSP over the last six months."
"I shall also answer, or I shall try to answer, Mr Brok' s oral question on Afghanistan."
"First of all, enhancing the common foreign and security policy."
"As Mr Brok pointed out a moment ago, the European Union has asserted its position over the last year and this has been backed up by developments that will prove to be extremely important for the future."
"I feel that the best example of this is the very rapid development of a European defence system."
"Following the German, Finnish and Portuguese Presidencies, the French Presidency has sought to fulfil the mandate given to it at Feira."
"Nice will, I think, mark a major stage and achievement in this field, in large part through the creation of permanent structures for a European defence system which should enable the European Union, in the course of 2001, to declare itself operationally capable of managing a crisis."
"The issue of military capabilities will be dealt with by Mr Richard, in a moment."
"The institutional aspects are also extremely important, because they will allow the Union to make plans, to take decisions and to act; in other words, to take political control and maintain strategic leadership of a crisis management operation."
"At Nice, the European Council is due to adopt several decisions, which I shall now discuss."
"First of all, the creation of permanent political and military structures, a political and security committee, a military committee and a European Union defence staff."
"The mechanism created as a result of these decisions will be complemented by establishing procedures for crisis management and the establishment of an operations centre in the Secretariat-General."
"As was laid down at Feira, these new structures will be put in place as soon as possible following the Nice Council."
"The next issue is ongoing arrangements with third countries and NATO."
"You all know how important these agreements are and we therefore need to establish relationships of trust and cooperation with NATO, with the candidate countries and with allied countries, whilst fully respecting the autonomy of the European Union."
"These relationships will, in particular, take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the iPSC and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European candidate and/or ally countries."
"We have also worked on enhancing civilian crisis management capabilities, in order especially to enable the European Union to achieve the objective that it has set for itself in the field of policing."
"I would also like to mention, in response to the comments made by Mrs Lalumi√®re in her report on the need to improve our research into conflict prevention, that recommendations have been drawn up by the High Representative and by the Commission on improving the coherence and effectiveness of action in this field, and I know that the Swedish Presidency will continue to work towards this goal."
"I also noted, in Mr Brok' s report, a number of questions and remarks on increasing the effectiveness of the European Union' s external action."
"This is one of the dossiers into which I personally put in a great deal of work."
"I hoped that we would make progress in this field, because the situation was clearly unsatisfactory."
"That was also the reason why, at the informal meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs at Evian at the beginning of September, I put this issue on the agenda and why we devoted a whole sitting to it, on the basis of Commissioner Patten' s proposals and plans."
"We have made considerable progress since then."
"On 9 October, the General Affairs Council adopted conclusions on increasing coordination and improving management and the instruments necessary for decision-making."
"The Council decided to hold an annual debate on these issues and the first such debate will take place after the January or February session."
"We will then assess the issue of when these new measures are to be first implemented."
"I would emphasise that this whole process has been carried out with full cooperation and perfect agreement between the Council in general, the High Representative, the Commission, and particularly, Commissioner Patten."
"As Mr Brok hopes in his report, the Council will have files summarising all of the relationships between the Union and each partner country, in order to gain greater benefit from the Union' s overall effort, to increase its efficiency and to provide better preparation for its discussions on external action."
"For the first debate, at the beginning of next year, the Commission will draw up a scoreboard, country by country, for the past budgetary year, which will show the current state of commitments, payments, and outstanding amounts for the main programmes funded by the Community budget and by the EDF."
"In this work, therefore, we have been very aware of the need for the Commission and the Member States to achieve greater complementarity in their aid actions for third countries whilst preserving, of course, the specific competences of the Commission."
"This applies to the actions of the traditional Member State administrations as well as to the specialist agencies."
"I now wish to say a few words about the new instruments established by the Treaty of Amsterdam and about interinstitutional relations, which are both subjects on which, I noted, your reports expressed some concern."
"Three common strategies have been adopted since May 1999, on Russia, on Ukraine and on the Mediterranean region."
"The Presidency has now asked the Secretary-General - the High Representative - to draw up a preliminary assessment report on how these common strategies are functioning and on their optimal use."
"This report is due to be presented at the debate at the beginning of next year that I mentioned."
"I should like briefly to talk about interinstitutional relations."
"I am aware of the discussion to which Mr Brok alluded just now, according to which the duties of the High Representative ought to have been allocated to a Vice-President of the Commission."
"But, as you yourself make the point, Mr Brok, since taking office and in the spirit that the various presidencies have sought to maintain, Mr Solana' s way of working has been fully compliant with the rules and procedures laid down by the Treaty."
"There has been coordination, no major difficulties have arisen and, to put it in plain terms, things are going well."
"We have shown on several major problems that we have faced in this period that we have achieved close and constructive cooperation between all the institutions."
"If we take the events in the Balkans as an example, it can be said that everyone played their role to the full."
"We are definitely seeing a real policy in this region of south-eastern Europe, which is furthermore beginning to bear fruit."
"I come now to a quick preliminary and, of course, still provisional assessment of the actions undertaken under the French Presidency in order to ensure a higher profile for the European Union in the international arena."
"I shall therefore quickly look at a few regions and a few events."
"I shall continue with the Balkans, since I was speaking about that region a moment ago."
"The situation there has altered radically with the change of power in Belgrade, even if, of course, much remains to be done."
"We had a genuine European strategy, which consisted of sending at the right time, in other words before the elections, a message to the Serbian people which had been drafted at Evian, announcing that if democracy won the day, European policy would be radically revised."
"Democracy did win the day, after all the ups and downs, with which we are all familiar."
"We have therefore kept our promise and the leaders of today' s Yugoslavia tell us that the message from the European Union played a genuine role in that affair at that time."
"We are therefore part of that course of events, which was entirely logical."
"We have undertaken to re-establish relations in all areas with Yugoslavia."
"This does not mean that we consider all the problems to have been solved."
"We are fully aware that with regard to Kosovo and Montenegro, with regard to Yugoslavia' s relations with its neighbouring countries and to its obligations to the International Court of Justice, much remains to be done or resolved. What it does mean, however, is that the European Union did consider it to be crucial to commit fully itself to supporting this movement towards democracy until it has completely achieved its objectives, until it is consolidated and can then wholeheartedly commit itself to redefining a new policy for Yugoslavia, particularly with regard to its neighbours."
"This is the context that explains why the summit held recently in Zagreb was so important."
"It had been devised against a different backdrop, in order to send a message to the Serbian people, bypassing their then leaders."
"The changes that have taken place enabled us to make the Zagreb Summit a first real democratic meeting of the whole European Union and all the representatives of the Western Balkan countries."
"We also applied ourselves to the issue of regional cooperation, an idea that met with a degree of resistance from the countries in the region that do not wish to be locked into a past from which they have broken free, and I think I can say that, as a result of this summit, they understood that there was no contradiction between regional cooperation and their progress and rapprochement in relation to the European Union, largely through the stabilisation and association process which was confirmed and laid down on that occasion."
"This summit, which was an initiative by the French Presidency, also enabled us to restate our commitment to that region, as, shortly before the summit, we had taken the necessary decisions on the major programmes for both the Mediterranean and the Balkan regions. The summit also gave us the opportunity to confirm that the new Balkans programme, which is known as ""CARDS"" , has been allocated EUR 4.15 billion for the 2000-2006 period."
"Much then remains to be done, both in terms of consolidating democracy and in terms of regional cooperation, but we now have a framework and a sense of direction and I think that the European Union now knows where it is going in this area."
"In parallel and at the same time, the European Union has continued to develop relations with major strategic partners such as Russia."
"Consequently, an EU-Russia Summit was held on 30 October, under the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Our policy is quite clear: we want, on the basis of principles of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and the market economy, to provide the most useful incentives and support for the huge changes undertaken by Russia, for it to become, eventually - and it will take as long as necessary - a great country, which is developing, which is modernising at every level and which is peace-loving, in short, the kind of country that we would be happy to have as our neighbour."
"All instruments for cooperation with Russia, both Community and national, must be directed towards this."
"An EU-Ukraine Summit also took place, on 15 September, and the fruitful political dialogue that resulted is now being extended to issues of conventional arms exports, security and disarmament, a subject highlighted by the OSCE as being a problem where Ukraine is concerned."
"It is therefore desirable that this country should be included in this dialogue."
"I wish to say to Mr Brok, who expressed concern at this, that the issue of more tangible cooperation with Ukraine, under the CFSP for example, will be addressed in the report to be presented at Nice on the arrangements that will enable our partners to contribute to military crisis management led by the European Union."
"Moreover, Ukraine is making a special effort with regard to this issue as, since 1 July, it has acted on 15 declarations made by the presidency on behalf of the European Union."
"We have also been maintaining transatlantic dialogue on the Balkans, in which the whole policy implemented by the European Union has been the subject of constant information passing in both directions between the United States and Europe. We have also maintained dialogue on Russia and on the Middle East peace process, even if my comments apply more to the period preceding the tragic events that have taken place since the end of September than to the most recent events."
"During this period we have also kept the United States fully informed of developments in European security and defence policy, which is essential if this policy is to develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment."
"Dialogue under this presidency has not yet finished as a summit is scheduled to take place in Washington on 18 December and in Ottawa the following day."
"We encountered a problem with the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles, as many of our Arab partners found it difficult to take part in the meeting in the current climate."
"Nevertheless, we did hold the meeting and they did eventually take part, with two exceptions."
"I think that the way in which the work was carried out and the intensity of the debates that were held on this very sensitive issue justified holding the meeting. What was at stake, and this was the reason for insisting on holding the meeting, was the continuation of the Barcelona process, which remains so important, even though it has suffered as a result of the situation in the Middle East."
"Nevertheless, it remains a powerful concept for the future, a long-term strategic idea that we must not allow to be undermined by the current tragedies, however heartrending they may be."
"The meeting did, therefore, take place and at this meeting we announced the budgetary appropriations for MEDA II for the period 2000-2006, which come to EUR 5.35 billion. To this figure we can add the loans that the EIB has planned to set aside, making a total of around EUR 13 billion."
"This demonstrates the substantial reality of the European Union' s commitment to this region."
"With regard to the Middle East, the Presidency remains in constant contact with all the key players, even through the most difficult times."
"We managed to ensure, for the first time, that Javier Solana was allowed to participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh Summit, held on 17 October."
"We spoke on behalf of the Fifteen in Marseilles, though this was not the main purpose of the Marseilles meeting, which was to save the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"On 20 November, the European Union once again expressed its views on the situation in the Middle East, in harsher terms which the deteriorating situation on the ground called for."
"We remain fully committed and we can achieve a number of things in the coming days and weeks."
"The most urgent issue remains the one you are concerned about, which is first and foremost an end to the violence and for both sides to be able to resume discussions on the basic issues directly."
"Moreover, Javier Solana is a member of the fact-finding committee that is meeting in New York on Sunday, which we hope will set to work very quickly."
"I plan to go there myself, on behalf of the presidency, after Nice, in connection with the work to be undertaken by this fact-finding committee."
"The French Presidency has striven to develop relations between the Union and the other great regional blocs and has held many meetings with Asian countries. There has been the third ASEM Summit, the summit with Japan and the one with China."
"Previously, a summit was held with India, under the Portuguese Presidency, and a ministerial meeting will be taking place with ASEAN."
"We encountered a small problem with the issue of North Korea, but I wish to state here that we must make a distinction between the issue of establishing diplomatic relations, which may have appeared rather confused at times, but which is not the real underlying issue, since some countries have maintained relations for a long time while others have not."
"We decided to work on the content of our policy towards North Korea and, on 20 November, we adopted guidelines for that country and the European troika has been able to visit North Korea on the basis of this approach."
"Our dialogue with Africa has been very active at all levels, at ministerial level too, particularly with CDAO, but also with SADC."
"This is moreover the case at this very moment."
"Dialogue with Latin America has continued both in New York, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and on more specific points, such as the support provided by the European Union for the peace process initiated by President Pastrana of Columbia, and for his social, economic and institutional programmes."
"I would not want to conclude this summary without mentioning the Union' s action on what are today known as the great global or cross-sectoral dossiers, particularly in the field of human rights, where work is still necessary to improve the coherence of European policy in international bodies and to involve civil society more closely."
"We have continued with the effort that was started previously."
"The second edition of the European Union' s annual report on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament and a human rights forum will be held in Paris on 13 December."
"Furthermore, the French Presidency has continued with the policy of promoting and upgrading disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and has played an active role in the conference on the illegal trade in light and small-calibre weapons to be held in 2001."
"The Presidency has also drafted the second annual report on the implementation of the European code of conduct on arms exports, which has led to real progress and is due to be adopted by the General Affairs Council on 4 December."
"As you see - and I have simplified this presentation considerably - European Union activity in these fields is developing apace and all of our partners throughout the world attach a great deal of importance to this fact."
"I shall finish with a few words to the effect that the Council shares the concerns expressed by Mr Brok about Afghanistan."
"I would remind you that the Union is implementing measures on the basis of a common position of January 2000, which are as follows: a complete ban on arms supplies, pressure to be exerted on all sides, support for the attempts by the international community and individuals within Afghanistan to provide mediation, the fight against drugs and aid for the civil population."
"The Commission would certainly have something to say about these matters if we had the time, but to put it simply, all the efforts that we are actively making, because it truly is a long-suffering country, will never be effective unless all of the neighbouring countries, or the countries that are involved in some way or another and have some influence in Afghanistan, decide once and for all to stop intervening and interfering."
"Since this has yet to happen, the Taliban regime remains immune to the arguments and pressure applied from abroad."
"I wish I could say that our pressure and our action are having some effect on the current situation, but unfortunately the Afghan situation appears to remain somehow self-sufficient and resistant to all such action."
"This is not, however, going to put us off."
"We must continue with these actions and I know that many Members of this Parliament here today are very aware of this."
"We shall therefore continue our work in this area."
"This is a specific point, Mr President but a specific question was asked, and so I wished to provide this type of answer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I speak to you today, I am aware of taking part in a key turning point in the life of Europe, because this is, I think, the first time that a Minister of Defence has addressed your Parliament."
"On 24 October, I reviewed the progress of a European defence system with your Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I am delighted to continue in this vein by talking to you today about the results of our conference on military commitments of 20 November."
"I wish, first of all, to express my agreement with the wording of your resolution of 21 November on the European security and defence policy."
"You claim that this policy does not aim to compete with the North Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the foundation of the collective defence of its members, or to establish a permanent European army."
"The Presidency and, I believe, all our governments share this view."
"Our aim is to gain the capability, by 2003, of coordinating our armies to fulfil the Petersberg tasks, should the Council decide to launch a military operation on behalf of the Union."
"In the vital area of military capability, at Helsinki, our States set themselves the overall target of being in a position, by 2003, to deploy within 60 days and to sustain for at least one year, forces of up to the size of an army corps, in other words, 60 000 soldiers."
"These forces should be self-sufficient in military terms and should have the necessary capabilities for command, control, intelligence, and for other support units, as well as air and naval backup."
"Our Member States also decided, again at the Helsinki Council, a year ago, to rapidly establish collective targets for strategic capabilities."
"The Fifteen have successfully achieved the difficult task of making these objectives a reality in military and technical terms."
"I wish to emphasise the quality of the completely new work that has been carried out by our States' military experts, under the auspices of the interim military body, which was only created in March."
"I would also like to highlight the genuineness and effectiveness of the cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance, which enabled us to have a fruitful exchange on the development of these new capabilities."
"As a result, we now have detailed military planning documents, which have just been adopted by the General Affairs Council."
"Firstly, we have the catalogue of capabilities, a 300-page document which scrupulously lists all the military capabilities that are known to be needed by our Union in order to guarantee that all of the Petersberg tasks can be fulfilled."
"I would remind you of the wide range of tasks that this covers: humanitarian aid, the evacuation of nationals, conflict prevention and also the separation by force of the warring parties."
"We now have this catalogue of capabilities, which has been adopted by the whole Union."
"We also now have a catalogue of forces that records the voluntary contributions of each Member State."
"These contributions, which were confirmed by the Fifteen at the conference on 20 November, form a pool of more than 100 000 men, around 400 combat aircraft and 100 naval vessels."
"These contributions therefore enable us, in terms of quantity, to fully meet the overall target set by the Council."
"I would like to make two specific points relating to these numbers. I could, of course, add many other facts and figures, but I would like to be concise."
"These numbers relate to a mechanism that is designed to be maintained for a European Union operation for at least one year, which means that each country will have, in line with the contribution that it has stated, a reserve force that will enable it to provide the necessary relief forces."
"Furthermore, although I mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we are seeking to exceed the target set in Helsinki, but that we will have a reserve of qualified forces and forces with various areas of expertise, which will enable us to guarantee that the figure of 60 000 personnel in the Council' s target would be reached whatever operational conditions they may be required to work in."
"I wish, briefly, to comment on these figures in order to emphasise that if the European Union has taken the decision to provide itself with military capabilities, it cannot carry out this decision on an unrealistic basis."
"These capabilities must be sound and credible, because, as everyone here can imagine, and as I can attest from personal experience, when a democratic political authority faced with a situation of violence to which it cannot fail to react decides to use force, it cannot afford to take a gamble."
"It must have complete confidence in the credibility of its forces."
"The catalogue that I have just discussed was not the only result of this conference of commitment."
"We also reached agreement on continuing work to improve the quality of these forces."
"The Member States committed themselves to implementing medium- and long-term tasks to improve both their operational and strategic capabilities."
"We gave a particular commitment, under the current reforms of our armed forces, referred to just now by Mrs Lalumi√®re, to continuing to increase our own capabilities and to coordinating existing projects, implementing national or multinational solutions to improve the performance of our forces."
"What we need to do above all is to increase the speed of deployment, the ability to keep forces on the ground and the power of coordination, which together make up what we call the interoperability of European forces."
"We must improve our strategic capabilities, especially strategic mobility, in order to rapidly move forces into the field. We must also provide further support for the senior officers to command and control the forces and improve the resources for training them."
"Finally, we wish to improve some of the European forces' operational capabilities."
"In particular, we have identified research and combat rescue, defence instruments against ground-to-ground missiles, high-precision weapons and logistical support."
"These incorporate most of the suggestions made in your resolution of 21 November."
"I should like to make another comment on this overall project to improve European capabilities."
"Some people have suggested that this illustrates the shortcomings and weaknesses of the European people. I shall simply say, however, that these shortcomings and weaknesses have existed for a long time and that until now, no one in politics has shown any concern about this, at least at European level."
"The action that we have set in motion has given Europeans the opportunity to shoulder their responsibilities, to look towards the future, potentially to use their forces to promote democratic political aims and to adopt resolutions on subjects that have remained unresolved for many years."
"A new dynamic has therefore been launched on the basis of an action demonstrating political will on the part of our Member States."
"This will be credible only if it lasts and that is why we have adopted a follow-up and assessment mechanism that will be adopted by the Nice Council."
"This mechanism will enable us to gauge our progress."
"It is underpinned, of course, by the independence of the European Union' s decision making and by the acknowledgement of the voluntary and political nature of the commitments that have been given."
"It will therefore enable us to compare the commitments given by Member States with their later decisions and I think that this will encourage or inspire governments to take the appropriate decisions."
"As you see, Europeans are bent on undertaking a sustained effort in order to give credibility to a European defence system."
"This will require the rapid implementation of the decisions that are taken."
"Our fifteen nations have set themselves the target of making this Force operational, I repeat, by 2003."
"Our desire is that the permanent bodies be put in place as quickly as possible after the Nice Council."
"In 2001, and this task will fall to our friends in the Swedish Presidency, the system will have to be made operational, especially the European Union' s defence staff."
"This will quickly have to establish its own facilities and proper working procedures."
"By 2003, when the bodies that have been established are in a position to fulfil their duties, the European Union will gradually become capable of accomplishing some of the Petersberg tasks."
"These are a few remarks, which have had, out of necessity, to be concise and as a result, incomplete in order to adhere to the rules of your Parliament, on the assessment that can be made today of the real achievements in the field of military capabilities, which have already been adopted or are about to be adopted, by the Nice European Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a few words to describe the profound political significance, which has been approved by the majority of public opinion in our countries, of this new task that will provide Europe with a tool for political influence that it has, until now, lacked."
"This achievement is the result of a clear political will on the part of our governments, which is in stark contrast to the many disappointments that we have seen since the beginning of European integration."
"For this I wish to thank my fellow Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers for Defence, who have enabled this substantial progress to be made and I must, of course, thank the European Parliament for the interest it has shown in this new major project."
"Mr President, as we discuss defence and security policy and conflict resolution, we should never forget the very basic reason why the European Union exists: It is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution."
"When you examine the past century, in the first half of it we had two world wars - the worst in the history of the world - millions of dead."
"Yet those same people in those same countries created European Union in that same century, and the principles that go to the heart of European Union, when applied anywhere in the world, will bring peace."
"When we speak about conflict resolution why, instead of sending soldiers, do you not send this philosophy and why do you not consider setting up in the European Commission a section on peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation, given the massive and fundamental experience of European Union and conflict resolution?"
"(Applause from the left)"
"Perhaps I can begin by commenting on what my honourable friend Mr Hume has just said."
"He has done more than most as a personalised version of conflict resolution in a part of the world which I know well and has been properly commended globally for his efforts."
"Of course, he is right in what he says about the contribution which the European Union has made to conflict resolution."
"A Japanese-American political scientist wrote a book with the unhappy title of ""The End of History"" in 1989."
"As we know, we have actually witnessed a good deal of history since 1989, but one point on which he was absolutely correct was that we saw in 1989 the end of a particularly shaming, and all too long, period in European history."
"We all know that the genesis of the European Union, the main objective of the founding fathers was to prevent Europe tearing itself apart in yet another civil war."
"That has been not the least of the achievements of the last few years, as we have consolidated liberal democracy throughout our continent, which is the great task that the French Presidency will steer us towards accomplishing in Nice."
"We are now faced with the problem of ensuring that when we talk about consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe, we mean the whole of continental Europe, because that is what enlargement and the enlargement process is all about."
"That is why the enlargement process is not just a strategic issue - not just an economic issue for us, but a moral issue as well - an issue very close to what the honourable gentleman was talking about when he referred to conflict resolution."
"I did not come to talk about that and I should respond to my honourable friend, Mr Brok, and the honourable lady, Mrs Lalumi√®re, and thank them for their excellent reports."
"They and the motions for resolutions building upon them provide us with some extremely ambitious guidelines for our future work."
"I am gratified that they are on the whole very supportive of the external action of the European Union, as it has been developed by the Council, the Commission and, since his arrival just over a year ago, my colleague, Javier Solana."
"I very much agree with the content of those resolutions and reports."
"It would not be sensible to try and address tonight all the points raised in those reports and resolutions, nor is now the moment to try and circumnavigate the globe in a discussion of our foreign policy."
"I would like instead to make just a few remarks on some of the key elements of the ESDP and the common foreign and security policy, which are highlighted in the two reports."
"As the ministers have pointed out in their excellent speeches, recent weeks have seen important developments in strengthening Europe' s contribution to its own security."
"I do not want to go over the ground they have covered nor, as I have made clear very frequently, are the military aspects something for the European Commission."
"They are not - repeat not - matters for the European Commission."
"The only expertise I could possibly bring to the debate is that of the former commander-in-chief of the garrison in Hong Kong."
"This is rightly a matter for Member States."
"It is rightly a matter for ministers to decide."
"It is not a matter for European Commissioners."
"I find some of the coverage that the creation of this force has received in the country I know best quite extraordinary."
"It is said that it undermines NATO, but NATO has, of course, made it perfectly clear that it supports what European ministers are trying to do."
"We are told that the United States is opposed."
"One newspaper in Britain on Sunday declared in a headline, ""US to pull out of NATO if EU force goes ahead"" , but the United States administration strongly supports the initiative."
"It has said so repeatedly."
"Every time a member of the American administration points out how much they support what Europe is trying to do, someone pops up in the media of the country I know best to say they do not really understand what is in their own best interest."
"Every time it happens someone else is trooped out, usually from some previous administration or some ancient period in our transatlantic relations, to say that things have changed and this would really be damaging to the relationship between Europe and the United States."
"What is absolutely clear is this: first of all, what would really damage the relationship between the European Union and the United States is if we were not to go ahead with what we have now proposed - if we were not to make a success of what we have set our hands to."
"Secondly, there is one other thing which we need to be clear about."
"No one is suggesting that the United States intends or wants to reduce its strategic commitment to Europe."
"What people do realise increasingly is there is going to be, and it is understandable, growing reluctance on the part of American public opinion to commit American lives to coping with the consequences of bloody, little European tragedies."
"I was in the United States during the debates on ""Larry King Live"" and everywhere else during the run-up to the bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis."
"That is exactly what the tenor of all those discussions and all those debates was then."
"There is plenty of evidence, as I have said, that if we do not do more for ourselves, it will have very damaging consequences for our relationship with the United States."
"In the recent history of Bosnia, we saw a situation in which some of our soldiers were very often put in intolerable positions, not just militarily but morally as well."
"The recent history of Kosovo underlines the importance of Europe doing more for itself."
"Now we are trying to do that, and frankly it is both fatuous and malicious to suggest that this is the creation of a European army or an attempt to kick the Americans out of Europe."
"I fully agree with what my honourable friend Mr Brok has said in his overall conclusions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We have come a long way since the decision in Maastricht in 1991 to take the step from political cooperation towards a common foreign policy."
"Much remains to be done to develop a strong CFSP."
"There is need for further reinforcement of coherence and effectiveness in the external activities of the European Union cutting across the pillars."
"Experience over the past few years has made clear that European Union external action is more than just a juxtaposition of declaratory politics and technical cooperation."
"We need to integrate three strands into a coherent whole, Community policies, CFSP, including ESDP, and national action by Member States."
"There needs to be a sensible and sensitive partnership in the external field between the institutions of the Union, including the European Parliament, and a very close coordination with Member States."
"Our challenge is to ensure that the world' s largest trading group and provider of development aid also makes its presence felt politically."
"We have a real contribution to make and we must not be afraid of doing it."
"For the Community, this means reforming our external assistance, improving our internal procedures and creating a framework within which we can mobilise the whole range of Community instruments in support of our agreed external objectives."
"We are not seeking new competences."
"We do not need new competences, but we want to exercise the powers we already have under the Treaty more effectively and I have every sympathy for the European Parliament' s desire to do the same."
"Mr V√©drine pointed out in his remarks the priority which we have given to reforming our external actions and to delivering our programmes more effectively and more wisely."
"I have spoken a number of times to Parliament on that subject and I do not wish to do so again at any length today."
"However, we have made progress and that has been largely thanks to the leadership we have received from the French Presidency."
"We have worked extremely effectively together in trying to ensure that Europe' s taxpayers are able to see the sort of programmes delivered which they have every right to see and that the beneficiaries in countries all around the world get the assistance they require as rapidly as possible, supporting the most high value projects."
"I note the call in the honourable gentleman' s report for common strategies on Africa, Latin America and the Western Balkans."
"Dwelling for a moment on the Western Balkans, I find it difficult to accept that we need a common strategy on the Western Balkans, we actually have a rather good strategy on the Western Balkans."
"It was reflected in the report which Javier Solana and I made to the Council earlier this year."
"The challenge for us now is sticking to that strategy, ensuring we can make that strategy work, ensuring that, in holding out the prospect of a closer relationship with the European family, we can help those countries make the economic and political changes and reforms required in order to secure their stability and long-term prosperity."
"I would like to thank the honourable lady, Madame Lalumi√®re, for highlighting the report on conflict prevention, which the Commission is preparing together with the High Representative for the Nice European Council."
"The Commission intends to follow up on this joint report with a communication next spring on the integration of conflict prevention across the board in the programming of our external assistance programmes."
"On crisis management, the Commission adopted on 27 September a draft decision on the establishment of a Community mechanism for coordination of civil protection interventions in emergency situations."
"This draft decision is now before the Council and I very much hope that it will be shortly adopted."
"The draft regulation establishing a rapid reaction facility, which should be adopted by the end of the year, will allow the Commission under one budget line and one legal base to carry out a number of actions simultaneously so as to respond quickly to a crisis with a wide range of instruments."
"I just want to repeat one thing about it, we are talking about a rapid reaction facility."
"That is what the Commission is asking for."
"The Commission is not involved with the creation of the rapid reaction force."
"Again, I refer to the sometimes not entirely balanced and objective media in my own country, who seem to have some difficulty in comprehending that distinction."
"It is an administrative measure that we want, an administrative measure to allow the occasionally slow Commission to react faster in a crisis."
"Even with our laborious procedures in the Commission, we do not need a force of 60,000 soldiers to accomplish our objectives."
"We do need the support of Parliament in helping us get these draft regulations approved as rapidly as possible."
"Like the minister, I will just say a word in response to the honourable gentleman, Mr Brok, on Afghanistan."
"We are concerned, as the minister said he was, at the recent upsurge in fighting in the northeast of Afghanistan, concerned at the resultant worsening of the humanitarian situation of the population, many thousands of whom have had to flee their homes in order to avoid the conflict."
"The European Union through its common position on Afghanistan of 14 January earlier this year is committed among other things to the objective of bringing about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan."
"In this it supports the central role of the United Nations through its special envoy, Mr Vendrell, in trying to bring the parties of the conflict together in an effort to establish a broad-based government for the country."
"The European Union also encouraged other peace efforts, including those of the six plus two group, the initiatives of the former king and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, in their efforts to intercede to bring about peace in Afghanistan."
"At the same time, the European Union continues to urge countries concerned to stop the involvement of their military, paramilitary and secret service personnel in Afghanistan and cease provision of all other military support to parties in the Afghan conflict."
"With respect to the provision of aid, the Commission largely through its humanitarian aid office, ECHO, has made a number of specific interventions this year aimed at alleviating both the effects of the catastrophic drought in the country by supporting, through provision of funds for food security and winterisation kits, the population's displaced by the fighting in the northeast of the country."
"So far this year, these commitments and those in preparation have totalled more than EUR 14 million."
"Member States also made individual contributions in addition to those sums."
"Lastly, can I underline what others have already said."
"We have come an extraordinary long way in a remarkably short time."
"People who occasionally accuse the European Union of sclerosis, of not being able to take initiatives, of not being able to show vision, of not being able to move forward and respond to the problems of the modern world, should perhaps look at the progress that has been made in the last months in a very short period towards the creation of a CFSP which has its own integrity and very substantial potential value."
"It is a remarkable contribution."
"I hope we in the Commission will be able to make a contribution to the sensible discussion of conflict prevention."
"Our other major contribution is to show that we can manage the jobs that we have already been given, a lot more competently in the future than we have managed in the past."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.10 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Mr President, Mr Brok has made it perfectly clear what our group thinks of the progress achieved in the field of defence and of the distance that still needs to be covered here."
"I shall confine myself to saying here, addressing Mrs Lalumi√®re, that our group will be approving her excellent report tomorrow. But let me concentrate for now on the situation in Afghanistan."
"I was there in June and I witnessed both the plight of the refugees and the fanaticism of the Taliban fighters with whom I spoke."
"Since the fall of Talokan in September, which led to our Parliament's first resolution and has triggered today's debate, the situation has continued to worsen, especially in humanitarian terms."
"The Talokan offensive cut off the only route of supply to the Panchir Valley and the Shomali Plains, where Commander Massood's forces are concentrated, as also a large proportion of the uprooted people and refugees."
"Quite clearly, there is no military solution in this area, as has been said, and I therefore took note of the statements the Presidency of the Council made a short while ago, when it committed itself to apply all the necessary pressure on the neighbouring countries, and in particular Pakistan, to persuade them to stop interfering here and to seek a political settlement."
"But what we really must look at, I repeat, is the humanitarian situation, which is becoming increasingly precarious."
"Today there are more than 30 000 families, of whom half have no shelter, who are living in complete deprivation in the Shomali Plains, in the Panchir Valley and in the northern region where communications with Tajikistan remain very difficult."
"Fifty percent means 15 000 families."
"The temperature in the region just now is between minus 3 and minus 6 degrees and the only provisions these families have received over the past month is one sack of wheat."
"So it is extremely urgent to provide humanitarian aid."
"I think that has already been called for."
"A food depot should be set up in Dushanbe."
"I think we should consider establishing an air bridge, as we managed to do in other times and other places."
"It is a matter of the very survival of the people there."
"Mr President, I intend to concentrate on Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report in my intervention."
"On behalf of the entire PSE Group, I would like to express my admiration for the outstanding report by Catherine Lalumi√®re, our highly esteemed fellow Member."
"My group supports her position and we are grateful for the well-balanced text, which brings out the right points."
"As you will all be aware, there is to be a new approach to the common foreign and security policy; in which the civilian component will be deemed to be at least as important as the military component."
"The setting up of the rapid reaction force seems to be coming on apace, for which we extend our compliments."
"The Member States have made promises that do justice to previously articulated ambitions."
"Now it is matter of forging an effective and efficient European unit from this, under a clear and unambiguous command."
"That will be the real test for the European Union in my view."
"A new dimension is being added to the common foreign and security policy."
"This makes effective parliamentary control an absolute necessity."
"Do the Council and the Commission go along with the proposals in the Lalumi√®re report on that score?"
"There are two other remarks we would like to make."
"The developments I have described will give fresh impetus to the European arms industry, and it certainly needs it."
"But we want to avoid pressure on exports, which is why we want to improve the rules on arms exports, and we will support an amendment to this end."
"My group recognises that there will be discussion of the various facets, but is seeking new methods via restructuring in the first instance."
"We do not rule out the possibility of increasing defence expenditure, but that will have to be assessed on its own merits, also in line with other priorities, for example in the social and economic field."
"Of course we are much taken with the emphasis the report places on the civilian component of the common foreign and security policy."
"The impression is sometimes given that the future of the CFSP stands or falls with the establishment of an autonomous military capacity."
"Is this appropriate?"
"Not if the press is anything to go by at any rate."
"The rapid reaction force is intended to implement the Petersberg tasks."
"However, we must not exaggerate the importance of this."
"Although I do not agree with the cynics who say that it will provide Europe with a pointless toy, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be immediately deployable in many situations."
"We regard it as an instrument that can be deployed alongside others, or better still, as one that can be deployed after other instruments, where possible."
"Conflict prevention is to be preferred over military crisis management."
"The EU is better equipped than NATO, for example, for such peaceful conflict prevention tasks."
"We want to strengthen this capacity."
"We are sometimes sceptical about the European Union' s efforts in this respect."
"We have developed a kind of fixation with the military instrument."
"It appears easier to get results using this method."
"Lip service is often paid to the second part of the Helsinki Decisions, in our view."
"Such criticism is often responded to with a reference to the headline goals for police deployment or the rapid reaction facility that is now being launched by the Commission."
"We support these steps but more must be done to strengthen the civilian aspects of the European security policy."
"We want scenarios and coherent planning."
"What instruments will we need and when?"
"The key to the European Union is its civilian basis and that is what we want to see clearly brought out in the Union' s foreign policy."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it often takes a very long time before visible results can be discerned when issues are dealt with at European level."
"Impatient citizens complain that the wheels of European bureaucracy turn infinitely slowly."
"However, things have happened amazingly quickly within the field of European security policy since the decision to set up a joint European rapid reaction force was taken in December 1999 in Helsinki."
"These are welcome developments."
"We need to show ourselves and the countries around us that Europe has the strength and the will in future to prevent tragedies such as that in the Balkans."
"Naturally, the EU must take increased responsibility for conflict-prevention measures, crisis management, peacekeeping operations etc in the immediate vicinity of the European Union."
"Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party entirely support Mr Brok' s report."
"We also back Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report in the main."
"We nonetheless think that the importance of not developing structures which overlap with those of NATO cannot be emphasised enough."
"It therefore seems a little unnecessary to regulate in great detail how, for example, European forces in space are to be organised."
"It is important to safeguard the transatlantic link and the United States' s continued commitment to Europe."
"The EU ought not to develop its own defence involving permanent troops."
"As I say, things are developing quickly."
"In the course of the week, country after country has reported on how many soldiers, aircraft, submarines etc it can contribute to make the rapid reaction force operational."
"Judging from the debate in a number of Member States, many people are clearly rather bewildered by the debate."
"Commissioner Patten gave a first-hand account of the debate in Great Britain."
"In another country close to my heart, the debate has been quite heated."
"In Sweden, a somewhat sluggish debate about neutrality is taking place, a concept which most of us perceive as a hangover from the days of the Cold War and as not being relevant today."
"Those of us in the European Parliament, who represent the people of Europe, nonetheless have an additional responsibility to lead this debate and to discuss, and conduct a critical examination of, defence and security policy in the form in which it is developing."
"This means that, as MEPs, we need structures to enable us to obtain information about the decisions made and to enable us to engage in debate, to participate and to hold people to account."
"However, citizens too must, as far as possible, be given access to information and documents."
"This is crucial if the policy in question is to win people' s confidence."
"Last summer' s so-called Solana decision was criticised vociferously in this Chamber."
"The decision meant that all documents relating to foreign and security policy were to be automatically exempt from public scrutiny."
"That is unacceptable, of course."
"It is also why we have asked the Court of Justice to examine this decision."
"The same ideas about the greatest possible transparency were expressed in Mr Cashman' s report which we adopted with a broad majority two weeks ago in Strasbourg."
"I am therefore hoping for broad support for the Liberal amendments which deal specifically with the issues of transparency and public access to documentation."
"Finally, I want to express my group' s considerable concern about the ever worsening situation in Afghanistan and urge the Commission and the Council to do all they can to increase their efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and to support the civilian population, especially now before the winter sets in."
"Mr President, Mr Richard, Commissioner, I would like to restrict my contribution to two important sections of the report by Mrs Lalumi√®re."
"The first section I am referring to is the one on conflict prevention and crisis management."
"I am delighted that this constitutes such an important part of her report because it is based on the analysis - which, if I am honest, has been made by the Greens before now, and on more than one occasion - that the European Union' s strength resides in its ability to prevent conflicts, and that we will only have to be able to seek recourse to military means - sadly - as a last resort."
"I think the Stability Pact for the Balkans is a good example of this."
"As I see it, it sets an example of how things should be done in the European Union, and it demonstrates that by taking various measures, for example in the field of democracy, support for the free press, and in the field of education, conflict prevention policy can help us to keep the lid on the situation."
"What I am hoping, and I would like to echo the sentiments of Mr Wiersma in this respect, is that what the report has to say on conflict prevention is not just paying lip service but will actually be translated into concrete goals, in which money and political will are to be invested. Otherwise we will be even worse off, i.e. by promising great things but not living up to them."
"The second section I would like to come back to is the military section."
"This contains two points of criticism put forward by my group, which, to our satisfaction, have ended up in Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report."
"The first point concerns the role of the European Parliament, which is something several other speakers have already touched on."
"It is still completely unclear in the current proposals as to what that role should be."
"As I see it, the European Parliament should be directly involved in drawing up the much-needed strategic concept in the future, and also, if it comes to it, in the decision on whether to deploy the European peacekeeping force."
"I have a very specific question for Mr Richard on that score."
"Reports are constantly appearing in the Dutch press to the effect that there is a secret protocol appended to the Saint Malo Agreement - which his country concluded with England early this year - in which both countries, France and England, say, and promise each other that the European Parliament will never have any authority over any aspect of the security policy."
"I would like to hear what Mr Richard has to say to this and ask him what he thinks Parliament' s role ought to be if there is no such secret protocol."
"The second point of criticism, which is also included in the report by Mrs Lalumi√®re, concerns the lack of any strategic concept."
"Quite simply: where, when and how is this European intervention force expected to take action in the future?"
"It is a complete mystery to me."
"I was therefore slightly perplexed, if I am honest, last week, when Mr Solana' s answer to the question as to whether we have a strategic concept or not, was a straightforward 'yes' . He said: 'yes, we do have a strategic concept, now all we need is the troops' ."
"I would like to ask Mr Richard if he agrees with Mr Solana on that point."
"Is there a strategic concept?"
"And if there is one, could he show me where it is written down as I would very much like to read it."
"Lastly, one point of criticism, which is not, I am sorry to say, included in Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report, is the financial aspect."
"I think Parliament' s message must be crystal-clear: we support this development but it will entail making cutbacks in the current standing armies, so as to allow for investment in new methods which we too consider to be necessary."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, another member of my group, Mr Modrow, will be speaking on defence matters."
"For my part, I shall confine myself to what Mr Brok's report terms a cornerstone of the CFSP, ensuring peace and freedom, and conflict prevention."
"Let me just give one example - one which is extremely topical and most significant in terms of how we must change our policy - namely the Middle East. Here Mr Brok rightly deplores, and I quote, ""the persistent inability of the Union to play a constructive role"", and in this case the responsibility does not lie with the French Presidency."
"I have just returned from a visit to Israel and Palestine last week, where I led a delegation from my group."
"I can tell you that the Palestinians have great expectations of Europe."
"If you fly a European flag on your car, you can go anywhere, even into the most miserable refugee camp."
"We must not disappoint these expectations."
"What do they expect of us?"
"Basically, three things that are within our reach, provided we ourselves and each of our governments show a degree of political courage."
"The first thing they expect is for us to call for international observers to be sent out to protect the people concerned."
"Let us simply repeat what Mrs Mary Robinson said to the UN Commissioner for human rights: not more, but not less."
"What we saw in the hospital in Gaza, for instance, was truly horrific."
"That has to stop."
"If you have any doubts, I would advise you to read an interview published in the major Israeli daily Haretz on 20 November this year, which reveals the unbelievable orders given to Israeli marksmen facing Palestinians over the age of 12."
"It gives some idea of the terrible toll of these two months of intifada: 270 dead, most of them Palestinian, and nearly 10 000 wounded, many of them crippled for life."
"Secondly, we should dare to call on the Israeli Government to put a halt to its military escalation, which can only set back any hope of peace."
"I am saying that not in a spirit of hostility but out of a sense of responsibility, in the well-considered interest of both Israel and the entire Mediterranean basin."
"Of course we must strongly condemn all attacks against Israeli civilians, like the terrible attack on a school bus."
"We did so immediately, on the spot. But it is not by bombarding Gaza, after plunging it into darkness to impress its people more, or by bombing the villages of the Bethlehem region fifteen times, villages we also visited, that one can hope to escape this spiral of violence."
"Thirdly, we should call for new peace negotiations to begin, based on the same principles that we uphold in all the other parts of the world, namely the requirement of respect for international law and the Geneva Conventions, the requirement of respect for the United Nations resolutions."
"In this case, that means an end to the occupation, including that of East Jerusalem, the dismantling of the settlements and recognition of the refugee problem."
"It is the constant violation of these fundamental rights, despite seven years of negotiations, and the resulting exasperation that lie at the core of this popular revolt."
"So it is these problems that we must resolve if we are to see a return to peace, to a lasting peace."
"For the rest, many Israelis agree and opinions polls show that over and above any voting intentions, an absolute majority of them accept the idea of a global peace agreement with the Palestinians, including the dismantling of the settlements."
"As an association of soldiers' mothers stated, we did not take our children out of Lebanon just so that they could die for the settlements."
"That is why I believe that Europe must decide to act now."
"If it does so along the lines I have described, Europe will not only live up to the expectations of the Palestinian people but will also underpin the current of opinion within Israel in favour of a just peace and give itself a worthy and respectable image in the world."
"Then, and only then, will it have a chance to overcome its impotence in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean region."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on Amendment No 1 to the Brok report, which concerns the setting up of an International Tribunal for Saddam Hussain' s reign of terror."
"There is no lack of reliable information on the nature of the present Iraqi regime."
"The flood of reports is still growing by the day."
"Nevertheless, the 'Republic of Fear' , as Saddam' s reign of terror was appropriately dubbed many years ago, is still greatly underestimated by many western politicians, also within the European Parliament."
"However, this erroneous assessment could have disastrous consequences, because according to what he says, the Gulf War is far from over in Sadism Hussain's eyes."
"Hence his relentless efforts to build up an arsenal of extremely sinister weapons of mass destruction."
"After all, who is there to prevent him from doing so?"
"He has kept UN inspection teams out for quite some time now."
"Incidentally, this brutal Iraqi autocrat is advocating a massive Arab attack on the State of Israel, indeed worse still, a full-blown Jihad, a Holy War."
"What, in all fairness, could be more obvious than the need to firmly contain the potential threat posed by Saddam?"
"In point of fact, how do the Council and the Commission view the situation at the present time?"
"One would appear to be justified in fearing that there is no question of our establishing a European CFSP to deal with this crucial danger to world peace."
"At all events, the consequences of a failed sanctions regime against Baghdad are incalculable."
"Owing to misplaced pleas for the suffering of the Iraqi people - as if we really believe that Saddam lacks the financial means to alleviate this - the tyrant of the Tigris is gradually being given more room to manoeuvre on the international scene."
"To what end?"
"To wreak death and destruction in his own country and beyond."
"In a nutshell, it is high time that the UN set up an International Tribunal to conduct a thorough investigation into, and try, all the crimes perpetrated by Saddam' s 'Republic of Fear' ."
"An initiative to this effect would certainly lend credibility to the CFSP of the European Union."
"Hence our enthusiastic support for Amendment No 1 of the Brok report."
"Mr President, these progress reports on the common foreign and security policy, which are certainly very comprehensive and informative, also mercilessly expose the regrettable weaknesses of the Union in this domain."
"Among the performances that surely give us no cause for pride are our rather embarrassing uncoordinated attempts to act as a mediator in the Middle East conflict."
"I believe that we Europeans bear a special responsibility for peace in the Middle East, a responsibility which we do not exercise and which is evidently beyond our capabilities."
"The one-sided apportionment of blame which we have been hearing in this House, the condemnations of one side or the other in this conflict and the discrepancies in the voting patterns of the EU Member States at the United Nations on 21 October of this year - which one of the rapporteurs quite rightly criticised, by the way - have further reduced the Union's chances of assuming a productive and responsible role in the Middle East."
"We are not talking here about different interpretations of the causes of the conflict by the individual EU Member States and by various politicians, which is something the political leaders might finally come to recognise. The only thing we are talking about is supporting a peace process and gaining the trust of the parties to this conflict."
"Both a viable Palestinian state and Israel's legitimate security requirements must be recognised by all members of the Union, otherwise we shall never adopt a common position on the peace efforts, and Europe will lose every ounce of credibility as a mediator alongside the United States."
"The Middle East conflict could therefore become the acid test of the efficiency of European Middle East policy."
"If we as Europeans cannot play a responsible role in the resolution of this conflict, independently of the United States, we must assume that we shall not be trusted to act as a mediator in any other regional conflicts either."
"Mr President, it is essential that we recognise that in recent months there has been considerable progress in the field of the common foreign and security policy, and that the credit for much of it must be given to the High Representative."
"Furthermore, as the French Minister for Defence pointed out, there has been progress in the field of defence policy."
"I believe that the establishment in record time of the interim committees in the Council, the Member States' ability to commit their contributions to the creation of the rapid reaction force and the very presence of Mr Richard in the work of Parliament - in its Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and in Parliament itself - are all to be welcomed and deserve our consideration."
"I would like to highlight very clearly the progress made by the French Presidency in the field of common foreign and security policy and in the field of defence policy, and I wish to say this particularly because, in the previous debate on the European Council in Nice, certain reservations were expressed on the progress made in general during this presidency."
"Nevertheless, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we should not be deceived, because the French Presidency will fundamentally be judged, not on the achievements with regard to common foreign and security policy, nor with regard to defence policy, but on the results of the European Council in Nice, which are truly essential to the promotion of our project."
"I, like Mr Patten this afternoon, am not going to comment on the whole of the European Union' s external action, but I would just like to concentrate on three points which I believe deserve to be highlighted."
"Firstly, the debate which has taken place as a result of the words of the German Foreign Minister at the Humboldt University, as a result of President Chirac' s speech in Berlin, the speech by the British Prime Minister in Prague, and the articles by the Italian Prime Minister and by the Swedish Foreign Minister that appeared recently in the press."
"All of these stressed the intergovernmental aspect, rather than the Community aspect, of the CFSP."
"Mr Giddens, the ideologue of what has come to be called the 'third way' , said that the Commission is going through a political decline and that the centre of gravity should be shifted towards other bodies, that is, towards the Council."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to us, action undertaken by the Commission and the interinstitutional balance are fundamental."
"Secondly, despite what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it would be possible or desirable for the European Union to do any more than it is currently doing in relation to the conflict and escalation of violence which has taken place in the Middle East, especially now, when the United States is going through a transitional period."
"I imagine that the 43rd President of the United States will soon be named, but I think that this would be a good time for the European Union to double its efforts and assert its presence in a conflict which is so close by."
"Lastly, I would like to comment on Latin America."
"I wonder - I will ask Mr Patten this question when the time comes - whether the directives for negotiation which the European Union and the Commission are currently debating with Chile and Mercosur, adopted in light of the Seattle Summit, should be revised, given the failings of that summit, and whether it would be discriminatory to conclude these agreements on the condition that a new round of the WTO should take place."
"I believe that this really is a discriminatory condition, which should now be adapted in light of the new circumstances."
"Mr President, I would like to end by saying that interinstitutional balance is very important to us, that the Commission should be given the role that it deserves, and that the internal dimension which is being consolidated in the European Union should correspond to its external activities."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have two very important reports to deal with today and an important question relating to the dreadful intolerable situation in Afghanistan."
"Nevertheless, I should like to concentrate on the Lalumi√®re report, because it documents the progress that has undoubtedly been achieved in the domain of European defence and security policy and sets that progress in a balanced and democratic framework."
"It is balanced, because the report makes it quite clear that we need three things: the first is an analysis of the various risk factors in and around Europe, the second is prevention, and the third is civilian crisis management."
"Only if all of that is to no avail do we need military crisis management."
"It will not always be possible to take these steps one after the other in chronological order, but we need the entire package, and the fact is that only all of these factors together will make a coherent, balanced defence and security policy in Europe."
"The report, however, also brings a democratic framework into play, and I should like to lay particular emphasis on that here."
"Minister, I should like to say a special word of thanks to you for having been with us in committee and for being here today."
"However, your personal commitment must not be seen as a substitute for democratic legitimisation of the European security and defence policy."
"Defence policy, the question of defence spending, is a national matter and must be determined and overseen by the national parliaments."
"There is, however, a European level of security policy, and the European Parliament acts as a budgetary authority for security expenditure at that level."
"We need cooperation between the national and European levels, and we also need democratic supervision."
"I realise, Minister, that you are sceptical and that you have just said 'No' again, as you did in Paris on a previous occasion, but this Parliament still believes in these principles, irrespective of party allegiance, and we shall go on campaigning for their acceptance."
"Allow me one final plea: enhance European defence policy by giving it a parliamentary democratic dimension."
"Mr President, I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report, which I think is clearly worded and well put together."
"The decision taken at the Helsinki summit to establish a rapid reaction force has been interpreted in different ways by the Member States."
"In Finland and Sweden they speak about crisis management, which in these countries chiefly means a traditional peacekeeping operation."
"Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report reflects the thinking of many NATO countries, according to which a rapid reaction force would very quickly develop into a fully-fledged army capable of warfare."
"It would have at its disposal, among other things, heavy transport aircraft, aircraft carriers, cruise missiles, and in-flight refuelling for long-distance bombing missions."
"The Finnish people have not been told anything about this."
"In my opinion, Europe' s military identity should have been established in the context of NATO, then the EU could just stick to the task of crisis management."
"I cannot approve of the EU becoming a military alliance and a military superpower."
"Now that the development of the EU' s military dimension has begun, it is wise to aim for a situation where the Union should be internally differentiated in this area also."
"The NATO countries could form a defence organisation within the framework of the Union that would function as a strong European pillar of NATO."
"In this way other EU Member States could keep to their traditional peacekeeping activities."
"I cannot accept certain details of Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report, and in the final vote I shall support its rejection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has yet to substantiate adequately its claim to exercise responsibility for peace and above all for lasting stability in the world."
"Yet the Union would be unrivalled in that domain if only it would improve the existing instruments and especially its present potential for civilian conflict prevention and apply them coherently."
"The unfortunate fact is that the trauma of Kosovo was followed by a hectic flurry of activity which was channelled in an entirely wrong direction."
"Concentration on purely reactive crisis management has thrown the common foreign and security policy totally out of synch."
"No government would take responsibility for sending its country's troops into a region on an open-ended assignment without clear political objectives."
"But there are no clear political objectives, and there is still effectively no common foreign and security policy."
"National interests continue to prevail, especially when diplomatic activity is on the agenda."
"We have just seen the examples in The Hague."
"We have the example of the Middle East conflict."
"It is absurd to detach European foreign policy from the institutions responsible for most of the instruments that are essential to its pursuit."
"These are not my own words; they were spoken by Commissioner Patten, and he is perfectly correct."
"It is equally absurd to concentrate the bulk of the available financial resources on military equipment."
"If we perceive European foreign policy as nothing more than a support instrument for European arms-manufacturing consortia, we have completely misunderstood its function."
"It can only recover credibility if the civilian approach is its supreme guiding principle, if the instruments at its disposal are used in pursuit of effective prevention and if those instruments receive a level of funding that maintains their credibility."
"Neglect of this wide range of instruments of non-military conflict prevention would turn out to be a mistake in the long run, and in that respect I am dissatisfied with the Council's statements to the effect that we have already taken decisions, but that things will move in this general direction."
"This is by no means certain, because it is also apparent that these decisions are based entirely on the reactive approach."
"Civilian conflict prevention, and I stress the word 'prevention', cannot be a mere appendage of military intervention."
"It will not be fully effective until we have overcome the trauma of Kosovo and Srebrenica, until we return to a policy of active prevention and begin to deploy our available resources long before the alarm bells start ringing and until we are fully committed to defusing potential crises and eliminating possible causes of escalation."
"This means that curbing arms exports to unstable regions must be the first aim for the Council to pursue, that trade policies must be fair, that assistance must be given to encourage the sustainable development of countries in volatile regions and, above all, that the democratic forces in civil society must be supported."
"The promotion of regional cooperation is another valuable instrument."
"The EU has only one problem in this domain, namely the fact that it has yet to arouse public interest in this sort of action, even though such measures are considerably more sustainable and effective than military intervention."
"Mr President, a German conservative, Mr Brok, and a French socialist have joined together on what I see as a disgraceful tack in order to present us with two mutually complementary reports and motions for resolutions, each of which rivals the other in its interventionist militarism."
"These resolutions, together with the interventions of the presidents of the foreign and defence ministers and Mr Patten, leave us in no doubt whatsoever as to the extent of the militarisation and aggression of the European Union."
"Both motions passionately support the creation of a terrifying military machine, spearheaded by a rapid reaction force of 50 000 to 60 000 men or, as Mr Richard has just told us, 100,000 men, with air and sea support and even aircraft carriers being mobilised."
"The stated aim, which I admit with a cynicism which makes me shudder, is for the European Union to be able to intervene militarily on the territory of third countries, in order to prevent and manage crises which threaten European values and interests, without so much as a resolution by the UN Security Council, given that all that is required is the approval of its Secretary-General."
"And just to be on the safe side, both motions explain away the criminal objectives of the famous CFSP by proposing that all countries in the European Union have professional, i.e. mercenary armies which will, of course, carry out their orders without question and without hesitation."
"This, they tell us, will enable operations such as the criminal bombing of Yugoslavia and the continuing occupation of Kosovo to be carried out more successfully and at the initiative of the European Union, which will back up and complement √ç√Å√î√è."
"What about Mr Brok's contention that the aim of the CFSP is to deal with massive attack from the Soviet bloc."
"Obviously, no-one has told him that, unfortunately for mankind, there is no longer any such bloc."
"One thing is clear and that is that nothing has changed since 1990; as far as our rapporteurs and those at the helm of the European Union are concerned, the enemy is still those who refuse to bow down to the new imperialist order, those who fight it, the grass-roots movement which is beginning to react - as is only natural - against the barbaric foreign, economic and social policy of the European Union, which provokes hatred between peoples, and leads to war, unemployment and impoverishment."
"This is the enemy which your CFSP has in its sights."
"As I am sure you will have understood, we intend to vote against both reports and we promise to fight tooth and nail against policies which express ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I intend to concentrate on Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report, for which I have the greatest respect, because I feel that as a report, it takes a very practical approach to issues concerning our security and that of others around us."
"But firstly I would like to comment on a number of statements that other speakers have just made."
"They have spoken most impressively and sympathetically about the order in which steps should be taken, i.e. first preventive action, using as many peaceful methods as possible, and only then, military methods."
"On hearing this you say: 'yes, of course that is quite right' , but this appeal would in fact suggest that the European Union and the European Member States have been far too quick to seize their weapons in the past, in different contexts."
"History has taught us that, sadly, this often happened far too late and that if it had happened earlier, hundreds of thousands of lives might have been spared."
"So I do not actually think this assertion is correct."
"Again, I readily support any efforts to take preventive action in order to avoid war and all kinds of violence, but, of course, we must not twist the facts."
"I believe, Mr President, that if you were to ask the public for their opinion, you would find that they think we deal with foreign policy and security here in the European Parliament, and that this is also where the centre of gravity of our decision-making power lies, which is not the case."
"The trouble is that the Council of fifteen Ministers takes the decisions on these matters, and it all proceeds rather slowly, and then Parliament gets the blame."
"I am therefore delighted that we are now making progress."
"We also have the French Defence Minister in our midst, which must make it an historic occasion."
"What he said in his speech was an inspiration to us all."
"We have been able to see that progress is being made of course."
"We also warmly applaud the efforts undertaken by Mr Patten - whom we hold in very high esteem, as we do Mr Solana - because something is being done at last."
"I think Mrs Lalumi√®re also makes an extremely practical comment in her report where she says that it would be an excellent idea for Mr Solana to effect coordination between the Member States, and for Commissioner Patten to generate more initiative from the Commission' s side."
"Ideally, these two should be fused into one person."
"I have been known to comment in the past that they should at least be regarded as identical twins, but the fusion idea would be far better still within the context of the Commission."
"I feel Mrs Lalumi√®re outlines some outstanding possibilities."
"If we take a leaf out of her book, perhaps we will be able to ensure that all our resources are deployed in a more effective manner, both those used in preventive actions and those used in military actions, if necessary within the Petersberg framework, as well as the action that follows military action, such as that required in Kosovo at the present time."
"We need police officers out there, but also people who can keep the wheels of administration turning, and who can take over the role of mayor somewhere, for example."
"These are all officials whom I think could be dealt with extremely well as part of Mr Patten' s portfolio, along with his rapid reaction facility."
"That is an extremely important element because the European Commission has a great deal of authority over it, which means that we as a Parliament can exercise a great deal of control."
"So I am certainly inclined to make it a very important priority."
"Mr President, then there is the budget, of course, and the question as to how it should be apportioned."
"There are some sound comments on this in the report, and I believe that we should follow Mrs Lalumi√®re' s example and give preference to financing it via the Community budget, then it will be apportioned fairly from the outset and we will also have control over it."
"Speaking of control, of course the European Parliament must take on more and more tasks from the Western European Union and its assembly."
"I think that would be a good move."
"I also think that we are being prudent and realistic for the present, in our assessment that when it comes to the practical deployment of troops, the national parliaments are set to retain a large capability for a very long time, and perhaps for ever, and that we therefore need a forum where we can come together with the national parliaments for that reason."
"It is not a control body we need but a forum, and I would gladly give it my blessing."
"Mr President, the report before us gives the EU carte blanche to establish a military intervention capacity."
"I regard that as unacceptable."
"In the early part of 1990, when it was foreseeable that the Warsaw Treaty would collapse, the Government of the German Democratic Republic which I headed adopted a new military doctrine based on freedom from nuclear weapons, on international security partnership and on gradual disarmament."
"Non-use of force was our principle."
"The end of the confrontation between the two blocs had rendered NATO superfluous."
"Yet instead of dissolving itself, NATO is mutating from a defensive into an offensive power and alliance and is spreading its radius of action ever further eastward."
"The arguments advanced today for the creation of an EU intervention force resemble those that have been put forward for the continuing existence of NATO."
"This move is not primarily designed to pacify trouble spots but rather to permit the use of military means to safeguard access to markets, raw materials and spheres of interest."
"I am in favour of the EU continuing to make peacekeeping the hallmark of its foreign and security policy and to detach itself from the apron strings of the United States."
"This, however, depends on a completely different set of conditions."
"First of all, the war that was fought against Yugoslavia in defiance of international law and the results of that war, such as the new tensions in southern Serbia, show that military force must not become a political instrument again."
"Secondly, NATO should be gradually winding down rather than engaging in eastward enlargement."
"Thirdly, a nuclear-free corridor, such as Olaf Palme once suggested, should be created from the Baltic to the Black Sea."
"Fourthly, the OSCE must be strengthened and endowed with enough resources for the prevention and resolution of conflicts in accordance with the fundamental principles of its security policy and not through the creation of storm troops."
"Fifthly, the United Nations should be asked to convene a world peace summit, at which lessons can be drawn from the wars of the twentieth century so that the peoples of this earth will be offered the prospect of a peaceful twenty-first century."
"Europe could set an example here, and the creation of an intervention force is surely the wrong signal for it to send."
"I have to say that there is much in the Brok report that we can support, in particular the importance attached to enlargement of the European Union."
"However we have concerns in particular about the nature of common European security and defence policy."
"I say this in spite of the mass of apparent reassurances on this subject that have miraculously been generated in the past few days."
"If the proposed European capabilities were indeed designed to reinforce NATO or the options for the alliance, we would have few difficulties. But this is not the case."
"The Union is bent on establishing an autonomous capability in pursuit of European political integration."
"Mr Richard says he does not want to compete with NATO but he does want to compete with America in the security policy arena."
"Among other ambitions, Mr Brok proposes that the European Union should set its military operational sights on a zone of instability in Asia, from Afghanistan to the China sea."
"He mentioned Kashmir - I find this alarming."
"The Lalumi√®re report wants EU military operations to be funded from the Community budget and even those not participating would be expected to pay up as well."
"There is a proposal to turn to Russia for long-range air transport and yesterday the Russians suggested common intelligence-gathering with the European Union."
"There are some here who would prefer Russia rather than America as a strategic partner."
"Mrs Lalumi√®re and Mr Brok want EU defence policy to be under the control of a Vice-President of the Commission, who would assume the CFSP responsibilities of the Secretary-General of the Council."
"Under this scheme the Commission would run defence policy."
"This is all barmy stuff."
"The Commission should concentrate on its civil external assistance programmes, military matters should be left to the nations on an intergovernmental basis."
"Let NATO first decide how it would deal with a crisis and then, if required, Europeans, having developed greater capability, could indeed assume responsibility for a particular task, as agreed in NATO four years ago."
"Let us not pretend that the present proposals have this in mind."
"I cannot tell you how delighted I am to discover that Mr Brok all along was a dangerous revolutionary!"
"Could I congratulate Mrs Lalumi√®re on her report."
"Clearly we have made huge leap forwards on European defence cooperation in the last 12 months or so, but there are certain things we need to bear in mind."
"Firstly, a key factor must be to maintain the consistency of the European Union's external policy."
"Unless Pillars 1, 2 and 3 are working towards the common goal, any other mechanism we set up is bound for failure."
"So we must always hold that in mind."
"Secondly, while attention has inevitably been focused in recent weeks on the military dimension, we must not lose sight of the need for civilian conflict prevention and one cannot be at the expense of the other, otherwise you are actually pulling in opposite ways."
"Thirdly, while I welcome the Rapid Reaction Force, we have to be clear from Europe's perspective, as we only get one chance to get this right."
"It is not a question of not being halfway in or halfway out, there has to be a clear commitment by all the Member States involved to making this work."
"We should not therefore try to force this to do anything it is not intended to."
"NATO of course is the arm of collective defence of Europe and the West."
"The Rapid Reaction Force's job is peacekeeping and peacemaking and the Petersberg tasks."
"To do that we have to have the capability."
"At the moment we are grossly short of that capability and ultimately Member States have to consider their defence expenditure plans, which are dramatically different from one country to another."
"I would like ultimately to see us move towards greater convergence of defence expenditure."
"We also need proper coordination."
"No duplication, not only with NATO, but no duplication within EU Member States."
"We should be working together and coordinating."
"We should move towards greater European procurement policy, so we have a more efficient defence industry delivering better value for money."
"Mr President, there are three things I want to point out. First of all, Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report contains a whole programme setting out how the EU is to become a military superpower within the fairly near future."
"It is perhaps hard to see why, bearing in mind that Europe has no enemies and is not threatened by any military power."
"Secondly, the report is mainly concerned with military offensives outside the EU' s own territory."
"As a superpower, the EU is to be able to intervene anywhere in the world where the EU' s interests or values are threatened."
"In this way, the EU is to be an equivalent of the United States in the area of military intervention, too."
"I am convinced that this policy would be greeted with distrust by the people of Europe if they only knew about it."
"Thirdly, the very comprehensive report does not say a word about the non-aligned States or about neutrality as such."
"The farthest it goes in that direction is a scornful reference in paragraph 5 of the explanatory statement to 'neutral' countries (in inverted commas)."
"The non-aligned countries must protest loudly and clearly against wordings of that kind and against the report as a whole."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Brok on the vigorously pan-European approach he has adopted both in his intervention and in his report."
"I concur with his arguments about enlargement. He notes that the accession negotiations involving twelve new Member States have proved to be the most effective instrument for stabilising the Mediterranean area, together with Central and Eastern Europe."
"The priority now is to do all we can to strengthen the conditions for freedom and peace in Europe."
"Mr Brok' s report also discusses the post of High Representative for the CFSP."
"I think that the present 'relationship' is unsustainable in the long term."
"It is an exciting debate we are having this evening."
"I welcome the unanimity and frankness with which, as MEPs, we are now discussing the Lalumi√®re report on the European Union' s security and defence policy."
"If they are to be credible, I believe it is important for the Members of the Council to say the same thing in Brussels and the EU as they do in their own countries."
"In my country, Sweden, there is a Foreign Minister who demands that there should be a UN mandate for EU operations."
"The debate in Sweden is very much about the extent to which Sweden, as a Member of the EU, is a neutral country."
"Astounding, but true."
"I also believe it is extremely important for those ambitions which the EU is now expressing to be backed by practical resources. Otherwise, they are in danger of becoming nothing but empty words."
"Finally, I want to point out how important it is for the political leaders of the European Union to involve the people of Europe in these important and far-reaching plans by making it clear to them how very ambitious the plans now are."
"Mr President, today we are debating two politically important reports, both of which basically concern the CFSP."
"As it takes shape, the CFSP will experience numerous ups and downs; however, it will help realise our dream of a political Europe."
"Even those who speculate as to the benefits of certain decisions, such as the decision to create a so-called Euro-army, cannot fail to see the important political dimension of this decision and its effect on the cohesion of the European Union."
"In all events, the peaceful resolution of any conflict must be our creed."
"If it is to retain its political attraction, the CFSP needs to be determined on the basis of the Member States of the European Union, not on the basis of isolationist or exclusionist rationales, but as a strong driving force behind the cohesion of the European Union."
"Antagonism and compromise are facts of life."
"However, the European Parliament must act within the bounds of government compromise and balance on the one hand, and the realistic utopia of European unification on the other."
"There are issues such as technology, research etc. which are in dire need of a convergence strategy - this applies to the defence industry, information technology, space technologies and research."
"And, as it strengthens its democratic institutions, Europe also needs to consolidate its economic and social power and cohesion, its strategic potential to act as a force of peace and its technological edge."
"It is about time Europe had its own Cape Canaveral, its own √ç√ÅS√Å and its own Silicon Valley."
"I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on the military and indeed civilian facility particularly with the forthcoming Nice Summit."
"I would also like to put on record my appreciation of the first Minister of Defence to address the European Parliament."
"It is indeed an historic occasion."
"One of the most important things that was emphasised here this evening was said by Commissioner Patten earlier on in the evening, when he emphasised that we are talking about military facility and not an EU army."
"I do not think that we can underline that sufficiently."
"Even some of our literature that has been circulated with reports on our discussions here tonight, talks about rapid reaction forces instead of a rapid reaction facility, for example. I think if we could clearly understand that, then a lot of the concerns might indeed evaporate."
"What a pity, I say to my colleagues Van Orden and others, because my colleagues just across the pond, the Irish Sea, have so much to offer in this area: the tradition, the experience and the practice."
"Maybe when the election is over we will get a more balanced debate."
"They have so much to offer."
"I am just disappointed with the line they are taking on it. I will say no more."
"I am very proud however of the Irish agreement and the Irish contribution."
"As a small nation that has been traditionally ""neutral"", I am delighted we are in there at the table and doing what we can, given the mandate of the Irish people."
"There is no nation in Europe that is philosophically neutral."
"There are some nations that are militarily neutral and there is a difference."
"Ireland has never been philosophically neutral."
"We have a very strong view on the atrocities and the lack of human rights in some parts of the world and we are not slow to state that."
"We have a very strong view of what we can contribute in peacekeeping and in peace-enforcing, and I hope we will always be able to contribute to that."
"We will never be philosophically neutral nor should that ever be confused with military neutrality."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Doyle."
"The first attendance in our Parliament of a Minister of Defence is such an historic event that we have reserved the evening sitting for it so that our Members are not overwhelmed by the experience."
"Mr President, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the two authors of the reports that we are now discussing, especially my colleague, Catherine Lalumi√®re."
"In the last few weeks the media have focused, as we in Parliament are doing today, on issues concerning European foreign and defence policy."
"I am referring to the creation of a rapid reaction force and the transfer of WEU powers to the European Union."
"It could be said that the public debate on these issues has broadened."
"In addition to the diversity of opinions, I feel that there is a prevailing awareness that Europe is at an historic moment which requires its role in the international system to be clarified."
"The perception of the importance attached by the European public to the common foreign and security policy is, in fact, borne out by the recent findings of Eurobarometer."
"Although we all agree that priority should be given to conflict prevention and to the devastating effects of other types of disaster, the European Union will only be taken seriously if it also provides itself with military support capabilities for humanitarian interventions."
"The progress that we are making in this field must, however, make us extremely thorough."
"Greater clarification and definition are needed at every stage of the creation of common instruments for military defence, from the methods of participation to command, and in the responsibilities that should be given to the various countries."
"We must ensure that this whole process is democratically monitored."
"The European Parliament, working together with the national parliaments, is, in my opinion, the most appropriate body for this task."
"I would like the Minister to comment on this point, if he can."
"Mr President, in this debate in which we are discussing all the problems in the world and in which everyone speaks on whatever subject they like, I have taken the floor to speak about Afghanistan. I would like to start by expressing my satisfaction at the fact that my amendment, which seeks to highlight the total failure of the United Nations drug control programme in Afghanistan, was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that it is now part of the text which is to be put to the vote tomorrow."
"Millions of dollars were promised and then given to the Taliban to enable them to remove, to pull up their opium crops: they pocketed the money and then promptly more than doubled their drugs production."
"The fault lies with the person who appropriated the funds, who should not have been so naive - and in this regard I am sorry to say that the programme and the agency were headed by an Italian - but also with the Taliban for their irresponsibility, and it is therefore right to condemn them, as the resolution indeed does."
"However, I wonder whether it would not have been possible to be harder and harsher in our criticism and even threaten to impose sanctions on the country which gives the regime the greatest support, support without which the Taliban regime would crumble, namely Pakistan."
"Why is Pakistan supporting the Taliban?"
"For various reasons, not least in order to unleash them on Kashmir once they have conquered the whole of Afghanistan, so that they will create anti-Indian hostility there once again."
"Well then, in my opinion, it is extremely important to break this vicious circle, and we can only hope that the resolution will contribute to doing so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Lalumi√®re for a very erudite report."
"I want to focus on two matters."
"The Union' s management of civil crises has not progressed; the conflicts are by nature social, economic, intellectual, ecological and ethnic."
"In all of these, preventive civil crisis management is a better approach than the military option."
"My fear is that a rapid armed reaction force will be used more and more often instead of civil crisis management, and more and more rapidly."
"The European flag is not to be promoted by means of a tank but by social equality, and therein lies a difference of principle."
"I suggest that we organise as effective a rapid reaction civil crisis management centre as has now been planned."
"Then we will be acting in accordance with priorities and our own philosophy."
"My other fear is the involvement of states in NATO that do not wish to be involved."
"There is one solution that might make the situation easier here: involving Russia in crisis management."
"It is likely that Russia will often be either party to or otherwise connected with the crises we will one day have to face."
"It is also known that President Putin does not take a categorically negative view of these crisis management forces, which I think means there are opportunities for cooperation, and when we know what type of crises we are dealing with, this for me would be an additional factor in achieving a balance in the process as a whole."
"It would also make it easier for the nations of Europe to understand the whole issue."
"I warmly welcome last week's decision by the EU Defence and Foreign Ministers to establish a 60,000 strong Rapid Reaction Force."
"I am particularly pleased that the Irish Government is fully committed to this initiative and has pledged that 850 members of our defence forces will participate."
"Like my Fine Gael colleague, Mrs Doyle, I recognise that this does not represent the creation of a European army and before shrill voices are raised in my own country, which there will be, against Irish involvement, I would point out that participation is voluntary and on a case by case basis."
"Let me say this and let me respond to the comments of my other colleague Mr Van Orden."
"I believe that this latest venture is a very important first step to remedy the deficiencies in EU defence capabilities, which were so cruelly exposed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and also Kosovo."
"I believe that the lessons we learn in this latest development will serve us well in the future as we come to terms with the need to establish a European defence policy and capability, which in my view is as much an essential component of European integration as is the single currency."
"This experience will provide us with the opportunity to develop our own policies in such a way, despite Mr Van Orden's fears, that we do not unnecessarily antagonise our US allies or cause stresses and strains within NATO itself."
"EU policy must always be based on the partnership approach which seeks to share NATO assets, particularly planning and intelligence as well as hardware, rather than duplicate the structures of NATO, particularly when we share common objectives."
"I believe this experience will serve the EU well when we come to develop our own defence policy, and I sincerely hope that that will come sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, Paragraph 31 of Mr Brok' s report on the common foreign and security policy highlights the following message: '[The European Parliament] stresses the need, for the democratic legitimacy of Russia, given its political union with Belarus, that Russia's president and government unequivocally reiterate the strong need for democratic reforms in Belarus, particularly in the light of the report delivered in Minsk on 16 October 2000 by the parliamentary troika from the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.'"
"I am the author of that amendment, backed by a broad majority of the European Parliament' s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Does Russia, in the long term, want to be in political union with a non-democratic r√©gime?"
"I also want specifically to name four people who have disappeared without trace in Belarus in the course of the years 1998-2000, together with a politician who died in obscure circumstances."
"These people are: Jurij Zaharenko, former Minister of the Interior and Vice-President of Belarus' s 13th Supreme Soviet;"
"Mr Krasovskij, friend of Vice-President Gonchar, who has disappeared with him; Dmitrij Zavadskij, a film maker for Russian TV who disappeared in mysterious circumstances from Minsk Airport on 7 July of this year; and, finally, Jurij Karpenko, leader of the Civil Party and former Mayor of Molodechno, who died suddenly and in obscure circumstances in August 1999."
"I would ask Mr Patten and Mr Solana, together with the incoming Swedish Presidency, to take vigorous joint action against Belarus' s anti-democratic r√©gime."
"Mr President, first of all I want to thank you for your concern regarding the length of this part-session, but as you know I have been a parliamentarian for 21 years now, so I am impervious to ups and downs of this kind."
"I would just add a few words to the comments on Afghanistan and say that the Council is determined to provide humanitarian aid on the ground so long as operational conditions allow it."
"I shall then make a few remarks on, obviously, only a few aspects of the very comprehensive debate we have just held on the reports by Mr Brok and Mrs Lalumi√®re, the broad lines of which, I believe, were largely endorsed."
"This, of course, encourages the governments in the work they are doing and will, I think, support the Nice Council."
"Let me start with the question of the position of defence capabilities within the European Union's spectrum of political and practical instruments."
"As many speakers have said, among the means at the European Union's disposal, military means must be used only by last resort."
"Obviously I must emphasise this principle, which is the one the governments uphold."
"But what does ""by last resort"" mean?"
"It means when everything else has failed and that is the only option."
"We saw this happen in Europe two years ago, and in Kosovo a year and a half ago."
"All the political and diplomatic efforts, all the economic pressure, could not prevent the outbreak of violence in the heart of Europe and the unacceptable challenge that posed to all our European values."
"So armed force is certainly a last resort. But if we want it to prevent the unacceptable, it must be reliable and credible."
"I also think that the European Union has the specific ability to combine these various instruments and that what we must do, if this policy progresses and becomes consolidated, is to develop a genuine European culture of conflict prevention and management."
"We have learned from past experience and are still learning, especially in the Balkans, that thanks to their historical experience, with all the many conflicts, thanks to their understanding of the subtle and at times tough nature of confrontations between communities, the Europeans can develop a savoir-faire and methods of conflict management that are worthy of it and worthy of respect."
"On the question of duplication, let me point out that the resources, the military assets the nations have freely accepted to provide for this joint force, are the same capabilities most of these nations make available to the Atlantic Alliance."
"There is no duplication of forces."
"They are the same forces, with the same level of preparation and readiness that most of our nations have - of course I belong to one of the nations that is not a member of the Alliance."
"But in regard to all those nations that are members of the Atlantic Alliance, there is no duplication in their defence effort between forces to provide support for the Alliance's activities and forces that could be made available to the European Union."
"On the question of the concept: this concept was adopted in 1992."
"It relates to the Petersberg tasks."
"They are enshrined in an agreement between European governments, which provides lines of conduct that are, in my view, well-tried and very broadly endorsed by European public opinion."
"Any action that had to be taken would obviously have to be decided by the governments on a basis of consensus, and as several speakers said, if we emphasise in the declarations that we are not talking about a European army, that means that clearly there is no authority superior to the nations that could force them to commit their forces to any operation whatsoever."
"So Europe is not about to form a new alliance as some people, who are not, I believe, fully informed, have suggested."
"It will operate on the basis of national decisions taken in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation under the control of the national parliaments, in respect for the Petersberg tasks and in compliance, as we have also said in our declarations, with the principles of the United Nations Charter."
"I believe that the European security and defence policy will move in the direction of providing an additional capability, practical support for the role of the United Nations, which is to resolve conflicts, including cases where the belligerents have to be kept apart."
"That is my reply to a comment made by one speaker to the effect that the United Kingdom and France concluded an agreement in Saint Malo that would restrict the European Parliament's rights."
"That is not what it was about."
"The agreement reached in Saint Malo, which was primarily an agreement between the fifteen nations, was that if they wanted Europe to have a practical, effective capacity for action in the defence field, this could only be achieved on an intergovernmental basis."
"Let us not forget that for a period of 50 years we hesitated or failed to give the European Union the minimum capability it needed so as not just to be an impotent witness to crises or outbreaks of violence."
"Today the only option we have is intergovernmental action."
"That suits all our democratic nations because it preserves their ultimate right to decide on the use of force."
"De facto, therefore, it is true that parliamentary control is largely the result of the nations choosing the intergovernmental option."
"I would also note, by the way, that the positions adopted by the Council do not, and will not, include any EU budgetary commitment to finance military action of whatever kind."
"Does that mean there can be no dialogue between the Council, representing the governments, and the European Parliament on defence and security?"
"I think this debate, which everyone has welcomed, is a first demonstration that the opposite is true."
"I believe we will see a positive dialogue developing."
"Why?"
"Because if we remain consistent with the decisions that have been taken, we will see a gradual rise in the European Union's level of responsibility, credibility and influence in crisis management."
"We will stop being a mere commentator."
"As a result, public opinion and our parliaments, including this one, will begin to give deeper political thought to the issues involved in resolving crises by a whole range of means, of which armed force is but one component."
"And the nature of the principles and thoughts set out in the reports by Mr Brok and Mrs Lalumi√®re already show and indeed foreshadow how useful these debates could be."
"There will still be other forms of rapprochement to invent with the national parliaments, but at any rate one thing that is within our reach and that represents a turning point I believe we can all welcome, is the fact that the fifteen nations which make up this Union, which have already built a political reality that has a positive effect on the international balance of power, these fifteen nations have chosen to acquire the means to act jointly in cases where violence challenges our values."
"They are doing so because they believe in our common values."
"I see that as good news."
"Thank you very much, Minister."
"Pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution to end this debate."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Reform of the Commission"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the Commission in March 1999 highlighted the need to reform its structures and working methods."
"The energetic reform exercise it is now undertaking must seek above all to restore public confidence."
"The need for reform is beyond doubt and the Commission must become a first-class administration in the service of our political objective."
"That is an essential condition for lending credibility to the construction of the European Union."
"Following the reports by the independent experts, the Commission, at the initiative of Mr Kinnock, presented a White Paper proposing reforms to the way it functions."
"Officially, our Parliament is consulted simply with a view to delivering an opinion, but Mr Kinnock assured us that our views would be taken very seriously in the Commission's further activities, in which we will be associated."
"Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and a hitherto unknown procedure was applied, in the form of four parallel reports."
"Let me now welcome the work done with my PPE colleagues, Mr Pom√©s Ruiz, Mr Harbour and Mr Lamassoure."
"So we decided on a method of looking at the entire issue, without any overlaps."
"That method was respected and involved us in a major consultation process."
"It enabled us to take a common approach, which respected each committee's terms of reference while seeking a real, underlying consistency among our reports."
"However, I want to point out that the PSE considers it essential for the reform to respect the treaties in a very pragmatic way."
"The cohesion between all the reform sectors should assure the people of Europe that the methods by which European integration is managed politically are clearly visible and truly transparent."
"Obviously the modernisation of a structure as complex as the Commission requires diplomacy, patience and trust on the part of the various players, and particularly the staff."
"That is why we want to ensure that this process is not imposed from above; we consider it crucial that all the staff are effectively associated in this whole process of modernisation."
"Although it may be led from the top, the reform must be clear and visible to the unions, to all the staff, who must be effectively associated in this whole process."
"We are firmly resolved to give a new dynamism to the European civil service, but that means we must respect certain principles: the European civil service must continue to be governed by a single set of interinstitutional Staff Regulations, which ensure that every official is recruited at the same basic grade and provide for real mobility, access to real training."
"The recruitment procedure must always guarantee equal opportunities to all EU nationals."
"The Committee on Budget's opinion on the reform concentrates on these major aspects, in line with our powers and responsibilities."
"The leitmotif is the systematic reminder that, parallel to any legislative procedure, all budgetary decisions must be taken in the framework of the related annual procedures and the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Parliament has a great responsibility towards the citizens."
"As an arm of the budgetary authority, it must ensure that public monies are properly used."
"Moreover, over and above all other considerations, we will be even more careful in future to ensure that the Commission really does spend the adopted budget on implementing the various political priorities our Parliament has democratically decided, rather than reallocating it on the basis of functional weaknesses."
"The package of measures proposed in the White Paper must help modernise the whole way the Commission functions and make it more efficient."
"We will support it and ensure that these procedures lead, as soon as possible, to a management culture geared to results and performance criteria, taking account of the cost-benefit ratio but also of our political priorities, and remembering that decentralisation and delegation of authority are essential tools, provided that power of decision and of supervision are guaranteed."
"The communication from the European Commission must deliver a common message to the various institutions."
"In concrete terms, it is crucial to review the procedures for honouring the budget votes."
"The non-execution of the budget, the excessive delay between inclusion in the budget and commitment, and then the payment of appropriations, is a caricature."
"It is extremely urgent to find ad hoc procedures to restore credibility to the Commission's activities."
"That means we must review the procedures and fix realistic objectives so that the backlog can be cleared rapidly and the delay between commitments and payments, which undermines the credibility of a large part of the budget, can be reduced. We must also provide for the suspension of contracts if there is no longer any consistency between budget appropriations and political commitments, and for paying subsidies and commitments at an early date."
"The credibility of the Commission, and therefore of the European Union, depends on its ability to reform its financial management systems very quickly."
"In the medium term, it is essential to fine-tune the budgetary procedures and ensure closer consultation between the budgetary authority and the Commission at the beginning of each financial year. That will avoid our plunging into the great difficulties we experienced in November and December and into situations that do not enable Parliament's political expectations to be translated correctly or allow for the real modernisation of the functioning of the Commission."
"An annual evaluation of the changes in the functioning of the Commission and of the additional cost of this reform requires consultation at the beginning of each financial year."
"That measure will take time, but it is inevitable and crucial to the reform."
"The introduction of global management by project must be accompanied by a new nomenclature to ensure transparent management."
"We are very much in favour of that."
"We will make sure that all the technical provisions can be implemented on the basis of full respect for Parliament's rights as an arm of the budgetary authority."
"Our committee was very pleased to see the conclusions of the Bourlanges report on externalisation taken up in the Letter of Amendment."
"However, in regard to commitology, the Member States all too often promote national interests that are at odds with those of the Community and consultation of their committees slows down the decision-making process and increases the cost."
"So the reform must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved."
"I shall not dwell on the question of human resources since Mr Harbour has addressed it."
"The Commission's human resources are obviously not up to the new tasks entrusted to it, in addition to those it will have to assume in the future, and the redeployment proposed in the Letter of Amendment, which only relates to 4% of staff, will not resolve the human resources problem either."
"In accepting the substance of the Letter of Amendment during the budgetary consultation procedure last Thursday, the Council proved that the other arm of the budgetary authority did in fact wish to support the reform of our Commission."
"The questions of audit, management and financial control are basically dealt with in Mr Pom√©s Ruiz's report."
"The Commission's position on the recasting of the Financial Regulation has been known since 22 November."
"We expressed our views on the reform of the fast-track procedure in the vote on the van Hulten report."
"Yet we would point out again that it is absolutely vital to guarantee independent financial control."
"Moreover, it is totally illogical for the Council alone to be able to amend the Financial Regulation and we repeat our call for conciliation on this issue."
"The reform of the Commission is crucial to the future of our institutions."
"The working method chosen by the Conference of Presidents, which some found rather risky, took time."
"But looking at the four reports as a whole, this period of consultation has allowed us to take both a broader and a closer view, which has increased the value of Parliament's opinion."
"This report looks at the very first steps in the reform of the Commission, a major project aimed at the genuinely modern management of the Union."
"It will be followed by many other reports and, for my part, after these weeks of working together, I hope we adhere to this method in future too."
"I want to give particular thanks to the other three rapporteurs, for I really appreciated the way we worked and the clarity of their positions."
"The differences of view that emerged are not just political but more a reflection of the cultural differences between the Fifteen."
"They show that the very different approaches to the management of the public service we see every day in the different EU institutions, as also in our political groups."
"The implementation of this reform clearly reflects the difficulties we are facing, but we know that this exercise, however difficult, is a vital one."
"Together, we have contributed to this first stage that is crucial for the political future of the Union; we have modernised its management to make it more transparent and therefore bring it closer to our citizens, so as to convince them more firmly that their only future lies in a stronger European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Kinnock, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, this debate marks the climax of Parliament' s examination of the White Paper on the reform of the Commission. This examination is intended, above all, to give new life, new support, to the Commission after the crisis it has suffered, which we all regret."
"I would like to warmly thank Mrs Guy-Quint, Mr Harbour and Mr Lamassoure for their work."
"We four rapporteurs have worked in a great spirit of cooperation and that means that this procedure, which is complicated in itself, will tomorrow give rise to four coordinated reports, which do not overlap each other and which provide the encouragement which we all wish to see for the task and responsibility which President Prodi has taken on."
"While each report deals with the aspects which concern each committee, there is a common element amongst the four: they all express a generally favourable opinion of the proposals for reform presented by the Commission in its White Paper, although at the same time they remain vigilant with regard to their implementation and development."
"With regard to the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to inform you that my report has been approved unanimously, apart from one abstention, and that we have been unanimous in stressing once again the need for a strong, independent, transparent and efficient Commission; in short, a genuine pillar for European integration."
"We have also been unanimous in stating that many of the shortcomings and irregularities that were condemned during the discharge for 1996 were due to the fact that previous Commissions had not managed to modernise their management and control systems and had not applied all of the legislation in force."
"In drawing up my report, I have been able to study not only the White Paper, but also the second report of the committee of independent experts and the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 19 January, proposed by Michiel van Hulten, on the work of the aforementioned committee of experts."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control and I myself are pleased to see that, in producing the White Paper, the Commission has largely taken its inspiration from the proposals of the independent experts and has taken account of many of the observations made by Parliament on 19 January."
"As the committee with responsibility for budgetary control, I highlight in the report approved by the committee the aspects of the reform concerning competence in this area."
"In this respect, we have fully supported the establishment of a true sense of responsibility amongst officials."
"This is the basis of the new philosophy for management of the Commission: each administrative unit will be expected to take responsibility for the regularity and legality of all its actions."
"The Directors-General will have responsibility for the internal control of their directorates-general, without in any way exempting the respective Commissioners from their own political responsibility with regard to the functioning of the services and that includes, where appropriate, the President of the Commission."
"The main task of the new internal auditing service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President with responsibility for reform, will be to analyse the functions and systems of internal control which exist within the Commission."
"This function is, as the Court of Auditors points out in its report 4/97, much broader and more general than the current function performed by ex ante overall control."
"In this respect, I would like to remind you that on 5 October last our Parliament gave the green light to the amendment of Article 24(5) of the financial regulation currently in force."
"In that way Parliament put an end to what the Court of Auditors had been condemning since 1981 and which it reiterated in its report 4/97: a latent conflict which exists between the power to grant an approval - and hence to authorise an item of expenditure - and the task of assessing it soon after according to criteria of good financial management."
"This amendment makes sense in a transitional period until the adoption of the new financial regulation which, according to the recommendations of the committee of experts, is intended to establish a system of control, based not on ex ante centralized control, but on ex post, a posteriori, auditing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the new system will prove to be more effective than the current one."
"The Court of Auditors, in its report 4/97, repeats its position with regard to the impact of financial control, which is not evenly balanced."
"Compared to the great efficiency that it demonstrates with regard to appropriations managed directly by the Commission, its weakness with regard to decentralised operational costs is notable."
"Evidence of this weakness can be found in the extremely limited number of refusals of approval, of authorisation, originating from the Commission."
"The Court of Auditors indicates in its report that it is not opposed to the removal of prior approval provided that it is replaced by other procedures, which offer guarantees that are at least equivalent, and can thereby involve parties other than the financial controller."
"This other party is specifically the internal auditing service, which will be completely independent."
"The Court of Auditors also says that, on the express condition that the role of the contractor..."
"(The President indicated that the speaker' s allotted time had elapsed)"
"I will end by saying that this is not a time for complacency, Mr President."
"We are not here to celebrate a victory."
"The fact that this Parliament is supporting the reform of the Commission should encourage it to shoulder its risks, its responsibility, as Mr Kinnock has promised, and also to get it right."
"They have the duty to get it right and to take risks, not to avoid them."
"Mr President, it is a special pleasure for me finally, and I emphasis the word finally, to be here tonight presenting this report."
"I recall that I first met Vice-President Kinnock in December last year when the parliament intimated that I was to be asked to take on this task."
"So it has taken eleven months before we have moved forward."
"It has been a very pleasurable experience."
"Certainly I echo what colleagues have said that the team of rapporteurs have worked very well together."
"It has been a pleasure to work together and I think the process of addressing a crucial reform of the Commission that is central to the future of the European Union has had added depth and richness because the four of us have been involved."
"The focus of my report is on the strategy for the human resource reforms."
"I emphasis strategy because the Legal Affairs Committee has perhaps at least two years work ahead of it, although we hope not quite as long as that, in scrutinising all the reforms of the Staff Regulations that will flow from the human resource reforms."
"So we were keen to make sure that the strategic framework was in place and that it was the right one."
"Generally we are satisfied with that, but we are not complacent about it and I just want to highlight what I think are some of the crucial issues that the Commission is facing and how we can help them achieve this absolutely critical reform."
"One of the things that we were keen to do in our committee was not just to look at this in isolation but to look at what was going on outside."
"We held a very successful public hearing on the reforms where we brought in people from private and public industry to give us the environment, the organisational and human resource changes that are going on around us, in which the Commission is going to have to move forward with these reforms."
"Indeed it is going to have to recruit the best people in a very competitive market."
"What was very interesting from those discussions was to see how employment and organisation practices in private and public sector are actually moving closer together."
"Big organisations everywhere now are becoming more open; they are becoming more transparent; they are using information technology in new ways; they are moving away from traditional vertical forms of organisation, sharing information across organisations and between each other."
"That is the crucial lesson that the Commission is going to have to take up in the details of its reform."
"In the short time this evening I do not have time to go through all our specific recommendations in detail, so I want to centre on what I think is the key element of how these reforms must move forward."
"We must develop an organisation within the Commission that is going to centre around giving every official clear objectives, giving them the right resources to deliver those objectives."
"That includes the all important financial resources, as both Ms Guy-Quint and Mr Pom√©s Ruiz have emphasised, and empowering them to use those resources accordingly."
"They must be given goals to be measured against, but also rewarded in terms of salary and promotion depending on how well they meet those goals."
"That is the core of what we are trying to do here."
"Those people who progress through the organisation will do so in a structured way with better career planning."
"They may expect to move to other European institutions, to be seconded to national governments, or to work in the private sector."
"That should become the norm, part of a standard career in the European Commission."
"They would also expect during that career to meet with people who are coming in from outside: on a short-term contract; a specialist, a young person who sees three or four or five years working in the Commission as part of a career plan."
"We should be encouraging those people alongside the structured career plan of the permanent service in the Commission."
"We expect all this in a modern organisation in future."
"The strategy is right but the details have to be right as well to really succeed."
"In managing an organisation it is all very well having the rules and regulations in place but there are so many other crucial ingredients: the attitude of the staff, their commitment and support for the plans and their willingness to change."
"All of those will be crucial and the involvement of everybody, whether in trade unions or not, will also be absolutely essential."
"Leadership from the top will be crucial."
"Vice-President Kinnock has tremendous enthusiasm for everything he does."
"He has led this process very enthusiastically, but it has to be led from the very top."
"I was pleased that all four of us had the opportunity to meet President Prodi recently."
"He assured us that he also gave these reforms his full backing."
"From the top all of these reforms must cascade down as quickly as possible to give the European Union the powerful Commission that it really needs to deliver its objectives over the next 20 years."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite its scope the contents of the White Paper presented by Mr Kinnock do not directly raise any institutional topics."
"It does, however, constitute the first stage of a wider discussion launched by Commission President Prodi himself, concerning what is called the governance of the Union."
"A further document on the subject is being prepared by the Commission."
"It is in that spirit, in order to start the debate immediately, that our Committee on Constitutional Affairs, following the other three committees consulted, looked at the question of the Commission's political effectiveness."
"Is the Commission able today to carry out the tasks and, in addition, the political role which fall to it under the Treaties?"
"Indeed, in a Europe which will have 30 Member States tomorrow, with a bloated Council and a 700-member, 20-language Parliament, the Commission will have a more important role than ever to play in defining and upholding the common European interest."
"Accordingly, our committee repeats its attachment to a strong, independent, effective, transparent and politically answerable Commission."
"To guarantee that it has these qualities, we insist on five points."
"One: the spirit of good governance must not be confined to the Commission's management tasks."
"It must also underpin its function of proposing legislation, for instance by devising an internal procedure which will ensure that the subsidiarity principle is respected and by keeping a chronological record of procedures in order to reduce excessive delays in the preparation of documents."
"Second important point: the Commission is the only institution that can coordinate all the activities relating to the preparation and follow-up of European decisions."
"Where it does not do so, the results are felt, as we have seen, especially in the second and third pillars."
"So we call on the Member States to give the Commission the main role in the preparation for and follow-up to meetings of the European Council and of the Council of Ministers in all its forms, which can be done without formally modifying the institutions."
"On the other hand, it is not up to the Commission itself to manage the implementation of the European policies or of the corresponding appropriations."
"The White Paper points out that at present about half the Commission staff is assigned to management tasks."
"That is too few if we consider that the Commission should manage itself."
"It is far too many if we think it should offload most of these management tasks, which is our view."
"Decentralisation must be the rule, in favour of the national administrations or external agencies."
"Regarding these agencies, the three institutions should take the deliberations on governance as an opportunity to establish a common doctrine on what is called externalisation."
"The establishment of independent agencies is justified whenever a scientific or technical opinion is required or decentralised management seems better."
"That was the case, for example, with the European Drugs Monitoring Centre."
"It will be the case tomorrow for food security or air safety, but provided we avoid any dismembering of the Commission's political responsibility and ensure that the latter has the legal means to account to Parliament and the Council for the way in which the agencies perform their tasks."
"Lastly, it is also time to look at the Union's external representation."
"We discussed that during this afternoon's debate on the common foreign policy."
"Here too we have reached the borderline between what aspects come under good governance and what may justify measures of institutional reform, questions that were raised by Commissioner Patten."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls for an overall study into the problem of the Union's external representation both in dealing with third countries in international negotiations and in international bodies, and to consider the establishment of a common diplomatic service."
"The debate on governance is thus launched."
"We will continue it in spring on the basis of the Nice conclusions and the new Commission proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to begin by thanking Mrs Guy-Quint in particular for seeking consensus throughout the process of drawing up her report."
"As the Committee on Budgets we consider that the establishment of the budget by activities causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority."
"We have just come from a budgetary negotiation with the Council, as Mrs Guy-Quint is well aware, where the hardest thing has been to determine in a clearer and more precise way what the limits of budgetary power are for one party or another."
"The Committee on Budgets considers that Parliament must not lose its control over the allocation of administrative appropriations."
"Our fears are not greatly allayed by the fact that, when the establishment of the budget by activities is over, category 5 of the financial perspectives will disappear."
"We are not speaking against these consequences, but in favour of safeguarding the budgetary powers of this Parliament."
"Therefore, any tendency of the Commission reform to covertly remove from Parliament this ability to control administrative expenditure would create interinstitutional problems in the short term."
"However, an approach that safeguards Parliament' s powers of control and decision-making with regard to expenditure in the current category 5 will guarantee that the Commission reform will be negotiated with no further problems."
"With regard to the TAOs and the transitional period for their dismantling, my Group insists that the Commission should make the greatest possible effort to limit that transitional period."
"We therefore ask the Commissioner: can the Commission guarantee a truly limited transitional period?"
"Finally, we must deal with the thorny issue of the proposal on early retirement."
"We are awaiting a three-way dialogue to define this question, amongst others, before the final approval of the 2001 budget."
"My group does not reject the idea of this proposal on early retirement being obligatory."
"We believe that the lack of definition of the current proposal could create more problems than advantages and we have already received some indications of concern from various officials."
"Nevertheless, we will give the Commission our vote of confidence so that it can give as much detail as possible about the scope of its proposal."
"During the coming three-way dialogue, we hope to receive good news on many issues, including this one, as well as the lifting of the reserve in the category of new posts."
"This would clearly indicate this Parliament' s goodwill in relation to moving ahead with this reform with the Commission."
"Mr President, today is an important day for Commission reform."
"Well, that is how I was going to begin but looking around the room I am beginning to doubt my own words."
"It is indicative of the way Parliament works that we are still not used to putting the items where we really have a big input at the top of our agenda and instead first debate those issues where Parliament does not have a formal say."
"(Applause from Mr Kinnock) Six months after the Commission set out its plans in a White Paper, Parliament is ready to give its opinion."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs."
"They did an excellent job under difficult conditions."
"Admittedly, we created the difficult conditions ourselves, but they were difficult conditions nonetheless."
"On matters as important as this one it is important that Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that is what tomorrow' s vote will demonstrate we are doing."
"I would like to extend my particular thanks to Mr Pom√©s Ruiz who drew up the report for the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"He demonstrated great willingness to take on board the views of his fellow members of the committee."
"The result of this exercise is a strong set of reports which will receive the near-unanimous endorsement of the House tomorrow."
"So I think the Commission had better take them seriously."
"It is also an important day for Commission reform because the Commission today adopted a number of proposals which I believe will be the key to restoring the confidence of the people of Europe in our institutions."
"First, the Commission has accepted the need for rules to protect whistle-blowers."
"The crisis which led to the Commission' s resignation last year demonstrated the absence of adequate provisions for dealing with genuine, honest complaints put forward by hard-working officials."
"While we may continue to differ over the role played by Mr Van Buitenen it is clear that he should never have been punished for following his conscience."
"Second, the Commission proposes to overhaul the disciplinary procedure."
"This is long overdue."
"The Commission has now decided to accept the recommendations by the Committee of Independent Experts that the disciplinary board should be headed by an independent chair."
"This will greatly enhance, and will be seen to enhance, the fairness and accuracy of the disciplinary process."
"Third, the Commission has adopted a proposal for an advisory group on standards in public life to be set up by inter-institutional agreement."
"This is also in line with the proposals made by the independent experts, and one which was strongly endorsed by Parliament in its resolution of 19 January of this year."
"The report by Mr Pom√©s Ruiz sets out Parliament' s position on this issue in greater detail."
"I am happy to see that the Commission' s proposal appears to be consistent with the position we are due to adopt tomorrow."
"But important challenges still lie ahead."
"The overhaul of the system of financial management and control has only just begun and while I do not share the pessimistic view just expressed by my EPP colleague I do think there is a lot of work left to be done."
"The de-centralisation of financial control to DGs is an important step but it will only work if staff are properly trained, if sufficient resources are available, and if the responsibility of line managers is properly enforced."
"In this context two aspects of the process are of particular concern to us."
"First, the Commission has not yet taken up our suggestion to set up an external chamber for financial discipline."
"The Commission may have perfectly good reasons for not doing so, but we would like to know what they are."
"Second, the setting up of a financial irregularities help-desk or panel as proposed in the White Paper is acceptable to my group only if it can be shown that such a help-desk will in no way undermine the ability of OLAF to do its work."
"After one and a half years of discussion and preparation the Commission is now putting its money where its mouth is."
"The reform process is on track and being implemented as the Commission' s progress reports have shown."
"The only danger in my view right now is that we become complacent and that we give in to the forces of conservatism."
"They are everywhere: in Parliament, in the Council, in the Commission."
"I therefore call on the Commission to redouble its efforts and to make sure that in two years' time, we have the first results that will show the people of Europe that the Commission is working again."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"Improving EU administration is one of most important reforms of this parliamentary term."
"The main objective of the reform of the Commission must be a reduction in bureaucracy, increased efficiency and an end to financial confusion."
"This means simplifying ways of working, devolving power downwards, and a better definition of the power of decision."
"The key to reform is to increase and emphasise the importance of personal responsibility."
"People in positions of responsibility within the institutions must bear both the legal and financial responsibility for their decisions."
"Emphasising the importance of personal responsibility requires, among other things, the swift reform of Staff Regulations."
"The reform will require activity-based budgeting."
"The managers of units and institutions must be given a certain amount of leeway in administration."
"Attention should be mainly focused on results, rather than working practice."
"Only then can the resources that are available be allocated most effectively."
"An institution and its directors must have clear scope for the best possible administrative practices."
"Bearing responsibility will mean ending the advance monitoring of financing."
"If there is more than one decision-maker, nobody clearly bears the responsibility."
"Administrative reform is particularly necessary to improve financial transactions in the European Union."
"The same practice needs to be followed in the payment of EU bills as in the outside world."
"The current three-month term is too long, let alone the fact that many payments are delayed for more than a year."
"That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice."
"My group firmly supports administrative reform."
"Mr President, my group, the Greens/European Free Alliance, also support the reform of the Commission as set out in the White Paper, and we urge its speedy implementation."
"Time and again in today's debate on Nice, we heard that the EU is facing enormous challenges and that the enlargement of the EU to an eventual total of 27 or more Member States will test the resilience of the European institutions."
"At the same time, however, the prestige of the European institutions has sunk to a new low in the eyes of the public, beset as they are between a lack of confidence on the one hand and the pressure generated by a growing number of problems on the other; by way of example, I need only name three of the most pressing problems at the present time - the oil crisis, climate change and BSE."
"We urgently need reform of the institutions, the sort of reform that will rebuild confidence and enable the Union to act more effectively."
"We need legitimacy, which is born of greater efficiency, activity-based management, the creation of a culture of accountability, greater transparency, user-friendly administrative services and decentralisation."
"We can only endorse these aims that the Commission has set itself."
"We do fear, however, that the required degree of courage is still lacking in certain areas."
"Let me take the example of transparency."
"The Commission made great promises about transparency when it took office."
"Sadly, the reality of the situation is quite different, as is shown by the framework agreement with Parliament and the rules on access to information."
"We can see that some ground still needs to be made up here, and we hope that the Commission will take a bolder approach to the transparency problem."
"As for disciplinary procedures, pledges have been made here too, but no clear rules have been formulated so far, nor have we seen or heard any clear statements as to how such rules would be enforced, nor has the question of external agencies been conclusively resolved."
"We are hoping for an unequivocal statement on this at an early date."
"With regard to 'whistle-blowers', I should like to subscribe to Mr van Hulten's earlier remarks."
"On this matter too, we should have welcomed a less diffident approach from the Commission and greater courage on its part to address this problem openly, because whistle-blowers, of course, contributed in no small measure to the fact that reform process was finally set in motion."
"The implementation of the budget is another area in which the Commission - and Parliament too, for that matter - must consider in future what to do about the problem of backlogs, how to ensure that we start to address the question of budgetary commitments in the implementation of new programmes too, so that we do not always have this huge discrepancy between commitments and payments."
"In the domain of personnel too, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - of all groups - had imagined that Parliament might have been more accommodating towards the Commission."
"Indeed, we believe that the establishment of new posts has been very tentative; given the current tasks of the Commission and the forthcoming eastward enlargement, there will certainly be a need to increase the rate of staff recruitment in future."
"But, as I have said, there has been a regrettable lack of support from Parliament."
"The European Parliament needs to take a good look at itself here too."
"In general, we consider the basic approach taken in the White Paper to be right and proper, and we hope that the Commission has staying power and further reserves of courage on which it can draw in the course of the implementation process."
"Mr President, despite the effort made by the rapporteurs to support the Commission's work, the fact remains that a coherent, global response aimed at producing a governing policy in addition to merely improving the institution's administration system has not yet been given to the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"We take note of the fact that the Commission has endeavoured to introduce progressively a new budgetary nomenclature, but we would like to know when this process will be completed."
"I would just like to point out that, according to the experts, under the current budgetary nomenclature most of the subsidies are in fact disguised contracts, which the Commission refuses to treat as such because transparency is ensured even less effectively by subsidies than by contracts."
"I will not dwell on the recruitment procedures."
"The fact remains that the secrecy veiling these procedures is still incomprehensible."
"As far as we are concerned, the only reform possible was put forward by the Socialist Group when it tabled 3 amendments to the B√∂sch report, which we discussed during the last part-session."
"I will close by touching on the commitology."
"According to the Committee of Independent Experts, the committees of the representatives of the Member States tend in practice to become a mechanism through which national interests are represented in the implementation of Community policies, sometimes to the point where they become a forum for dividing up the booty of Community funds."
"In our opinion, on this issue, the Commission sees nothing, hears nothing and sometimes speaks in a whisper if at all."
"With regard to the Commission reform, we feel that the disparity between declared goals and accomplished facts is clear."
"Mr President, in his letter to the Romans, the apostle Paul exhorts his readers to allow themselves to be transformed by the renewing of their minds."
"This process of transformation is necessary to be able to truly serve God and cannot be enforced by rules."
"Although the reform of the Commission is not to be compared with Paul' s message, this Biblical precept contains an important lesson for the Commission: rules cannot enforce true obedience."
"Commissioner Kinnock is trying, by changing and improving the rules, to give the Commission officials an enhanced sense of responsibility."
"As sound as the intention behind the rules may be, ultimately it all revolves around the implementation of these rules."
"The new rules must therefore be tested as to their feasibility."
"At the deepest level, this reform process is about a change of attitude and behaviour on the part of the Commission and its officials."
"This change of attitude should find expression in openness of government."
"The reform plans still leave a lot to be desired on that score."
"The proposed advisory service for financial irregularities will not only undermine OLAF' s openness, but also its work."
"In view of its limited budget, the Commission will have to make choices in its task package."
"We must choose between deepening or enlarging the Union."
"The years to come will be dominated by the issue of enlargement."
"It is therefore astounding that the rapporteurs Mrs Guy-Quint and Mr Pom√©s Ruiz completely pass over this and merely regard the reform process as a means of achieving European political integration."
"I believe that the reform of the Commission should be seen in the context of enlargement, and that is what it must be guided by."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the plan to reform the Commission, we are progressing towards the new European institutions: new in that changes were made to the old institutions following the problems which arose during past management and on the basis of the lengthy, exhaustive and in many places complex report of the independent experts."
"As in the case of anything new which changes established situations, care and precision are clearly necessary."
"Those with legislative responsibility cannot, and must not, let themselves be influenced by emotion and must not accept proposals in toto which, although the product of brilliant minds, do not follow the principle of representativeness."
"The experts, as such, are specialists, but the legislator cannot be either their obedient servant or another expert: he must hear, consult, reflect and then produce on his own initiative, or else he may as well give up politics and leave law-making to the experts."
"We would point out that part of the reform, which was unwisely adopted in September last year in line with the experts' proposal, was then rejected by the Court of Justice."
"The entire structure of the Commission, which is a fundamental institutional body of the Union's current system, implements European Union policy as willed by Parliament and the Council."
"Parliament must succeed in reforming the appropriate and necessary parts of the Commission without undue influence from outside, in order indeed to guarantee efficiency and transparency but also to make those who work there more aware of themselves, of what they are, of what they do and for whom they work."
"As I see it, there is no structure of greater importance or substance in the world: 15 nations, soon to become 20 or more, an entire continent; the most industrialised part of the globe thrives in the Union and, therefore, in the Commission through its structures."
"The officials working in the Commission and Parliament must be top quality, aware of this and paid accordingly."
"They must work but they must also receive all the guarantees and prerogatives appropriate to their job."
"They must be accountable but not subjected to humiliation."
"If we give due recognition to those who have to be good, hard workers in order to be here, we will achieve excellent institutions."
"Otherwise, everything will regress and the same problems may well arise as in the past, those very problems which have prompted us to carry out these reforms."
"Mr President, can I start off by acknowledging Mr Harbour and the work he has put in to his report."
"Like Mr Van Hulten I commend the way he worked with other people and was prepared to take on ideas and submissions from other political groups."
"At the same time I thank the Commission and its staff for their support and assistance."
"The Harbour report is really only the broad framework, it is basically the bones."
"There is still a lot to be done, and I believe that Parliament cannot rest on its laurels."
"We have already heard that the Commissioner earlier today launched a series of papers on individual aspects of the report."
"Parliament, I understand, will not officially be considering these. This is a mistake."
"For what happens in staff reform in the Commission will ultimately have repercussions for the Parliament and we should not forget that."
"I would like to pick up on the some 26 amendments which have been made to the Harbour report."
"As you would expect we are supporting Amendments Nos 1 to 6, submitted by the PSE."
"We shall however be withdrawing Amendment No 6 and asking for a split vote on the latter part of Amendment No 15 as we do not believe the current system within the ECB lends itself to this situation."
"We would ask that Amendments Nos 20 and 23 be taken as additions, as in Paragraph 10 it would be utter folly to delete the involvement in drawing up the job goals and the personnel development role of the appraisal system."
"Amendment No 23 looks like it was an afterthought and while we are not against it, it should not replace the existing Paragraph 22."
"We are supporting Amendments Nos 13, 14, 16 and 9 submitted by the PPE."
"We are opposing the rest of the amendments as they either add nothing to the report or basically take us off into flights of fantasy."
"I would like to say something quickly about change."
"Change is never easy."
"Many people are resistant to change because of the fear of taking that step into the unknown."
"Can I say that as someone who has been an employee of an organisation which downsized without any consultation with the existing staff, I envy the Commission staff."
"Can I also say as someone who has been of another organisation who went through a downsizing and was made redundant, I am more than envious of the Commission staff and the way they are working and the Commissioner working with them."
"It is not easy being made redundant."
"I wish I had been offered the chance of retraining for another job within that organisation."
"I want initially to pay credit to Mr Harbour."
"I recall what he said about the long gestation period of this work and I would encourage the Commission not to feel that the timetable is an indefinite one."
"There has been a vacuum and I would encourage the Commission to feel that its restored sense of self-confidence is important to us here in the Parliament and more importantly to the peoples of Europe."
"Could I now draw attention to what Mr Lamassoure said in his explanatory statement about the institutional role of the Commission and particularly the political initiative."
"I do not often agree with my colleague Mr Van Dam who sits with me on the Estonian delegation."
"But he said two things I do accept, one that an attitudinal change was necessary and two, that enlargement is a key factor in the future success of the Commission."
"Mr Lamassoure says on enlargement that the Commission, as regards the accession process, is expected to propose a comprehensive strategy reflecting the Union's interest in its political timetable - not just an assessment regarding the suitability of each applicant country."
"When I was previously in this Parliament, the President of the Commission was Jacques Delors and he worked alongside Commissioner Brittan and before him Commissioner Cockfield."
"They did not wait for ideas to be handed down from the Council of Ministers."
"They themselves devised the single market programme."
"They worked hand-in-hand with the Parliament throughout."
"They promoted the scheme and they achieved it."
"There was a sense of great self-confidence and harmony between the institutions."
"I would simply say to Commissioner Kinnock, and I am sure he needs no encouragement in this, that it is not just a question of management or technical detail, it is a question of personnel and belief in what you are doing and belief that the Parliament will work alongside the Commission."
"We must have a goal."
"That goal is enlargement and it is extremely difficult to achieve but we look to the Commission to be the driving force and we want to work alongside it."
"Mr President, all administrations need to be reviewed periodically and to be modified and brought up to date."
"Consequently, our Group supports the Commission' s proposals - the White Paper - promoted by Commissioner Kinnock."
"Mr Harbour' s report views these proposals positively and we also support that report, which has been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"However, while doing so, the Socialist Group considers that the current functioning of the Community' s public administration is reasonably efficient."
"We must remember that the crisis in the Commission was not caused by any failing in the Community' s administration but by political problems which had little to do with the functioning of the administration, and any desire to link the crisis in the Commission with the malfunctioning of its administration would be arbitrary."
"We must bear in mind that the Community administration is based on certain principles, which are well established in continental administration, such as the principle of a job for life and stable employment."
"These principles were established after a previous period in which public appointments resulted from the distribution of influences, from the system of cherry picking and string pulling."
"In light of this, the system of stable public administration offered a guarantee that political changes would not affect the functioning of the administration."
"In some countries, such as Spain, where our political life has been through tempestuous times, the administration, at least, has been a guarantee of stability."
"Therefore, while recognising that it is necessary to modernise the administration, our concern is to guarantee those fundamental principles of Community administration, which is currently occupied by extremely competent officials, who, often at great personal sacrifice, have to move home in order to set up in Brussels and who receive remuneration which is appropriate to the efforts that this entails."
"We feel sure that the Commission will continue to present concrete proposals."
"We believe that we will have the opportunity to express our opinions on them and that throughout this time we will be able to help the Commission in developing the Community civil service."
"However, we feel that we ought to respect two fundamental principles; one, the recognition of situations that are recognised in law; the so-called acquired rights of officials and secondly, the principle of stability, of guarantee, and even the right to union membership, the right to the defence, by officials, of their post, their career and even their professional prestige."
"With this consideration, we urge the Commission and Mr Kinnock to move ahead with their efforts at reform."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are monitoring this reform with justifiably high expectations."
"I regret the fact that it took the resignation of the Commission in March 1999, due to dubious practices and maladministration, to initiate this reform."
"The European public' s confidence was shaken and it is much more difficult to regain this now."
"The Commission' s problems in implementing various programmes are clear to see."
"Delays in payment are mounting up and the bureaucratic obstacles are well known."
"The Commission' s new duties have multiplied, the complexity and the slowness of its procedures have grown worse and its structures, methods and formal constraints have not changed."
"We are all familiar with the consequences of this situation and it has tested the dedication and skill of the many people working in the Commission and in its administration."
"It is crucial that the Commission makes the best use of existing human resources and promotes new recruitment."
"This is not enough, however, to improve the implementation of actions and of available appropriations."
"We hope to see a thorough reorganisation of structures and working methods, and clarification of the distribution of powers between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is essential."
"The first two institutions are responsible for defining policies and priorities and making financial resources available."
"The Commission is responsible for ensuring that all the conditions are met in order to implement the financial management of Community programmes."
"With regard to this last aspect, the executive role of the Commission must be strengthened, above all, by a reform of commitology."
"Let us be clear on this matter: if, under the terms of Article 274 of the Treaty, the Commission alone is responsible for implementing the budget, then some interventions by Member States through management and regulatory committees, which have basically been put forward to express national interests, must be seen as hampering the Commission's ability to manage efficiently."
"This is what also needs to be changed in the procedure known as commitology."
"I am sure of the success of this reform and therefore congratulate the four rapporteurs, especially Mrs Guy¬≠Quint, whose work I have followed most closely."
"Mr President, the resignation of the Commission in the spring of 1999 was in fact the d√©nouement of a much more deep-seated problem within the European Commission, namely vague working structures that resulted in a lack of political accountability, fragmented policy priorities and unsatisfactory results."
"Commissioner Kinnock' s White Paper offers a solution to these problems but also goes much further in that the reform proposals are founded on the basic principles of a modern European public service."
"The people of Europe should be the main concern of a service of this kind, and for their part, they simply expect to see results and appropriate action when their interests are at issue."
"Issues such as the BSE crisis, oil prices, and the greenhouse effect have a distinctly European dimension."
"So the Commission has an important task to fulfil in this respect."
"It will only be possible to achieve results for the citizens if the Commission is able to act swiftly and transparently, and be accountable to this public service, among other things."
"So this is what the goal of the reforms taking place within the Commission must be."
"We have all seen how the culture of fear has rather paralysed - totally paralysed I might say - the decision-making processes within the Commission, and by that I also mean the departments and the officials."
"The field of external relations, for example, exemplifies the major problems that the Commission is unfortunately still struggling with. Many thousands of project applications have been awaiting assessment for over a year now."
"Letters and requests for information as to the state of play are either dealt with half-heartedly or not at all."
"Situations of this kind have severely eroded the confidence of the citizens and organisations concerned."
"That being the case, Commissioner Kinnock' s proposed transition to efficiency and supervised management and budget deserves all the support it can get."
"The Commission could then concentrate on its core tasks and dramatically improve its efficiency."
"At the same time, the package of reform proposals could break through this culture of fear, restoring the officials' faith in themselves as an organisation, because there are a lot of good people there."
"The European Parliament could then judge the Commission on its results, with the political priorities established by Parliament and the Council, but also, in fact, the emphasis on service provision for the people of the EU, forming the all-important framework for assessment."
"It is essential to quickly win back the credibility of the European public service in the eyes of the public."
"This cannot be achieved by over-emphasising the word 'internal' in the reforms."
"The public must also be able to feel that the Commission is truly accessible and transparent."
"The White Paper on European governance that came out recently, contains a whole host of worthwhile initiatives to this end, but there is still a great deal to be done in other areas."
"I have in mind the people' s access to documents, an issue that we have yet to be satisfied on. Now is the time to close the chapter on fraud, bureaucracy and the fall of the Commission once and for all."
"Let us open a new book on a modern European public service that fulfils its constitutional role in the proper manner, is ready for the forthcoming enlargement and lastly, which embraces service provision for the European public as its new mission statement."
"Commissioner Kinnock and President Prodi will receive the full support of the socialist group, which also means that we will keep an ever-watchful eye on the results and criteria outlined so eloquently in the White Paper."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to be very brief, but first I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs."
"The basic consensus with which they have worked is something to be greatly welcomed and is very encouraging."
"The debate, as we have seen, is not so much about the principles, objectives and timeliness of the reform as about the procedures, pace, timetable, and possible shortcomings or unwanted consequences of its implementation."
"This is a necessary reform because at the root of it was a real political crisis, not just the normal self-criticism which occurs in the course of an administration that has been in action for several decades."
"However, what we are dealing with here is not a political reform with administrative consequences but an administrative reform with political consequences."
"We are therefore dealing with one of those challenges that are occasionally faced by politicians who must find the best way to safeguard the governability of institutions, as well as the best way to provide the citizens with a good administration."
"The success of the reform will be a success for all of us and we all have a great deal at stake here."
"This being the case, it seems to me not only appropriate but also necessary to explore all the possibilities offered by interinstitutional dialogue."
"This dialogue must open up the basic legislative framework of Community finances to the codecision procedure."
"This dialogue must allow the establishment of common mechanisms in human resources policies."
"It must yield fruit in terms of multiannual budgetary agreements, within the framework of the Financial Perspectives and, finally, it must allow us to work jointly on the monitoring and control of the reform."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European public is not so much interested in our plans, in the sense of the material design of the reform, as in the intentions, that is to say, its objectives and consequences."
"The public is going to judge us according to the degree of transparency, closeness in the decision-making responsibilities, coherence in the distribution of responsibilities, and according to the efficiency which is finally achieved."
"I was reflecting on the very good point, amongst others, that Mr van Hulten made earlier on, seeking the explanation for the fact that the House, including myself, had the delight of listening to a lengthy foreign affairs debate earlier on."
"The difference between the time given to that debate and the time given to this debate and the occasion on which they took place, I would point out to Mr van Hulten, is very simple to understand."
"For the European Parliament, foreign affairs is a vital and interesting matter, and I completely agree that, having had a lifetime's interest myself in these issues, that is a proper explanation."
"For the European Parliament, reform is a vital matter on which it has decisive effect as a budgetary authority and as a legislature."
"That explains in politics why foreign affairs gets two hours and comes first and reform gets one hour and comes second."
"The more power you have over an issue, the later it comes in the night."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to you for the opportunity of this debate to respond to the excellent work of Parliament's four rapporteurs, the four musketeers, on the Commission's Reform White Paper."
"It is also appropriate for me to provide an up-to-date picture of the latest progress with the implementation of our strategy for applying modernising changes and for preparing the further improvements, which we outlined in our strategy eight months ago."
"I am very pleased that my colleague, Michaele Schreyer has been able to join us and naturally she will respond on the parts of the reports that relate particularly to her budget portfolio."
"I would like to begin by reporting to the House that this morning's meeting of the College as Mr Van Hulten said earlier, adopted a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory group on standards in public life, as outlined in Action 1 of the White Paper action programme."
"It adopted a preliminary strategy for decentralisation and simplification of decision-making procedures - something which eventually will lead to substantial increases in Commission productivity and reducing those strata of bureaucracy that everybody rightly talks about."
"The College also agreed today substantial proposals relating to the reform of human resources policy."
"Those human resources policy documents relate to discipline, to whistle-blowing and to equal opportunities."
"They will be the formal basis for the legally required consultation between the Commission, its staff and staff representatives, which of course will take place over the coming months."
"Our approach on disciplinary procedure proposes several necessary changes, including the improvement and restructuring of the investigative phase of disciplinary proceedings, which would be handled by a specialist service."
"They include: making the disciplinary board a permanent and more professional body, chaired by a qualified specialist from outside the Commission; improving the provisions governing the justified suspension of officials, including those being prosecuted in criminal cases in national courts; consolidating the vital coordination between the Commission and OLAF whilst not compromising the essential independence of OLAF; refining the list of possible sanctions to relate them better to any proven contravention of staff regulations."
"All these proposals are focused on enabling the Commission and the other European institutions, including Parliament, to improve the professionalism, the consistency and the reasonable speed of disciplinary procedures and to do so without loss of fairness or rights of the accused."
"The document on whistle-blowing proposes a system that compares well with the best existing practices in Member States."
"It proposes the integration of the existing OLAF regulation reporting obligation into the body of the Staff Regulations."
"It sets out the rights of career protection for whistle-blowers who report genuine concerns in a responsible way."
"It establishes safeguards against frivolous or malicious reporting."
"It emphasises the responsibility for those receiving reports of possible wrong-doing to act promptly, seriously and effectively."
"It defines many clear procedures in several channels for reporting alleged wrong-doing inside and outside an official's employing institution."
"In addition in the right to report to OLAF and to the hierarchy of his or her own institution, an official will also be entitled to report suspicions and evidence to the Presidents of the Council or this Parliament or the Commission or the Court of Auditors or the Ombudsman."
"The provision of external channels will be a major and progressive change, which I am certain will work to the benefit of the institutions and their staff, the European Union and, of course, the public interest."
"Finally, our equal opportunities document presents specific policy proposals to ensure equality of employment opportunity, so that the evident inequalities, which have been endured by women, by people from ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, can be addressed effectively without compromising standards of merit."
"In these documents we have again sought to take examples from best practices in Member States."
"To save time and to recognise portfolio relevance, I hope that the House will accept that it is best at this juncture to leave the salient issues raised in Madame Guy-Quint' s very thorough and very constructive report from the Budget Committee and also the financial management issues highlighted in the equally productive report by Mr Pom√©s Ruiz to my colleague Commissioner Schreyer."
"With more time, naturally, I would be very happy to address the matters raised, and I am sure that there will be other opportunities."
"For now, however, I will focus on just one of Mr Pom√©s Ruiz's points, one raised by other honourable Members in this debate, namely his question of why the Commission has not acted on the proposal made in a number of Budgetary Control Committee reports that there should be a separate chamber for disciplinary hearings for budgetary irregularities, either within the Court of Auditors or in the Court of Justice."
"I think Mr Van Hulten made the point in the course of the debate again."
"It is a fair question and there are basically two reasons for not taking up proposals that the Commission should have recourse to such external institutions."
"First, the Committee of Independent Experts stipulated, in my view rightly, that any such body should be an internal one, not least because the Treaties attribute very specific roles to the other two institutions in controlling the financial implications and the legality of the Commission's disciplinary decisions."
"It would create untenable conflicts of interest, not to say some constitutional gymnastics, if either Court were to be directly involved in the Commission's internal procedures."
"In addition, such changes would obviously only be possible with amendment to the Treaties."
"Secondly, in practical terms, dividing a disciplinary case up into its financial aspects and its other aspects of conduct, with these matters being heard in different institutions, would have the very undesirable effect of considerably lengthening the disciplinary procedure."
"I hope that the House will agree that these reasons are sound, as the document on discipline this morning shows."
"In most Member States and in all international organisations, the institution itself is responsible for disciplining its staff."
"We strongly believe that should remain the case in all the European Union institutions."
"Turning now to the governments and human resources issues of the reports from Mr Lamassoure and Mr Harbour, I regret greatly that time does not permit me on this occasion to make the detailed response, which these reports merit."
"Suffice it to say at this juncture that I very much welcome both these reports."
"I thank Mr Harbour for the very positive and thoughtful approach that he and his committee have taken to the complex issues of the modernisation of human resources policy, both in the Commission and in the other European institutions."
"The report has given us additional and extremely useful bases for discussion in many of the relevant areas and the opportunity which was provided by the public hearing on human resources policy organised by Mr Harbour offered practices and perceptions from the public and private sectors which were all extremely instructive."
"I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Lamassoure for his constructive insights and his constructive remarks on the constitutional context in which the current reform is being pursued."
"He rightly draws attention to the broad issues and argues that it would have been valuable if the forthcoming governance White Paper could have preceded the proposals for administrative reform."
"Ideally, of course, he is absolutely right."
"I know, however, that he and other honourable Members understand that the political priority and the urgency necessarily given to the reform agenda meant that any delay in pursuing that agenda would not have been feasible or acceptable."
"I am sure, however, that the analysis and the principles that will be set out in the Governance Paper next year will directly inform us, as we complete the design and begin the full implementation of reform and modernising changes over the next two years."
"I express my gratitude to all honourable Members for their hard and thoughtful work on the reform issues undertaken over recent months."
"I also thank them for the quality of the further contributions made in the course of tonight's debate and I am naturally glad to be able to say, with justification, that the hope that I expressed last year that the Commission and this Parliament would sustain an alliance for reform is proving to be absolutely realistic."
"I thank the House for that too and for your patience this evening."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vice-President."
"I am sure that Parliament will give you the opportunity to go into greater depth on another occasion, since this reform is not going to end with the first vote tomorrow."
"I am therefore sure that we will have the pleasure of hearing you in the future."
"Mrs Schreyer has the floor to supplement the Commission' s report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Commission is a root-and-branch reform process."
"That is evident from the White Paper, and I believe it is also very plainly evident from the parliamentary reports."
"The main focal point of the reform is the effort to improve financial management."
"This is not a matter of localised fine-tuning; no, the changes in this area are profound and substantive."
"The best news is that major building blocks of the reform process are already in place."
"They not only exist on paper but have also been implemented in practice."
"Some building blocks are being chiselled out, while others still have to be approved in formal decisions of Parliament and the Council prior to implementation."
"Allow me to deal now with important points from the reports by Mrs Guy-Quint and Mr Pom√©s Ruiz which relate directly to the budget process, namely the drafting of the budget and its implementation."
"Both of these subjects are examined in the new version of the Financial Regulation."
"The recast Financial Regulation is at the heart of the reform process."
"The main aims of the new version are simplification, greater transparency and reinforcement of budgetary principles; in concrete terms, this means fewer exceptions to the rules, fewer incomprehensible special regimes and more efficient and effective budgetary procedures."
"An entirely new feature of the Financial Regulation is the inclusion of rules such as those on the awarding of contracts and on financial aid."
"In other words, the rules governing everyday budgetary operations have become clearer and will be easier to administer, which - as is our hope and our aim - will cut future error rates."
"Mrs Guy-Quint, in your report you referred to many points in the new version of the Financial Regulation, but you also expressed concern that activity-based budgeting might deprive Parliament of information."
"I believe I can allay this concern."
"The idea underlying activity-based budgeting is actually to make it clear in the budget how much money is available for operational and necessary administrative expenditure in each policy area."
"We want to indicate the cost of each policy, and you are right in saying that this does not in itself suffice for a cost-benefit analysis, but it does provide a general review of the funds available for a given policy area, and that is an innovation in the budget of the European Union."
"The abolition of the present division of the budget into administrative and operating appropriations is the logical consequence of this new approach, but it does not mean that staff and administration costs are no longer identifiable, no longer separately labelled. On the contrary, it goes without saying that they will continue to be shown in specific budget lines; they will simply be assigned to the appropriate area of political activity and will no longer lurk anonymously somewhere inside a general administrative budget for the Commission."
"This activity-related approach is designed to harmonise resources more closely with political priorities."
"It is an instrument with which expenditure can be more accurately estimated and recorded, and it is also a straightforward management tool which can channel managerial activity in a more focused manner on the basis of priorities."
"It was, after all, one of the main concerns of this very Parliament that political priorities should be made more clearly identifiable."
"So once again transparency is the aim, and I believe we shall achieve that aim."
"Let me say briefly, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the categories used in the Financial Regulation have been retained."
"The Regulation is a financial-planning instrument, and as such it has also been retained."
"Incidentally, I am delighted to note, Mrs Guy-Quint, that you are a specialist in this field who can be relied upon to debate the recast Financial Regulation in Parliament with competence and no doubt with passion too."
"I should like to deal with a point on which Mr Pom√©s Ruiz laid special emphasis in his report, namely the issue of payment targets. You were right, Mr Pom√©s Ruiz, to emphasise this point so strongly."
"Last year, only about two thirds of payments were made within the 60-day limit, and I agree with your criticism; this is unacceptable."
"Admittedly, the number of financial transactions has risen rapidly in recent years, but that is no excuse."
"It must become a matter of course for the Commission to pay invoices within the prescribed time limit, and this is the target the Commission has set itself."
"How do we intend to achieve it?"
"I shall mention just a few of the many steps we are taking."
"For example, contract clauses on invoicing will be simplified, and the Commission will make greater use of flat-rate reimbursement."
"For one thing, it is simply very uneconomical for the Commission if contracts operate in such a way that 20% of expenditure on item X is reimbursable, while 30% of expenditure on item Y is eligible for reimbursement, not to mention the frequent need for vouchers covering minimal items of expenditure to be collected and checked."
"The instrument of flat-rate reimbursement saves a great deal of time and money."
"Another important point is that the date on which the Commission receives an invoice should be clearly specified."
"For that reason we shall establish a central register in which incoming invoices will be logged, and an entitlement to interest on late payments will be enshrined in the Financial Regulation and in the terms of our contracts. I need hardly add that financial penalties are always a very potent and painful instrument."
"On the subject of externalisation, may I briefly point out that the Commission will present a legal basis for this."
"Moreover, in its letter amending the budget, the Commission also gives a detailed opinion on the question of the technical-assistance offices (TAOs), and I am very pleased to see that the ideas of the Commission and those of Parliament on the future treatment of this question run along the same lines."
"Administrative reform is intended to improve the work of the Commission."
"For this improvement we need good people, good staff, and we need a sufficient number of staff."
"To that end, the Commission requested additional posts for next year from the budgetary authority, and I am delighted with the decisions that were taken last week in the framework of the conciliation procedure."
"With these reforms the Commission is preparing itself to deal more effectively with its current tasks as well as with new tasks in the future, and it is also, of course, a reform process that will equip the Commission to discharge its new responsibilities in the framework of enlargement."
"We shall naturally make every effort to implement the reforms as quickly as possible, even though there will be occasional criticism that one or other of these reforms still awaits completion."
"In those situations it is sometimes forgotten that we also operate within a democratic system and that codecision rules have to be respected - and rightly so."
"The staff of the Commission are also agents of the reform process, so it has to meet with their acceptance too."
"It also has to be accepted by the other institutions, and in particular it needs the support of the elected representatives of the people. For that support, whether critical or enthusiastic, may I express my sincere thanks to Parliament."
"I see that we have evidently launched the reform process in good time, because it is not quite five to twelve yet!"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"EU - LDC relations"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo P√©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of reform of the Commission on these relations [2000/2051(INI)]."
". (ES) Mr President, although we are approaching twelve o' clock we hope that this final report on development policy - which we are also trying to include within the reform - is not being treated as any less important, despite the fact that it is indeed the last report."
"I wish firstly to thank Commissioner Nielson for being here and for putting his commitment to this Parliament before certain other important engagements."
"The report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for which I am rapporteur, deals with the repercussions of the Commission reform on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and developing countries."
"It is an initiative report, because the Commission has not seen fit to consult us in any other more official way, despite the fact that it has done so with regard to other aspects of the reform."
"At least as important as those which we have just debated is the issue of the RELEX reform, which is the one that will offer the world an idea of the scope of the changes in the Commission."
"On the basis of the Commission' s own diagnosis of the ineffectiveness of Community development policy, this report reaches different conclusions on how to remedy it."
"In our opinion, that is, the opinion of the Socialist Group and that of the whole of the Development Committee, the development policy is an essential policy within the framework of Community external action, which must respond to the problems of today' s world, of which the greatest and most dramatic is underdevelopment."
"This is an essential policy whose method of implementation must be modified in order to achieve the objective of eradicating poverty."
"These are the basic principles that we share with the Commission."
"Nevertheless, we believe that it has not been correct in its approach to the reform."
"The Commission maintains a division - albeit a somewhat blurred one - between political responsibility and executive competence, which past experience leads us to believe, will not work very well in practice."
"We believe that a cosmetic reform makes no sense in these times of profound change."
"Commissioner, surely you and your staff have asked yourselves the same questions as I have: Why not unify the cycle of cooperation?"
"Why not allocate the competences for development in the developing countries to the Commissioner with responsibility for that area?"
"It sounds absurd, but in fact what the Commission is proposing is absurd: that you take charge of implementing measures designed by others for certain countries considered to be developing, and of designing and implementing policies for the ACP countries."
"Reason and experience lead us in a different direction."
"Perhaps the direction we propose in this report, which does not question the division of competences in the College of Commissioners, simply applies it."
"The Commissioner for Development should have competence for development; the Commissioner for External Relations should have competence for political relations, and so on and so forth."
"We fear that the origin of the absurdity lies in the internal debate within the Commission regarding who is who."
"The problem is that the consequences of this will harm the effectiveness of development policy and, what is even more serious, those people who should be benefiting from it."
"We will see this next year when we are presented with the assessment we are asking for of the results of the reform."
"The assessment criteria will be the progress made in the eradication of poverty, in the complementarity of Member States' policies, in the degree of coherence between Community policies, in the efficiency of project management, decision making and the simplification of procedures."
"These latter aspects particularly effect the NGOs."
"The NGOs, Commissioner, are one of the pillars of Community cooperation, providing added value for European development policy and great care must therefore be shown in taking them into account."
"The importance of the large multilateral organisations does not cancel out that of the small NGOs, and I am not going to expand on the role they play in development at local level because we are all aware of it, especially those populations that benefit from their action."
"We consider it to be essential that the hitherto fragile dialogue between the Commission and the committee for liaison with development NGOs be consolidated."
"We wish Commissioner Nielson the greatest success."
"We ask Commissioner Patten for the greatest generosity for the sake of the effectiveness of development policy, to which we are all committed and whose consequences are immeasurable in political and human terms, in both a positive and a negative sense."
"We demand from Commissioner Kinnock, who has just left, the greatest transparency in the management of the reform and the necessary efforts in the field of human resources."
"And we will call all of them to account."
"We remind the Member States that there is no place in European construction for temptations to renationalise; on the contrary, it is time to defend the European dimension of this policy by contributing to its rationalisation."
"Complementarity is one of the key elements for the success of the Community development policy and there should not be theological debate like the one in which subsidiarity has become bogged down."
"(The President urged the speaker to bring her speech to a close) Mr President, I will conclude by saying that we are going to approve two amendments and another three will not be approved, as has been discussed in committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by emphasising the quality of Mrs Sauquillo's own-initiative report on the reform of the Commission and its impact on the effectiveness of the European Union's relations with the developing countries."
"One of the great merits of this report is that it highlights the crucial need for the European Union and its Member States to conduct a large-scale development policy, which alone can reflect the culture and influence of our continent."
"First let me remind you of a few statistics, to avoid any complexes about our current activities."
"We must say it and repeat it: the European Union and its Member States provide more than half the public development aid."
"Thirty years ago, it provided 7% of international aid; today the figure is 17%."
"In 1990, total external aid from the European Union accounted for EUR 3 billion. Today, ten years later, the figure is nearly EUR 9 billion."
"Of course this is not enough, but it should at least protect us from caricatures about our poor record of development aid."
"Nonetheless, we have to remember one incontrovertible fact."
"It is that some Member States pursue their own development policies alongside the European policy."
"In my view we can improve the global situation if we take a pragmatic approach and try to coordinate the Member States' activities as closely as possible with those of the Community."
"At that price, I believe, we can achieve complementarity."
"In any case, that is in line with the declaration on regional policy of 10 November, an important Council and Commission policy."
"It introduces a division of labour between the Commission and the Member States, on the basis of their comparative advantages."
"In my view, we must beware of two equally dangerous traps: the gradual renationalisation of development aid on the one side, on the other a Utopian vision of the Commission as the sole player in the development aid field."
"Nevertheless, the reform of the European Commission is moving in the right direction in proposing both more effective action by the Commission and giving more responsibility to the beneficiaries of the development projects."
"Of course, as some speakers have pointed out, that raises the question of human resources, which have been inadequate until now."
"I shall not dwell on that point."
"Let me conclude by emphasising three amendments I tabled on behalf of the PPE Group, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4. The underlying idea is to turn the European Union into an active rather than passive partner in development aid, but also the concern to improve the use of the allocated funds."
"The PPE Group will vote for Mrs Sauquillo's report, while hoping the amendments it has tabled can be incorporated."
"Mr President, one in five people in the world has no access to basic social provisions."
"Europe is a super power in economic terms and so it is absolutely right that we should be having this discussion subsequent to the debate on the White Paper."
"It was an excellent idea of Mrs Sauquillo' s to include the part on external relations in the section on internal training, thereby making it an item on the agenda."
"We have big problems."
"The Commissioner has also referred to this in his texts: a huge backlog, lack of objectives, a culture of fear in the departments dealing with payments, and at the same time, far too low a level of project proposals, a great deal of time wasted and little in the way of efficient spending."
"We want to work towards a culture of greater accountability."
"We want to see ex-post control."
"We want to see increased accountability for the public service and we want to see decentralisation."
"We want to see a European development fund become integral to Parliament."
"We want clearer objectives."
"Parliament foresaw all this in terms of its role in the draft budget for 2001."
"We will come back to that later because that in itself constitutes a sound framework."
"We have our doubts about the technical mould in which the reforms are now being cast."
"We think it is more important to have a clear distribution of political tasks: a Parliament with clear objectives, a Commission with a clear idea of what it wants, a Commissioner - and I fully support Mrs Sauquillo in this - who has hundred per cent responsibility for the whole world when it comes to development policy, and who is given full responsibility for this within the Commission, and also the human resources they need, because without these human resources it is of course absolutely impossible to implement this policy."
"To briefly sum up: let us put an end to this culture of fear, also amongst the officials."
"Let us build trust between our Parliament, the departments and the Commissioner so that Europe can deliver a different kind of message in a world of poverty."
"Feyenoord was known as the football club of 'deeds, not words' ."
"May the Commissioner take this motto to heart."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support Mrs Sauquillo's report, commending the hard work put in and the contribution it makes to the changes to the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"If, as is hoped in the explanatory statement, the reform brings about greater involvement of the European Parliament, we will have to establish a sort of policy which does not merely stop at money or budget headings, which, in practice, take the form of tangible aid to less developed countries."
"Aid does not just mean donating money but providing practical assistance in times of difficulty or for things which they would not be able to do themselves or without assistance."
"Poverty and need are not just the product of economic backwardness and development problems but are often the result of aggression and the exploitation of the weak by the strong, of the selfishness of the capable in the face of the weakness of the marginalised."
"Before we start to talk about aid to projects, we should try to remove all the existing causes of exploitation, identifying and bringing to justice those who have exploited and abused peoples which are in a state of need."
"The reformed Commission must establish a project, before dispensing aid, to investigate the causes which have created or contributed to creating a state of discomfort among the poor peoples."
"We often talk about cancelling the debt of the less developed countries."
"The phrase would lead us to believe that it is an act of altruism or great generosity but, when all is said and done, it may be merely an act of justice."
"The Commission must also ensure that this happens at international level."
"In this way, quality of life will improve and the gap between the poor, who are becoming increasingly poorer, and the very rich, who are exploiting these situations and becoming increasingly richer, will be lessened."
"Mr President, I have today returned from Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for brilliant humanitarian assistance following the flood disaster, but, once again reconstruction projects, where we have already allocated the money, are delayed while signatures in Brussels are awaited."
"Reform of external assistance ""yes"" , sufficient staff numbers to manage projects ""yes"" , decentralisation to delegations ""yes"" , increased emphasis on programming, movement to ex post financial assessment, streamlined comitology arrangements ""yes"" , ""yes"" , ""yes"" ."
"Late at night, when we have to be clear, even blunt and when my esteemed colleague, Mrs Sauquillo P√©rez del Arco, has had to use the instrument of an own-initiative report to ensure parliamentary accountability, the Commission should listen when European Parliament says ""no"" ."
"First, the emasculation of DG Development will deform not reform external assistance."
"We want a single development directorate covering policy and implementation, covering trade and aid, covering Asia, Africa and Latin America, when the Commission still proposes to peel off these other policy areas, still proposes a hybrid with programming undertaken separately."
"Second, we demand an end to the practice of draining external assistance away from developing countries towards the EU' s own borders in recent years."
"The reform communication of 16 May does not once mention the word ""poverty"" nor does the General Affairs Council Resolution of 9 October."
"We need to ensure the EU lives up to the promises made at the UN summits, that development is paramount, and to do so by guaranteeing a fixed percentage of external assistance to the world' s least developed countries."
"Finally, we should understand that Mr Patten' s proposal for aid responsible to a board of Commissioner directors with Mr Nielson as Chief Executive is an unworkable gimmick borrowed from management text books and is fundamentally incompatible with the collegiate structure of the Commission itself."
"It is precisely because Mr Nielson is loyal to that collegiate responsibility that he will doubtless defend the proposal tonight."
"So I hope others in the Commission will hear us when we say we have a highly effective development Commissioner."
"Let us give him the political responsibility to do the job."
"Mr President, the latest annual report by the World Bank highlighted certain figures which were both scandalous in their bleakness and a challenge to the developed world."
"This report told us how, in fact, poverty and under-development continue to gain ground and that a huge number of people are still unable to exercise their inalienable right to live in dignity."
"Furthermore, there is the fear that the process of economic globalisation will increase the difficulties of the poorest countries and widen the chasm that separates them from the wealthy countries."
"Given this situation, there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment."
"If the European Union wishes to fully implement its policy of solidarity and finally eradicate poverty and its causes, we must begin to reassess the Union' s actions and the approach it should adopt towards its development aid policy, with a view to improving the effectiveness of those efforts."
"That is why Mrs Sauquillo' s report and the proposals contained in it are so timely - and I would also like to congratulate her on her work - because they indicate the direction which the European Union should take in responding to the challenges of the twenty-first century in the field of development cooperation."
"These proposals have been drawn up on the basis of an assessment of the current situation and take account of the obstacles which hinder progress in this field and discuss, in particular, the reform of the Commission' s services: greater competences for delegations and an increase in human resources devoted to development policy, the allocation of financial resources in accordance with the objectives of Community development policy, the simplification of administrative procedures and - of course - the complementarity and coherence of the Union' s development policies."
"Let us hope that the Commission and the Council are receptive to these proposals and that together we can make speedier progress towards the ultimate eradication of poverty, thereby contributing to the creation of a fairer world."
"Mr President, when preparing its proposal for reform, the European Commission did not include amongst the people it consulted those of us in this Parliament who deal with the issues of cooperation and development."
"Therefore, on its own initiative, Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation decided to present the report which we are currently discussing."
"In this report we advocate the idea that the policy of cooperation for a fairer, more balanced and stable world is not some sort of secondary issue, but that it should be a real priority in European Union policy and that, furthermore, the efforts which we make in pursuit of this objective must be considered to be a substantial part of our project."
"Furthermore, however, in Mrs Sauquillo' s report we draw attention to certain measures within the reforms proposed by the Commission, which we consider to be mistaken."
"For example, they propose an institutional structure in which the body responsible for formulating cooperation policy and the body responsible for implementing that policy are not one and the same."
"Our Committee shared the view of the rapporteur that the Commissioner for Development should both formulate and implement policy in this area, although these should be coordinated with the other policies dealing with external activities."
"What seems to us even more serious in the Commission' s proposal is the territorial separation, which is maintained."
"It does not seem reasonable that the Commissioner for Development should deal almost exclusively with the ACP countries while relations with Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean region - which of course are very much cooperation and development issues - should remain in the hands of those responsible for external relations."
". Chairman, this debate is timely as the Commission has in fact taken important steps, new steps in the reform of external relations."
"It agreed today in the creation of the new office responsible for European cooperation from the identification of activities to implementation."
"The process of implementing the Commission' s decision of May on reform of external relations is going well."
"There are three main elements to the reform: the enhancing of the programming process; the reunification of the management of the project cycle; and the devolution of powers to our delegations, all are making substantial progress."
"As regards country programmes, the Commission has adopted a standard framework for country strategy papers."
"This was discussed during the recent development council and was positively welcomed by all Member States."
"We now have a harmonised scheme to draft country strategy papers and indicative cooperation programmes in all developing countries."
"This will put the country concerned at the centre of the process, and it will also provide a basis for close coordination with Member States and other donors involved in that country."
"This is the tool we have missed in the discussion over many years about how to coordinate better."
"The clear focus of our action on fighting poverty as part of our overhaul of the policy framework and concentration on a limited number of sectors will be key elements in improving the impact of our cooperation."
"Within the Commission, the inter-service quality support group has started work under the chairmanship of the Development DG."
"It will ensure that strategy papers follow the agreed framework and methodology and I am confident that this group will bring more quality and consistency to our country strategies."
"This covers the whole geography and it makes also a big improvement as to the consistency with the policy we are backing."
"Last but not least, I shall with my colleagues, the external relations Commissioners, very soon submit to the college legislative proposals to modify the rules relating to the legal basis for all external relations instruments and budget lines."
"This will allow the management committees to focus their work on strategies and not on individual projects."
"As regards the reunification of the project cycle, the creation of the new office has now been agreed today formally in the Commission."
"The office will be responsible for the management of all steps of the project cycle."
"As from the beginning of next year, 250 officials will be transferred from the Development DG and the External Relations DG to the office and gradually contractual agents will also join the staff of the office while, in parallel, the technical assistance offices will be dismantled."
"Here also, things have moved quite fast with the help and understanding of the budgetary authority."
"Finally, a programme of devolution of powers to the heads of delegations has been set up."
"In three years, about 120 delegations or officers will see major improvement in their working methods."
"Together with extended financial powers they will receive upgraded computer systems and telecommunications."
"Here again the understanding of the budget authority has played a crucial role for funding this major reorganisation of the European External Service."
"In 2001, for instance, financial responsibilities will be deconcentrated to 22 delegations, 15 more delegations will see their computer facilities upgraded and 40 additional posts of officials will be allocated to external services."
"The creation of SEM in 1998 was a first step towards improving the speed of delivery of 8 programmes."
"Even if that reform were clearly insufficient, and this is beyond any discussion today, it did in fact lay the basis for a number of the changes which we are now pushing forward."
"Simplifying procedures is essential if we are to speed things up."
"It is also necessary to make sure that programmes can in future be easily managed by our delegations and made more accessible to our partners."
"How could we have talked of increasing transparency when we had 46 different tendering procedures?"
"How could we expect the delegation official to move from Morocco to Mauritania or from Botswana to South Africa when the procedures of each programme and the relevant financial management systems had to be learned from scratch?"
"So simplifications are very necessary."
"The resolution is quite correct in identifying as problems the unclear and divided responsibilities within the totality of the cooperation cycle and the problems we have had."
"Moreover the creation of SEM provided no solution to the continuing mismatch between 8 voluminous administrative resources."
"The resolution supports a reform going further in one respect than agreed today by the Commission."
"It favours not just the reunification of the project cycle but of the whole cooperation cycle, including programming which now remains with the DG Development and DG Relex."
"On this point, I can only say that the reform is a dynamic process."
"The quality support group will enable a more deliberate and better-managed handover from the programming part of the total activity to the office."
"This is something we are giving quite a lot of attention in order to have this run smoothly."
"I would also remind Parliament that the decision contains a review clause."
"We will have to assess how this new system works and, if necessary, we will take steps to pursue reforms further and deeper."
"The Commission is very much aware of the importance of Parliament' s support for the reform of its policies and working methods."
"I am very grateful for the supportive recommendations in Mrs Sauquillo' s report and for the very positive contributions tonight in this debate."
"I assure that I will do my best to keep Parliament informed of policy proposals and I welcome the invitation to the Commission to report regularly to this Parliament on the reform of the external service."
"Thank you very much indeed for your contribution, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.30 a.m.)"
"Safety at sea"
"The next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on maritime safety and the following reports:"
"Report (A5-0343/2000) by Mr Watts, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port state control) [COM(2000) 142 - C5-0174/2000 - 2000/0065(COD)]"
"Report (A5-0344/2000) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design standards for single-hull oil tankers [COM(2000) 142 - C5-0173/2000 - 2000/0067(COD)]"
"Report (A5-0342/2000) by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 94/57/EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations [COM(2000) 142 - C5-0175/2000-2000/0066(COD)]"
"Report (A5-0336/2000) by Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision setting up a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental or deliberate marine pollution [C5¬≠0501/2000 - 1998/0350(COD)]"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was especially keen to be with you today for the debate in the European Parliament on the first maritime package because you are about to examine three important texts which are a vital step in an issue which recent events have unfortunately made into headline news."
"The European Union has 60 000 km of coastline bordering some of the busiest seas and oceans in the world."
"The importance of maritime matters to Europe is undeniable but that also gives Europe a tremendous responsibility."
"Since the Erika accident last December, considerable work has been done within our European institutions in order to move forwards."
"In this connection, the first package of measures proposed by the Commission in March has been examined by Parliament and by the Council."
"A second package of measures is expected in the near future."
"The European Council in Biarritz examined this issue, and it will again be an important subject at the Nice Summit."
"On the occasion of each disaster, the people of Europe express their anger at the lack of maritime safety and at the risks posed by the dozens of ships transporting toxic or hazardous substances which sail the waters off our shorelines on a daily basis."
"I believe we ought to understand their emotion and their anger."
"Naturally, we want to ensure that things move forward."
"How can we accept maritime transport, which is vital for our trade and commerce, being developed to the detriment of environmental and human safety?"
"How can we accept that more and more ships, increasingly larger in scale and increasingly automated, ply the waters off our coasts without always respecting the strict safety, navigational control and social rules, after the fashion of land and air transport?"
"What we can no longer accept is the logic which makes the quest for the lowest price the operational rule of maritime transport."
"What we can no longer accept, what we must no longer accept, is the connivance of certain States, which we know to exist, which register some of the oldest and most corroded ships, sometimes for just a few dollars. What we cannot and must not accept are the shipowners and operators who deploy underqualified and underpaid crews, classification societies which, for fear of losing a client, pay scant regard to the quality of the ships and their crews, and charterers who seek, above all, to reduce their costs."
"I am told, especially in France, that stringent national measures must be adopted to protect French coasts: it has also been proposed that French coastguards should be deployed."
"But the Erika and the Ievoli Sun were not French ships."
"Their owners and their classification societies were not French, and they were both sailing in international waters when they sank."
"Hence, even though each State has to assume its own responsibilities, decisions must be taken on a broader scale, at least on a European scale."
"To achieve this, the Members of the European Parliament not only have a role to play - and I am well aware of their determination to do so - but, even more importantly, they are crucial in pushing forward Community regulations as far and as quickly as possible."
"The people of Europe have woken up."
"We see this in the case of animal meal and mad cow disease."
"They are now challenging us; they are challenging international institutions and are calling on them to be effective. If a new accident, a new shipwreck, occurs tomorrow off the coasts of Europe, we will all be justifiably denounced for our shortcomings, given these inadequate rules."
"Personally, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, that the fact that we are examining these proposals today is living proof that the European Parliament is an effective institution, which can take on board the concerns of our citizens speedily and effectively."
"That is why I am delighted that, under the impetus of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, significant progress is about to be made towards bringing about a truly safer maritime Europe."
"The fact is that, on the basis of proposals we made last February, the European Commission put forward its own proposals with the greatest alacrity."
"Today, you are examining these three texts in first reading."
"I recognise that the European Parliament and its rapporteurs are motivated by an unshakeable will to see the rapid adoption of texts that are binding and effective in terms of maritime safety."
"I also recognise that we share the same objective of improving maritime safety and the same analytical approach to the methods of achieving this."
"I also recognise, as do the rapporteurs, that the technical aspects of the texts relating to classification societies and to port state control may need to be gone into more deeply."
"The question arises as to whether the fact that there is a new part-session of Parliament in December will make it possible for any residual problems to be solved."
"This may also enable the Council Presidency to have discussions with the Member States with a view to obtaining the Council' s approval of your proposals and to adopting the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority voting."
"We could seek the broadest consensus on the system of liability of classification societies, on toughening up the system of banning the worst offending black-listed flag states, on introducing on-board black boxes, and on putting in place immediate inspections for ships posing the highest risks."
"As regards this fundamental text on enhancing maritime safety and eliminating single-hull oil tankers, we can already congratulate ourselves on the work that has been carried out by the European Parliament. If this text is adopted, as I believe your rapporteur will propose, it will make it possible to phase out more than a third of single-hull oil tankers by 2005 and the remaining two thirds by 2010."
"This is a considerable achievement and it should make it possible for the dangerous ships sailing off our coasts to be speedily replaced and to ensure the greatest level of safety."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, as you see, here we have the opportunity to enhance the safety of maritime transport."
"We all know that these measures, which you are going to be debating today, are inadequate."
"The Heads of State and Government highlighted the urgent need to examine a second package of proposals relating to the supervision and transparency of maritime transport and to the establishment of a European agency, and to making all actors involved in the maritime transport of hazardous or toxic substances aware of their responsibilities."
"What is more, on this occasion France reaffirmed the need to set in motion a Community project on the training and working conditions of seamen, and I know that some of you also share this concern."
"As you can see, it seems to me that the determination of all Community institutions is decisive, and I am convinced this determination is total."
"It is starting to bear fruit here in Brussels, in the European Parliament: so that only safe, sound ships with trained crews living and working under normal conditions are authorised to sail, so that, at last, responsibility falls to each of the actors involved in maritime transport, so that the rules of maritime transport evolve with due regard to the coastal State' s right and its aspiration to protect its environment."
"Madam President, I believe it is beyond doubt that the Commission, like the French Presidency considers the question of maritime safety and environmental protection to be of extreme importance."
"In fact, it has been among the highest priority items on the Commission's agenda ever since the fatal sinking of the Erika 11 months ago."
"Even more recently, only some weeks ago, another tanker, this time a chemical one, the Ievoli Sun sank off the coast of France."
"Once again we were reminded of the potential disastrous consequences of such accidents."
"The European public no longer tolerates oil spills or other environmental disasters caused by industrial accidents in shipping or otherwise."
"Indeed, citizens have the right to expect that ships are safe and that they can transport their cargo in an environmentally acceptable way without endangering the life and economy of people living on nearby coasts."
"Let me say that I saw the effects of the Erika accident myself whilst visiting the site and I know that it takes a very long time and a lot of manpower and, of course, money to clean up."
"The effects are disastrous."
"It is evident that, because of geography, it will always be the same regions that suffer the risks of maritime oil transports, despite the fact that the benefits of such transports are enjoyed by the Union as a whole."
"We have taken this message very seriously indeed and it is exceptional that the Commission has acted so quickly and so consistently with six different legislative proposals within a year covering very different issues."
"All lie at the very heart of the regulations of shipping as a whole and I want to remind you that, in addition to the three proposals which are to be discussed here today, the 'Erika II' package, as Mr Gayssot has already mentioned, will be put on the table next week. This set of measures will propose the creation of a European maritime safety agency, a new European system for the adequate compensation of oil pollution victims and a new traffic surveillance system for EU waters."
"This swift and focused approach resulting in the two 'Erika' packages and six proposals has created an enormous momentum."
"I believe it is fair to say that only after the Erika disaster did Member States and the international maritime community fully understand and feel the determination of the European institutions to improve maritime safety."
"They have realised that the determination remains even if such actions involve friction between the EU and the international maritime institutions and tension with the economic interests of the maritime industry."
"Now that there are Commission proposals on the table we must not lose this momentum and forget the issue until the next accident happens."
"In order to make a real change for maritime safety, the three institutions, but in particular the two co-legislators, must adopt the texts."
"Legislation alone is not enough."
"Member States must also ensure that they have the proper means to implement it, in particular I am thinking of the necessary recruitment of port state control inspectors."
"Otherwise the benefit of the exercise will not be what the public expects from us."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that it is our clear intention not to spare any effort to make ships safer and our seas cleaner, both next year and in the years to come."
"This goes for all sectors of maritime transport."
"I wish to conclude by thanking Mr Gayssot, President of the Transport Council of Ministers, for his encouraging comments."
"We hope and expect that the Transport Council, on 21 December, will add their part to the common determination among the European institutions to bring about a real improvement in maritime safety by the adoption of common positions on all three texts."
"The Commission is not ready to accept any compromise just for the sake of achieving a compromise."
"Finally, I wish to thank this House and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Ms McKenna and Mr Watts, for their understanding of the importance of the first 'Erika' package which is evidenced by the excellent work already done in such a limited time, and for the generally good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in the field of maritime safety."
"Madam President, in a few days time Europe will mark the first anniversary of the loss of the oil tanker, Erika."
"Since then, sadly, there have been many other disasters at sea, we know only too well."
"Before the Erika sank, many other ships sank as well, with the loss of oil, other cargoes, or tragically, the loss of lives of crew or passengers."
"The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right."
"In that context, I wish to pay tribute to the Commission for bringing forward this 'Erika' package to try and right some of those wrongs, to try and prevent another Erika occurring."
"We also pay tribute to the French Presidency, in particular the minister, for his determination to ensure that, in a very brief period of time, we truly learn the lessons of the Erika and make sure that they are applied to prevent an Erika-type disaster occurring again."
"Without the minister' s determination, without the determination of the French Presidency, the IMO's working committee would not have agreed with us that single-hull tankers should be phased out rapidly throughout the world."
"So I pay particular tribute to them for that achievement, which I hope is confirmed by the full IMO assembly very soon."
"The main problem throughout the world is not the lack of maritime laws but the lack of the willingness of countries throughout the world to enforce them. For example, I am afraid that the whole history of port state control is the lack of willingness of Member States within the European Union and beyond to implement port state control adequately."
"That is why we welcome the amendment to the directive because it gives us the ability to make sure people implement the port state control Directive effectively."
"However, in my view as rapporteur, the proposal from the Commission simply does not go far enough."
"It is not strong enough."
"In our view, if implemented, the Commission's proposal would allow another Erika to occur."
"That is why this morning we cannot agree with the Commission's proposal but we are putting forward four proposals which we believe will significantly strengthen the proposal and would therefore secure this Parliament's support."
"Firstly, we agree that there needs to be enhanced compulsory inspections of the most dangerous ships."
"We all agree on that, but we have to find the methodology by which that particular priority can be implemented, and we have yet to secure an agreement between the three institutions on that."
"I think it is within sight but we need to be sure that this agreement will be enforced."
"Secondly, we make a demand again this morning for 'black box' style voyage data recorders to be fitted, not on just some ships or new ships, or in 10 or 20 years time, or whenever the IMO eventually agrees."
"We want black boxes in all ships as soon as possible."
"That is a very clear, fundamental demand, which we are not willing to compromise on."
"Thirdly, we support, and there is a great amount of support, that a dangerous ship should not simply be detained and then allowed to return to sea."
"If you are detained three times in a period of 24 months or 36 months, then you should be banned for life - three strikes and you are out."
"There must be a clear signal to sub-standard ships that we will not tolerate them in European waters or in European ports."
"Finally, we have a clear message to the flags of convenience, the black-listed states."
"Countries like the Lebanon, Liberia, Syria, Azerbaijan, Albania, whose fleets we all know in our hearts are unacceptable overall."
"Seventy, eighty, ninety per cent of their ships have serious defects."
"We cannot tolerate a situation where these rogue flag states continue to allow their ships to sail the seven seas."
"We must as a Parliament express our clear view that in a matter of years we simply will not allow them in."
"Again I hope that we can find a compromise between the three institutions to secure the objectives which I know we all share."
"We must eliminate dangerous ships."
"We must protect our environment and, ultimately, we must save lives at sea."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the importance of safety at sea is, I think, obvious, as we have seen twice in France recently with the √Örika and the Ievoli Sun and as we have seen in my own country with the shipwreck of the Express Samina, a real human tragedy."
"Eighty lives were lost and the final act of the tragedy was played out just yesterday, when the chief executive officer of the company which owned the ship committed suicide."
"What is Parliament's stand on this particular subject?"
"Allow me to remind you that Parliament demanded action right from the start, on the very day the Erika was shipwrecked, calling on the Commission to put forward proposals for adoption."
"We have examined these proposals and, because certain misunderstandings have arisen, I should like to say that we agree with the French Presidency on the timetable, which is why we are holding the debate now, today, before the second Council of Transport Ministers, so that decisions can be taken at first reading."
"We have reached agreement as far as my report is concerned and, once it has passed its first reading, that will be that and we shall be able to start withdrawing single-hull tankers."
"As you know, there are still some problems with the other two reports."
"There are numerous points, as Mr Watts has already explained, where the European Parliament takes a firmer stand than the Council appears to be taking."
"I understand and I welcome the minister's efforts to expedite these two reports as quickly as possible and I therefore consider that, in principle, his proposal to discuss the matter, if possible in December, is a positive one."
"However, Minister, from my discussions today it would appear that your proposal is a little late - most people doubt that it will be technically possible for Parliament to find time in this last week to discuss the matter in detail from the beginning and vote on it in December."
"In all events, please be assured that Parliament is at the Council's disposal, it will vote on its reports, they will be passed to the Council, the Council can approve a common position and we shall examine the reports as quickly as possible - they will be our top priority."
"We shall be finished by spring, provided that the Council moves quickly and provided that the bilateral negotiations are a success and I think that they will be because the will is there on both sides."
"Now to the withdrawal of tankers, to come back to my report."
"Obviously, withdrawing single-hull tankers is a step in the right direction - in fact the IMO has also been making moves in this direction under the Marpol convention for some years now - and I think that the fact that the withdrawal of these tankers is being accelerated is even more encouraging."
"Not that this is a panacea, of course, as we saw with the Ievoli Sun, which was a new, double-hull vessel, from which we must conclude that this measure alone is not enough."
"We also need to take fundamental action on shipping registers and port inspections."
"We need to advance on all fronts."
"In this sense, the initiative by the French Presidency to contact the IMO, the International Maritime Organisation, in a bid to find a solution was an important initiative, because this is an international problem and international problems need international solutions."
"I may add that the Commission's initiative in presenting this position was an important initiative because it acted like a sword of Damocles, effectively pressuring the √â√å√è into getting a move on."
"The IMO working party did get a move on by reaching an agreement in principle - a few issues still need to be clarified, but most issues have already been clarified."
"So what is the basic approach in my report?"
"For large tankers I have kept to the timetable of the IMO, the International Maritime Organisation."
"For the second category, the post-Marpol tankers, I have kept, where there are different approaches, to the common European approach."
"And I think, in the end, we have struck a balance."
"We are protecting the environment, we are providing safety at sea but, at the same time, we have not touched competition in the shipping sector or the normal supply to the market."
"For small tankers, we have adopted a compromise position between the 5000-tonne limit set by the √â√å√è and the 600-tonne limit set by the Commission."
"We have reconciled the need for safety with the need to supply certain regions of Europe, such as island regions especially."
"Madam President, I think that we have taken a step forward today, a fundamental step forward."
"Parliament has taken a clear and unequivocal stand on the Commission's proposals, we are at the Council's disposal, in the hope, I repeat, that this issue will be brought to a close as quickly as possible, because all of us here, the Council, the Commission and the House, are acutely aware of the importance of this issue."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Erika accident on 12 December of last year and the Ievoli Sun accident more recently clearly revealed the limits of the action of some classification and inspection societies in terms of monitoring the construction and, above all, the seaworthiness of vessels that are under their responsibility by delegation from the flag states."
"However, and especially in this field, it is the public institutions who have the essential task of responding to the people' s demands with legislative initiatives that ensure the preservation of the environment and an optimum level of maritime safety, as well as the duty to ensure that the rules established are complied with correctly."
"With this in mind, and in order to remove the obvious differences that exist on an international level between the various classification societies in terms of the competence of their inspectors, the level of development of their IT resources and the degree of technical requirements in their inspections, the Commission has presented us with a proposal to amend Directive 94/57/EC which will apply to all vessels, including those transporting oil products, and which establishes the rules that the Member States, and the classification societies authorised by them, should comply with."
"This proposal has been analysed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, with opinions from both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"There have also been talks with the sectors concerned and a great deal of contact with the French Presidency with the aim of being able to arrive at a text agreed by consensus that can be adopted quickly by the two legislative bodies: the Council and the European Parliament."
"As a result of all of this, we have drawn up a parliamentary report amending the directive, which suggests improvements in various aspects aimed at strengthening the classification system, as a means and a valid tool for guaranteeing the safety of maritime traffic."
"Thus, first of all, it is considered that no element of this directive should be interpreted as an exception to the absolute duty of the shipowner, which cannot be delegated, to maintain and use seaworthy vessels."
"Subsequently, the harmonisation of the requirements that classification societies have to fulfil is being considered, with the Commission, assisted by a committee, being responsible both for the granting and, if necessary, the suspension or withdrawal of their European recognition."
"In order to do this, they will take into account accident rates and the results of recorded incidents and accidents on all the vessels classified by each of the societies."
"In this respect, there is a commitment to improving the quality of vessel inspections as a measure to prevent maritime accidents."
"On the one hand, it is stipulated that the classification societies must have their own system of internal audits in order to measure the quality of their services in all the locations where they work, as well as clear rules for the responsibility and monitoring of all its branches and staff."
"On the other hand, it requires that inspections only be carried out by specialist, exclusive inspectors, that they may not have a relationship with or be dependent on the shipowner in any way, and that the shipowner may not control the vessel classification society."
"Meanwhile, a high degree of transparency is established for information on the results of the inspections carried out on vessels, operating conditions or operating restrictions and changes, suspensions and withdrawals of class."
"This information must be made available to the European, State and port authorities, and to interested members of the public."
"Also, the transfer of a vessel from one class to another - change of classification society - is dependent on all overdue recommendations and conditions that may be pending being satisfactorily complied with."
"Thus, periodical inspections and supervisions are established, to be carried out by the Commission and the Member States in order to check whether this directive is being complied with by organisations that are recognised at European level."
"Finally, it is stated that the Commission must lay down strict rules and ship maintenance inspection procedures, with a view to compelling all the participants concerned to assume their responsibilities."
"In this area, the initial proposals from the Commission and Parliament' s amendments aimed to define the system of financial responsibility for the classification and inspection societies."
"However, the Commission has already announced a second package on maritime safety, which will propose a system of responsibility for all the parties implicated in accidents: shipowners, the owners of the cargo, classification societies, etc."
"I think it would be better for us to leave this for the second package and move forward immediately in order to reach a consensus at first reading with the French Presidency, so that in the next Council of Ministers on 20 December there will already be an agreement with the European Parliament and the first package can be adopted definitively this year."
"Marine pollution, accidental and deliberate, is one of the major threats to the marine environment of western Europe."
"This region represents one of the most intensely industrialised areas of the world where chemical, radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships."
"The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world."
"There are several tragic examples of accidental marine pollution from tankers and other ships carrying other forms of dangerous cargoes."
"As we have just heard, two of the most recent were the Italian chemical tanker, which sank in the English channel, and also the Maltese registered oil tanker, the Erika, which sank off the coast of Brittany causing major environmental havoc."
"Now, more by good fortune than planning, there has not yet been a major accident with a ship carrying radioactive materials."
"Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping-ground for much industrial waste."
"Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought for the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable."
"However, the legacy of the years when materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with very severe consequences."
"It is a lesson which tells us that, when we attempt to throw things away, they do not actually go away because there is no such place as 'away'."
"This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution."
"Furthermore, there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational, historical, radioactive and other harmful substances."
"Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents, in terms of chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons, radioactive materials and other harmful substances which, because they go largely unnoticed, are a cause of major concern."
"In terms of the environment, whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no consequence, the environmental impact remains."
"Furthermore, although the direct dumping of industrial materials, including military dumps of redundant munitions, is largely a practice which has been abandoned by Member States, the sights of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases a threat to human safety."
"Often fishermens' lives are at risk, as is the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea."
"The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution."
"Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful materials carried at sea or discharged into the sea, or which have been dumped as part of a historical dumping regime, is a vital prerequisite to facilitating the preparation and coordination of any responses necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents."
"Effective mitigation requires a rapid response."
"The longer an accident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact."
"Hence, it is too late to start trying to get information after an accident has actually occurred."
"Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques, personnel and equipment at appropriate locations."
"It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessment of the risks."
"The public's trust in the authorities is important and must be ensured with adequate responses."
"Furthermore, the public have a right to know what preparations have been made, what types of material are threatening and what impacts are to be expected."
"To this end, publication of information is a vital component in the establishment of a way for the general public to obtain information, emergency phone contact numbers, etc."
"During the conciliation procedure the European Parliament delegation was able to reach a compromise with the Council, which is close to the original amendments on all the major questions."
"The definition of accidental marine pollution includes a reference to munitions dumping."
"A definition of harmful substances in line with the water framework Directive was added in order to cover but not, unfortunately, explicitly mention radioactive substances."
"The cooperation includes exchange of information and mapping of munitions dump sites."
"The polluter-pays principle is recognised, and the Member States should take this into account in order to provide compensation for damages."
"Nature protection organisations are also included in cooperation at local level."
"We did actually achieve most of what we wanted in the conciliatory procedure, maybe not exactly as we wanted, but we are happy with the result."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this first package of directives on maritime safety is without doubt one of the most important actions our House is going to implement in the course of 2000."
"France may have been especially hit by various maritime disasters, in particular by the recent wrecks of the Erika and the Ievoli Sun off the coast of Brittany, nevertheless what is at stake is the responsibility of the entire European Union, which managed to draw the necessary conclusions."
"The European Union has demonstrated its willingness to accept responsibility by putting forward strong proposals aimed at avoiding a recurrence of such serious accidents. I thank Mr Gayssot who, on behalf of the French Presidency, has shown great conviction and skill in dealing with these issues effectively."
"Nonetheless, we must be aware that these proposals which, as highlighted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, are essentially a response to the legal requirements which have been identified in the areas defined by their respective objectives will only be effective insofar as they are correctly implemented by the Member States and monitored by the Commission."
"I would therefore like to highlight the points which, I feel, cannot be ignored if, following the adoption of these regulations and this directive, the expected progress is to be achieved."
"First of all, the action of Member States must be translated into action integrated at European level."
"We must deploy adequate numbers of properly trained people, used to cooperation, whatever their country of origin, and to using similar equipment."
"I am convinced that this will mean, in the longer term, the establishment of a European coastguard."
"I expect a great deal from the second series of proposals and from the establishment of a European maritime safety agency."
"It is at this level that, in one way or another, this indispensable European cooperation must be found."
"In the meantime, we must, at all costs, eliminate ships whose characteristics give cause for the gravest concern, and this means we must demand transparent intervention on the part of the inspection authorities, who must take measures against ships in a poor condition, irrespective of their age and structure, in line with a significant minimum target factor. We must refuse to permit ships to transit the 200-mile exclusive economic zone if they are not equipped with an IMO-compliant voyage data recorder (VDR) intended to provide information for the purposes of inquiry in the event of an accident."
"Nor let us forget, as Mrs McKenna said, that a large percentage of marine pollution is due to practices coyly described as 'operational' , that is, tank cleaning and other deliberate spills, against which the arsenal of deterrents must be intensified."
"I know how much attention Mr Gayssot pays to the action of Equasis and now to Galileo, which we must implement."
"Vigorous action must be taken on the question of flags of convenience, including that of the Kerguelen Islands in the case of France, and against ships which fly the flag of states with above average detentions and delays during the 36 months preceding the adoption of these directives, which are blacklisted in the annual report of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding."
"Attention must also be paid to the complicated financial set-ups based on 'brass-plate' companies."
"My thanks go to Mr Watts for the specific proposals he has made in this connection."
"I thank the rapporteurs and I urge my fellow Members in the European Parliament to take these proposals into consideration."
"They seem to me such as to make significant progress possible, which is crucial for the effectiveness of the legislative resolutions we are going to be voting on, which must not remain dead letter terms throughout the territories and waters for which Europe is responsible."
"I have in mind not only the Atlantic and other oceans, but also the Mediterranean Sea, where disasters such as we have been experiencing could be irreversible."
"Mr President, the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC deals with the selection of ships for inspection and items for inspection."
"Amending the directive in terms of greater stringency in its application and the harmonisation of legislation, especially regarding the selection of ships for inspection and the scope of the different types of selection is clearly a positive step."
"Even then, the European Union would need to ensure that current legislation is enforced by the Member States."
"The fact is that Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, France, Ireland and the Netherlands, which are obliged to inspect 25% of ships, do not do so."
"Worse still, the existing directives, even though they date from 1995, have still not been transposed into national legislation in Italy and Portugal."
"In order for Member States to enforce existing legislation, they must allocate sufficient resources to inspections so as to ensure the proper application of international conventions and the directive amended by the European Parliament."
"In concrete terms, this means employing additional inspectors, broadening the competences and the scope of inspection, notably concerning respect for social standards and for shipboard living and working conditions, and their publication."
"Since human error is the root cause of 70% of accidents, the inspection of crews, their living and working conditions, their level of training and their numbers must be an integral part of a ship' s inspection."
"Non-compliance with these standards must be a reason to detain a ship and to impose sanctions."
"Furthermore, the Commission proposals still do not go far enough: they, in fact, concern no more than twenty or so ships."
"The positions adopted by the French Presidency, which we have heard elsewhere, which would water down the Commission proposals even further, such as amending the proportion of ships targeted with the aim of reducing inspections by half, are naturally unacceptable."
"I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur about refusing port access to ships posing a serious risk, irrespective of age, and those that have been flying a flag of convenience for more than three years."
"We must also go further and ban them from sailing in Community waters."
"To this end, we must strengthen international maritime law."
"Moreover, it seems to me that we need to be more restrictive concerning flags of convenience, especially those of Member States, as well as those, Minister, of the islands of Kerguelen, Wallis and Fortuna in the case of France."
"I will support this report and the Commission' s amendments, but I call on the Members of Parliament to also support the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on social standards."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me begin by thanking the four rapporteurs."
"The three reports from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were adopted either unanimously or by an overwhelming majority in committee."
"In other words, we discussed the issues objectively and arrived at a common position."
"For that reason, it is important that we stand by that position."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it was very honourable of you to ask at the last minute to have the votes on two of the directives postponed so that we can still reach an agreement."
"But I put it to you that this is a somewhat ambivalent move."
"First of all, we in Parliament were criticised for having caused a delay."
"The President of Parliament specially brought the debate and vote forward from the scheduled date in December to today's sitting."
"We have had no written statement from the Council which would have enabled us even to discuss a compromise."
"I believe your intentions are honourable, but we can only discuss negotiating outcomes that have been examined by the Council."
"To that extent, it is impossible to change anything, because we discussed this material meticulously in our committees, and it would be impossible to hammer out a compromise wording on the various issues that are particularly awkward, to have these compromises printed in eleven languages and to discuss them with our colleagues in time for next Tuesday."
"I can therefore only ask you to accept the directive and the regulation in the form in which Parliament adopts them at noon today."
"That would take us as close as possible to our common goal of increasing maritime safety without delay."
"The choice is yours."
"On those points where you feel unable to accept our proposals, produce a common position in December."
"Do not delay it in the Council."
"We are prepared to negotiate on proposed compromises for the second reading from January onwards, so that the second reading will be completed early next year, just like that."
"I should like to reiterate that the urgent action upon which you are now insisting is not necessary."
"For example, in the case of port state control, we certainly want tighter rules, unlike the Council."
"But even if we did not complete the process in December, we should certainly have taken a huge step forward, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you managed to persuade the other States and your own administration to fulfil their obligations in matters of port state control under the old directive."
"So if you want to do something to improve safety at sea, recruit new inspectors, carry out stringent checks under the existing law, and we shall have achieved a resounding success."
"With regard to the liability of classification societies, which is a highly complex subject, we shall have to discuss this calmly and carefully."
"We have discussed the material thoroughly in committee, we have adopted our opinions by a large majority or unanimously, and Parliament should do likewise at noon today."
"If you achieve the same level of agreement in December, we shall be through to the next stage."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is good that we are discussing and adopting the maritime safety package at first reading today."
"What is less satisfactory, as has just been pointed out, is our past record; heaven knows that the States of the European Union have scarcely covered themselves in glory in the realm of maritime safety."
"We know, of course, that port state control has not been a potent guarantor of maritime safety in the past, we know that the classification societies have not all discharged their duties as shipping inspectorates properly and conscientiously and that some of them have tended to be slipshod, and we know that tankers without double hulls are floating time bombs."
"The more appalling thing, however, is that we knew all of this before the Erika sank."
"Parliament has highlighted this situation time and again, and the sad fact is that the progress made since then would never have happened without this disaster and the public pressure that followed it."
"Nevertheless, it is all the better that we are set to act, at long last, today."
"I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that you recognise Parliament's demand on port state control which Mr Watts made in his report."
"My first request to you is that the Council sign, seal and deliver this very quickly."
"It will then be law, as it were, and can be put into practice."
"I believe that some rethinking will certainly have to be done between the Council and Parliament on the liability limit for classification societies, irrespective of what is decided today."
"We shall agree to an international regime for double-hull tankers, but only on condition that a set of IMO rules is actually created in April."
"Our committee unanimously supports this linkage."
"If IMO rules do not materialise, we shall need European legislation."
"But we hope that IMO rules will be adopted in April."
"For these double-hull tankers we shall need many good and safe new vessels."
"I should like to see European shipyards winning the orders to build these ships in fair and open competition."
"The Commission recently presented a report in which it documented the fact that Korea is pursuing a very unfair dumping policy in the shipbuilding industry."
"For that reason, Commissioner, I earnestly appeal to you and to your colleague, Commissioner Monti, to pledge this assistance which our shipyards need so urgently and to do so before Christmas."
"The shipyards of Europe are beset by uncertainty."
"Please help to ensure that the Commission sends a clear signal here."
"We are working to establish new credibility; we should not jeopardise it by letting the Commission take the wrong course of action."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we have some good reports here."
"We must send out a clear signal to unsafe flag states, to shipowners, including those from the EU who use these flag states, to shippers who can then get cheaper prices, and to classification societies that are not doing their job properly. Safety comes at a price."
"We should have the courage to say so sometimes."
"I would just like to take a minute to go into the report by Mr Watts."
"If a flag state defaults, then the port state must be given increased responsibility."
"That is a sound principle and we must stick to it."
"A black box, a blacklist: we are in complete agreement with all these things, but there are still a few points I would like to bring to your attention."
"Countries that impose stricter controls run the risk of being saddled with shipwrecks in their ports, and environmental risks, and sometimes with human tragedies, when crews are left to their fate."
"These are all things we must take into consideration, and we must ensure that the port is not disadvantaged by well-intentioned measures."
"Commissioner, we have a directive for end-of-life vehicles."
"Ought we not to have one for end-of-life ships too, because I would not be at all surprised if there were a few environmental risks there too, which we should take a close look at sometime?"
"Secondly, we must invest in manpower and in crews."
"Hence we will support a number of amendments tabled by Mr Vachetta."
"We also need to invest in inspectors, because even if there are too few of them, we at least need to make sure we have skilled workers at the helm, so to speak."
"At the end of the day, we must also be realistic about our limitations as legislators."
"We have rules and they are not being implemented satisfactorily."
"A number of speakers have already made the same point."
"Take the Ievoli Sun, a double-hull ship. It was built in 1989 and sailed under an Italian flag."
"It has been inspected three times in the last three years."
"So, there is more to safety than rules."
"Everyone who works in the sector bears a heavy responsibility."
"Those who are not prepared to take on this responsibility must stay out of our waters and our ports."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on 18 January 2000 I brought you a cake of crude oil from the Erika which had come ashore on a beach."
"This oil cake symbolises the enormous amount of work we have to do to make our seas cleaner and maritime transport safer."
"The Erika and the Ievoli Sun are but the most recent names to date in the wrecking of an entire system."
"Firstly, the ecological system is being wrecked, with the natural marine heritage, flora and fauna destroyed or contaminated forever."
"Then there is social wrecking, with gangs of third-world seafarers, modern-day galley slaves, exploited literally to the point of slavery."
"Finally, we have economic wrecking, the result of untrammelled liberalism in maritime matters. The liberal tide of free trade which has been unleashed has swallowed up all safeguards, all preventative action and, ultimately, all morals, only to become engulfed itself in its own excesses, thereby revealing the lack of any Community maritime policy worthy of the name."
"Who today answers for the integrity and healthy conditions of maritime transport?"
"What authorities claim to control and stamp out trade on the high seas, which is more maritime trafficking than maritime traffic?"
"Nobody."
"What more proof do we need than these coffin ships fit only for the scrap yard, these thirty-year old single-hull tubs that take to the seas in stormy weather?"
"Eight thousand of the ninety thousand ships plying the seas around the world are sub-standard in terms of safety, and four thousand are carrying hazardous substances."
"In the accident barometer measured against the gauge of shipwrecks the traditional mercury has been replaced by oil or residual acid."
"Faced with the disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport, Europe has taken up the challenge and, just 11 months after the loss of the Erika, will be in a position to announce that never has a procedure been worked out quite as quickly."
"This powerful political signal is in our hands."
"It is up to us to adopt the 'Erika I' package and it is up to the Council to accept its final amendments."
"In responding favourably to this acceleration of the timetable, our group has not, however, given up on the fundamental demands for the enhanced safety of the marine environment."
"The revisions of the directives concerning port and ship inspections should get rid of the lame ducks as far as the classification societies are concerned and appreciably increase the number of inspectors in the Member States, provided, however, that the latter provide adequate resources to achieve this."
"But we are also waiting impatiently for the second package, 'Erika II' , with the establishment of a maritime agency and outline plans for a European coastguard."
"We may regret the delay in the timetable for the mandatory double hull for oil tankers and the Council' s abandoning of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues applicable to oil tankers, depending on whether they have a single or a double hull. Nevertheless, we support this report which, with its revision clause, provides for the so-called American timetable to be given a second chance in the event of failure at the Marpol Convention in April 2001."
"We are told that zero risk does not exist, but it has to be said that zero responsibility must not exist either."
"With the 'Erika I' package we will be placing the first foundation stone of a substantive European maritime safety policy, in anticipation, of course, of the 'Erika II' package."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the disasters of the past few months have brought to light the inadequacies of legislation, weaknesses in the systems of control and deficiencies in terms of human and financial resources."
"Initiated by the French Government and driven forward within the European Council of Transport Ministers, the proposed European directives are an undeniable step forward."
"They are supported by the parliamentary reports we are debating this morning."
"The Watts report intensifies the measures against ships posing serious risks or flying flags of convenience without abolishing them altogether."
"The Larrea report on classification societies harmonises legislation, develops sanctions that go as far as the withdrawal of authorisation, and increases compensation in the event of accident."
"The Hatzidakis report, whilst banning single-hull oil tankers on the same dates as the American bans, nevertheless introduces a whole raft of exemptions which do not go in the desired direction, notably with the proposal to extend the deadlines for the phasing-out of single-hull vessels."
"My group supports the Watts and Larrea reports. We will vote in favour of them."
"The vote on the Hatzidakis report will be linked to the vote on the rapporteur' s amendments."
"The two directives and the regulation we are examining are an asset in confronting the enormous challenge of maritime safety and need to be implemented as quickly as possible."
"They are nevertheless inadequate in view of the magnitude of the problems that are posed."
"Many players have stressed that the lack of maritime safety is largely due to deregulation and lenient practices."
"In the context of increased competition, the primary objective is to transport goods as quickly as possible, at the lowest cost, at the expense of safety, the environment and the crews."
"In measurable terms, the liberal rationale is effectively opposed to a high level of maritime safety."
"I reiterate that current European decisions, whilst being a definite asset, do not question this rationale."
"Hence the amendments to the Watts report presented by my group concerning social standards have been thrown out; yet the importance of the human factor is highlighted in each case."
"It is a matter of great urgency that measures be adopted to put an end to social dumping and to review the conditions of crews in terms of status, salaries, training and working conditions."
"To enable effective control to be carried out in ports it is necessary to reinforce the body of maritime inspectors and their qualifications, and hence to free up financial resources."
"Much more stringent measures must be imposed to make classification societies effective."
"Flags of convenience must be banned."
"The consequences of their use in terms of non-compliance with standards are well known."
"Yes, it is time that the European Union committed itself to actually reforming the maritime system."
"This demands a strong political will and the financial resources to put in place even more controls."
"In the run-up to the second package of proposals it seems important to me that we turn our thoughts to promoting the lasting development of maritime safety, which will involve yet further guarantees of safety and quality."
"Mr President, a year ago, three regions of France were hit by one of the most serious oil spills in European maritime history when the oil tanker, the Erika, sank."
"A few weeks ago, the west of France was struck by another ecological disaster, the wreck of the chemical tanker, the Ievoli Sun, and it is only today that the European Parliament will take the decision to strengthen maritime safety."
"I was elected to office in a coastal region which is paying every day for the grave consequences of the wreck of the Erika: the serious lasting damage caused by this oil slick to the flora and fauna of the Loire, Brittany and Charentes."
"Workers in the fishing industry, in fish farming and aquaculture, and salt makers have been very badly hit. The inhabitants of this region would have appreciated greater speed on the part of the Community institutions."
"Nonetheless, I am delighted that the Commission proposals have taken on board the main demands formulated by the elected representatives of the coastal regions: the banning of single-hull oil tankers, strengthening port controls, and the assessment of classification societies."
"On the other hand, it is unacceptable that the European Parliament should be moderating the initial Commission proposal concerning the ban on single-hull oil tankers."
"Mrs de Palacio recalled a few days ago in Rennes that, in less than a year, the United States was able to unilaterally put in place a draconian law regarding maritime safety."
"Why does the European Union need a timetable as long as that envisaged by our Parliament for the rapporteur' s amendments to phase out single-hull oil tankers?"
"Double-hull vessels may not be a cure-all, but phasing them in is an important measure that is likely to be subject to substantial technical improvements. It seems to me that to create a discrepancy between the American timetable and the European timetable would be a very dangerous thing indeed."
"If this were to happen, it is easy to see which waters and which ports the dangerous ships would head for."
"It would be better if, faced with a proactive United States, our Parliament did not give the impression that, by systematically going for the lowest possible bid, it was soft on the issue."
"If another accident were to happen, how would we be able to justify the European Parliament adopting such a slow timetable in order to wait for the IMO to reach a compromise at global level, where there are so many countries accommodating flags of convenience, which are not the most zealous militants on behalf of safety?"
"How, with the European Union under a French Presidency, will we be able to explain to the people of France that the European Parliament has abolished the necessary incentive and financial deterrence measures proposed in order to expedite the phasing in of double-hull oil tankers?"
"Parliament' s role should be to speedily and fully support the most stringent and most effective provisions proposed by the Commission, not to dilute them."
"Quite the contrary, we should be proposing going much further."
"This first package is simply a first step."
"It is vital that we put in place a system which makes the entire transport chain aware of its responsibilities so that we can finally emerge from the current lack of transparency."
"We hope that the second package of measures to be proposed to us will be commensurate with this need."
"Irrespective of the technical measures that will be adopted, one of the major reasons for this lack of safety will remain as long as the exponential growth in traffic linked to the overdevelopment of the North Sea ports is not balanced in the Channel and North Atlantic areas."
"Is it reasonable that the zone of frequentation of the port of Rotterdam should extend as far as the South of France?"
"Would not one of the most effective safety measures be to reduce traffic in this zone by regenerating the port infrastructures of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean?"
"This is the thrust of the two amendments to the reports by Mr Watts and Mr Hatzidakis which I tabled on behalf of my group."
"It is an area of consideration that the Member States and the Commission should explore. If the issue of overcrowding in the Channel and the North Sea is not dealt with, this zone will inevitably become a highway for marine pollution and a permanent threat to the safety of our seamen, the beauty of our coasts and the quality of our marine resources."
"The coasts of France are not there to become a dumping ground for European maritime traffic nor receive munitions, crude oil and styrene on their shores."
"Mr President, safety is a serious issue for various forms of transport."
"More than 40 000 people die in road accidents every year, and although the victims of shipping disasters are fewer in number, each human life counts, and what is more, the natural world is coming under increasing threat owing to accidents at sea."
"Flora and fauna, in particular birds, are the victims of oil and other forms of pollution."
"It is sad that a tanker had to be wrecked off the French coast, with disastrous consequence, before the package of measures now on the table was put together. We are very satisfied with this set of measures, as we are with the various reports."
"I will confine my comments to the Watts report on port state control."
"As the rapporteur very rightly points out, the condition of a tanker is more indicative than its age."
"I also support his demand for compulsory voyage data recorders."
"His regime for ships that have been detained several times or that fly a flag which has been on the blacklist for three years, makes a great deal of sense."
"What I would ask though, is what percentage of the ships should be refused at the present time on the basis of these criteria?"
"Neither the size nor the status of such a flag state, for example an candidate country, must result in the undermining of the measures."
"Speaking of the responsibilities of the port state, we must take care not to underplay the importance of the tasks to be fulfilled by the port authorities."
"It is highly likely that the refusal of the port concerned to allow the Erika to put in, dramatically increased the scale of the disaster."
"It would be to the credit of the acting President-in-Office of the Council if he were to set things right in his own country too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, just now I heard you acknowledge that our Parliament was an effective institution."
"We demonstrated this effectiveness on the day following the loss of the Erika."
"I remember the occasion well: we were in Strasbourg during the December part-session when we learned of this disaster."
"Knowing Finist√®re well, I knew from the start that we were unfortunately about to experience catastrophic marine pollution which would leave its traces on the shorelines of France for a long time to come."
"And so, with anger welling up inside us, we demanded immediate proposals from the Commission, which were put to us in March. Since then, we have experienced other disasters - some in Greece - and then the Ievoli Sun accident."
"We are all sick and tired of seeing our oceans and seas turned into dumping grounds."
"The McKenna report, in its third reading, recalls a certain number of key principles concerning accidental and deliberate pollution, for example the infamous illegal practice of tank cleaning, which are underpinned by the 'polluter-pays' principle."
"But certain problems continue to be intractable, even if things are moving in the right direction."
"Have we not wasted a lot of time since last March?"
"Where in fact was the political will?"
"The Council must commit itself to adopting stringent measures, which we are all hoping for, concerning port inspections, classification societies, the responsibility of shipowners and charterers and, finally, the responsibility of FIPOL, which is behaving in a scandalous manner."
"People in Brittany are still waiting for compensation for damages."
"Today, a large number of texts are being put to us, and there are yet others to come."
"This risks compromising cohesion, especially since a number of existing directives are at stake, one of which is the framework Directive on water."
"All this needs to be rationalised and we must turn our mind to producing a framework text which would simplify things at international level."
"In the interim, Minister, let us intensify technological research into marine depollution."
"It is important that the exchange of knowledge and cooperation are encouraged and sustained in this highly technical area in order to preserve our natural marine heritage. Let us hope that the measures we will adopt together will enable us to prevent further marine pollution and to protect our marine heritage."
"Mr President, I am only going to comment on and explain the majority position of the Socialist Group on one of the proposals, the one that modifies the directive regulating inspection organisations."
"The guarantees of the seaworthiness of vessels required that considerable measures be adopted on the societies responsible and on inspections, as has already been said."
"The current situation is simply unacceptable."
"In this sense, the text proposed contains some new elements that are interesting and positive but which, in our opinion, are not sufficient."
"Public opinion is demanding that we act swiftly in this situation, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, but that speed needs to be compatible with an acceptable minimum text."
"No one in the Council of which you are the Chairman should be tempted to accuse of us of moving too slowly; we demand some minimums and everyone will understand that."
"Our fundamental discrepancies are to do with two areas: on the one hand, the issue of responsibility and compensation, for which the amounts and the minimums should be adequate and equal across the whole of the European Union - we do not think that subsidiarity is acceptable."
"That independence should be very clear at this time when many shipowners and proprietors are forming their own societies that are authorising boats."
"This is unacceptable."
"Therefore, in general, we are not happy with the compromise text."
"As we understand that it is the minimum text that the Council will accept, we are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading, but we will not vote against it because we recognise the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo, which resulted in some agreed amendments which show us the path to take for the next reading."
"So, there are some interesting new elements, but they are not enough."
"Mr President, since the breaking up of the tanker Erika, a package of measures has been devised, under political pressure, with a view to improving the safety of ships at sea."
"Of course, the key question is will these measures actually lead to sub-standard ships being taken out of service?"
"I am not so sure."
"Although it pains me to say it, the fact is that we are tinkering about at the edges with these measures, rather than tackling the real root causes of the problems."
"Mrs Peijs and I have carried out a short investigation, and I would very much like to hear the Commissioner' s response to the following question. Can you tell me what became of the 750 ships that Honduras removed from its register?"
"Were they really taken out of service? And where are they in that case?"
"Secondly, is it true that in Cambodia, ships can be registered within twenty minutes via the Internet?"
"Thirdly, I feel that a tough line must be taken with the classification societies. They are given too much free rein at present."
"I have tried to incorporate an incentive to take responsibility by raising the limited liability, which involves relatively small sums, but there is often nothing to be gained."
"But I have opposed the idea of unlimited liability because this impedes the market and is counterproductive."
"What is the situation with regard to the port state control?"
"Commissioner, the current rules are not being properly adhered to as it is, never mind new ones."
"The Member States are simply not prepared to release enough money."
"There is a lot of talk but little action."
"As I see it, the Council must show greater commitment to making more resources available and exacting better sanctions."
"Then there is the matter of how to deal with flags of convenience."
"I have quite a list."
"I will vote in favour of the rapporteur' s proposal that ships which fly a blacklisted flag for three years in succession should be excluded, thereby sending out a signal to these flag ships that sub-standard controls will not pass muster in Europe."
"We do not want them in our ports or in our waters."
"In short, measures are an informal way of trying to bring safety to the desired standard."
"That is bad for the people, the sea, the environment and for the sector' s image."
"There should be more cooperation within the sector."
"I therefore support the initiatives for a European maritime platform."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their sterling work."
"It is absolutely imperative to ensure, taking the environment, safety, fishing communities, and tourism into account, that we do not have a repeat performance of what happened before."
"All eyes were on the Erika in the first instance, but a tanker was sinking in other waters off Turkey at the same time."
"The Ievoli Sun was double-hull but contained chemicals in a particular form."
"Mr Gayssot, Greek ships have sunk without warning, when there were no storms in the vicinity."
"In short, as I understand, there are reasons besides storms in the Channel that should prompt us to consider stopping shipping traffic there."
"At the end of the day, we are talking about eight to ten thousand sub-standard ships."
"In other words, this is a very extensive problem."
"The age of ships is a factor, but not the most important one."
"Maintenance plays a very important part."
"That is what we are discussing now, along with manpower."
"The human aspect of the whole issue is extremely important."
"I would just like to concentrate on two dossiers: port state control and the phasing out of single-hull oil tankers."
"Everyone has stated - and I absolutely agree - that the current 25% inspection rate necessary for port state control has not been achieved yet."
"Some countries should take a very close look at what they need to do about this back home."
"These countries must make the necessary resources available, people must be trained and so on. In particular, the President of the current Transport Council has a great deal of work to do in his own country in the near future, even though he will not be the President any more."
"In a nutshell, we should not just look at the technical side of the matter, we also need to look at crewing issues, and not just make laws, because as far as I am concerned, it would be no bad thing to raise that 25% inspection rate even higher in time, but first we need to take the other steps."
"Once again, enforcement is the most important measure."
"I have a few brief comments to make regarding single-hull ships."
"I am not happy with the fact that ships weighing 600 to 3000 tonnes have been left out."
"Nor am I pleased that the financial incentives have been completely removed from the dossier."
"I do not think the proposal was well drafted, but feel that we are certainly going to have to build financial incentives or sweeteners into these measures in the near future."
"Thirdly, when we discuss dossiers of this kind, I think it becomes clear that we do not make the connection between our oil supply, on the one hand, and the fact that we are still using fossil fuels on the other."
"Suppose we have new ships built, phasing single-hull ships out and building new double-hull ones, then we will have a more extensive fleet, when what we should in fact be doing is introducing other forms of fuel supply."
"Mr President, we should not forget that everything which we condemn here is due to the fact that shipping is, by definition, a globalised sector par excellence and has been for a long time."
"It is dynamic and disorganised and the risks inherent in it are those inherent in the global economy as a whole."
"It is not properly regulated."
"And there is nothing which international organisations such as the IMO or technology, black boxes and so on can do to provide this sort of regulation."
"Naturally, we shall be voting in favour of everything our fellow Members have proposed because these are important steps."
"But what we really need is an integrated, organised policy of intervention and regulation on the right scale, or at least on a European scale, which is why, Commissioner, we hope that the second or third package which you present to us will contain provisions in this direction - surveys, inspectors, coastguards, ports, installations and fines for those who do what they do on the high seas, because quite simply, the fines cost less than doing the job properly in port."
"But these measures need to be taken at European level and applied by everyone, rather than varying from country to country."
"Finally, everything we have said in our amendments in support of social and working conditions on board ships is quite simply a question of social and political solidarity."
"It is also a question of efficiency."
"The accidents which occurred in Greece, all of them were due in the end to so-called human error by people who were tired, who were sleepy, who had been working three days without a break and, so of course, they resulted in what has been so hypocritically referred to as so-called error."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increased incidence of disasters at sea is not the work of pure chance."
"Our political duty requires us to adopt urgent measures but we must also enforce existing legislation."
"We can no longer confine ourselves to telling the people hit by these ecological and economic disasters that we have discussed these problems, that we are giving them some thought, and that we will avoid them in future."
"If we want to be credible, we must act quickly and put an end to sterile political diatribes."
"The time has long gone for simple compromises, which some, moreover, are saying will be difficult to achieve."
"We must adopt draconian measures and enforce them at an international level by reforming the erstwhile International Maritime Code."
"Is it necessary to recall that maritime safety is the preserve of international law, especially since pollution never stops at the limits of national territorial waters and that it starts for the most part in international waters?"
"Given that, it is no longer a question of making the players involved aware of their responsibilities - as that is not effective - but of striking with real binding force where the impact will be felt the most, that is at financial interests."
"Our political action must be powerful and commensurate with ecological urgency."
"We must do away with hypocrisy."
"The way to achieve this necessarily lies in deploring the financial links that exist in some cases between shipowners and classification societies and in involving the parties concerned - shipowners, shippers, insurers and maritime administrations - in order to find a comprehensive solution."
"The reports currently under debate must be the draft for a genuine maritime safety policy, but they must in no way be limited to the Community context."
"We have the political and economic resources to impose our choices and to ensure that they are respected."
"To conclude, I will recall that the Americans did not wait for us to promulgate the Oil Pollution Act in 1990 in response to the loss of the Exxon Valdez in 1989, whilst the loss of the Amoco Cadiz in France dates back to 1978."
"Let us have the political courage of our ecological ambitions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been one bit of bad news after the other."
"First there was BSE and the prohibition of animal meal, and then yesterday a bill banning fish meal was presented to the German Parliament."
"Yesterday too, we received news from the Commission, borne by three Commissioners who really ought to know better, that the Commission is not prepared to extend aid to the European shipbuilding industry beyond 31 December."
"What else do we intend to do to ourselves in the European Union?"
"I cannot understand it, and the Koreans must be laughing up their sleeves."
"By contrast, the Environment and Transport Committees have acted wisely and boldly in dealing with the first 'Erika' package, albeit in response to pressure in the wake of the accident."
"We quickly received the package and discussed it promptly in Parliament, which is a praiseworthy achievement."
"A second package is already under way."
"For your part, Minister, I am sorry to say that you have been telling us ""we could..."" and have been talking about flags of convenience, black boxes and the like."
"But why are you not doing these things right now, rather than tomorrow?"
"You said, ""We have the opportunity to improve safety."""
"So take that opportunity now, Minister, rather than later."
"Parliament has long been calling for such action."
"We parliamentarians are certainly not letting the grass grow under our feet."
"As to the accusation that Parliament has been solely responsible for any delay, I can only say that this is an attempt by others to hoodwink the public and divert attention from themselves and their own failure to deliver."
"For that reason, we cannot agree to a postponement of the vote."
"We must send the right signal."
"The flags are at half-mast already, and I do not expect a rapid result at any price but rather the best possible result within the shortest possible time."
"The conciliation procedure is an option. It may be a necessary evil, but it is an option, and I hope that all of us will contribute as best we can."
"We all know each other's positions by now, which is another reason why we need to vote today."
"As far as the classification societies are concerned, it is my duty and my wish to re-emphasise on this occasion that the main focal point of the present discussion seems to be liability."
"Everyone understands that."
"People's futures and the survival of many businesses are on the line here, not to mention the environmental implications."
"The Commission intends to look at this liability issue again in the second 'Erika' package, and rightly so."
"I am convinced, however, that it is vitally important in the context of maritime accidents to consider the whole chain of responsibility and to examine every aspect of the matter."
"It is regrettable that nobody is looking beyond the classification societies in the present discussion of the liability issue."
"This, at least, is the impression that has been conveyed."
"The spotlight is focused on the first link in the chain of maritime operators without being turned on the liability of the other parties."
"So this still needs to be rectified."
"We must have a full picture of all parties' responsibilities and hence of their liability."
"Mr President, these texts have been imposed on us by exceptional, dramatic and repetitive circumstances and, faced with two accidents in less than a year, those of the Erika and the Ievoli Sun, public opinion has expressed a Europe-wide concern and a feeling of urgency."
"This shows that, in this area more than any other, we have a tremendous responsibility and we must, it seems to me, stifle any institutional pride we may have."
"The European Parliament has responded to this ambition of public opinion by means of a rapid, accelerated procedure, the credit for which must be firmly laid at the door of our four rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs McKenna, Mr Watts et Mr Ortuondo Larrea."
"We had a common objective."
"It seems to me that that was the one we had to pursue: to arrive at a text during the December part-session and to achieve a consensus between the Council and Parliament."
"It turns out that two texts risk putting us at odds with the Council and so, this evening, it is likely that the imminent publication of directives and regulations, which everybody is hoping for, will not be announced."
"Personally, I regret that, due to over-hastiness, or perhaps due to a lack of level-headedness, these ten days have been cruelly snatched from us, and I also regret that we have not taken the hand extended to us by the Council so that, in December, in ten days to be exact, we might achieve what it seems we are all apparently hoping for throughout this Chamber."
"Personally, I regret this and I believe that it will be severely judged."
"I believe that Parliament' s position is the correct one to take on most of these texts, because it is perhaps the most demanding one, except on the issue of double hulls."
"Mr President, I therefore appeal for the adoption of a common position on the liability scheme of classification societies, the system of banning ships, black boxes and systematic inspections, to tackle what we will doubtless be unable to reach agreement on today."
"The French Presidency will have given the matter a crucial boost, the effects of which will unfortunately only be felt in two or three months' time."
"We are taking any number of risks, including that of conciliation."
"I believe we will come to regret this."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for their successful reports. In them, attention has been focused on factors that are essential for increased safety at sea."
"There is, however, still much to be done to improve safety at sea."
"It is important to tighten up regulations regarding the control of harbours and ports even further, and enhance its effectiveness."
"We also have to improve the way we approve classification societies and monitor their work, and expanded inspections must be carried out, in particular on high-risk vessels."
"I would also like to point out that it is not enough that the Union alone should find solutions to increase safety at sea."
"For example, questions of responsibility must be dealt with on a global basis."
"That also goes for the matter of double-hull design requirements."
"Rules applied regionally are not enough here either: we need global IMO agreements."
"For example, for Finland it is vitally important that Russia is included in these agreements."
"We must ensure that vessels that are no longer seaworthy and pose a risk actually are scrapped and are not brought back into service flying someone else' s flag."
"Mr President, I shall be voting in favour of all the technical measures aimed at enhancing maritime safety even though, at the same time, I deplore their inadequacy."
"But the real problem is the political will to adopt and implement measures binding upon all those endangering the community and the environment in order to make a profit."
"These are not only the shipowners but also, more especially, the contractors, who are large multinationals, as the losses of the Erika and the Ievoli Sun clearly illustrated."
"These binding measures should involve not only the detention of dangerous ships but also the seizure of such vessels and their contents."
"What is more, these major companies should be made financially liable to the extent of their assets for any damage that they cause."
"The fuel dumps of Total and Shell, the charterers of the Erika and the Ievoli Sun respectively, should have been immediately confiscated until all the damage that had been inflicted due to their irresponsibility had been fully compensated."
"Justice can be merciless towards the poor who are unable to pay a tax or a fine, and will even go so far as to seize their meagre belongings."
"Laxness towards large companies is indeed a sign that they are more powerful than elected institutions."
"Mr President, allow me first to express my thanks both to the Commission and to the three rapporteurs for their important work on this matter."
"The Erika catastrophe in autumn 1999 caused many to react, which is a good thing."
"At the same time, it would have been even better if we had acted in advance instead of reacting afterwards."
"Then perhaps we could have avoided a catastrophe."
"There is much that is good in what we must decide on today."
"That applies both to the stricter requirements on the design of oil tankers, better rules on port state control and the tightening up of the rules on classification societies that will also result from this."
"At the same time, I feel that many question marks remain."
"For example, what is the point of preventing vessels from putting into EU ports if we do not prevent them from navigating our waters?"
"Realistic assessments suggest that we will only be able to stop a further 10-12 vessels per year."
"Will this be sufficient?"
"The latest major accident resulting in oil discharges just a few weeks ago involved a double-hull tanker."
"This means that not even the mandatory introduction of this type of hull will provide any kind of certain solution."
"Allow me to take up one further matter, namely all the cases of oil discharges that are not an accident but rather are entirely deliberate discharges."
"Oil traffic in the Baltic has doubled since 1995 and in a few years' time will have trebled."
"Every day we suffer two new discharges on average."
"A short time ago a vessel with a Maltese flag of convenience discharged oil in Swedish waters just off Gotska Sand√∂n."
"The vessel then sailed into the port of Tallinn in Estonia."
"The question is who can act."
"Under the MARPOL convention Sweden is not entitled to act because the vessel is no longer in Swedish waters."
"Neither can Estonia act, because the vessel did not cause any damage there."
"Malta, for its part, probably does not wish to act, because the country enjoys great economic gain from this type of vessel being registered under the Maltese flag."
"And so yet another environmental marauder goes free."
"The proposals that we have submitted to date will not solve this problem in the future either."
"I therefore consider that there is an incredible amount still to do in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the issue of safety at sea, in other words, the safety of human life and environmental protection, is a very serious issue."
"If we are to deal with it, we need strict, modern rules with reliable inspectors and suitably-staffed government agencies to ensure that they are applied."
"Proposals have been made to prohibit ships which seriously endanger our seas from docking, to record voyage data so that conditions along a ship's course can be checked in the event of an accident, to gradually make double hulls compulsory and to improve regulations and standards governing ship inspection and control bodies."
"Of course, nothing would be simpler than to set limits and restrictions which, in theory, would preclude any accident."
"However, they would be impossible to apply without taking other basic aspects of the problem into account."
"Shipping should not be treated as the ""enemy"", nor is it. It should be seen as a friend which could do better."
"We need to take action to improve safety which causes shipping and trade as little pain as possible and we must be sure that such action will not do more harm than good. In other words, we must not exaggerate."
"I am positive that everyone would rather have more lenient regulations which are applied than stricter regulations which are not applied."
"May I remind the House that five Member States - and to avoid misunderstanding, Greece is not one of them - have been charged by the Commission with failure to apply the previous, more lenient directive."
"I think we can strike the required balance on the basis of the Commission and IMO proposals and the reports under discussion, on which the rapporteurs really do deserve to be congratulated."
"The tragedy is that, even if regulations are introduced, they will not stop the type of accident in which the Greek car ferry Express Samina was involved, i.e. where a captain ""decides"" to ram his ship into charted, well-lit rocks."
"Mr President, today we are discussing maritime safety on the basis of three reports, on which I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on."
"Immediately after the Erika disaster the Commissioner started working on an extensive legislation package, and in all honesty, I am compelled to say that apart from the liability aspect, the legislation really was not bad at all."
"The problem was, and remains, compliance with legislation, inspections and sanctions in the event of non-compliance."
"Today we are discussing the safety of ships and flag states, port state control and the classification societies."
"Unfortunately, pressure of time means I have to be selective."
"Firstly, the issue of the classification societies. It does not really matter that they are supposed to have maximum unlimited liability."
"The majority of them cannot afford it anyway."
"What is important is to ensure that when they make a serious and inexcusable mistake, they are shut down, i.e. we must close them, put a stop to their activities, end of story."
"That would keep them on their toes a bit more."
"It would also seem to be better than imposing sanctions that do not yield anything."
"Then there are the flag states. I personally am in favour of banning ships that sail under cheap blacklisted flags from the ports and territorial waters of the Union."
"However I can see the practical difficulties associated with this."
"Is it not worrying that the sister ship of the Erika, the Maria S, carried on sailing round undisturbed for more than a year before it was detained and sent to the scrap heap?"
"Why was the Maria S not taken out of service by its classification society?"
"What did the flag state actually do?"
"Various states, which are completely irresponsible to my mind, offer registrations that take a mere twenty minutes via the Internet. It is in every sense a virtual affair, with no form of inspection."
"Mrs Sanders has already mentioned Cambodia. Cambodia advertises this form of registration in the shipping news."
"What is the Commissioner doing about ships that have been registered in this manner?"
"Are we going to wait until they are detained?"
"Once, twice, until there is oil on the North Sea beaches."
"It is obvious that a bonafide company does not register its ships in Cambodia."
"The second example is Honduras."
"750 ships were in an unspeakably poor condition even by Honduran standards."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether we follow these ships with a tracking and tracing system?"
"Because surely the question arises as to which flag states have accepted these floating wrecks?"
"Where are they now?"
"I do not think we can continue to operate with any credibility without a tracking system of this kind."
"Other countries besides those of the EU must take a firm hand with the flag states."
"Some of our Member States make a mess of their own registers."
"A strict test must also be applied under real life conditions to those countries that have systems which look good on paper but which do not amount to anything in reality."
"If they fail the test then the same rule applies to them as it does to other untrustworthy flag states: we do not want their ships in our ports."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, several times in the debate we have been reminded of the Erika disaster and other catastrophes; each of us could add to this list."
"Our past and recent history has been dotted with calamities, and that might also seem quite natural, though upsetting, if we did not remember that 75% of them have been caused by human hand."
"So it is important to state the political and cultural bottom line: it is time to get rid of the emergency culture, and it is time to affirm the prevention culture."
"The reports that have been presented are a move in this direction."
"It is significant that the Commission, through the Commissioner, Mrs Wallstr√∂m, has this morning confirmed its priority commitment to a modern maritime safety policy, and the declaration made by the Council is also important, but this declaration is binding in respect of the effort that must be made to bring this matter to a definitive close by the end of December."
"This has been a good start, but we must also move on to other stages."
"Some have been announced this morning by the Commissioner, and I shall mention four of them: legislative and organisational harmonisation by the candidate countries for enlargement; training of human resources and recognition of the rights of those working in the sector; the setting-up of a European maritime agency, with the full involvement not only of the Member States, but also of local and regional authorities; and affirmation of the principle of liability, and hence redress, for environmental damage and not just social and economic damage."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us ensure that the ""polluter pays"" slogan does not remain just a slogan!"
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, transport by sea is undoubtedly one of the least environmentally damaging modes of transport."
"This is demonstrated by the fact that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce accidental pollution have certainly had some success."
"Nevertheless, we still unfortunately witness serious incidents, such as the recent sinking of the Erika, which show how urgent it is to adopt new measures to promote marine safety and to avoid any repetition of incidents that have such major ecological and economic repercussions on our coastlines, our seas, fisheries and tourism."
"With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who in a very short time have shown how determined our Parliament is to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, controls and construction standards, and that it is no longer tolerable that similar incidents should occur again."
"I believe it is our duty to strengthen the enforcement of existing directives on these matters and to adopt new measures designed to clear our seas of sub-standard vessels, real sea-going old rust buckets."
"In addition to adopting this package of measures, the European Union should, in my view, act in a worldwide context, identifying solutions agreed at international level that will improve maritime safety and at the same time not penalise our shipowners in comparison with others."
"In conclusion, I would highlight the need to set up an information exchange system among the Member States on navigation safety in areas with heavy tanker traffic, so as to ensure constant monitoring and an immediate reaction to any hazards."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialists in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to make a few brief comments."
"The Commission has the merit of overcoming inactivity and contributing to a political solution."
"Parliament wants effective and coherent action for the sector."
"We know that the cause of accidents, which are becoming more numerous and more serious despite the technology now available, lies in the competitive madness in shipbuilding, leading to declining quality, and the absurd economic management of ageing fleets, which hinges on a strategy of drastic cuts in maintenance and crews."
"Accidents are not just caused by the age and type of the vessel; they also occur because of the unscrupulousness of ship owners and operators who make use of every possible method to cut costs. Some of these have been repeatedly mentioned here, from flags of convenience to the permissiveness of port authorities and the complicity of classification societies."
"The problem of safety for this form of transport requires offenders to be penalised rigorously; imposing such penalties entails costs that must be shared by the whole sector worldwide, so that we do not penalise the European sector even more."
"We agree with imposing a lower limit for personal injury or death and material damage, leaving the Member States free to raise these limits."
"We disagree with the idea according to which the fitness of classification societies depends on their size or even the number of inspectors on their staff, and prefer to be guided by the consequences of their certification, and therefore the system of civil liability compatible with the risk is necessary."
"Allow me to make a comment on Portugal, which has been mentioned here."
"Portugal supported the changes to Directive 94/54 but disagrees with the abolition of classification societies by smaller countries."
"Classification society performance must be assessed by common criteria: number of accidents, incidents or detentions of inspected and certified ships that cause pollution."
"It is unrealistic to expect the number of accidents to fall without international coordination channelled through a political and entrepreneurial commitment that creates a new operational mentality."
"Mrs Chairman, a series of high-profile ship disasters, particularly involving oil tankers, has hit our continent in the recent past."
"Tremendous damage has been caused to nature as well as to the livelihoods of the population living in these areas."
"Our electors ask us what we are doing to prevent catastrophes like these?"
"I would like to thank Ms Wallstr√∂m and Ms De Palacio for the action they have taken in the field of maritime safety."
"They definitely have reacted quickly and worked swiftly for better rules and legislation regarding safety at sea in both the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' proposals."
"The phasing out of single-hull oil tankers will increase safety along EU coasts."
"My friends in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism remarked that stricter EU phase-out dates should be adopted."
"I thank my colleagues for this responsible approach and I urge agreement to be reached on the earlier drop-dead date of 2015."
"When we do this we should always remember that double hulls or even triple hulls do not guarantee with absolute certainty that accidents will not happen in the future."
"Presenting new technologies and making improvements to the vessel design are part of this important work."
"As regards the Commission decision yesterday to stick with the previously agreed timetable regarding the state aid schemes I think that was a wise decision."
"Like my very good friend Mrs Langenhagen I am very worried about the situation in South Korea and I was glad to see that the European Commission will review this issue before May next year."
"Madam President, when the Erika sank, it was the fault of the ship' s age, the single hull, the Indian crew and the Maltese flag."
"When the Ievoli Sun sank, it was relatively young, it had a double hull, a crew from the European Community and it was flying the Italian flag."
"It is enough to confuse anybody!"
"Our citizens understand even less well."
"I believe that our reports contain a weakness, in that they do not sufficiently discuss the seafarers and the men on board ship."
"More than 80 of accidents are associated with human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social in nature."
"Naturally, the training of the crews is important, but it must be checked and this can only be carried out by the port state. Inspectors must check not only the condition of the ship but also the shipboard social conditions."
"Is Convention 147 of the ILO which, amongst other things, obliges port states to reinforce measures aimed at protecting the interests of seamen in terms of their health and safety, their working conditions and their union rights, being correctly enforced?"
"As for the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, I believe it would be useful to amend it in such a way as to make inspections of the shipboard social conditions systematic and effective."
"I believe that the issue of maritime safety will not be over until we have talked about the seamen."
"Madam President, firstly, as regards urgency in taking decisions and in implementing these decisions, bearing in mind that less than a year after the Erika incident we had the Ievoli Sun accident, how is it possible not to understand our electors, our fellow citizens, when they ask how this could have happened?"
"I have heard Members of Parliament ask why action was not taken sooner."
"While I can understand this question, I believe that we must realise that, in this area, perhaps as never before, Parliament, the Commission and the Council did indeed display a willingness to act and to react speedily."
"One can even assume that this initiative creates conditions not only for the European Union to adopt perfectly effective measures regarding the waters that concern it directly, but also measures to enable the IMO itself, as it were, to bring all these measures up to a fully global level within the coming months."
"I remember - and please forgive me for using this personal tone - that last February we sent the three memoranda to the European Union, to FIPOL and to the IMO. This was done on France' s initiative because the Erika had just sunk and, since March, the Commission has put forward a number of proposals."
"From the very first meeting, under the French Presidency of the Council of Transport Ministers, there has been a common will to so something. Today, as well as moving forward the date of the debate in part-session, the European Parliament is proposing to debate and to give its verdict in three key areas."
"This specifically demonstrates that, this time, we will not fall once again into the ruts of the past."
"It has to be said that in the twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz accident some things were perhaps achieved, but not enough to prevent this lack of maritime safety from being eradicated."
"I want to highlight the work that has been done at this level and I share the opinion of your rapporteurs, the quality of whose work I also commend."
"I am convinced, as are the Members of the European Parliament, that we must strengthen the texts proposed by the Commission, especially regarding black boxes and banning ships."
"I am also in favour of the liability of all operators, in particular that of classification societies, which play a key role in maritime safety, being established and clearly reinforced so that no lenience can exist, most notably as regards inspections."
"I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise."
"We must move forward towards consensus upon maximum maritime regulation and safety."
"It is not a question of a compromise between those who would like more and those who would like less."
"There is common ground and we must seek the consensus to achieve it."
"As regards maritime safety and 'cheating' there is no compromise to be sought regarding the elements of inspection and maritime safety."
"If you agree, Parliament, the Commission and the Council must work, by consensus, between now and the Council of Ministers on 20 and 21 December."
"I have indeed heard this suggestion made by several rapporteurs."
"This is the proposal I am putting to you officially right now."
"I hope that this work can result in common positions being established as early as 20 and 21 December."
"I am not yet at a stage where I need to talk about conciliation."
"We can expedite matters."
"If we work from now until the Council of Ministers on 20 and 21 December, we will succeed in establishing common positions, obtained by qualified majority voting. This is an element I wish to stress as Parliament will then be able to accept these positions in second reading early next year."
"It is true that the subjects we are dealing with are sometimes complex and technical."
"I realise that even the translations take time."
"But the most important thing is the unshakeable will which must motivate us collectively to change the current rules of the game of maritime transport in order to establish maritime safety."
"These proposals which, I hope, we are going to push forward together very quickly, both as regards the phasing out of single-hull ships and the issue of classification societies and port state control, are important, but, as you have said, and as the Commissioner has also said, we know that they are not enough."
"We need this second package in order to go further in terms of making all the operators aware of their responsibilities. We also need to step up surveillance and transparency."
"One Member of Parliament used the term 'traceability' ."
"I would support that idea."
"We cannot allow operators to do just what they like with ships, especially when they have been repaired or banned in such and such a place."
"We must not find them back on our seas and on our oceans."
"The Equasis system, which is part of the second package, will enable us to push things forward."
"Finally, Madam President, a number of you have spoken about this, but we do not as yet have all the elements of the inquiry that I set up in the wake of the loss of the Ievoli Sun."
"The fact is that this ship was not old, it had a double hull and its crew was from Europe."
"We will get the results of this inquiry shortly."
"It is important that everybody knows what happened, as the human question, which was brought up by a number of you, is also very important."
"Things are happening in terms of the overexploitation of seamen and shipboard living and working conditions, as well as in terms of maintenance, which may be determining factors in the cause of accidents, and I believe we must move forward in this area too."
"Madam President, I first would like to thank you all for this interesting and valuable debate."
"I am glad to say that the Commission will support many of the amendments put forward in these three reports."
"There still remain some areas where we have somewhat different approaches."
"But I hope that these can be cleared today."
"Allow me to give the Commission' s view on each of the reports on the three proposals."
"I would like to start with the proposal on port state control."
"I thank Parliament for its strong commitment to our proposal and especially Mr Watts for his series of amendments which sends a clear and strong message to sub-standard operators and negligent flag states."
"Most of the amendments are focused on the proposed refusal of access to Community waters."
"These are Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8."
"The core of Parliament' s amendments is Amendment No 3, amending Article 7a of the Commission proposal."
"It includes three elements: firstly, the deletion of the age criterion is acceptable to the Commission since there is no absolute correlation between age and the quality of a ship."
"Secondly, regarding the criterion based on the absence of a black box on board, the Commission supports the principle of a widened accelerated introduction of black boxes on board ships plying EU ports, but this is a matter which should not be dealt with in the port state control Directive."
"So this is not a matter of principle but a matter of the formal place for this specific proposal."
"The port state control Directive is designed to check compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules."
"Within a few days the Commission will adopt a proposal for a Directive on safety of navigation including such an obligation to be equipped with a black box."
"The third element of Amendment No 3 is a proposal to ban all ships that have flown for three years the flag of a state included in the blacklist published by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding."
"In Parliament' s proposal, this criterion alone would be decisive to ban whole fleets."
"Should the directive enter into force today with the proposed amendment of Parliament, 32 fleets including Malta, Cyprus, Russia, Panama, the largest fleet of the world, would be banned."
"This means thousands of ships including ships of high quality which is contrary to the objectives of port state control."
"We prefer our proposal where the flag criterion is linked to the detention record of a ship so as to give a clear and strong signal to sub-standard operators."
"In brief, the Commission can only partially accept Amendment No 3."
"Amendments Nos 1, 6, 7 and 8 also relate to the refusal of access."
"The Commission can accept Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 8, but can only partially accept Amendment No 1."
"The deletion of the age criterion is acceptable but not the extension of banning the territorial waters of Member States."
"This is not reflected in the text of the directive where the refusal of access only concerns EU ports."
"As regards the other amendments, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 21, 22, 23 and 24 subject to some redrafting."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 9 to 20, Amendment Nos 25 and 26."
"Most are new proposed recitals that do not reflect the contents of the directive."
"Many are either outside the scope of the port state control or are already covered by this or another directive."
"More specifically, Amendments Nos 9 to 17 and 25 introduce new recitals most of which are not linked in any way to the text of the directive."
"Amendment No 18 introduces port state control in relation to the seafarers' rest period, however the enforcement of the provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work is already fully covered by existing Directive 99/95."
"Amendment No 19 is redundant since the current procedures already provide that non-compliance with the required health and working standards as established by ILO conventions are reported as deficiencies and can also lead to the detention of a vessel."
"Amendment No 20 is irrelevant to port state control as it concerns competition between ports of the Atlantic and North Sea and not maritime safety."
"Amendment No 26 reflects the amendments of banding proposed by the rapporteur in Amendment No 3 but extends the scope of the measure to the exclusive economic zone of Member States and in this light it is contrary to the law of the sea."
"Let me now turn to the proposal for the accelerated phasing in of double-hull oil tankers."
"I am happy to say that we almost entirely agree."
"Following pressure by Member States on the International Maritime Organisation, there is a proposed phase-out schedule which meets the main concerns of Europe and at the same time aligns with the American Oil Pollution Act 90 and which is to be fully supported."
"In this respect, the Commission insists on 2015 as the final end date."
"In order to achieve the main objective of this proposal, namely to phase out old single-hull oil tankers quickly, we are prepared to go along with the deletion of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues."
"It is expected that the IMO will formally adopt the phase out schedule at its April meeting next year."
"However, should the International Maritime Organisation fail to do so, the Commission agrees with Parliament that we will have to adopt a EU regulation based on the EP text and introduce a system for European Union waters."
"Amendment No 12 of the report says exactly the same, but it is more of a political commitment than a legal text."
"Therefore, we do not need it in the final text and I hope you will not insist on this point."
"For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept the new Amendment No 22 which relates to the very important area of safety of navigation but is of no relevance to the proposed regulation."
"The Commission also rejects Amendments Nos 10 and 18 since this would mean setting up an additional committee just for this regulation and this is inconsistent with our policy line of reducing the number of committees by making use of existing committees."
"I am happy to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21 to the condition assessment scheme and we agree with the main thrust of the approach suggested but there is need for some fine tuning of the wording to make it clearer."
"Last but not least, the proposal for amendments to the classification societies Directive."
"Here again, there is no great divergence of views and the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 6, 12, 14, 15 and 8 with the exception of the additional Paragraphs 3a and 3b to that amendment."
"There is a set of amendments which the Commission feels could create confusion because they introduce new terminology in an area where the language of the international fora, IMO, is well established."
"I am referring to Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7 and 9 and the Commission feels that these are not really substantial problems, more drafting language matters which could possibly be cleared by the jurist-linguists."
"The issue of assessments to be carried out over the classification societies by the Member States on the one hand and by the Commission on the other is of primary importance."
"The objectives of Parliament and the Commission are the same."
"We must maintain the clear difference in substance of the tasks at hand for either party."
"Member States must satisfy themselves that the classification society they have chosen to work on their behalf, fulfils the tasks to their full satisfaction."
"The Commission' s task is to confirm that the classification society continues to meet the qualitative criteria in the directive and to monitor the performance of the classification societies."
"In that respect, the control tasks of Member States and the Commission are different and should not be undertaken at the same time."
"This is why the Commission would favour Amendment No 28 now on the table which reintroduces the obligation for Member States to carry out their assessment and therefore rejects Amendment No 13."
"Ethics is an equally important issue that should be tackled."
"I share Parliament' s concern that there should be no undue influence from a shipowner over a classification society."
"In this respect, Amendments Nos 26 and 29 are making clarifications of the text in their Spanish versions and would be acceptable to the Commission."
"Amendment No 4 and part of Amendment No 18 relating to point ""K"" are not acceptable."
"There are some other amendments which the Commission has difficulties in accepting mainly on the grounds that we feel that the concerns expressed have already been sufficiently taken care of in other parts of the existing text."
"Here I have in mind Amendments Nos 5, 16 and the additions 3a and 3b to Amendment No 8: 3a because we feel this is adequately covered in Article 9 and 10 and 3b because this is covered in the Directive on port state control."
"Further, Amendment No 1 and part of Amendment No 18 relating to point ""K"" are not acceptable on legal grounds."
"Amendment No 1 because only the Community is a legal person and not the Union and 18 ""K"" as it may contravene horizontal commitments made in the general agreement on trade in services."
"Amendment No 11 and a part of Amendment No 18 relating to point ""H"" which deal with the issue of setting clear performance targets and indicators for classification societies are rather ambiguous."
"They seem to suggest limitations which are unacceptable and should be rejected."
"The aim of our proposal is to allow for a tightening of supervision of classification societies and the possibility to suspend or withdraw recognition in situations where the performance of a classification society is not up to standard."
"In this respect, the Commission cannot accept any limitation or involvement of classification societies in the judgment over themselves."
"As regards Amendments Nos 19 to 25, I am afraid none of them is acceptable either because they are already covered in the existing directive or simply fall outside the scope of this directive and are covered by other directives."
"That leaves Amendment No 10 dealing with the important issue of liability limits."
"The Commission appreciates the support for its originally proposed limit."
"Also, the Commission agrees with the revision clause but would prefer the more flexible formula suggested in Amendment No 12, commitology, over that in Amendment No 10, full legislative procedure."
"I have two comments on issues raised by Mr Stenmarck about oil spills in the Baltic Sea."
"We have two instruments at hand."
"Firstly there is a Directive on waste reception facilities recently approved by the European Parliament and Council."
"All ships are obliged to discharge waste in European Union ports."
"Secondly, in our proposal on 'Erika II' concerning surveillance of navigation, Member States will be required to intervene even on the high seas in such cases."
"I would say to Mrs Peijs about Cambodia and Honduras ships, that we are perfectly aware of the threat to safety and these are precisely the kinds of flags targeted in our proposal on the port state Directive."
"I can assure you that if a shipowner thinks of registering a ship on these registers, he should think twice after our proposal."
"May I conclude by expressing once again my gratitude to Parliament and to the four rapporteurs for their expeditious work and excellent reports."
"It is a curious coincidence that Parliament is considering the final stage of the adoption of the European Parliament and Council decision on accidental or deliberate marine pollution, at the same time as the first set of measures proposed by the Commission following the Erika disaster."
"Indeed, even with the best preventative legislation, zero risk does not exist."
"We are sometimes struggling against the forces of nature."
"In order to be better prepared against maritime disasters, this decision has established a solid framework for cooperation at Community level."
"It creates the conditions that will allow the sharing of experience gathered by Member States to better protect our marine environment against the risk of accidental or deliberate pollution."
"The conciliation process was demanding, but a well-balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of Parliament and Council have produced a better decision."
"The scope and content of the decision are now clearer, in particular concerning operational discharges and munitions as well as regarding the link with international conventions or in relation to the polluter-pays principle."
"This has largely been due to the excellent work of the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, whom I would particularly like to thank along with the Members of Parliament' s delegation."
"Let me conclude by recalling that one month ago the Ievoli Sun sank near Cherbourg with 6 000 tonnes of dangerous cargo."
"Once again, this demonstrates how urgent the adoption of strengthened, preventative and restoratory Community measures for the protection of our seas is."
"We now count on the Council and, of course, Mr Gayssot personally to crown this remarkable work with our good, solid, ambitious agreement during the next Council."
"Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m."
"Commissioner, no one in this Chamber was getting impatient as you were speaking. Quite the contrary, we are very grateful that you have taken so much care to set out the Commission' s positions in such detail."
"I once again thank the President-in-Office of the Council for what he had to say and for the very great determination that he expressed."
"Mr Poos, would you like to add something to the debate?"
"I wish to raise a point of order, Madam President."
"The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes and during this time she cited dozens and dozens of items and gave a breakdown of the position of the Commission."
"It is impossible for Members of Parliament to take note of the Commission' s position on the different amendments."
"That is why I would like to reiterate my proposal that the Commission' s position on the amendments is sent to all the Members of Parliament in writing before we cast our vote."
"Very well."
"I am sure the Commissioner heard what you had to say."
"I am told there is no objection to that, Mr Poos."
"Madam President, this is a point of order concerning Rule 44."
"As we have heard on several occasions, the Council persists in not taking the deadlines for replying to our questions into consideration."
"Instead of supplying a written, priority reply in three weeks, they took 16 weeks to send this one."
"Anyway, I should like to read out this very brief reply: ""The first four questions raised have never been submitted to the Council; as for the last three questions, these clearly fall within the organisational competences of the General Secretariat."""
"You can understand that there might be an incompetent and provocative official, but when 15 countries give their assent to this kind of answer, Madam President, I think you should take the initiative when you meet the Council to have this prerogative of Members of Parliament respected."
"Mr Turco, I have understood what you had to say and I will give the matter some thought."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments."
"VOTE"
"Thank you, Mr Hatzidakis."
"Motion for a resolution on the preparation of the Nice European Council"
"Madam President, please allow me briefly to explain our reasons for withdrawing the resolution."
"We are withdrawing the resolution since its content has been reproduced almost in full and to the letter in the joint resolution signed by the Chairmen of the main political groups."
"I note with satisfaction that this acknowledges the high quality of the end-result arrived at on 21 November by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the basis of a transparent and balanced compromise between the various positions."
"While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda."
"That was what the Committee over which I currently preside had proposed in carrying out its mandate, consistent with Parliament' s action on the eve of the Amsterdam Council in 1997 and on other similar occasions before that."
"I believe, Madam President, that the powers and initiatives of our parliamentary committees ought not to be constrained."
"Thank you, Mr Napolitano."
"The motion for a resolution from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is therefore withdrawn."
"Joint motion for a resolution on the preparation of the Nice European Council"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0340/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy"
"Relating to Amendment No 2:"
"Madam President, I should like to move that the amendment be altered so that it begins with the words ""urges, in this respect, the Council and the Commission""."
"The words ""and the Commission"" would be inserted, and the last clause, ""urges once again the Commission to open a representation office in Taipei"" would be deleted."
"If the author of the amendment agrees, we could proceed in that way."
"Madam President, in the Foreign Affairs Committee this week we suffered a physical intrusion into our debates which stopped our debates three times."
"We now know that this intrusion happened at the invitation of certain members of this Parliament."
"Would Madam President apologise to our guests, the Turkish Foreign Minister Mr Cem and his Ambassador Mr Akiyol, and would Madam President remonstrate strongly with those Members who deliberately arranged the demonstration today as it was a travesty of our normal Parliamentary hospitality and could have led to physical harm."
". The rapporteur is correct in identifying the local dimension in terms of strengthening European employment strategy."
"Local authorities, SMEs and NGOs must be involved in any strategy to create employment as they are in close contact with the situation at ground level and can provide the expertise to make a success of local employment strategies."
"I support the idea of designating a European Local Development year and welcome the idea of maximising the use of new technology to reduce unemployment."
"Employment creation must remain one of our top priorities."
"McKenna report (A5-0336/2000)"
"Madam President, I have voted for the McKenna report, which, together with the Conciliation Committee, marks the conclusion of the Community framework for intervening in the matter of marine pollution."
"I have talked to retired seamen, who tell me that they are all in favour of this programme, especially because it is a European programme aimed at keeping the seas clean."
"They also say that they know Europe and have had personal experience of it all their lives because many ships have mixed crews, with Italian, French, English and Spanish members, and so they are really happy that Europe as a whole is interested in keeping European seas clean."
"Watts report (A5-0343/2000)"
"Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party I voted against the Watts report."
"I voted against in protest at the fact that the European Union is still not managing to intervene in this matter as it should."
"In fact, those concerned with enforcing shipboard living and working conditions, as the title of this report states, are unable to lay down that seamen who go to sea are, throughout Europe, entitled to receive their pensions and end their working lives earlier than other people."
"Many seamen are grandfathers and do not see their grandchildren because they are always at sea; fathers do not see their own children."
"In short, this job is different from others and entails many more sacrifices than other jobs."
"Therefore it is fair that they should be entitled, if they wish, to take their pensions before other workers."
". (EL) Accidents at sea, marine pollution, unacceptable health and safety conditions on board ships and the over-exploitation of crews are simply expressions of the criminal unaccountability of big shipowners and the policies which serve them at national, regional and international level."
"The EU's policy merely maintains and extends this unaccountability, given that even the inadequate protective measures decided under pressure from the grass-roots movement will never be applied."
"Regional decisions on safety at sea seriously undermine the role of the International Maritime Organisation (√â√å√è) and the economic war being waged exerts a constant downward pressure on safety regulations, which are sacrificed to profit."
"At the same time, big shipowners ply their trade uncontrolled under flags of convenience and the state of world shipping goes from bad to worse."
"The unaccountability of shipowners is being bolstered by the privatisation of shipping registers, which shipowners now control, and by the lack of any basic inspection controls or other form of involvement on the part of government authorities."
"We urgently need to take preventative action for ships flying under the flag of Member States of the European Union, to improve existing legislation and, more importantly, to ensure that it is applied."
"We need to change the system of shipping registers by moving them from the private to the public sector."
"We also need to extend seaworthiness surveys and inspections by the competent authorities to ships of any nationality sailing in the territorial waters of the Member States and to promote similar measures at international level under resolutions by the √â√å√è, paying particular attention and applying particularly strict measures to ships sailing under flags of convenience."
"Merchant ships need to be inspected by government departments with suitably trained staff and proper technological facilities, with the active involvement of the shipping trade union movement."
"A real policy to protect safety at sea, human life at sea and the environment needs, first and foremost, to address the unaccountability of shipowners, apply strict measures to punish their infringements, stipulate how ships are to be crewed in keeping with their enhanced requirements, help to improve living and working conditions on board ship and ensure that the trade union movement is properly involved when decisions are taken on shipping, especially on safety issues."
"Although the proposal to amend the current Directive on ship inspections and the Watts report fall far short of what is actually required, they are a step in the right direction and the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"- (FR) First of all, I would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur and to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for the diligence they have shown and for their remarkable work on such a serious and crucial issue."
"Not only has our Parliament accelerated the legislative procedure, which was to be expected, but it has also succeeded in staying at the forefront in matters of safety by putting across principles it has recognised for a long time."
"The fact is that, on three accounts, Mark Watts has managed to reinforce the measure envisaged by the Commission:"
"Not only must ships which have been detained more than twice in the course of the preceding 24 months in a port of a Member State be barred from sailing but, in the opinion our Parliament, this should apply irrespective of the age of the vessel."
"Ships that have flown the flag of a blacklisted state for 3 consecutive years shall be barred from sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"This is aimed at dissuading states issuing these types of flags of convenience and shipowners from having recourse to this illegal practice."
"A black box shall be installed on board ship."
"A ship that does not have a black box will in future be refused access to Community ports."
"Public opinion is waiting for us to act and is impatient for our vote."
"We have not accelerated the procedure only to hold it up at the finish line through conciliation with the Council, which would be spread out over several months."
"The risks of accidents and pollution are too great, to say nothing of shipboard working conditions and the wages of the seamen."
"Let us demonstrate our drive and energy and let us vote in favour of this progressive report."
"This will be to our credit and preserve our environment, and hence give us a better quality of life."
"- (NL) If all the flag states for shipping, all the shipowning companies and all the classification societies had good will, there would be no need for port state controls."
"Unfortunately, making maximum profit is often all that matters, to the detriment of safety, the environment and the personnel."
"Human error largely results from overloading, underpayment and the fact that the sailors have not received adequate training."
"The Commission proposal looks reassuring, but is not proof against deliberate sabotage."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteurs Watts, Vachetta and Pi√©trasanta have endeavoured to close the gaps still present in the Commission proposal."
"They propose that ships which pose a risk or sail under cheap flags and those lacking voyage recorder data should be banned from EU ports, that we should counteract brass-plate companies, stop ships rinsing out their tanks in the sea, and increase the number of inspectors."
"It is significant that Mrs Vachetta has proposed that the level of manpower, the working hours, the pay levels and the training of sailors should be improved."
"I support any improvements and am disappointed that some of them will not get a majority vote behind them even now."
". (FR) I voted in favour of the Watts report, which aims to enhance the quality and frequency of inspections in the ports of the Member States of the European Union."
"The European Commission proposes to introduce a certain uniformity of inspection procedures and sets out the conditions under which access to the ports of the Member States of the European Union can be refused: these are the minimum conditions for a common policy on maritime safety."
"These provisions have the effect of strengthening safety checks on ships in our ports but do not make it possible to ban dangerous ships that do not drop anchor at one of our ports from sailing in our territorial waters."
"The limitations of these proposals are therefore clear."
"One can therefore deplore the fact that the Commission proposal has not taken up the idea of the establishment of a European surveillance body on the model of the coastguards in the United States."
"We will settle for setting up a European system of surveillance and information exchange between Member States."
"The European Parliament will have to ensure that the financial and human resources that are needed to effectively establish this rapid reaction and information exchange system are quickly made available by the Member States."
"I would point out that the European Union has some 270 inspectors charged with state port control."
"This figure falls far short of the number of inspectors needed to implement the measures we are proposing in ports."
"The rapporteur has put forward a number of proposals enhancing the binding nature and effectiveness of these inspections."
"I fully support the ban on navigation for ships which have been detained twice in the course of the preceding 2 years, irrespective of the age of the ship."
"However, I believe that this measure should be considered a minimum requirement and I hope that we will be able to go much further."
"To do so, we must be sure that the measures we are proposing today are implemented by all the Member States of the European Union."
"The responsibility for putting these measures in place rests therefore with the Member States."
"Without additional inspectors and without extra financial resources, the controls proposed in the ports will remain a fiction."
"We therefore call on the Member States to make a real commitment to maritime safety."
"Hatzidakis report (A5-0344/2000)"
"A pensioner to whom I mentioned that this document by Mr Hatzidakis was going to be discussed exclaimed, 'But couldn' t you have thought of that before?!' ."
"This really is such an obvious measure, and I see Mr Hatzidakis as the deus ex machina of this need to avoid marine pollution hazards."
"If we had thought of it before, if Mr Hatzidakis had been here before, in previous years, he would surely have proposed the double-hull design and we would have avoided so many disasters."
"I now ask Mr Hatzidakis to become the promoter of another initiative, to have double shells adopted also for the road tankers that carry oil and other harmful substances on our motorways."
". (EL) We will not achieve safety at sea or protect human life at sea and the environment unless we address the unaccountability of shipowners, introduce strict controls on the state of ships, impose heavy penalties on shipping companies in breach of safety regulations, improve working times for seamen, train them properly and ensure that ships are crewed in keeping with their enhanced requirements."
"Introducing double-hull ships may help improve safety and protect the environment, but it is not a panacea, nor is it a guarantee, on its own, of seaworthiness."
"We feel that a differential charging system for port and pilotage dues for double-hull oil tankers should not be introduced at the expense of the revenue of the port and other funds to which dues are currently channelled; on the contrary, dues for double-hull ships should be maintained at present levels and gradually increased for single-hull ships."
"Unfortunately, not only do the proposals in the report make no such provision, they also worsen the preconditions for withdrawing old ships."
"We feel that the proposal to increase the tonnage of vessels below the MARPOL limit which are exempt from the provisions of the Commission regulation from 600 to 3 000 TDW will increase the number of ships with the potential to jeopardise safety and environmental protection."
"Most of these ships are used in busy shipping areas."
"For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"- (NL) It would be better if there were no single-hull tankers any longer, but such ships were still being built up until 1996."
"The Commission is right to want to stop Europe lagging behind America."
"We must not allow single-hull tankers to carry on sailing in our waters when they are no longer present elsewhere after 2005, 2010 or 2015."
"If we do not implement the necessary measures in good time we will end up with the old, high-risk ships that have been sent for scrap in the States in our own waters."
"Double-hull tankers reduce the risk of oil pollution, but do not rule it out."
"In particular, in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in tanker and fast passenger ship traffic in the Baltic Sea off Estonia and Russia."
"The risk of ships crashing into each other is so great there that without extra supervision and inspections, shipping accidents are becoming increasingly likely."
"There is therefore every reason to tighten up the Commission proposal, just as the rapporteurs for the other reports on safety at sea that are on the agenda today have done."
"Unfortunately, rapporteur Hatzidakis has done the opposite."
"He fears a shortage of tankers and would rather wait for internationally agreed measures."
"I support the Commission proposal."
"However, the ways in which it has been toned down make it inadequate."
". (FR) To unravel the chain of responsibility, to respect shipboard social standards, to re-establish the 'polluter-pays' principle and to innovate in the field of equipment must be our top priorities."
"In this context, making the construction of double-hull vessels, especially those used to transport toxic and/or dangerous goods, more widespread as quickly as possible is a useful measure."
"Europe must not be out of step with regulations in the United States which, thanks to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, aim to phase out single-hull vessels between 2000 and 2015."
"We must at least keep pace with the United States while adopting measures not to shift the activities of the whole fleet of coffin ships towards third-world countries."
"Moreover, replacing the outdated ships is a means of giving a fresh boost to shipbuilding."
"We must envisage improving the system of double hulls."
"Many technical experts have pointed out the difficulties encountered when inspecting the space between the two hulls and during its maintenance."
"Yet Mr Hatzidakis makes proposals which restrict the scope of the Commission proposals."
"As he explained, they aim to enhance maritime safety while respecting the system of competition or, in other words, the quest for the lowest cost."
"In short, what is being proposed is to eliminate the lack of maritime safety without attacking its causes."
"This draft directive is moving in the right direction, but we must reject all exemptions and delays in implementation."
"We must stick with the Commission proposal."
"(FR) I am delighted that the European Parliament has finally been able to give its verdict on the three texts relating to maritime safety but I deplore the excessively long delay in achieving one of the priorities of the French Presidency of the European Union."
"The loss of the Erika, which occurred in December 1999, put the issue of maritime safety on the Community' s political agenda and it was due to pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission proposed the texts we voted on today, almost a year after the accident."
"It took a second maritime disaster, the wreck of the Ievoli Sun, to accelerate the first reading of these texts."
"I voted in favour of Mr Hatzidakis' s report and I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur on persevering with such a sensitive issue."
"The mandatory double hull for oil tankers and the progressive phasing out of the oldest ships are measures which go in the right direction and are a practical response to the legitimate concerns of our citizens."
"The lengthy transitional period during which single-hull vessels will still be able to sail is to be regretted, however, even though the scope of the measure is such as to justify the gradual rate of their withdrawal."
"We must pay the greatest attention to amendments to the timetable for withdrawing the oldest ships which may be proposed by the Council."
"In all eventualities, the ultimate deadline of 2015 must be respected."
"The fact is that the unilateral decision taken by the United States to ban single-hull oil tankers from calling at American ports after 2015 poses a real threat to maritime traffic passing through EU waters, where these ships are likely to ply their trade."
"It is therefore crucial that the timetable for eliminating these ships from our seas must be in line with the American timetable."
"Finally, we must not forget that the mandatory double hull for oil tankers can be but a single element in a genuine European policy of maritime safety."
"This decision is important but it does not go far enough."
"Promoting more stringent regulations at an international level must continue to be the fundamental objective of our maritime safety policy."
"Watts report (A5-0343/2000) and Hatzidakis report (A5-0344/2000)"
". The Erika and other recent oil spills form a continuing catalogue of disasters that have taken place in Community waters, including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress of Wales."
"These catastrophes in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage have devastated local industries."
"In the case of the Erika, the local fishing and aquaculture industries suffered a bitter blow and it is important not just to look at the harmful effects that are apparent in the immediate aftermath, but also to look ahead at the long-term detrimental effects of oil pollution."
"Effective compensation is essential."
"It is time that shipping safety within the Community was tightened up and that greater controls were introduced, including bringing an end to the use of flags of convenience which is also increasingly resorted to."
"The companies responsible, the ship and the cargo owners must pay up for their negligence."
"Current compensation funds have been inadequately funded and this was all too apparent in the case of the Braer disaster where the Shetland Islands fishing industry was inadequately compensated for its losses."
"Maritime disasters are usually followed by flurries of political activity which sound reassuring at the time but which have not always been followed through."
"Let us ensure that adequate measures are instigated throughout Europe and that lessons learned lead to decisive political action."
"Madam President, I have already mentioned that I have been to sea in the past."
"This measure by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, regulating inspections and control visits to ships, is extremely important, just as all inspections and controls are important."
"I remember when the inspectors of the states that had to check the ship came on board."
"They would shut themselves in a cabin with the chief purser and come out loaded with cigarettes, bottles of spirits and maybe other things too."
"Inspections are serious business!"
"I believe we should try to get European inspectors to go on board European ships, because this habit of governments and the Council of refusing inspections must come to an end, especially in this activity of cleaning up the sea and our coastlines."
". (FR) We have one maritime disaster after another, all following the same pattern."
"After the wrecks of the Erika and the Ievoli Sun, which recently affected the shorelines of France, it is time that the European Union reacted and took firm control of the classification societies which authorise coffin ships to sail."
"It is against this background that European legislation is vital."
"This report, which aims to improve the control of ships and to establish harmonised procedures and rules of inspection must therefore be supported, as it is a step forward, even though, in our opinion, the rapporteur' s approach does not go far enough."
"The fact is that, whilst he provides for the harmonisation of inspection criteria for all Member States, nothing is envisaged for ships from third countries inspected outside the European Union."
"What is there to prevent, for example, a Maltese or a Cypriot ship in poor condition from sailing close to our shorelines."
"When will the European Union finally take the decision to ban access to its territorial waters to any ship that does not comply with the rules it promulgates?"
"Will Europe, normally so swift to legislate on environmental issues, continue to ignore maritime safety because colossal financial interests are at stake and because the interests of its Members differ?"
"When will the European Union free up the human and financial resources commensurate with the task at hand so that this text does not remain a simple declaration of intent?"
"We will vote in favour of this report, which goes in the right direction, whilst at the same time deploring what it fails to do: to determine the precise liability of the polluters (inspectors, shipowners, charterers, insurers); to introduce preventative and penalty measures to fight against intensive tank cleaning, which is responsible for most marine pollution; to draw up a blacklist of coffin ships, and to refuse access to EU territorial waters to any ship posing a significant threat, irrespective of age."
"The revision of Directive 94/57/EC is becoming a matter of some urgency, especially since Malta and Cyprus, the fourth and sixth largest fleets worldwide respectively, are candidates for accession to the European Union."
"This Community action must be accompanied by the reactivation of the IMO which, endowed with genuine police power to enforce the International Safety Management Code, would be an effective instrument on a par with Interpol."
"We hope that the Council will assume its responsibilities speedily."
"The quality of our environment is at stake."
". (FR) The recent wreck of the oil tanker, Erika, and the chemical tanker, the Ievoli Sun, have revealed the importance of the role played by classification societies in maritime transport."
"And we have a legitimate reason to question the reliability and the effectiveness of the inspections they carry out."
"First of all, recognition of classification societies is devolved to Member States without any prior control or harmonisation at European level."
"What is more, the training of the inspectors of these societies differs from country to country."
"Furthermore, no guarantee is given as to the independence of classification societies vis-√†-vis the flag administration and/or the client."
"The rapporteur' s proposals aimed at harmonisation on a European scale can only be positive."
"The European Union must set aside the resources to make it possible for a recognised and competent authority to enforce standards on classification societies."
"Additional financial and human resources will be necessary."
"Classification societies will have to be monitored and, where necessary, punished by having their authorisation suspended."
"In the event of an accident, the financial liability of recognised organisations must be acknowledged and harmonised."
"In addition, the amount of the mentioned compensation must be revised upwards to take better account of the material, economic, but also social and environmental damage inflicted."
"I will support this report and the Commission' s amendments, but I call on the Members of Parliament to support the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in particular those aimed at harmonising the rules applicable to classification societies and the status of inspectors."
"- (NL) The volume of maritime transport has grown dramatically in recent decades, whilst the cost has gone down."
"Ships save on port fees by continuing to sail through stormy weather and by risking fatal accidents at other times too."
"As long as it costs less to transgress rules than it does to comply with them, companies that have maximum profits in their sights will carry on making the wrong choices."
"The flag states are still incapable of organising the inspection of seagoing ships for seaworthiness and environmental safety for themselves."
"They contract this work out to internationally operating companies that are dependent on the favours of shipping companies."
"The shipowners that register voluntarily as customers can, if desired, transfer to another bureau whose requirements are less strict."
"It is a step in the right direction that the recognition accorded classification societies can be withdrawn, that liability is to be harmonised and that classification societies will always have to transfer their data to the competitor who takes over from them."
"It would be better still if inspections were to take place biannually and if classification societies were not permitted to be dependent on one large company alone, which builds, repairs or utilises ships."
"But the best result of all would be if harmonised inspections were to become the direct responsibility of the government."
". (FR) The report by Mr Ortuondo Larrea is the final section of the package of measures on maritime safety."
"It is an important section as it relates to classification societies."
"I voted in favour of this report, which proposes the introduction of a certain uniformity amongst Member States in terms of quality and the expert capabilities of classification societies, whose recognition will henceforth be the preserve of the shared responsibility of the Member Sates and the European Commission."
"These proposals also step up the liability of classification societies by providing for financial sanctions and the suspension or withdrawal of their recognition in the event of accidents that may be attributable to them."
"The arraignment of the classification societies in the wake of the loss of the Erika in December 1999 recalls their vital role in evaluating and preventing the risks associated with the condition of ships."
"The navigable condition of a ship is the responsibility of the state whose flag the ship flies."
"I hope the involvement of the European Commission in recognising classification societies and the increased liability of the latter will make it possible to do away with flags of convenience altogether."
"From this perspective, these measures must be implemented without delay in the candidate countries, whose fleets must conform to the standards and safety criteria of the European Union."
"The problem of classification societies goes far beyond the borders of the European Union."
"The European Commission must therefore free up the resources to monitor the enforcement of the new measures by Member States and candidate countries alike."
"Finally, our common policy on maritime safety must be an international role model and the obligations we place on our ships must be extended to third-country fleets."
"Maritime safety must not simply be an issue arising out of a state of urgency in the wake of each new disaster that hits our shorelines, but the object of an internationally integrated and constant policy."
"Preparation for the Nice European Council"
"Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not endorse the European Parliament resolution on the preparation for the 2000 Nice European Council, since it is inspired totally by the desire to strengthen supranational institutions by applying uniform rules to all Member States."
"In particular, we reject calls for a European constitution, at least if it entails the subordination of national constitutions."
"We reject the idea of a restrictive Charter of Fundamental Rights being integrated into the Treaties, since it would trigger a formidable spiral of standardisation."
"We reject the general extension of qualified majority voting accompanied by the simultaneous extension of codecision and the abolition of the Luxembourg compromise."
"If the Nice Council did not reach an agreement on this basis, it would not in our view be a failure, as the federalists claimed yesterday in their attacks on the French Presidency and Mr V√©drine."
"Rather, it would be a great success, as the Europe we need on the eve of enlargement is not a supranational Europe which is inflexible, hierarchical and remote, but a Europe which is flexible and close to its people, therefore founded in respect for national democracies."
"As far as the current Nice agenda is concerned, we believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should remain a simple declaration, that the Commission should be composed of one Commissioner for each Member State, that the weighting of votes in the Council should respect the parity of the large States, that majority voting should not be extended to the most important issues, such as immigration, international negotiations on services, taxation and social security and, finally, that specific acts of cooperation should be accepted very liberally, including outside the single institutional framework."
"More generally, we believe that, after Nice, further negotiations should be entered into, this time in the right direction, to make the institutions more flexible and to re-establish control by the people, by turning Europe, not into a super state, but into a network of national democracies."
"Unlike Mr Berthu, Madam President, the Pensioners' Party, which I have the honour and pleasure to represent in the European Parliament, and I favour a closer link between the States that make up the European Union."
"Indeed, I believe that this Parliament in which we sit should be more courageous and act as in the times of the French Revolution: we should turn ourselves into a constituent assembly and one day we should meet in the Salle du Jeu de Paume, and you, Madam President, should be our Robespierre."
"Of course, you would become a heroine rather than a hero, and anyway we naturally would not wish the same fate on you as Robespierre met."
"What I mean is that the European Union should become a true union of states, with a parliament placed at the centre of lawmaking."
"Madam President, whether the European institutions are modified at the Nice European Council or whether rivalries between national ruling circles thwart all attempts at institutional reform, the European Union will continue to be exclusively concerned with the interests of the dominant economic class, with large industrial and financial groups, with their business and their profits."
"Notwithstanding a few phrases, as pompous as they are empty, on democracy and on the interests of the people, the debate which is under way within these institutions bears no relation whatsoever to the interests of the working classes and the majority of the population."
"We will certainly not be taking part in the bickering between the mouthpieces of the three or four major powers competing for domination of the European Union."
"It is of little consequence to us whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union or not, because, in any case, this Charter, allegedly a Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only refuses to include the elementary rights of workers, it actually clears the way for retrograde social measures."
"Instead of raising human and social rights to a higher level, the Charter will make it easier to bring them down."
"As a result, while abstaining on the details, we have voted against the whole."
"- (SV) We are voting in favour of the resolution, but we wish to comment on the following points:"
"We take a positive position as regards increasing the use of qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers."
"However, we consider that this method of decision making must not include issues that fall under the second pillar."
"Where qualified majority voting is used we feel that this must be combined with power of codecision for Parliament."
"We wish to lend our support to a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6.2 of the Treaty."
"However, in the present situation we are against incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty and constitutionalisation of the Treaty."
"Within foreign and security policy we take a positive view of the fact that crisis management has been given a prominent position."
"Provided that the institutions of the EU are given control over the nature of the closer cooperation we would also give this our support."
"- (NL) It does not bode well for a successful conclusion to the Nice Summit."
"There is no satisfactory agreement in the offing yet."
"The increasingly open struggle for power between many Member States is clouding the view in terms of possible compromises."
"Quite a number of Member States, particularly the large ones, seem only to be interested in consolidating their own position of power in the future."
"The lion' s share of the tabled resolutions show that Parliament too has fallen prey to the temptation to regard the Nice Summit as largely successful because its own authority has been extended."
"I have no time for this attitude."
"An ambition for power alone is not enough to prepare the European Union for the future."
"The very first thing that is needed if we are to have a European Union in which the various nationalities can live peacefully together, is for the governments to seek a sustainable balance, in mutual respect and empathy."
"The institutions of the European Union must be in a position to fulfil their tasks without having to step into the shoes of the Member States."
"Now, and in the future too, each country must be able to truly show itself to best advantage in a Union based on justice."
"I believe that is a crucial criterion by which to judge the Treaty of Nice."
"Unfortunately though, I do not see any evidence of this notion in the motions for resolutions."
"I am anticipating complete justice in the future realm of the Lord Jesus."
"That must not stop us, the people of the European Union, from seeking this justice in the here and now, here on earth."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution concerning preparation for the European Council' s meeting between 7 and 9 December in Nice where, among other things, the current Intergovernmental Conference is to be concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Nice."
"As we have also made known through the individual votes, we have, throughout the Intergovernmental Conference, been opposed to the much expanded agenda which, by means of repeated motions for resolutions, the majority in the European Parliament has been trying to draw up."
"Many of the motions for resolutions tabled by the different political groups are therefore also based upon a deep concern about how much success there will be in achieving the goal in Nice, which is to make the EU ready for admitting the new Member States of the EU."
"The most important task in Nice is to ensure that the EU has effective institutions."
"As a prerequisite, the solution should involve striking a balance between small and large countries, not only where the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers is concerned, but also when it comes to the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission."
"These two institutions contribute very significantly to the EU' s continuing to concentrate its efforts on the common objectives and cross-border tasks, while the rest is left to the Member States."
"Enlargement is a major project requiring backing not only in the applicant States but also in those countries which are already Members."
"Many Members of the European Parliament have ambitions to see the Treaties made into a constitution, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights included and qualified majority voting used in all areas."
"To keep harping on about these aims, for which there is, in any case, no broad support to be won, during the current Intergovernmental Conference is unwise in our view and will contribute to Parliament' s losing influence."
"We have also emphasised this during the individual votes today."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole because we wish to put pressure on the Heads of State and Government to achieve a good outcome in Nice."
". (FR) On the eve of the Nice Summit and without prejudging the outcome, I want to salute the tremendous work carried out by the French Presidency and the majority of ministers who generously put in the time and effort to address Parliament on a regular basis both in committee and in parliament."
"While, like many others, I have at times during this semester regretted that we have heard so little from Prime Minister Jospin himself due to reasons of 'cohabitation' , I am aware of the strong impetus he has always given to his ministers and I should like to state as much."
"I especially want to thank Hubert V√©drine and Pierre Moscovici, as well as Martine Aubry, who instigated the social calendar, one of the highlights of this presidency."
"It now remains to make a success of the Nice Summit and, as regards institutional reform, to persuade each of you to make the final concessions needed to achieve 'a good agreement' and a good Treaty."
"It is also important, of course, that we succeed in providing a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty itself so as to give it greater legal force."
"The importance of the Social Agenda must also be highlighted so that it can be implemented speedily."
"A draft Directive on public services, whose urgency is no longer contested, must at last be set in motion."
"Just one week away from the Nice Summit I personally have high hopes."
"My voting in favour of the resolution, even though I do not agree with the wording in all cases, is an expression of these hopes."
". (SV) In its resolution, the European Parliament, as usual, recommends increased power of codecision for itself."
"It would be good if the European Parliament showed just as much enthusiasm for discussing how to go about increasing participation in parliamentary elections to the European Parliament."
"In the 1999 election, the participation rate would have been below 40 per cent on average had some Member States not had compulsory voting and had national elections not taken place at the same time as this election."
"The enthusiasm that the European Parliament shows for increased power of codecision in the EU is not something that has a strong foundation amongst the electorate."
"The democratic debate in Europe today is based on the national parliamentary elections in each Member State."
"To create a more democratic EU the national parliaments must be given greater influence in the work of the EU."
". (PT) The debate and the resolution adopted by Parliament give serious cause for concern as to what will be decided at the Nice Summit, specifically as regards the potential increase in restrictions on the sovereignty of small countries such as Portugal, the strengthening of federalism and the militaristic path in security and defence policy, and the weak and clearly inadequate measures in the social sphere."
"With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and the subsequent reform of the European institutions, it is particularly serious that moves are being made towards strengthening the power of a small number of large countries to the detriment of the decision-making ability of the great majority of small and medium-sized countries. This may happen with the extension of qualified majority voting, instances of closer cooperation situated within a hard-core concept, the application of closer cooperation to areas like security and defence policy, the prospect of moving towards a European Constitution based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which itself has a content that is restrictive and in several aspects retrograde compared with similar international or national documents, the latter applying to the case of Portugal."
"In the social sphere, the proposals are too timid and do not even effectively flesh out the commitments adopted at the Lisbon Summit, particularly as regards the need for strengthening economic and social cohesion."
"The Council must, therefore, re-examine its positions and move to oppose the wave of company mergers and concentrations in various sectors, interrupt the current liberalising processes, and change macroeconomic policies with the aim of fighting for quality employment with proper rights and against poverty and social exclusion."
". As a Member of Parliament representing Ireland I am deeply disappointed with the wording of the resolution which has just been adopted by this House on the 2000 Nice European Council."
"The reform of the European Union Treaties must take account of the needs and interests of smaller Member States."
"Failure to do so would upset the delicate balance that is the very basis of the proper functioning of the Union."
"I would like, in particular, to highlight a number of elements that I believe could hold inherent danger for the future stability of the Union as well as raising questions as to the democratic legitimacy of the decision-making process."
"As far as the general extension of qualified majority voting is concerned, I do not believe that this is a helpful proposal as it would pre-empt the right of Member States to take a decision at the appropriate time on whether a policy should be communitised."
"I firmly believe that any change from unanimity to QMV should be considered on a case-by-case basis."
"Neither am I in favour of an automatic linking between QMV and codecision and once again believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should also be made on a case-by-case basis."
"I am already on record as being absolutely opposed to bringing the common agricultural policy into the codecision sphere and will not further elaborate on that issue at this point."
"In so far as the Charter of Fundamental Rights is concerned, while I am in favour of promoting the rights referred to in this document, I do not support its incorporation into the eventual Treaty of Nice."
"An alternative solution such as EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights merits much closer examination."
"Whatever is finally agreed at Nice by the 15 Member State governments may well have to be ratified by the Irish people through a referendum."
"I can assure you that the current negotiations are being followed in my country, as I am sure they are in all of your countries."
"We must tread carefully and not run ahead of public opinion or of what our populations are ready for."
"European integration for Ireland has been a very positive experience and I believe that one of the keys to this has been the gradual approach."
"In order for Treaty reform, and indeed enlargement, to be a success it must have the full support of the people."
"In this sense, no decision about the development of the EU should be taken which risks alienating the citizens of Europe."
"After all, any democratic system is built upon the trust and confidence of the people."
"If the Union loses public support then it loses its very legitimacy."
"- (FR) The French Presidency announced the birth of a political Europe yet the Nice Summit will simply reinforce a Europe of defence and a commercial union."
"The EU, within the framework of NATO, will take part in imposing a new world order which has little sympathy for the fate of the Palestinians and which is preparing to effectively endorse the liberalisation of rail transport and postal services."
"The accession of new countries is a pretext for emphasising a European structure which is satisfactory only to industrial groups."
"All the advocates of a liberal Europe are enlarging is the scale of misery of peoples already crushed by poverty and not only that but, on this occasion, they are imposing a political agenda which involves placing on an official footing a core of rich countries which will control an expanded European market."
"By the same token, the EU is taking the initiative on the new liberal demands of the WTO and capitalist globalisation."
"By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend the qualified majority voting currently in force in the Council in trade matters to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health and education."
"Finally, the adoption of a Social Agenda is a decoy."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights will not even be a new, short-lived label, but instead one more liberal standard threatening to be raised over Europe."
"For our part, we shall be participating in the alternative social summit together with all those who refuse to turn the world into a commodity."
". The votes of Conservative MEPs today reflect our view that Britain should be in a Europe that does less and does it better, not run by a Europe that does more, worse."
"There were two types of EU reform on offer to MEPs today."
"A Conservative response to the White Paper on Commission Reform would enable the EU to do less and to do it better."
"The resolution on the Nice Summit is the blueprint for the EU to do more, worse."
"The reforms proposed by Malcolm Harbour MEP on the White Paper are common sense reforms."
"British people want reform of the EU to make it more accountable and more efficient."
"Conservatives in the European Parliament have consistently argued for these reforms."
"On the other hand, the so-called reforms proposed by the Nice Summit resolution make little sense to anyone in the world beyond Brussels."
"They will make the EU more complicated and further removed from ordinary people."
"They do nothing to help enlargement, such as overhauling the CAP."
"This is the agenda Labour and the Lib Dems support."
". (PT) Parliament has just voted for a resolution on the Nice Summit in which:"
"1 - It does not deal clearly or in depth with any of the issues in which there were major divergences among the Member States in the work leading up to the IGC, leaving all the main Amsterdam left-overs without any prospects even now."
"Thus Parliament waives its right to influence, shuts its mouth and remains silent for the sake of party, State and government loyalties, forgetting its obligations to the people."
"2 - Despite everything, it ensures an advantage - not as tiny as it might seem - for the less populous States, which can always take advantage of Parliament' s silence at the choices of those States that seek to strengthen their institutional power in all the Community bodies."
"From this standpoint, the large States are blocked by the rest and cannot drag Parliament into supporting their views, using it against us in the future architecture of the institutions."
"3 - It demonstrates that the united efforts of the small countries' delegations have succeeded in drawing a political trump card from the others in next week' s debates in Nice."
"Although we have not won, we have achieved a result in this resolution, which does not leave us defeated on the battlefield."
"Sometimes silence is a victory..."
"4 - This explains why, as silence is not innocent, it can justify a vote in favour."
". (FR) I had no hesitation in voting against the joint resolution on the Nice European Council."
"The voters I represent have no sympathy with any of its policy directions."
"This text uses the future (and ever more distant) enlargement of the European Union as a pretext to call for the reinforcement of a system which has already run out of steam."
"As if that were the only solution!"
"As if on our continent no other form of organisation were possible except the integrationist model, originally designed, need I remind you, for a hard core of five or six countries."
"Why seek to find a solution to the squaring of the circle represented by the enlargement of the European Union and the representation of States and peoples in a system which is already saturated, when a different model, that of a Europe of Nations, would provide simple and effective solutions?"
"Why deny, furthermore, that the democratic alibi of this integrated Europe is nothing but a false nose?"
"An enlarged integrationist Europe is not by nature democratic: in fact it violates one of the most basic of human rights, the right to nationhood."
"Need we remind ourselves that democracy does not boil down to having a vote?"
"Democracy presupposes dialogue, which in turn presupposes a shared feeling of community, which is often linked to language."
"Our debates within this Chamber increasingly resemble a series of monologues than real exchanges."
"Compare them to the vivacity, energy and pertinence of the debates in national parliaments: the members of parliament in the Palais Bourbon, Westminster, the Cortes are able to compare ideas because they are expressed within the same cultural framework and in the same language."
"I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice."
"This is an ambiguous and contradictory text, open to all sorts of interpretations."
"It is impossible to claim, as some do, that this text is inoffensive."
"In the hands of the European Court of Justice - 'one jurisdiction and one mission' as one of its judges said some years ago - the Charter may become the most undemocratic instrument to which European integration has given birth."
"The Convention which was given the task of drawing it up foreshadows this: the sanctioning of the dominant role of influential groups and activist agencies in the construction of a federal Europe in the pipeline."
"It is a body which, by its very nature, can find only a minimum consensus on the rights to which the people of Europe are already entitled."
"It is a body which has produced a text which will not fail to create a conflict of judicial doctrine between the Court of Justice and the Court of Human Rights."
". (FR) One last time before the Nice European Council, the European Parliament has had the opportunity to express its opinion on the major themes of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs prepared a draft resolution outlining the expectations of the European Parliament."
"While I may agree with the broad thrust of this resolution, ""to make the European Union more democratic, more effective and closer to its citizens"" , I am nevertheless unable to take on board a certain number of proposals which seem to me to be rather vague."
"I therefore prefer to abstain."
"On the crucial issue of the institutions, however, the proposal of a satisfactory all-round formula is to its credit."
"The explicit affirmation of the principle of the double legitimacy of the European Union, that of the peoples and that of the Member States, is, in this respect, essential."
"It will make it possible for negotiators from the least populous Member States to defend, in Nice, the principle of adequate representation in all the institutions, including the European Parliament."
"It is becoming ever more apparent that opening the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in the European Parliament), one might go so far as to say on the balance of power between the Member States, has opened a Pandora' s box which will be very difficult to close in Nice."
"Now, there are squabbles not only between the 'larger' and the 'smaller' but among the 'larger' too."
"It would be a good idea for the European Council to decide, from the outset, to base all its institutional decisions on the principle of double legitimacy, which has proved itself from the very inception of the Community."
". (SV) I welcome the aim to ease the enlargement process at the Conference of the European Council in Nice."
"However, the common resolution contains a number of formulations that I cannot support."
"I am against the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a council of defence ministers."
"I cannot support qualified majority voting within trade policy, nor do I support the decision on qualified majority voting under the second pillar, that is to say within foreign, security and defence policy."
"It is a mistake to divide the union up into an A-team and a B-team, and I therefore cannot support a third of the Member States being given precedence."
"Similarly, it is a mistake to incorporate the Charter into the Treaty."
"Brok report (A5-0340/2000)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we deplored the Brok report and the report by Mrs Lalumi√®re, not only because of what they contain but also because of their subject matter, the common foreign and security policy."
"We have always believed it was unrealistic, and it has proved to be so in the eight years since it was adopted by the Maastricht Treaty."
"Ironically, and just for the record, I should mention Article J2, the third paragraph of Title 5 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states: ""Member States shall ensure that their national policies conform on the common positions"" ."
"This article has not been respected once; nor indeed have the other articles in Title 5."
"On the contrary, it has been consistently flouted, the last example to date being London' s recognition of North Korea."
"The President-in-Office of the European Union deplored this breach, which, and I quote him, he described as ""exceptional"" , and then, three days later Berlin followed suit without even taking the trouble, it seems, to inform the French Presidency."
"We are a laughing stock and, basically, that is just one more disappointment for the poor old construction of Europe or, rather, the deconstruction of Europe."
"I am thinking, for example, of the reform of our institutions, which was promised for 1995, then 1997, and which still seems to be in the doldrums just a few days away from the Nice Summit."
"This will be just one more disappointment to add to our vagaries on enlargement, which itself has been promised for ten years, to say nothing of the successive and, I might add, cumulative collapses of the euro."
"But these are just examples."
"I could go on and talk about the reduction in appropriations for the MEDA programme or the European Development Fund."
"There is just one thing to be retained from these reports and, if only for that, we would have to oppose it."
"That is the almost ritual reference to NATO since, basically, the only thing that Mr Brok has managed to put in the 1999 annual report is the Kosovo affair."
"It has to be said that, this time, the Europeans have found an arbiter in Washington and that, thanks to the rearguard of American generals, Europe has finally found a certain unity."
"This is laughable, I repeat, and when historians write the history of Europe in the twentieth century, I think they will mention neither the common foreign and security policy nor the League of Nations, and perhaps that is just as well."
"Madam President, with regard to the Brok report, which I have willingly voted in favour of, I should like to mention the observations that an old pensioner - he is called Maurizio Enfissi, from the town of Capriate San Gervasio in the province of Bergamo - made to me when I told him that Europe was beginning to think about its own security and its own defence."
"'Good for you!' he said."
"'I fought in the last war and I did not like it at all."
"So if you succeed in avoiding wars, as you have done so far, you will be doing the most important thing that has ever been done in the world.'"
"And then he added, 'When I was in the war, I missed several years of work towards my pension."
"And the war pension I am paid is so, so little..."
"But are these wars really necessary?!' ."
". (SV) We welcome and support the report, which touches on many important trends in the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"However, we cannot support the tasks performed by the High Representative being transferred to the Commission."
"Nor can we support the conversion of the Community' s delegations into EU embassies."
"The Member States have responsibility for foreign diplomacy."
"We feel that the conversion of the Commission' s delegations into Community delegations risks leading to conflicts of interest with the national diplomatic delegations of the Member States."
"- (NL) Earlier this year I heard Mr Solana saying enthusiastically that there are many areas outside the territory of the European Union where action can be taken."
"His new role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria."
"After 1945, defence was taken to mean the defence of one' s own territory against foreign attackers."
"So a country' s defensive army did not have any tasks beyond the territory of the state that had established it."
"NATO abided by this formula during the first 50 years of its existence."
"The United States army moved into Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and Grenada, whilst France and England tried to gain control of the Suez Canal, but countries did not take action as part of NATO outside their own territory."
"That did not happen until the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact - which for years had justified the existence of NATO - had collapsed."
"My party, the Socialist Party of the Netherlands, rejects any attempt on the part of the European Union to imitate the superpower America."
"I cannot go along with the aims Mr Brok hopes to achieve via his report."
". (FR) The 'Other Europe' delegation of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group resolutely voted against the own-initiative report which was drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and presented by Mr Brok."
"As every year, this ritual report prepared by the European Parliament, which is in principle devoted to the annual general budget of the CFSP, employs the well-known method of gradual shifts which work on a federalist crevice found in a given area in order to extend this breach with scant regard for the Treaties or the decisions of the European Councils."
"In this case, it is the area of the Helsinki Council and common foreign policy, a field in which the rapporteur sets himself three main objectives."
"We have no alternative but to reject these objectives, which are as follows: to reduce European action in the world to that of the European Union as sole actor; to establish a European Ministry of Foreign Affairs intended to absorb the functions of national ministries and, finally, to get rid of the structure of the European Union in terms of pillars by widening the Community method, in particular by placing the High Representative under the responsibility of the Commission."
"This action plan, which deals with the structures, leaves out just one albeit decisive element, the definition and content, at an earlier stage, of a European foreign policy."
"The truth is that, far removed from the virtual visions which hold sway within this Parliament, diplomatic realities are entirely different and the CFSP hardly exists."
"Glaring proof of this has just been adduced, as if this were necessary, by the recognition of the Republic of North Korea by the United Kingdom and Germany, without waiting for a common position to be adopted."
"Hence, it is clear that the way to strengthen the weight of European diplomatic action is to seek the harmonisation - where desirable, opportune and effective - of decisions which remain fundamentally the prerogative of the national actor, not through structural constraints which are totally ineffectual."
"That is why our group once again voted against the absurd proposals to communitise national diplomatic services included in Articles 74 and 75 of the resolution, to turn European Union delegations into actual European embassies, and to establish a European diplomatic academy."
"The mind boggles at the proposal to put the entire diplomatic staff of Europe of an estimated 40 000 perfectly real people at the service of a virtual foreign policy."
"This proposal is both specific and surreal!"
". There is much that the British Conservative group can support in this report, in particular the emphasis on enlargement of the Union."
"However there are a number of specific elements which we cannot support, for example:"
"that the Commission should assume the responsibility for security policy and defence by taking over the role of the High Representative for CFSP (Paragraphs 65,66,68)"
"that Commission delegations should take on the role of ""EU embassies"" and coordinate the work of Member State embassies (Paragraph 74)"
"the support for an autonomous security and defence policy outside of NATO (Paragraphs 11-15)"
"the suggestion of EU military adventures in Asia (Paragraph 38)"
"Lalumi√®re report (A5-0339/2000)"
"Madam President, I was in Rome last week."
"I have a nephew, my sister' s son, who has been at the NATO bases in the United States learning to fly fighter planes, and he has been promoted, so he is ready to be an air-force pilot."
"While chatting to me he learnt that a military force of the States of Europe is being organised, a force ready to intervene to keep the peace in and around Europe."
"'Oh, I' d like to be part of that!' he told me."
"But it is not because of that that I mention him, of course - if he is good, he will go far - but because we then carried on talking and he added, 'But this idea of a European army and a European police force is quite right!"
"Why do we need standing armies to defend the borders between Italy, France, Germany and Spain, which do not exist any more?"
"Joining forces is a positive step.' ."
"- (DA) The Liberals' five Members of the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Lalumi√®re' s report on the common security and defence policy, because we are in favour of strengthening the EU countries' power to act and, therefore, NATO too."
"The criterion of success for this new form of cooperation must be that both the EU and NATO are strengthened by it."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have supported the report on setting up a common European security and defence policy."
"There are nonetheless a number of features of the report about which we have reservations."
"First of all, it is important to state that, because of its reservation in the military sphere, Denmark cannot contribute forces to the common European rapid reaction force."
"Secondly, we are sceptical about the ideas for establishing a proper European space policy, if the intention behind this is for Europe to have a defence system such as that which the United States is in the process of establishing."
"From a research point of view and in relation to the monitoring of the environment, a common European space programme may nonetheless have some advantages."
"Thirdly, there are a number of points in the report which leave one wishing that the European Parliament had more influence in devising a common European security and defence policy."
"We think it is very important to state that formulating security and defence policy is an intergovernmental concern in which the European Parliament neither can nor should be involved."
"Further institutionalisation of security and defence policy in the EU is therefore a development that we cannot support."
"It is up to each individual Member State to decide to what extent it wants to participate in a common European security and defence policy."
"Nor, furthermore, is it a task for the European Parliament to define what capacity a European rapid reaction force should possess and whether or not it should, for example, include a capacity for intervention by air and sea."
"Parliament' s desire for all Member States to contribute financially to the European rapid reaction force, even if they are not involved in operations, is in our view inappropriate since it could mean, for example, that some countries are involved in a conflict they do not wish to take part in."
"In connection with this, it is also important to emphasise that those Member States that are neutral must not in any way be compromised."
"Their desire to remain neutral must be respected in every way."
". (FR) We have naturally voted against this report."
"Under cover of establishing and developing a so-called European security and defence policy, it glaringly exposes the need for a military policy in the service of what it calls 'the foreign policy objectives of the European Union' , in other words, the interests of the imperialist powers and major capitalist groups which dominate Europe and which dictate European Union policy."
"We protest against this imperialist military policy all the more given that a declared consensus on the issue holds sway in this Chamber, with acceptance of and open support for this policy on the part of the vast majority of groups, from the extreme right to the Greens and the Socialists."
"The truth is that this policy is directed against ordinary people, like all those who, as we saw recently in the Balkans, have to endure the imperialist military interventions by the European Union and its allies."
"It is also, however, directed against the people of the European Union who will, in any event, have to finance the new expenditure on armaments which the report advocates and who will not even have a guarantee that these military forces will not one day be turned against themselves for the sake of 'maintaining law and order' ."
". (IT) Europe must become a political Union too, and not just an economic one."
"For this reason the Italian Communists offer and propose very fast enlargement to the candidate countries in order to build a great Europe based on its cultures and its best democratic traditions."
"In this context, once all opposition between the countries of Western Europe and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been left behind, the military organisation of NATO will also be left behind - in fact it will then be completely anachronistic - in favour of a European military force wholly independent of the United States, with which Europe must maintain close, friendly, but no longer subordinate relations."
"The European military force should be totally European, democratically controlled by parliamentary resolutions, effective and efficient."
"If such a military force had existed, through the history and traditions of the peoples that compose it, NATO' s war against Yugoslavia would not have happened."
"That is why we voted for the Lalumi√®re report, but with many reservations and objections concerning the aggressive tone found in some parts of the resolution which, in any case, we shall fight to avoid."
". (SV) We have voted against the report by Mrs Lalumi√®re for reasons that include the following:"
"1."
"We do not consider that there is any real threat to Europe at present; rather, it is now high time for an active disarmament policy and civil development."
"We are convinced that a Europe of Peace will not be created through military alliances."
"Future conflicts will not be solved through military intervention but rather via a policy for social, economic and ecological justice."
"Our peace policy analysis is based on the conflict theory that militarisation does not create a more secure and more peaceful world, but rather contributes to growing uncertainty and increased risk of military conflict."
"We feel that civil crisis management is a valuable instrument for preventing conflicts, something which we must unfortunately state has not been given sufficient attention in the report."
"3. We feel that military initiatives within the common security and defence policy must only be implemented following and in accordance with resolutions by the UN Security Council, a view that the rapporteur does not seem to share."
"4. The report is based on an intervention philosophy that we do not share."
"We consider that international law and the sovereignty of the national States must be respected and must be the guiding principle of international policy."
"There is talk of the EU' s common interests and values as grounds for military armament."
"We do not consider that there is reason for militarisation on the basis of these values, which are not defined, and we would question what they mean."
"5. Mrs Lalumi√®re clearly points out that it is probable that in the future within the EU we will be forced to defend all the boundaries of EU Member States from third countries."
"This is not compatible with the freedom from alliances of certain Member States."
"6. Furthermore, freedom from alliances is not taken up at all in the report and in the explanatory statement section of the report we sense a lack of respect towards States that are neutral."
"In Paragraph 49, Member States who do not wish to or cannot participate in a task are nonetheless obliged to make a contribution to the financing of the task."
"This is not compatible with freedom from alliances."
"7. We consider the idea of a large-scale defence force to be an insult to the candidate countries that already have stretched economies and that need to invest money in, say, social welfare rather than military armament."
". (PT) This is a particularly serious report and in adopting it Parliament gives its support to a greater militarisation of the European Union, with a view to establishing a 50 - 60 000 strong Rapid Reaction Force by 2003 to be mobilised within 60 days and deployable for a year with the necessary air and maritime support."
"It emphasises the development of the European Union' s military assets and capabilities and the Member States' effort to close the gaps that currently exist in this field, as they have just done in the fields of strategic air transport, cruise missiles and reconnaissance and navigation satellites."
"Equally serious is the intention that any State that does not wish to take part in a mission should be required to pay a financial contribution to be divided up among the States participating in that war."
"Another point deserving our disapproval is the satisfaction with the framework agreement signed in Farnborough by six countries of the European Union, since this will facilitate the restructuring of the defence industries in Europe and emphasise a space policy covering the civilian and military aspects of the use of space and combining the European Union national and multinational resources the holds in the military field."
"Lastly, it should be noted that in Nice, as the report states, the definitive CESDP bodies - Military Committee and Military Staff - may be set up with responsibilities and decision-making powers enabling swifter progress to be made towards the implementation of the common security and defence policy."
"We can therefore only vote against this report."
". FR) In deciding to create the nucleus of a European army, the Nice Summit will reaffirm the creation of Europe as a major power which will 'defend its interests throughout the world' ."
"In this way, Europe is exposing its imperialist character, with the protection of its investments abroad, the penetration of its goods, access to raw materials and the exploitation of cheap labour."
"It will act in concert with the United States within NATO."
"But this European army will primarily serve to stabilise the immediate periphery of the European Union."
"The commercial annexation of the East and of North Africa can but exacerbate social inequalities, which in turn will lead to social explosions, local armed conflicts and massive displacements of populations."
"In the future, by coordinating its diplomatic and military forces, the European Union will try to optimise what its Member States did individually all through the last century, and all in the name of 'maintaining' peace and 'humanitarian operations' ."
"We do not need euro-militarism."
"We are radically opposed to this European army as we are to NATO and to our own national army."
"The creation of a European military industry (EADS, Dassault, BAE) capable of checkmating the United States would in the first instance result in a dramatic increase in the military budget and a transfer of scientific and technological research to the military sector."
"Workers have nothing to gain and everything to lose from this 'new' imperial design of the European Union."
"- (NL) In my explanation of vote for the Brok report, I stated that I do not regard action taken by EU Member State armed forces outside their own territory as a contribution to defence or security."
"The 50-year anniversary of NATO was marked by the first NATO war."
"This war enabled Milosevic to continue ruling Serbia and Montenegro a year longer because it gave him the opportunity to set himself up as the Serbs' best guarantee against foreign aggression."
"The rapporteur now cites a number of reasons for taking action outside one' s own territory, one being justifiable outrage at ethnic conflicts outside the Union."
"It is positive that we are dealing with this by using mediation techniques, producing models for administrative solutions and delivering humanitarian aid to those who have felt constrained to move as a result of this conflict."
"It is no good trying to impose a solution from outside using military methods, because it does not tackle the root cause of the conflict or change public opinion."
"The fear that energy supplies will not be made available for the Member States could never be a valid reason for unilateral intervention."
". (SV) I have voted against the report."
"From among several points of which I am critical in the report I wish to mention the following examples:"
"Paragraph 49: ""Calls at all events for any Member State not wishing to take part in a task to be required, by reason of the mutual solidarity linking the Member States, to make a financial contribution to be divided between the participating States"" ."
"Paragraph 50: ""Considers that Petersberg tasks should in the long term be funded from the general budget of the European Communities, which would require a revision of Article 28 of the TEU and of the Financial Perspective"" ."
"I consider that these two points are so far-reaching that it is difficult to maintain the right of alliance-free States such as Sweden to independent decision making within defence policy and the right to non-involvement in armed conflict."
"The wording in the report is thus too far-reaching and consequently reason enough to vote against the report as a whole."
". (SV) I value the attempt to develop a common European security policy, but I am against the development of a common military defence force."
"For example, the wording is far too far-reaching in respect of CESDP and NATO, in respect of the use of ""threats of the use of force"" as a means of applying pressure in conflict prevention activities, which directly contravenes the UN Charter."
"The same applies to the wording concerning improving the EU' s capacity to penetrate enemy air defences and naval intervention, as well as the wording concerning closer cooperation in respect of collective defence guarantees."
"I therefore cannot support the report."
"- (SV) I support the holistic orientation of the report, but would like to stress that my opinion differs as regards Paragraph 49."
"Here it is requested that States that do not wish to participate in a task shall be ordered to make a financial contribution to be divided between the participating States by reason of the mutual solidarity linking the Member States."
"In my opinion such a requirement is too far-reaching."
"Brok report (A5-0340/2000) and Lalumi√®re report (A5-0339/2000)"
"- (DA) We have voted against the Brok and Lalumi√®re reports for a number of reasons."
"We do not consider that an arms build-up, with the resultant increased military expenditure, is the answer to the challenges faced by Europe in 2001 and beyond."
"Now, in the decade following the upheavals in the East, we think that, with these reports, 'the European peace project' is sending an unhelpful signal to the applicant States."
"Secondly, the reports set the stage for a split with the non-aligned countries which, it is proposed, would be involved through their financing of the common European security and defence policy."
"The talk about being 'united in diversity' rings hollow, especially for the non-aligned Member States, if only parts of the content of the reports are put into practice."
"The introduction of a new form of territorial defence, which would come under the aegis of a Vice-President of the Commission it has also been proposed, is a point that we cannot support either."
"A break of that kind with NATO, only to see a new partitioning of Europe, is far from the enigmatic words spoken following the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"What we definitely do not need is the development of further military structures."
"However, it would be to the EU' s credit if the priorities of the Petersberg tasks were turned around and the focus placed upon model solutions of a civil and humanitarian nature."
"Theorin report (A5-0308/2000)"
"I voted in favour of this measure, Madam President, because it is only right that any attempt to bring peace to regions where internecine strife and civil conflicts rage should be supported by the Pensioners' Party."
"I must, however, make one point to Mrs Theorin: among the numerous proposals she presented for women to be able to influence peace in war zones, she forgot to propose that the top echelons of armies should also be filled with women."
"Madam President, if you are clever and capable enough to direct this quarrelsome European Parliament, you would surely also be able to direct the military forces deployed to bring peace to war zones: you could thus make your contribution in support of women' s beneficial influence on peace."
"- (DE) It is an acceptable idea, in principle, that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should produce an own-initiative report concerning the participation of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts."
"But the end product is actually tantamount to fraudulent misrepresentation, because very little of what has been set down in the nine and a half pages of this motion for a resolution actually relates to the subject of the report."
"We have 18 references to documents, declarations, conventions, resolutions of the UN General Assembly and Security Council and action plans which are hundreds of pages long, the scope of which is beyond the grasp of most of us."
"We have 19 recitals and 23 numbered paragraphs with 36 subparagraphs."
"A mere six of these paragraphs contain statements relating to the title of the report."
"The rest is packed with remarks about rape, the sexual misdemeanours of European soldiers on peacekeeping missions - the Serb troops are not mentioned - the positioning and lighting of latrines in refugee camps, demands relating to asylum and immigration policy, abortion, adoption, statistical analyses differentiated by sex, the creation of ministries for women's affairs in the Member States and much more besides."
"A teacher marking such a piece of work would write ""Does not answer the question""."
"I cannot support this kind of hotchpotch, which simply hijacks the subject to use it as a vehicle for ramming ideological demands on the aforementioned topics down our throats."
"Let me pre-empt any misinterpretation of my vote as an expression of opposition to women's participation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts."
"I am not opposed to it - on the contrary!"
"."
"I support this report from my colleague Maj-Britt Theorin."
"As she points out, sexual violence and mass rapes of women are used systematically during conflicts as weapons of war."
"I back her calls to the Member States to take all necessary steps to amend Article 75 of the Fourth Geneva Protocol to define rape, forced impregnation and sexual slavery as war crimes;"
"I also support her call for the ratification of the Treaty of Rome on the International Criminal Court."
"The rapporteur also deserves support for her calls on the Commission and the Member States to take account of gender differences in the organisation of EU-funded refugee camps and in their asylum and immigration policy, by for example, granting asylum to women who have been raped during an armed conflict."
". (SV) We would like to express our support for the report in broad terms, but have difficulty accepting the detailed rules that the report contains in certain cases - which is reflected in our voting - since this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Moreover, the report goes further than its original task, as defined in the title of the report."
"Many of the problems that are taken up in the report are very real, but do not belong in this document."
". The report ""Gender-related aspects of the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts"" aims to report on participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution."
"Actually, there is confusion in this report as its title does not fully represent its content."
"Some provisions - like punishing rapists, making camps physically safe for women, and making sure women in stressful situations get fair portions of food and medical resources- are good."
"But the language of the document goes even further."
"Sadly, there is clearly an aim at overriding national abortion laws or even punishing or suppressing faith traditions opposing abortion."
"This contravenes the constitution of my country of Ireland, and I have no doubt the legislative position of other countries which seek to diminish rather than promote the practice of abortion."
"Whilst I fully recognise and support the participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution, I must sadly vote against this rather confused report."
"Smet report (A5-0301/2000)"
". (FR) The only positive aspects of this report are that it calls for a 'European definition of domestic work' and a 'clear limitation of the maximum number of hours to be worked' ."
"However, dealing ostensibly with domestic workers, the report, in fact, chiefly deals with the interests of those who employ them, which would not be shocking if it concerned only the category of employers, in a minority what is more, that are 'elderly people living alone and needing domestic help' ."
"But the needs of this category of employers are only brought up in order to call for the introduction of measures to make 'domestic services tax-deductible' and to adjust 'prices and costs to take account of individuals' financial resources' ."
"If Parliament votes in favour of this clause, it will above all enable rich families to subsidise their expenditure on domestic services by money squeezed out of the community."
"I would like to add an extra touch of cynicism: the explanatory statement makes domestic workers responsible for the fact that their employers employ them illegally."
"As a result, although we are not voting against this report on account of the few basic rights which it does express, we will not be voting in favour of it either."
". (SV) We are voting against this report that deals with so-called domestic help."
"The introduction of models of this type, sometimes referred to as the ""new labour market"" , in countries such as Belgium and Denmark clearly shows a preservation of a lower servant class consisting primarily of immigrant women, but also of men and the long-term unemployed."
"To tax-subsidise such a labour market is in our opinion downright offensive."
"Tax resources should be used in another way, for example so that people can improve themselves and be given choices in life."
"Problems taken up in the report can be solved with a humane asylum and refugee policy, by organising work to take into consideration a balance between work and personal life as well as by taking responsibility for people with special needs in a way which shows solidarity and social responsibility."
"Many tens of thousands of women in the European Union who provide domestic help in the informal sector of the economy would no doubt be delighted that we are dealing with the regulation of such activity, if only they knew."
"This report certainly has the advantage that it exists."
"However, I am not very comfortable with some of the wording in it."
"In my own country of Luxembourg, we are in the normal situation of making no distinction between manual workers, whether they work in industry, in households or anywhere else."
"They are entitled to a statutory minimum wage and to membership of the health, accident and pensions insurance schemes. In short, there is no discrimination against them in relation to other employees."
"That, of course, almost sounds like a perfect world when I read all the proposals for possible exceptional arrangements that are listed in this report."
"I see no reason, for example, why the working conditions of domestic staff should be in any way untypical."
"It is actually incredible that, in the twenty-first century, we should still be recommending that Member States guarantee the right of domestic staff to social security cover and adequate pensions."
"I am equally astonished by the demand that prices and costs in respect of domestic work be adjusted at national level to take account of individuals' financial resources."
"The call for simplification of administrative formalities for employers, on the other hand, makes good sense."
"In Luxembourg, we decided to carry out this type of simplification within the framework of the national employment plan. It works very well and is a model which I, in all modesty, would recommend."
"The demand that domestic services be made tax-deductible to reduce the difference in cost between employing undeclared and declared workers is also a step in the right direction."
"National governments should be magnanimous here, so as to ensure that employees and employers have an incentive to stop offering and engaging in illicit work."
"May I also warn against granting migrant women work permits for domestic work."
"The gangs who smuggle people into our countries would be delighted and would naturally ensure that all the women they intended to bring into EU countries illegally were declared as domestic staff."
"Is this what we want?"
"I think not."
"We should therefore be wary of making such statements which could leave us open to abuse."
". (SV) We have voted against Smet' s report on the regulation of domestic help."
"The rapporteur feels that a legal framework is required at European level that makes it possible for persons providing domestic services to be covered by employment protection legislation."
"Smet proposes, amongst other things, that a European definition of domestic work be introduced."
"In addition, the rapporteur requires the Member States to introduce tax allowances for domestic services so that the differences between the costs of ""black"" and ""white"" labour are reduced."
"There is great demand for domestic help."
"However, the high taxation rate both in Sweden and in other EU countries prevents supply and demand from intersecting in the non-shadow economy."
"Income taxes, social security contributions and VAT drive up the hourly rate to levels that almost no household with a normal income is prepared to pay."
"More or less all domestic work that is carried out against payment is currently carried out in the black economy."
"Many women and young people work in this market."
"They have no rights, no insurance, no pension credits, no sick pay and no security."
"Too many young people are at risk of their first contact with the labour market being a job in the black economy."
"It is highly unfortunate that unreasonable tax rules are forcing people into the black economy in this way."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur that it is important for the differences between the costs of 'black' and 'white' labour to be reduced and feel that the Member States should introduce a tax reduction on domestic services."
"This will allow the people who carry out domestic services to be covered by insurance, pension schemes, sick pay and security."
"However, we are against the introduction of a legal framework containing detailed rules at European level for domestic help."
"These matters should be dealt with at national, regional or local level, and consequently we are voting against the report."
"Mrs Smet is right to draw attention to the vulnerable position of domestic helpers in the black economy."
"She is calling for a European definition of ""domestic work"" to be drafted and for Member States to draw up and regularly update statistics on undeclared work."
"She wants this type of work to be recognised as an occupation in its own right and is calling for European rules to be established on the rights of these workers - at present the situation varies from country to country."
"The needs of domestic workers should be considered when employment legislation is being drafted."
"The need for all Member States to introduce the principle of declaring all employment relationships is stressed and both employers and employees should be made aware of their rights under their employment relationship."
"Finally, she wants Member States to link the issuing of visas for domestic employees working for diplomats to be linked to a guaranteed minimum level of working conditions."
"This report merits careful consideration."
"- (NL) Female labour has a long history of poor pay, poor working conditions, a poor legal position and sexual intimidation."
"This especially applies to work performed by poor women in the households of the rich."
"That kind of work is usually organised on an informal basis, with no trade union representation, works council, premium payment or collective labour agreement."
"The employee has little or no protection and in many cases is largely dependent on the discretion of the employer."
"The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves."
"It is an occupational group that is often forgotten in a world still heavily dominated by men."
"Everyone is aware that the situation is open to abuse, but many people are inclined to seriously underestimate the scale of this abuse and the impact on those concerned."
"This own-initiative report is a useful product of the Commission' s fight for women' s rights and equal opportunities."
"The talks held with interested organisations and the itemisation of the problems that exist remind me of investigative reports on the position of workers over a century ago."
"Although my group considers the report to be too limited and the conclusions too modest, they will help us to start moving in the right direction."
". (SV) We take a positive attitude to domestic services being incorporated into the labour market, but have difficulty in accepting the detailed rules at EU level that the report contains in certain cases and that conflict with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Moreover, in certain cases the report goes beyond its original mandate as defined in the title of the report."
"Guy-Quint report (A5-0327/2000)"
"Madam President, I shall not waste your time explaining why I voted for the Guy-Quint report, but I really must say that for the elderly and pensioners it is very important to know how European Union funds are spent, how in concrete terms they are used by the administrative offices of the Commission."
"This is because pensioners have had first-hand experience throughout Europe of what bad administration means."
"They have given their pension contributions to the various national governments, which have quickly made them vanish like clever magicians."
"I should not want President Prodi too, like a clever magician, like a modern European Houdini, to succeed in making the funds at the disposal of all European citizens vanish."
"It is just a fear: I am sure he will not do so, but I should like to emphasise this anyway on behalf of pensioners."
". (FR) In March 1999, in the wake of various scandals and patent inefficiencies, the European Commission resigned."
"This resignation, the outcome of a long process of deterioration, must not however make us forget that the 'Delors Commission' bore heavier responsibilities than its successor."
"This resignation, imposed by the elected representatives of the nations of Europe, revealed the pressing need for far-reaching reform of working methods within the various Directorates-General of the Commission, and of decision-making procedures and structures, in order to improve the utilisation of the available resources in the management of Community resources and policies."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, while taking note of the serious infringements of the past, will not criticise the Commission and its reform out of hand."
"It is clear, however, that the exercise it is engaged in must seek primarily to restore the widely and legitimately shattered confidence of public opinion in the European institutions."
"This must come about, as the report says 'by means of a significant improvement in performance and efficiency' , but also by means of more transparent practices."
"The Commission reform will be judged on actual evidence, hence the need for regular follow-up reports, which the European Commission will present throughout the programme, and the importance of the overall report, which is expected in December 2002."
"As far as the ABB is concerned, on the basis of whose activities the budget is established, we recall that it presupposes an amendment of Article 19 of the Financial Regulation, which establishes the distinction between Part A (administrative appropriations) and Part B (operating appropriations)."
"As a result, the Commission must ensure that it does not call into question Parliament' s powers with respect to the allocation of resources."
"The French delegation will naturally oppose the introduction of the codecision procedure in amending the Financial Regulation."
"By imposing the dismantling of the Technical Assistance Offices with a view to increasing the Commission' s accountability for programme implementation, this House wishes to point out that 'only tasks not requiring public authority intervention might be outsourced to the private sector, and this in the form of one-off contracts' ."
"As regards commitology, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group denounces the report' s federalist vision, which claims that Member States, through management and regulatory committees, encroach on the Commission' s independence as regards management, and reproaches Member States 'through those committees, of promoting national interests which are sometimes at odds with those of the Community' ."
"The rapporteur even takes the view that 'reforming the Commission must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved' ."
"The management of Community policies must reflect the pragmatic agreements entered into between the countries of the European Union. For our part, we take the view that, especially because of the widespread lack of bureaucratic transparency which prevails and the scandals and inefficiencies of a still recent past, Member States must be more than ever involved in the decision-making process."
"The willingness shown by the rapporteur to eliminate their influence is, in this respect, edifying!"
"The Commission proposals, in the context of its reform, raise a number of questions as regards human resources."
"I will cite but one: the early retirement measure concerning some 600 staff, which is 3% of the total staff employed."
"The Commission services tell us that this would not have any significant impact on the budget."
"Our group hopes this is the case, but this is not a sufficient condition and it is necessary to ensure, in particular, that the statutory provisions are respected and that these measures do not obscure the other priorities of the reform and do not give rise to a political settling of scores."
"It is, moreover, common knowledge that certain nationalities are manifestly over-represented in the junior grades of categories C and D, for the undisclosed budgetary reason that the staff concerned would not benefit from the 16% expatriation allowance!"
"These discriminatory practices are unacceptable."
"The fact is that unemployment exists in all our countries and the Commission would be well advised to take advantage of future procedures for early retirement and for the recruitment of hundreds of new civil servants to start putting its house in order."
"By the same token, nepotism and lack of transparency must be eradicated from the Commission services, especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts."
"Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group forcefully recalls that the citizens of the European Union expect more than ever that reform measures and staff recruitment must take account of the diversity of opinions and convictions which are expressed in our countries."
"Pom√©s Ruiz report (A5-0329/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted in favour of the Pom√©s Ruiz report."
"It is most important that it should be possible to check the budgets and expenditure relating to the Commission' s activities."
"But most of all I voted in favour because what I would like - and I want to say this in this Parliament - is that when the accounts are checked, that is, how the money has been spent by the Commission, attention should be paid not only to checking the figures - 4 plus 4 is 8, 8 plus 8 is 16, 16 plus 16 is 32, 32 plus 32 is 64 - but also to checking whether these expenses have really been useful to Europe, whether they have really achieved the aims that they were meant to achieve."
"This is a check to be done alongside the mathematical check on the figures."
". (FR) In the still recent past, various scandals and inefficiencies resulted in the resignation of the European Commission in March 1999."
"This resignation revealed the need for an in-depth reform of the structures, procedures and working methods within the Commission services in order to ensure optimum use of resources in the management of Community policies."
"The proposals contained in the White Paper, which are to a large extent drawn from the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts, should make it possible for the Commission to equip itself with the optimum organisational structure and operating methods so as to fulfil to the best of its ability the tasks assigned to it by the Treaties, without, however, encouraging it to exceed the limits of its prerogatives as defined in the Treaty, which has all too often been the case in the past."
"Nor is there any doubt, by virtue of the powers and competences conferred upon it by the Treaty, that Parliament is required to fully exercise its powers of scrutiny with regard to the Commission, particularly as regards transparency and the implementation of the Community budget."
"The fact is that the citizens of our 15 nations, who elect their representatives, would not understand if this were not the case, because it is their money which is at stake."
"Quite clearly, the effectiveness of the reform proposed in the White Paper will be judged by its results in terms of the use made of financial and human resources, particularly by the application of the relevant financial provisions being effectively monitored with appropriate supervisory and sanction mechanisms."
"As regards standards of behaviour in public life, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group welcomes the establishment of a set of codes of conduct for the Commission (code of conduct for Commissioners, code of conduct governing relations between Commissioners and departments and code of good administrative behaviour for relations with the public) and reiterates its view that these texts should have a legal basis."
"Delays in the payment of sums due by the Commission often appear unjustified."
"It is important therefore that this situation is remedied as quickly a possible by speeding up payment of the sums due, lest the smooth running of all the European institutions be damaged."
"The fact is that Community policies are reflected in moral and financial commitments to our citizens and third-country nationals."
"It is therefore necessary to ensure that these commitments are respected much more closely than they have been in the past."
"As far as human resources are concerned, the quality of employees and greater transparency in staffing policy in general must become the strong points of the new administrative reform."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group welcomes in principle the response represented by the Commission White Paper to the appeal made by the European Parliament inviting it to carry out far-reaching reform of its human resources policy."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, however, forcefully recalls that, as regards staff recruitment, the Commission reform must take account of the diversity of opinions and beliefs which are expressed in our countries regarding Europe, its past and its future."
"The citizens of our respective countries would not understand if this were not the case."
"By the same token, lack of transparency and nepotism must be eradicated from recruitment, especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group does not at this stage wish to express any opposition to the early retirement of hundreds of officers from the Commission services provided, however, that the statutory provisions are respected, that the early retirement measures do not hinder the priorities of the reform, that these retirements have a neutral impact on the budget, that they are implemented in the interest of the service and under volunteer termination of service and do not give rise to a political settling of scores."
"In conclusion, I feel bound to say that we expect this reform, which is essential for the future, to introduce greater discipline and greater transparency into the day-to-day running of the Commission, but it must also lead to a greater sense of accountability on its part, within the strict framework of the competences that have been devolved to it."
"Harbour report (A5-0326/2000)"
"Madam President, this report by Mr Harbour concerns itself most of all with the Commission' s staff: salaries, career structure and also pensions."
"Now, the Commission should demonstrate in practice that it knows how to administer its staff' s pension funds properly."
"As it says on page 16 of the Harbour report, there should be a move to a funded pension scheme."
"We have the example of the European Parliament' s pension fund, so outstandingly managed by our administrators, who have made wise use of the MEPs' pension funds, that they have recently increased payments to retired members."
"The same should be done for the Commission' s staff and eventually for all citizens in the European Union."
"Lamassoure report (A5-0328/2000)"
"I have voted in favour of the Lamassoure report, which concerns itself most of all with the institutional aspects of Commission reform."
"During this explanation of vote, I must emphasise the fact that Parliament does not, unfortunately, have all the powers it should have."
"A change I have never heard proposed - yet one which I consider useful, important and not difficult to implement - is that the initiative in lawmaking should be reserved for Parliament and not shared with the Commission."
"The Commission should execute: it should be the executive power of the European Union;"
"There should be a separation of powers - as was said at the time of the French Revolution - in the European Union too."
". British Conservative Members will vote against the report because of the well-rehearsed opposition to the extension of QMV and proposed incorporation of the blanket of fundamental rights into the Treaty."
"Concerning enhanced cooperation, they support the initiative as it is compatible with the view that greater flexibility be introduced into the operation of the EU."
"Conservatives also support the statement in Paragraph 7 of the report that democratic control be ensured and that the three pillar system be enabled to work."
"The notion that Parliament' s assent be required to authorise the procedure would only be necessary if the existing unanimity rule in the Council were to be waived."
"Sauquillo P√©rez del Arco report (A5-0337/2000)"
"Madam President, we abstained from this vote."
"I would still like to give some kind of explanation though because illness prevented me from taking part in the previous round of discussions in Strasbourg."
"We did not vote in favour because we feel that all too often the development cooperation within the Commission is still regarded as a stopgap measure."
"When I read in the Commission documents that integration into the globalised world is the name of the game for poor countries, then I am afraid we overlook the fact that we, i.e. the western economies, are the ones pushing globalisation, and that we are therefore not actually seriously doing anything about what we regard as our number one priority, i.e. fighting poverty, because we often cause the very poverty we then seek to fight."
"I did not vote against this report because it embraces a number of worthwhile issues and because I want a robust line to be taken."
"I advocate maintaining Community development cooperation at EU level but I am afraid that if the reforms do not go well, it will add grist to the mill of those who actually want to renationalise all the aid programmes."
"As far as I am concerned, Parliament has missed its chance to make a serious contribution to the analysis of the errors, and we should also have spent more time on a clear analysis of the remedies proposed by the Commission."
"I regret this and that is why we abstained from the vote as a group, because we feel that the NGOs have done badly out of it."
"I would like to close with a procedural motion."
"I have now heard all the judgments on the voting of my fellow Members on all kinds of subjects imaginable and that is why I have taken the liberty of ignoring your rap on the knuckles to some extent, because I thought it is going a little over the top to stay here especially to have your say on everything once again, even though we all have our thoughts on these things of course."
"Thirteenth and last explanation of vote, Madam President, by the Pensioners' Party today, 30 November 2000, on this document relating to cooperation and development."
"I have voted in favour of this document, even though - and I say this loud and clear in this session of the European Parliament in Brussels - I believe that, now that we are spending European money to help the poor and less fortunate in developing countries, we should decide to appoint European ambassadors in these countries to supervise how this money is spent."
"This is absolutely essential!"
"That concludes the voting."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 30 November 2000."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the final draft agenda agreed by the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, 7 December, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Tuesday:"
"Madam President, firstly, please allow me to express, on my own behalf - although I believe I am expressing the opinion of the majority of the House and not just of my group - that I agree absolutely with the statement that you made at the time of the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I believe that it is right to point out that this is of constitutional value to Parliament and I therefore congratulate you."
"Secondly, Madam President, I would like to ask you to explain to the House as clearly as possible, given the amount of contradictory information which has accumulated throughout the day, what the structure of the debate with the French Presidency will be in relation to the Nice European Council, and what approach will be taken to the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"(Applause)"
"The reports are certainly contradictory, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo."
"Presumably all the more so because the Summit ended in the middle of the night, which nobody had planned."
"I shall try to clarify the position."
"I was told before the Summit that the President of the Republic would attend together with the Foreign Minister."
"That is what I was told, but I shall seek more up-to-date information and I shall pass on your message."
"Madam President, thank you very much for taking the trouble to do this."
"Our information - and I wish to add straight away that I really cannot believe it - is that the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of France, will only be present tomorrow for 30 minutes in order to speak."
"He may also hear Romano Prodi's intervention, I do not know, but he would not hear the remarks of the group Chairmen."
"If that were the case then I would judge this procedure to be unacceptable, and it would meet with criticism from the vast majority of our group."
"I am pleased that the other groups also agree."
"I hope that this information is wrong, but I would ask you to convey to the French President that it is completely unacceptable for him to come here into Parliament simply to make a speech and then to take his leave and not listen to what this democratically elected European Parliament has to say."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I strongly agree with those remarks."
"I would invite you to convey to the French Presidency the view of my own group that a draft treaty which is worth promoting should be a draft treaty which is worth defending."
"Madam President, an issue has arisen in relation to the possible tabling of a resolution on the Nice European Council."
"My group' s understanding is that the Conference of Presidents did not take any decision in this regard and that the debate will be without a motion for a resolution."
"I would be grateful if you could confirm this view."
"Do you not want there to be a resolution?"
"It is not what the Group of the Party of European Socialists wants."
"There was no agreement at the Conference of Presidents. So they decided to wait and I would like that point clarified."
"You are right to want to do so, because for once, as you know, I could not attend the Conference of Presidents. I was at the European Council at that very time."
"Madam President, some of us were, of course, at the same meeting."
"I was not present at the Conference of Presidents' meeting either."
"Our colleague, Mr Friedrich, kindly represented us."
"As we understand it, we need to decide here whether we want a resolution."
"Our group believes that we should have a very short text now; not a definitive opinion, but a short political statement which does not conclude yes or no."
"We should then, at a later stage, carry out a very detailed assessment, particularly since we do not even have the texts yet."
"This would mean - in my group's view - a short text this week."
"We should not allow the opportunity to issue a political opinion to pass us by."
"That is our group's position."
"Madam President, I recognise how difficult it is for Parliament to comment on the Nice Summit when we do not have the documents yet."
"There seems no possibility of our having a well-thought-through and properly argued position."
"That said, this Parliament is often criticised for not keeping up with what is going on and it would be a pity if we said nothing."
"So I agree with Mr Poettering: on Thursday we should pass a short resolution as a political signal after the Summit."
"Madam President, at the Nice European Council, there have been two types of resolution which relate to issues which we have dealt with in Parliament, such as, for example, the status of the European limited company, the Social Agenda, maritime safety and BSE."
"They are all issues on which the Council has adopted resolutions which we have been aware of sufficiently in advance and, furthermore, which we are able to assess."
"However, at this time, neither my group nor any other has any knowledge of the final texts decided on by the Intergovernmental Conference and, bearing in mind that we cannot pass judgment on such sensitive issues, we believe that we should not table a resolution on the results of the Conference unless we want to express a positive or negative initial reaction, and we therefore believe it is not appropriate."
"Furthermore, in order to produce a short resolution we must understand the issues very well."
"Madam President, we therefore believe that it is prudent not to table any resolution and to ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to prepare a report on the background to the issue, which can be debated at the right time when we know the facts."
"Madam President, no one underestimates the significance and scope of this summit, which has also been the lengthiest in the history of the European Union."
"That is exactly why we have a problem: this is an important summit and everything we say counts."
"I think hastily adopting a short resolution, as Mr Poettering proposes, would be a feeble, unimaginative solution."
"So I am in favour of postponing the resolution until January."
"Then we can discuss later whether this resolution should be based on a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs or simply on our own initiative, but, whichever, I am in favour of postponing the resolution until January."
"Madam President, Nice has been a particularly important summit."
"It is being commented on already and that comment will be widely reported in the press. It would be quite inconceivable for the European Parliament, sitting the very day after the Summit, to say nothing about it."
"So, Madam President, I propose that you put two alternatives to the vote: immediately discussing the Treaty of Nice, which is different from the Summit, or finding the right formula for postponing detailed comment until the January part-session."
"Whatever the case, let us have a vote on it, and, personally, I support a resolution along the lines suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others."
"Madam President, the balance of opinion in my group was that we should not express ourselves by way of a resolution."
"This is partly because we have not had sufficient chance to reflect, but also because we believe it is wrong to say that when there is a major debate, Parliament will not express itself."
"I believe that Parliament will express its views vigorously tomorrow even if there is no resolution."
"So I do not believe that we will be deemed to have been silent;"
"I suspect that the presumption will be quite different when we are finished."
"Madam President, this Parliament adopts resolutions on all kinds of topical and urgent problems throughout the world, and yet when something really is urgent, namely having an opinion on the Nice Summit, we hesitate."
"You can make of that what you will."
"Our electorate will not understand it."
"Many resolutions have been adopted here in the past without colleagues even reading the texts."
"Surely we will be in a position to hold parliamentary debates on texts which have been ready for months, whose content we are familiar with, whose consequences we know and whose historical importance we are fully aware of."
"I believe that it is our duty to our electorate to have an opinion on this."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the European Parliament can only issue its final opinion, which is both binding and a message to other parliaments - and we know from them that they are waiting for this message - on the basis of a thorough report which needs to be prepared by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"On the other hand, however, the people of Europe are waiting to see what we think."
"This statement need not contain an opinion - a yes or no to the Treaty - but we should express our views on the critical reaction to the events in Nice, otherwise we will be excluding ourselves from a political event."
"I believe that we need to be present in the discussion process of the coming week and that we should put forward our critical or perhaps also positive arguments, without drawing any conclusions."
"This alone is the right way forward."
"I think that, in this sense, the proposals made by Mr Poettering and Mr Dell'Alba indicate the right way forward, the way which best allows us to discharge our responsibilities."
"Madam President, there has been mention of what the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs may be."
"I must point out that the Committee is to meet tomorrow afternoon, firstly to try to really get to grips with what the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference were."
"We shall have the chance to address the representative of the Commission in order to obtain information on the draft text of the Treaty, which we do not have as yet."
"We have only just discovered that this text is not available, at least for the time being, but it might be in the next few hours."
"Of course, I give no opinion on the political assessments, and the group Chairmen will be able to make their opinions known through resolutions in time."
"We will also need to agree on what we mean by political assessments."
"It seems no easy task."
"With regard to the assessments in question, I will give just one example."
"The President, herself, knows that until yesterday evening, there were different views on a fundamental issue, that is, the extension of qualified majority voting and the matter of recognising Parliament' s power in the codecision procedure."
"They continued working on these texts during the night, just as they continued working through the night on figures relating to the division of votes in the Council and of seats in Parliament."
"At least as far as the Commission is concerned, we feel that more awareness and thought are necessary."
"Madam President, the importance of the situation with which we are faced after Nice is such that I do not believe that Parliament should allow itself to be divided on the technical question of whether to have a resolution or not."
"This technicality is not sufficiently important."
"It is true that in this week directly following the events in Nice we in Parliament should send out a clear signal."
"We could do this, as Mr Cox has proposed, through the debate alone."
"But the tradition of this Parliament has it that we usually choose to do this by way of a resolution."
"I have listened very carefully to what Mr Poettering, Mr Brok and others have said; all that this is about is issuing a first opinion."
"It is not about casting Parliament's position in stone..."
"(Applause)"
"but about saying that we will do so after an in-depth examination of the matter by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"This will happen within the next one or two months."
"Then this Parliament will lay down its opinion - yes or no or maybe - as it always does."
"This would also make it possible - and I have agreed this with the Chairman of my group - for me to vote in favour of a resolution of this kind this week."
"I believe that this would also allow the necessary agreement to be reached, if we say that we are making a statement, but that Parliament reserves its judgment and final position until its committee has tabled the report."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr H√§nsch, for that constructive contribution."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Wednesday:"
"President."
"I have a request from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the report by Mr de Roo on the assessment and management of environmental noise be postponed until the January part-session."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request?"
"Madam President, we voted on 4 December."
"The report is extremely complex; moreover, Amendment No 10 and Amendment No 35 were adopted under protest."
"We believe that this report needs further consideration, which is why we would ask to be able to discuss it and vote on it in January."
"Does anyone wish to speak against the request?"
"Madam President, I would strongly urge the case for not removing this report by Mr de Roo from the agenda, as it has been excellently prepared, and we will be preparing to adopt a common position on it next Monday and Tuesday in the final Environment Council of the French Presidency."
"It would be a great pity if Parliament were now to obstruct this report, which is of enormous importance to our citizens."
"There are just 36 amendments, so we really could get through it quite methodically."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"President."
"I have another request from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Peijs on credit institutions be postponed until the January part-session."
"But I would point out, without wanting to influence your decision, that the 3-month deadline expires on 15 December."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request to postpone the report?"
"Madam President, when we discussed this in committee, we assumed that this debate would take place in January."
"After all, this is a second reading."
"Discussions are still being held between the Council and the European Parliament which may make a conciliation procedure unnecessary."
"For this reason, I think that it would be wise to extend the deadline - if need be - and to debate the Peijs report in January."
"Does anyone wish to speak against this request for a postponement?"
"If not, I will put it to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Madam President, in view of that decision and since Commissioner Liikanen will not be present on Thursday but could be present on Wednesday, I wonder whether it would be possible to bring Mrs Gill's report on European digital content forward from Thursday to Wednesday to fill that slot."
"I should be grateful if you would agree to that request."
"As there seems to be a consensus on this proposal, that is what will be done."
"Friday: President."
"I have a request from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the Parish report on young farmers to be postponed until the January part-session."
"Does anyone from that group wish to support this request?"
"Madam President, I should like this put off until January 2001, if possible, as Commissioner Fischler is unable to be here because of fisheries meetings."
"It is very important that he is present for this report because he is very interested in it and we are very much in the hands of the Commission for its success."
"I ask that the House hold it over to January."
"Thank you, Mr Parish."
"(Parliament approved the request) I would remind you that this will be our last Friday of the session."
"The order of business is thus adopted."
"Madam President, while enlargement was being discussed at the Nice Summit, the French Government was practising a kind of contraction, stopping 1200 young Italians at Ventimiglia as they were on their way to take part in a union demonstration."
"That was an infringement of the freedom of movement as laid down in the Schengen Agreement, and I would be grateful if you would seek an explanation from the French Government."
"I think a very unusual interpretation of the Schengen Agreement was applied in that case, actually, and, no doubt, if it had been a group of bankers or a train carrying meat-and-bone meal, the French Government would have been far more tolerant."
"Thank you, Mr Krivine."
"We will look into the background to the ban."
"Madam President, on 20 October, 200 political prisoners went on hunger strike, which they intend to see through to the bitter end, in protest against the Turkish Government's policy of using 'white' isolation cells in order to undermine morale and break down prisoners' resistance."
"A further 800 prisoners are on hunger strike in sympathy."
"The prisoners' mothers are also on hunger strike."
"Solidarity is being expressed in numerous countries."
"I, personally, was horrified by the murder of a sympathiser on hunger strike by a detachment of the Grey Wolves in Rotterdam a few days ago."
"I have also written to you on the subject, Madam President."
"I should like Parliament to protest to the Turkish Government through you, through its presidency, calling on it to stop this particularly inhumane practice and not to isolate political prisoners."
"Thank you, Mr Korakas."
"I will see what I can do about that."
"Madam President, I should like to request your assistance."
"We have a rule in this Parliament that smoking is prohibited in certain places - that includes the Chamber."
"We are going to debate the whole issue of tobacco in a few moments."
"I came in here today to be greeted by huge wafts of smoke, courtesy of Mr Brok."
"This is not the first time."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - as Chair of that committee - he sits there smoking."
"This is not acceptable."
"It has a knock-on effect."
"In the last Committee on Foreign Affairs meeting that I attended, other members of the committee also started to smoke."
"In the interests of everyone, the rules should be respected, irrespective of the person concerned."
"It is extremely important that the no-smoking rules are complied with."
"That includes the Members."
"It is very disrespectful of them not to take this into account."
"We have some Members in this Chamber who are immediately affected by tobacco smoke, for example, Mrs Lynne, who frequently complains."
"Please urge the Members - in particular the Member I have mentioned - not to smoke in areas where it is forbidden."
"I know exactly how you feel, Mrs McKenna, and I shall undertake to ensure compliance with the rule."
"Tobacco products"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0348/00) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products [9448/1/2000 - C5-0431/2000 - 1999/0244(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Maaten)"
"Madam President, we are now discussing this directive for the second time this year, and once again, a large number of amendments have been tabled."
"This would have been completely unnecessary, of course, if the Council had taken more notice, or indeed any notice, of our first reading and the amended proposal from the Commission, which went some way towards our goal."
"I am happy to say that since then - partly through the good offices of the Commission - the entire Presidency has shown willing and I believe the positions have moved somewhat closer together after all."
"Legislative procedures do not take place in a vacuum; as the negotiations for the framework agreement on tobacco control in the World Health Organisation have shown, there is a worldwide trend towards increasingly far-reaching control of what the World Health Organisation refers to as the tobacco epidemic."
"Madam President, how far should we take this?"
"How far are we allowed to take it?"
"I witnessed the concern expressed in our Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market over the implications of the ruling of the Court of Justice of 5 October for the directive concerning tobacco advertising, and I echo the view that it will have a considerable impact on this directive and also on EU public health policy in general."
"I also feel that the arguments for closer involvement of the European Parliament, i.e. greater transparency and better democratic control, have gone from strength to strength."
"Adjustments had to be made to the draft directive and some have been proposed this time round as well."
"I just think it is a shame that our Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been unable to make a constructive contribution in terms of the content of the directive."
"I would be most interested to hear the Commissioner' s view of the issues surrounding this legal basis."
"I think it is important for us to know what he thinks."
"The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market whilst maintaining a high standard of public health and consumer protection, and building on existing legislation and advanced scientific knowledge."
"We really must strengthen the functioning of the internal market, for example by mutual recognition of test results and the development of common standards."
"Those who adhere to them would not then be required to fulfil various additional conditions depending on which country they happen to be in."
"This is not a crusade against smokers, nor is it a ban on smoking."
"That would be undesirable and would also be unworkable in any case."
"What we are aiming to do is to achieve an enhanced sense of personal responsibility, and hopefully help deter young people from smoking."
"According to the World Health Organisation, there are 1400 smoking-related deaths annually in the European Union."
"That is almost one per minute."
"Eighty per cent of new smokers each year are below the age of 18, and the majority of them are young women who predominately smoke the so-called 'light' cigarettes."
"So it is vital to impose a ban on these misleading descriptions, and the product must be subject to controls."
"It is the most readily available product in the European Union, but we know more about the contents of a pot of jam and the ingredients of cola than we do about the average cigarette."
"This directive will ensure that we at last get to know what cigarettes contain and why."
"Once in possession of these facts, we must proceed to draw up a common list of permitted ingredients of the kind that already exists in incomplete form in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Germany."
"However, I sense that the Commission is reluctant to take this step and do not really understand why."
"This Parliament would like to see a commitment to drawing up this list before 2005, during the tenure of this Commission, or at least to see it proposed by then."
"We therefore insist on the Member States providing the necessary information in good time."
"Provision must be made to ban at an earlier stage ingredients that increase physiological dependency."
"It is very important to establish maximum tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels."
"However, I do wonder whether our efforts are going to be able to do a lot for public health standards in the long run."
"Nicotine addiction is a complex matter."
"The harmful effects are largely caused by the tar, carbon monoxide, and other ingredients, and we need to find out more about the damaging, but perhaps even the positive, aspects of nicotine addiction."
"It is obvious that what is unhealthy for European consumers is also unhealthy for other consumers and therefore ought not to be exported."
"I am willing to consider establishing a derogation for this purpose, lasting three years or so. During this time, companies would be able to make the necessary production and marketing modifications, so that jobs are not needlessly transferred to countries outside the European Union."
"Health warnings need to be improved."
"The European Parliament has gratefully made use of Canadian research findings, and I feel we will go further down this line in time."
"We are not ready to go that far at this stage."
"That said, we do feel that health warnings should be at least as big as they are in Poland, where they now cover 30% of the packet and I am disappointed that the Council did not want to go further than 25%."
"Madam President, I hope this Parliament will support the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to deal with the consequences of the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Case C376/98 on the directive concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products, currently in second reading before this Parliament."
"Firstly, given the clear internal market objective to regulate the free movement of tobacco products in the Community, Article 95 of the Treaty constitutes the appropriate legal basis for this proposal."
"Secondly, there is no doubt that a better motivation of the effects of this provision on the internal market will strengthen it."
"In particular, there is a need to reinforce the motivation of the provisions of Article 3 on carbon monoxide maximum authorised yields in the recitals of the directive."
"They should better reflect how they aim to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods or distortions of competition."
"Finally, in relation to Article 3, allowing manufacture in the European Union only of products respecting this directive amounts to an export ban for products with higher tar, nicotine or carbon monoxide levels."
"The European Parliament has therefore proposed to add Article 133 dealing with the common commercial policy to Article 95 as the legal basis."
"The Commission could agree to this solution subject to the insertion of a specific article in the text of the directive which would explicitly regulate exports as such."
"This would be the case, for example, of an amendment on the transitional period to be applied to exports of cigarettes not complying with Article 3 of the directive."
"Mr President, when it comes to harmonisation measures, we have a choice between promoting the interests of the tobacco industry or standing up for public health. We would have no hesitation in choosing the latter."
"In other words, we would make it our business to reduce the maximum yields of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide, then we would go for decisive and striking warnings, and ban misleading wording."
"We would also opt for efficient measures to deal with certain technical issues."
"Despite this clear course of action, we must also be conscious of the fact that we are the Parliament of a Union that sets great store by the principles of the constitutional State, which means that we must recognise the limitations of our authority, i.e. we must know what the limits are to the authority we derive from Article 95, the legal basis we are invoking for the new tobacco directive."
"Assuming I have read the judgment that annuls the advertising directive correctly, we must verify whether there is a European market for tobacco products."
"Then we must verify whether there are obstacles to the internal market, or whether they could arise, realistically speaking."
"Thirdly, we must check whether the stipulations we approve will really help to improve the functioning of the internal market and whether they are commensurate with the goal to be achieved."
"Fourthly, we must see whether the choices we face in terms of content will contribute to a high standard of public health protection, because that is another of our duties pursuant to Article 95."
"Overall, I do not see any problem with this directive."
"So I am extremely content with the answer I received in advance from the Commissioner, to a question which has also been raised in our group, as to how we should deal with the proposal to immediately incorporate an export ban on products we do not want to use ourselves, into this directive."
"If this can be settled in a legally conclusive manner by adding a reference to the legal basis of Article 133 of the Treaty then I feel we should all support this solution, and I would also hope that by so doing, we will not encounter annulment rights at a later stage."
"In any case, the fact is that if it should transpire now, or further down the line, that we are not going to be able to secure the export ban, then we must do everything in our power to see that this is done subsequently."
"Because for ethical reasons, nobody in Europe can accept that products we do not consider good enough for ourselves, and that we do not want to allow Europeans to use, can, without further ado, be exported to Africa, for example."
"There must be no question of something like that happening."
"So the ban must be imposed at some point."
"Let us hope we can do it now."
"Mr President, to finish I just have this to say."
"Mrs Martens was the spokesperson for the PPE-DE Group."
"There are serious reasons as to why she will arrive a little later here today."
"She is hoping she will still be in time to round off the list of speakers from the PPE-DE Group."
"If not, I have also spoken on her behalf."
"Mr President, the opportunity today to debate and subsequently vote on the Maaten report in second reading is an important one, a test of Parliament' s ability to live up to the expectations of citizens, who want institutions capable of making clear-cut decisions."
"Their way and concept of life, in which the protection of health is becoming increasingly important, are at stake."
"At this level, the work undertaken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been truly remarkable, thanks, in particular, to our rapporteur' s work."
"One thing must be made clear: we are not adopting a legislative framework to fight smoking, which continues to be the largest cause of death in the European Union; at least for the moment this is not possible and I, personally, would have many doubts if we intended to draw on, more or less secretly, an illusory prohibitionist philosophy."
"Harmonising the national laws concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of smoking products at the highest possible level of health protection is something that we can and must do."
"As has been pointed out, there are four cornerstones of this directive: limiting the content of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide; banning descriptors of cigarettes - 'light' or 'ultra-light' - which are universally acknowledged to be misleading; uniform regulations and, where necessary, prohibiting other ingredients and additives which are often responsible for increasing the risks for smokers and, above all, increasing their addiction; quantitative and qualitative reinforcement of the warnings of the gravity of the risk taken when lighting a cigarette and trying to dissuade the young from falling victim to this psycho-physical slavery."
"By merging three pre-existing directives, we are obviously staying strictly within the boundaries of improving the operation of the internal market without, however, renouncing forging ahead with a harm-reduction strategy and curbing a true scourge: smoking, which is costly in both social and economic terms."
"During this second reading, we have had two main concerns: firstly, political reconciliation of the aim of protecting health with the nevertheless valid point of view of production and employment."
"The example of applying new levels of toxic substances to cigarettes exported from the European Union as well, should apply to everyone."
"To uphold this basic principle, we have, to begin with, proposed extending the legal basis to include Article 133 of the Treaty, but above all, we have postponed the date by which Member States will be obliged to implement it to 1 January 2007."
"The second concern, of a specifically legal nature, has, on the other hand, encouraged us to increase the interdependence of the harmonisation of the market and the protection of health even further, by meticulously following the recommendations arising from the Court of Justice' s reasons for recently setting aside the Directive on advertising, reasons of which only a biased reading could lead one to conclude that the two aspects are incompatible."
"We have therefore carried out fruitful and important work, especially because the distances from the common position of the Council, but even more so, from the observations which were made in the Council following the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, of which we had first-hand experience, are so small that there is a real chance for a swift and effective compromise."
"To ditch, as someone has proposed, all this work and with it the opportunity to send a positive message to the citizens is, of course, a valid proposal, but at least let us have the courage to do it in the name of an explicit political reason and not hide behind formal homage to the Treaty."
"We have made every effort to achieve the greatest possible unity of Parliament so that it can, as at other times, find the strength to appear to citizens as a sure point of reference, impervious to individual interests."
"If this proves not to be the case, at least the responsibilities will be clear and easily identifiable."
"Mr President, I am firmly of the belief that people have a right to smoke, but my personal taste is that they should do so only in the privacy of their own homes."
"This rule can be applied equally to all recreational but dangerous drugs when no one but the person consuming the drug is likely to be affected."
"Certainly, there is none more dangerous than tobacco mixed with nicotine and other chemicals to guarantee a very high rate of addition and dependency."
"Governments have the task of ensuring that citizens have the information to make informed decisions and to exercise their free will."
"Earlier this year, the Canadian Government decided to strengthen its powers of communication with its citizens about tobacco products and overcome the intense lobbying and huge financial interests of the tobacco companies by requiring that cigarette packets in Canada carry pictures depicting some of the health consequences of smoking."
"Studies have shown that such pictures have a significantly greater effect in conveying concerns about smoking and the health consequences than any written warning."
"I ask Members of the House to support the amendment which has been tabled by John Bowis for the PPE-DE Group, Catherine Stihler for the Socialist Group and myself."
"This seeks to give the governments of European Union Member States strengthened powers to introduce such pictures on cigarette packets in their own countries."
"I emphasise that we are not insisting that these pictures should be imposed on every Member State. It simply gives Member States an additional right to introduce them."
"Let people have the freedom to choose whether or not to smoke."
"Let us be absolutely sure that they are informed when they make the decision one way or the other."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 fatalities in Europe from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Europe, its Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament decide to ban meat-and-bone meal and exclude cattle over 30 months' old from the food chain without prior testing."
"Better late than never."
"Fifty thousand deaths a year for decades, due to the consequences of using a drug with known side-effects for which doctors and hospital departments know there is only palliative treatment, and nothing is done apart from a few timid information campaigns."
"Then, when a directive does come along seeking to regulate the distribution of that drug and information about it - I am talking about tobacco - there is an outcry from some Members."
"But ladies and gentlemen, if you truly acknowledged the health problems linked to tobacco, you would demand a ban on this drug, just as you continue to maintain the bans on other substances despite the fact that, quantitatively, they are far less lethal."
"You are responsible for the health of millions of citizens, and also for the deaths of thousands of young people who have not been given sufficient information."
"Cases have recently been won in the United States against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning people and lying about the toxicity of their products."
"Now, in France, the Loire-Atlantique health insurance company has won the right to sue the tobacco industry in the courts."
"But in the future, just as with contaminated blood and mad cow disease, legal action will be taken against those who knew about it and let it happen, and that means you, us, the decision makers, the legislators."
"So let us do something together, just a small thing in view of how much remains to be done."
"Let us reduce the levels of nicotine and tar; ban addictive substances, like ammonia which is added to the nicotine to increase addiction to cigarettes; attach legible warnings covering at least 35% of the cigarette packet to alert people to the risks and dangers of tobacco; get rid of lies like 'light' and 'ultra-light' which encourage young people, especially young women, to smoke in the belief that this makes it less harmful, when medical science now agrees that the upsurge in peripheral small-cell lung cancers which are more insidious, more difficult to diagnose and have even more tragic prognoses is linked to over-consumption of this type of cigarette; evaluate the socio-economic cost of tobacco and transform the subsidies to tobacco producers into real redevelopment subsidies benefiting, for example, the production of cereals to replace meat-and-bone meal; recognise that products intended for export should comply with the same regulations as those intended for the internal European market; raise the price of tobacco because that is a measure which has a direct incidence on consumption, especially by young people; and harmonise tax rates."
"None of this amounts to a great deal, ladies and gentlemen, and it will not really damage the interests of the tobacco industry, which some people would apparently rather protect than public health."
"Much more needs to be done."
"In fact, this directive should be extended to products other than cigarettes, like cigars and rolling tobacco, which are no less harmful. The ban on advertising these lethal products should be confirmed, and the collective rules on no-smoking areas should be extended."
"We have a lot of work to do."
"I urge you to adopt Mr Maaten' s report as a first step in the interests of the health of future generations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on the advertising of tobacco products, this report and proposal for an amended directive has been called into question from various points of view."
"There are also amendments that would discard the whole of Parliament's proposal."
"We are of the opinion, however, that there are very significant differences between the issue of tobacco advertising and this directive."
"We feel it is self-evident that Article 95 should form the legal basis for this directive together with Article 133, as the committee are now proposing in Amendment No 1."
"The directive on which the proposal builds is based on Article 95 and the issue is, of course, directly concerned with the content of products on the internal market."
"We have a positive opinion of the contents of the report and support its main points."
"It is particularly important to establish clear limit values for the hazardous substances contained in the smoke."
"Amendment No 2 concerning carbon monoxide is, therefore, particularly positive."
"We can also support the proposals concerning the size and wording of the warning text."
"In this case, there is such a small difference between the different points of view that it should not be difficult to reach a compromise."
"We are also in favour of the ban on habit-forming additives."
"As regards export from the European Union of cigarettes that are banned within the Union for health reasons, we consider that the only reasonable and consistent solution is to put a stop to this."
"There is no reason to provide special conditions and extended transitional periods where the export of cigarettes is concerned, as compared with their manufacture for use within the European Union."
"The report also mentions special brands of cigarettes that are marketed as 'mild' , 'light' and such like. This is a marketing strategy which is often misleading and which gives the false impression that these cigarettes do not carry the same risks as other cigarettes."
"We do not see any reason for allowing this type of marketing and regard the committee's present position in this area as being in danger of leading to far too many opportunities for exceptions."
"Even if subsidies for tobacco-growing are not regulated by this report, it is impossible not to touch on the issue, which constitutes one of the absurdities of the European Union."
"It is unreasonable for the Union to put the large sums of money into tobacco-growing that it does today."
"This is inconsistent, and it is becoming expensive."
"This money could be put to good use elsewhere."
"Therefore, the only sensible thing to do is to phase out the subsidies gradually and for the farms affected to be given help to convert to other crops."
"When this report was previously discussed, the issue of Swedish snuff was brought up."
"I do not consider there to be any reason to change the current rules, i.e. an exception in the case of Sweden, nor, at the same time, the right of countries which do not wish to sell snuff to uphold their ban."
"I am therefore pleased that no amendment has been made to that regulation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with a subject tonight which lies outside our competence."
"Not for the first time, no doubt. But this time it seems much more serious than usual."
"So, once again, I shall deal with the substance and not the form."
"The fact is that the Court of Justice has just repealed the 1998 Directive banning advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products."
"The Court held that a total ban on tobacco advertising cannot be justified in the name of the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Now, in contempt of the Treaties, believing it is entrusted with a mission of salvation, our Parliament marches on, head down, to push this text through, come what may."
"That attitude perfectly sums up the defects of our European institutions, always ready to go to any lengths to achieve the ideological goals they have set themselves."
"But there are rules that have to be respected and we have to remember that."
"History teaches us that it is dangerous to regard the goal - however noble and virtuous - as superior to the agreed rules."
"The obstinacy demonstrated here reveals a striking lack of realism."
"Rather than learn the lessons of the defeat suffered in Luxembourg on 9 October, we persist in taking a legally indefensible attitude."
"Our group is profoundly attached to the preservation of public health, but we are worried about the consequences of such a suicidal political position."
"If we do not change our approach we are likely to kill the directive."
"Public health must not be put at stake in a power struggle designed to scrape together more new powers every day, to the detriment of the States."
"Health is too important an issue to be used as a political tool."
"So, what answers are there?"
"There is only one, in our opinion: learn the lessons from the Court of Justice' s decision and recognise that the European Commission unfortunately went much too far in its efforts to distort the treaties."
"We must also have another look at our copy and redraft it respecting the balance called for by the Treaty"
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to compliment Mr Maaten on his excellent report, into which he has put a lot of effort."
"I believe he has successfully amalgamated the three existing directives into one new one."
"It would, of course, have been much nicer if we had not had to concern ourselves with tobacco legislation at all."
"However, the sad fact is that tobacco is still produced, presented and sold."
"And although everyone is aware that it is bad for your health, they still use it nonetheless."
"If tobacco had to be admitted to the European market as a new product, it would certainly be rejected for health reasons."
"If jam or cola were as harmful as tobacco, they would certainly be banned."
"I support the strict labelling proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy both in terms of the size and the wording of the health warnings on cigarette packets."
"However, I think the Council' s proposal with regard to the size of the warnings on labels besides those on cigarette packets, is an improvement on Amendment No 25, since the 50 cm¬≤ limit is far too close to the surface area of a packet of cigarettes."
"I still feel that messages such as 'low-tar' , 'mild' and 'light' are misleading, so I will, in fact, oppose Amendments Nos 10 and 30."
"I am delighted that the ban on adding ammonia or other addictive products will be maintained at second reading."
"It seems obvious to me that we must not tolerate such practices."
"On a final note, I must sadly point out again that the European tobacco policy is still inconsistent."
"Tobacco consumption is discouraged on the one hand, yet on the other, in excess of EUR 1 billion is spent on tobacco subsidies annually."
"I would like to take this opportunity to again express my wish that this will change some day."
"Mr President, I rise in defence of the workers in the industry."
"We have a large tobacco industry in Northern Ireland, Gallaher's Ltd. If this directive is adopted, at least 300 jobs will be lost."
"I have studied carefully what the Commissioner said to my colleague Mr Hume: ""No massive job losses in this sector."
"It is not understood how a reduction in tar from 12 to 10 mg, as proposed in the present text, would have noticeable employment effects."""
"The key difference, however, between previous and current reductions in tar ceilings is simply that previous reductions in tar ceilings were limited to the EU."
"Gallaher's has a 25% export volume."
"If this directive is adopted, 300 jobs will go."
"It must be said that the manufacturers will sell not one cigarette fewer than they do now, because they will transfer their business outside the European Union."
"Gallaher's will transfer its business to its Russian factory and the ceilings will be ignored, but we will have exported 300 jobs."
"The job losses in Gallaher's will affect workers about 47 years old on average."
"In Northern Ireland, if you lose your job at 47 there is not much chance of getting another job."
"This is my concern on this issue."
"Mr President, given that some of us have been accused of having shady intentions for arguing that there is a lack of, or rather doubt over, a legal basis for certain articles of the directive which we are debating today, I would like to talk about interinstitutional balance."
"This interinstitutional balance is a source of legitimacy for European integration."
"I would also like to talk about the obligation inherent in the Treaties."
"According to the Treaty, the Commission has had the obligation, for more than two months, to analyse the judgment and to draw the relevant conclusions from it."
"The Commissioner today, for the first time, in his very brief intervention, has used the words ""no doubt"" at least three times and the words ""clear"" or ""clearly"" at least three times."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in law, when one feels the need to say that something is clear, and that there is no doubt about it, it is because there is doubt and it is not clear."
"In this case there is doubt and it is not clear."
"Mr President, how can it be said that a justification in Amendment No 2 respects what the Court of Justice has said, when according to that justification, in order to explain the danger to the internal market, several Member States have indicated that, if certain measures are not adopted, they would seek to legislate?"
"Which Member States?"
"Which measures?"
"That is what we expected from the Commission, that they should tell us, that they should explain this to us."
"Let us take some other examples, Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 18."
"To add the legal basis of Article 133 is legally skilful, but has the Commission really considered Article 131 which is the mother article of external trade policy, and which says that that policy is intended ""to increase the competitiveness of our companies"" ?"
"How does that square with the justification in Amendment No 18, where it says that an exemption period is granted because that could seriously harm our industry?"
"How does that square with that same justification, which says that negotiations must be held within the World Trade Organisation?"
"Mr President, these doubts, these justifiable doubts, which have nothing to do with any shady or mysterious friendship with some company or other, are the reason for the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and I remember that it was 18 votes to 9."
"Although I was not present, my vote, of course, supported the Committee."
"Mr President, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has just put the Commissioner in the dock and, in this case, while we are talking about interinstitutional balance, all the Commission has done is to have tabled a proposal for a directive."
"It is Parliament and the Council who have to approve this proposal for a directive and examine, amongst other things, a suitable legal basis for it."
"Therefore, it is not a question of accusing the Commission of having committed any irregularity."
"Above all, it cannot be accused of any irregularity because the Commission, in this case, has simply tabled a proposal for a directive which revises three previous directives on the content of certain products in tobacco and certain warnings on the packaging of those products."
"Therefore, there is really nothing new here."
"The only new thing is that there has been a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, of 5 October, in which the Court of Justice says that, with regard to another completely different directive, that is, the Directive on tobacco advertising, the legal basis of the current Article 95 - which was formerly Article 100a - was not suitable."
"The reason why the Court of Justice deems this legal basis to be unsuitable is that it believes that, by means of this legal basis, there is a danger of attempts being made to side-step a specific prohibition in another article of the Treaty - which has also changed number: from Article 129 to Article 152 in the current text - in accordance with which, any harmonisation of national provisions was prohibited."
"The Court of Justice is therefore trying to prevent any contrivance by means of which this subterfuge could be employed."
"However, in this case, this situation does not apply because the proposal for a directive, like the previous directives already in force, intends, in fact, to remove existing barriers to the functioning of the internal market."
"Therefore, their correct legal basis is the former Article 100a or the current Article 95."
"The rapporteur, Mr Maaten, has, with good reason, proposed reinforcing that legal basis with a reference to another article, Article 133 on external trade, and furthermore has proposed a series of amendments to some of the articles with the aim of preventing this directive being challenged on the basis of the case-law established by the judgment of the Court of Justice."
"I would like to point out that the judgment of the Court of Justice has been guided by too literal an interpretation of the text."
"This judgment has several questionable aspects but, accepting the judgment as it stands - since we have no choice, given that the court of Justice is the highest body qualified to interpret Community law - there is nothing to prevent this Parliament from declaring itself in favour of the proposed legal basis of Article 95 with Article 133, and introducing the amendments to which I have referred, which include the rapporteur' s amendments."
"Of course, on behalf of the Socialist Group, and specifically the Socialist Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, who voted against this majority opinion to which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has just referred, I must say that we consider that taking this route, rejecting the proposal for a directive, as proposed in two amendments, Amendments Nos 52 and 53, tabled by Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and another 32 MEPs, would lead to a serious restriction on the European Parliament' s legislative powers."
"Therefore, I am not concerned so much at the moment with health issues, which are, of course, important and considerable, as with the constraints that would result from our accepting such a restrictive interpretation of the legislative powers which this European Parliament would have."
"I believe that such a restrictive interpretation would practically lead to the elimination of the legislative powers of this institution and of the Council."
"I do not believe we can take such a restrictive route, that is to say, independently of the content - and the substantial content which has been highlighted by Mr Maaten and others - that there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People' s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying their hands and feet with regard to the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important to the development of Community law."
"For this reason, we Socialists support the amendments tabled by Mr Maaten and we reject, of course, Amendments Nos 52 and 53 by the Group of the European People' s Party."
"Mr President, it is regrettable that despite all the efforts made by rapporteur Maaten, we must conclude that no one is really happy with the developments that now characterise this report."
"I would like to make three brief comments."
"My first comment concerns the legal basis."
"The Court has had a judicial review carried out and states quite explicitly that Article 95 can be the legal basis in some cases, provided certain conditions are met, but also states that Article 95 will not be sufficient in certain cases, for example Article 133 would need to be added where the export ban is concerned."
"In view of the lack of motivation, I therefore support the amendment tabled by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, which calls for us to reject the common position and ask the Commission to submit a new proposal."
"As for the other comments, I would point out that we ought not to concentrate too much on symbols that do not tackle the root cause of the problem."
"Imposing higher taxes is not a satisfactory way of discouraging people from doing something."
"Increasing the space for warnings out of all proportion is not a satisfactory way of achieving the desired goal, i.e. better public health."
"What is more, I feel this will set a poor example if we want to put warnings on other products at a later stage."
"Mr President, we all know that this is an unusually important report we are dealing with here."
"It is important because we are here and now considering just how credible the European Union' s policy on public health is."
"I am sorry that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also expressed opinions that the Court ban on tobacco advertising would in some way render this directive null and void."
"By no means is that true, as this directive concerns the content of cigarettes and not measures to promote tobacco sales."
"Parliament should no longer be deluded in this matter; it should understand that it is now vital to show support for Mr Maaten' s excellent report."
"Now to the matter of whether the words 'light' or 'mild' on brands of tobacco should now be banned."
"We should keep to our opinion that such misleading descriptions cannot be allowed, and the decision of the Court in October brings nothing new to this matter."
"We must maintain the stand we took on this before."
"We must understand that all those countries that have undertaken to draft fairly tough legislation on tobacco have clearly seen deaths from lung cancer and heart and vascular disease brought under control."
"We should be able to promote all of this in the European Union' s common single market policy as well, which must be based on high standards of protection when it comes to public health."
"Mr President, if this proposal actually becomes law at second reading, this will lead to companies' freedom being curtailed somewhat, and to a slight improvement in the protection of public health."
"The strength of this proposal resides in the fact that it is not concerned with the behaviour of individual consumers of tobacco products, but is aimed at making it compulsory for companies to provide all consumers with information, and having the addition of addictive ammonia banned."
"This would make it less easy for the impression to be created that you can smoke without risking premature death."
"It would be more difficult to spread reassuring lies."
"The weakness of the proposal resides in the fact that it places heavy emphasis on the promotion of free competition."
"The imposition of uniform standards in all Member States seems calculated to give the various tobacco companies the same opportunities to earn money throughout the EU."
"This liberal basic principle does not have my group' s blessing."
"Our main concern is to protect people against the damage that tobacco products do to their health."
"My group would rather the proposal had taken an all-encompassing approach."
"Taking public health as the starting point, this would entail a complete ban on advertising and sponsorship and reducing to a minimum the number of young people who take up smoking."
"We would also need to look at what impact a reduction in the production and consumption of tobacco would have in terms of alternative employment for tobacco farmers and tobacco industry workers, how to put an end to the current EU subsidy regime for tobacco cultivation, and what we need to do to oppose international trade in this unwholesome product."
"As long as we fail to do this, each and every European measure can be counteracted by increased exports of American tobacco."
"All we can adopt at second reading is a watered-down version of the most far-reaching proposals that we voted on six months ago after the first reading."
"A watered-down text was adopted back then too, but the Council of Ministers still thinks that Parliament' s opinion goes too far."
"I represent those members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left who supported the rapporteur' s proposals at first reading, and who will also support his watered-down proposal at second reading."
"The proposal is too weak, but without a decision of this kind tobacco products will be able to destroy even more lives."
"Mr President, it is fair to say that we have a moral obligation to fully inform the 30 million consumers of the European Union about the public health dangers of cigarettes."
"Indeed, as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy I have been strongly lobbied by various groups about the need to regulate more strictly the sale and presentation of tobacco products in Europe."
"I welcome the amendments which were passed in our committee recently, which sought to increase warnings to the general public about the dangers of smoking."
"Amendments approved by our committee were to increase the size of the general warnings such as ""smoking kills"", on the front of cigarette packages from 25 to 30% and to increase the size of additional warnings on cigarette packages from 25 to 40%."
"Examples of the additional warnings supported by the Committee for inclusion on cigarette packages are: ""half of smokers die younger""; ""smoking causes fatal lung cancer""; ""smoking is highly addictive""; ""get help to stop ""; and ""protect children, do not make them breathe your smoke""."
"Our committee also believes that warning messages should be attached to vending machines."
"Research has shown that the greater the size of the public health warning on cigarette packets, the greater the reduction in the level of cigarette smoking."
"The results of the research on that matter are so clear that it would be wrong for us, as European Union legislators, not to follow such advice."
"We need to send out a strong message about smoking to the 370 million consumers of the European Union and we are going to give our children and smokers all the necessary public warnings about the health dangers of cigarette smoking."
"In conclusion, since the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Parliament has the power of coordination over environmental and consumer protection matters, and it will, of course, work closely with the Council and the Commission in this regard."
"We regard this procedure as an important legislative weapon of Parliament's arsenal and we intend to use it."
"I compliment the rapporteur on the report."
"Mr President, whilst one cannot but laud the good intentions of Members who support this directive, I should point out that the prohibition on the manufacture of tobacco above EU limits will have a significant effect on jobs in my region."
"In particular, I refer to the British-American Tobacco plant in Southampton, which produces all its cigarettes for the non-EU market."
"With the advent of this directive, the manufacturers will not be able to produce these cigarettes, even though the EU limits do not, of course, apply to their markets."
"However, this does not mean that these cigarettes will not be manufactured."
"The company concerned, BAT, will transfer production to non-EU countries."
"So, instead of exporting cigarettes we will be exporting jobs - 4 000 of them in my region alone."
"Yet, ironically, I do not see in this directive any prohibition on growing tobacco within the Community - even when in countries such as Greece the tobacco grown is so strong that under this directive it would become a criminal offence to use it for manufacturing."
"A Community which subsidises this tobacco-growing and then makes it unlawful to sell it, whilst destroying jobs and the lives of ordinary people who rely on revenue from goods which are not even sold in the Community, cannot gain the respect of ordinary people."
"Whatever you think of this directive, please support my amendment tomorrow which takes out the prohibition on manufacturing for non-EU export."
"This directive will have no health benefits whatsoever outside the EU."
"It is a classic symptom of political correctness gone mad."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to correct a misapprehension: the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rejected the directive as a whole as early as the first reading, although it is true that Parliament did not go along with it."
"Following the European Court of Justice ruling the Committee then adopted the opinion again, admittedly this time by a large majority."
"It is true that the Court's ruling did not, in fact, significantly change the legal position, but it did develop it; some aspects have now been clarified and some points are clearer."
"In fact, it does not actually have anything to do with tobacco: the European Court of Justice's judgment might just as well have been handed down in relation to an advertising ban on alcohol, for example, or an advertising ban on chocolate, because we know that sugar can also be damaging to human health."
"In my opinion, the superficial way in which the Commission and the Council of Ministers have examined this Court ruling in their discussions hitherto is shameful. In fact, it would be truer to say that they have not examined it at all; they have completely ignored it, as Commissioner Byrne did just now, and as is also the case, for example, in the statement of reasons for the common position, in which it was not deemed necessary even to correct and make some adjustments to the recitals either."
"The only laudable exception is Parliament's Legal Service."
"Unfortunately, time does not allow me to go into detail here; that is quite impossible."
"I can only call on colleagues to go along with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"This is not about the tobacco industry; quite simply it is about upholding the Treaties."
"Neither is it about legalistic hair-splitting; it is about an eminently political question, which it does not require any legal training to answer. It is simply about respecting areas of competence and safeguarding subsidiarity and also, for example, the rights of colleagues in the national parliaments, who, of course, are entitled to have their own areas of competence."
"This very issue of delimiting competences was addressed in Nice."
"But if whenever a material majority is found on a specific issue in the three bodies - the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament - this majority is also observed, then we can do without this ceremony and it would suggest that what really matters are institutional safeguards."
"I hope and assume - and here I am also placing my trust in the European Court of Justice - that it will continue to hold its previous course, that it will agree to step up its efforts to safeguard competences and that, for this reason, it will once again annul the directive."
"Mr President, to begin with I would like to congratulate Mr Maaten on a splendid report."
"I also think there is reason to thank Mr Byrne for a very clear presentation of the legal basis."
"When I listen to Mrs Palacio and also to Mr Lechner I am reminded most of all of the reports we are receiving from American courts right now."
"A serious mixture of law and politics, which, in any case, does not increase legal certainty."
"I believe that reducing the limit values for the tar content and reducing some of the limits for how much nicotine and carbon monoxide cigarettes may contain will have an extremely significant effect on health in Europe."
"It is important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additives by the end of 2004 at the latest."
"The secrecy on the part of industry surrounding additives which we have witnessed so far should naturally be brought to an end."
"I also consider it important that, independently of this common list, a ban is imposed on the use of ammonia and other similar compounds used for the express purpose of making cigarettes more addictive, to increase dependence on cigarettes."
"This is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way."
"Finally I would like to make a single comment concerning the matter of exports."
"I simply do not understand why a majority here in Parliament want to propose more lenient rules for exports than those proposed by the Member States' own governments - the governments which, however, also represent the many industries referred to."
"Like Mrs Thyssen, I feel that it is absolutely unethical for us to sell cigarettes outside the area of Europe which, for health reasons, we consider to be unsuitable for use by citizens in our own area."
"It simply cannot be ethically justifiable to act in this way, and I therefore hope that on this point we arrive at the responsible line which I believe the Council and the Commission have proposed."
"Mr President, I think that we need to make the requirements for the manufacture and sale of tobacco tougher and that to do so in a harmonised fashion, by means of a directive which must be respected by all the Member States, could strengthen the objective of preventing consumers from taking up smoking and of protecting them from this habit."
"Nevertheless, I truly consider it to be unacceptable to interpret the differences in criteria with regard to the content of the proposal for a directive in terms of a supposed confrontation between the powerful interests of the tobacco lobbies and the common interest of protecting consumers."
"To accept this would be to misrepresent the legitimate arguments of a good number of Members of the European Parliament who see, in the need to respect the legal aspects, a guarantee of the future viability of our own legislative acts."
"If we believe that we need common rules which are legally binding in order to better protect the public' s health from the risks of tobacco, let us seek a way of doing so, without using loopholes in the law, without back doors through which our good intentions may escape."
"Public opinion cannot and must not be fed solely by political gestures which are not solidly based in the reality of what is possible within the competences conferred on us by the Treaties."
"Mr President, smoking is the tragedy of our time - the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union."
"More than half a million people die needlessly each year in the European Union and the number is set to grow if we do not act now."
"That is why this directive is so important: bigger, bolder, clearer health warnings, a ban on misleading descriptions such as 'light', 'ultra' and 'mild', a maximum tar content for products used in the EU as well as for exports, and, for the first time, a disclosure of ingredients."
"As a relatively new Member of this House it struck me how strong the forces against this directive are in this Parliament."
"There have been so many red herrings thrown into this debate that I think many people would be more comfortable in a fishing debate than in a public health debate."
"The power of big tobacco companies is all too evident."
"I say to each and every one of my colleagues, tobacco is like no other product."
"You become addicted and it kills you."
"It is a fact that 80% of people start smoking before the age of eighteen yet the tobacco industry says people make adult choices."
"It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to stop but there are few policies within the tobacco industry to help those people stop."
"Instead it pretends to tackle youth smoking."
"If we had known at the outset what we know about tobacco now, it would be an A-class drug. It is a fact that in the last century almost twice as many people died because of tobacco than in the two world wars put together."
"If we do not act now, worldwide deaths are estimated at one billion this century."
"Let us make sure that the fight to save lives is paramount and play our part in tackling the power of big tobacco interests, which only destroy lives."
"Mr President, nobody wishes to play down the consequences of smoking on human health, but even if you want this measure and share the health policy objectives, the legal bases have to be right."
"The European Court of Justice recently handed down its judgment in the case of regulating tobacco advertising to protect human health and it is unambiguous: it is not the task of the Commission and the European Union to regulate these matters, but of the Member States."
"Only if the internal market is disrupted does the Union have regulatory powers."
"But the Commission has not submitted one single piece of evidence to show that the internal market is disrupted, not one."
"Quite the opposite."
"Where it actually is disrupted, with the different taxation rates and the special rules for Greece, everything is staying as it was."
"It is therefore ridiculous for people to act here, Commissioner, as though the ruling of the European Court of Justice had not changed anything."
"This ignorance really is staggering."
"I predict that this directive, too, will fall before the European Court of Justice, and Parliament and the Commission will make a fool of themselves just as they did the first time, if we are not prepared to examine the legal aspects."
"Commissioner, you are a Guardian of the Treaties and not someone who can overstep your competences here on your own initiative."
"If you enlist Article 133 for the export ban then the conclusion is obvious that it is not part of a common commercial policy to dictate to third countries what they should import."
"This legal basis, too, is completely worthless in my opinion, and that is why the unions, companies and colleagues here are right to refer to job losses."
"Ten thousand jobs because of the export ban alone, 8 000 of which are in the United Kingdom, are at stake."
"This does not help anyone to achieve their objectives because production is not reduced, it is just moved."
"We are seeking to dictate to others how they should live."
"This is presumptuous and it will not become law."
"Mr President, tobacco wrecks lives."
"To the shame of this European Union, we require our taxpayers to subsidise the growing of the wretched stuff to the tune of over EUR 1 billion a year."
"At the same time, we jeopardise sensible measures to deter smoking, especially among young people, because we try to put the whole world within our single market."
"If we insist on telling other countries what health standards they should set by extending our sensible proposals for the domestic market to exports, we shall put all Mr Maaten's good work at risk."
"Because, as sure as export night follows advertising day, there will be another challenge in the courts, and not just the export provision but the whole directive with it will be thrown out."
"I should like the Commissioner to clarify whether the removal of the exemption for exports applies just to the tar and nicotine levels, as was the impression given in committee, or to all the proposals in the directive."
"We need to know because thousands of jobs are at stake in Darlington, Nottingham, Southampton and Belfast."
"Those jobs could be destroyed very quickly by our misunderstanding and our vote."
"I want to see sensible measures go through and not lost."
"I want to see an end to misleading descriptions such as 'mild' and 'light' that give the impression that some cigarettes are safer: deeper inhalation means they are not."
"These labels should go."
"There should be no exemption for trademarks or we will simply create new anomalies in competition and the single market."
"I want to see the photographic warning option, sensible listing of ingredients, Europe-wide research, health promotion measures to help children to remain smoke, tar, nicotine and addiction free."
"I do not want to see all this put at risk because we tried to take this measure beyond the legal powers of this European Union and this Parliament."
"Mr President, the tobacco directive addresses two points that are very dear to my group' s heart: the harmonisation of the internal market and public health."
"Health organisations are justifiably calling for more protection for public health."
"Hence, we are all in favour of the directive and of reducing tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields."
"That is also why we approve of increasing the size of the warnings, in accordance with the common position, and why, as per the common position, we favour short, pithy warnings on cigarette packets and support a ban on the use of misleading words such as 'mild' , 'light' , and 'ultra-light' ."
"Only where these terms are part of registered trademarks which are already marketed could consideration be given to granting derogations."
"The industry complains about the inequality and inefficiency of the present legislation."
"The inequality concerns the permitted ingredients, for example."
"We readily support the proposal to produce a list of permitted ingredients."
"The testing procedure is inefficient."
"As matters stand, each product has to be re-tested in each country."
"We are in favour of devising a standardised testing method recognised by all EU Member States, to be implemented by an approved testing laboratory."
"We would also like a test of this kind, carried out in a laboratory recognised by a Member State, to be valid in all EU Member States, as is customary in the field of medicine, so as to cut down on the number of tests performed on animals, for example."
"We would ask that special consideration be given to the position of SMEs."
"This is hit disproportionately hard by the directive in some cases, specifically by Article 6(1)."
"We will therefore vote in favour of the amendment that does request information on the ingredients used, but which proposes a more realistic working method than is outlined at present in the common position."
"I have the following to say about the legal basis. The directive builds on three existing directives on the same subject which have the same legal basis."
"These have never caused problems with regard to the legal basis hitherto."
"The legal services of the EU institutions do not foresee any problems in this area."
"We will certainly assume the legal basis to be valid once Article 133 has been added."
"Naturally, we want to follow correct legal procedures and it would, of course, be regrettable if the Court were ultimately to reject the position of our legal services, but we cannot afford to discard the directive because then we would have nothing, all the work would have been for nothing and we might as well start all over again with the same old work and the same texts."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, the important thing now is to show political courage and produce a directive which improves the functioning of the internal market and provides maximum protection in the field of public health."
"Mr President, I am grateful to my group for being willing to allow me extra time."
"I would very much like to thank the Commissioner for his comments on the legal basis."
"For brevity' s sake, I would like to echo what Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Lund had to say on the matter."
"I do have two additional comments to make."
"The first concerns Article 11."
"The reports produced by this committee are crucial in terms of future policy."
"I am also delighted that this Commissioner is responsible for it."
"I do have my concerns as to whether the Commission has the capacity to work on this report."
"I am hoping the Commissioner might reassure us that an increase in the level of staff support within the Commission is on the cards."
"Finally, Mr President, major alterations must be made to the Council' s common position."
"It is important in terms of the legal basis, more far-reaching harmonisation of the market, better consumer protection and so on. Each of these elements in isolation probably lacks sufficient support here in Parliament for a qualified majority to be achieved."
"But as a package, it should lead to better balanced and more results-orientated legislation."
"There was also a readiness to compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I have in mind Mrs Martens and Mr Sacconi and our cooperation with them."
"I therefore urge you to support this compromise package."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by relating a little of the history of how this directive came before Parliament."
"This directive was introduced to take account of the European Parliament's Valverde L√≥pez report of 1997 which mentioned many of the elements of the present text and called for a proposal from the Commission."
"The second reading debate on this proposal marks very swift progress."
"It shows the urgency with which the Council of Ministers and Parliament have both dealt with this matter."
"I should also like to stress the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, to advance with this file in a balanced and conscientious way."
"The health effects of tobacco use are now widely recognised and there is a shared feeling among legislators and the public alike that the time has come to adopt stringent rules and regulations on this product."
"The proposal contains some significant improvements on the present legal situation and aims to create harmonised rules on a series of product regulation issues."
"On others, the groundwork has been put in place to gather the elements needed for subsequent initiatives."
"One of the principal improvements concerns a new lower tar ceiling and, for the first time, a carbon monoxide and nicotine ceiling in cigarettes."
"Controversially, these ceilings would cover all products manufactured in the Union, whether for domestic consumption or not."
"The arguments which have been presented about possible job losses have been carefully weighed against the certainty that if we act otherwise we would be exporting a product not considered good enough for Community citizens."
"I might also mention that the figures put forward for potential job losses were already an issue when the original directives now being recast were proposed over ten years ago."
"The job losses then forecast never occurred."
"In fact, the main job reductions in this industry are due to increased investment in automation, as the firms themselves have declared."
"The Commission would nevertheless see an argument for an extended transitional period for the application of the rules for exported products, in order to allow more time for manufacturing formulae to be changed and new marketing approaches to be undertaken."
"Mr Bowis asked whether the exemption would apply."
"The exemption would apply to Article 3, as I understand the amendment, i.e. tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels."
"As regards the question of descriptors, I would stress that the effect of the use of certain terms such as 'light' , 'low-tar' and 'mild' can be very misleading."
"People change from one type of cigarette to another under the false assumption that the 'light' cigarette is safer for their health."
"This is also a factor in why people continue to smoke instead of trying to stop."
"Therefore, the need to regulate in the interests of consumers is clear."
"Indeed, in the negotiations presently under way for a World Health Organisation framework convention on public health, the same provisions are currently proposed."
"Consequently, the Community rules will fit well into the future international arrangements, avoiding the danger of trade barriers and reinforcing, at the same time, the protection of consumers and ensuring a high level of health."
"I should add that the European Court of Justice has stated in its judgment on Case 376/98 that public health provides a legal basis in addition to and in association with its Article 95."
"In fact, I would draw your attention to the judgment of the Court."
"I am not fully convinced that everybody here who has pronounced on the issue has read a copy of the judgment."
"I would recommend it to those who have not."
"For instance, Paragraph 88 of the judgment further states: ""Furthermore, provided that the conditions for recourse to Article 100a [that is now 95] and 66 as a legal basis are fulfilled, the Community legislature cannot be prevented from relying on that legal basis on the ground that public health protection is a decisive factor in the choices to be made."
"On the contrary, the third paragraph of Article 129(1) provides that health requirements are to form a constituent part of the Community's other policies, and Article 100a(3) expressly requires that, in the process of harmonisation, a high level of human health protection is to be ensured."""
"I also refer you to Paragraph 98 of the judgment."
"Let me read that in the context of the challenge made to me as to whether there is a substantial legal basis or not."
"""In principle, therefore, a directive prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in periodicals, magazines and newspapers could be adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty with a view to ensuring the free movement of press products, on the lines of Directive 89/552, Article 13 of which prohibits television advertising of tobacco products in order to promote the free broadcasting of television programmes."""
"It is quite clear from the judgment that the judges took the view that Article 95 could be used as a legal basis for regulating the internal market."
"In fact, in coming to their conclusion as to what was the appropriate judgment in this particular case, they took the view that some aspects of regulating the market in tobacco and advertising could be permitted and some not."
"They went on to say in Paragraph 117 of the judgment: ""As has been observed in Paragraphs 98 and 111 of this judgment, a directive prohibiting certain forms of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products could have been adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty."
"However, given the general nature of the prohibition of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products laid down by the directive, partial annulment of the directive would entail amendment by the Court of provisions of the directive. Such amendments are a matter for the Community legislature."
"It is not therefore possible for the Court to annul the directive partially."""
"That is a very important paragraph in the judgment of the Court."
"It clearly indicates that the decision taken by the Court was such that it said: some of this is permissible, some of it is not."
"Given the general nature of the directive, we cannot sever one from the other and, therefore, we have to strike it all down."
"There is a clear signpost here as to how we can move forward on these issues."
"In answer to the question on exports that Mr Bowis asked me earlier, it is quite clear that, in the unlikely event that the aspect of the directive that refers to exports is challenged and if the view of the Court - which I do not predict - is that it is not supported by the legal basis, it is clearly severable from the directive."
"Therefore, even in those circumstances, the directive would survive."
"In this respect, let me point out that, from the point of view of international and Community rules, there is no exception for registered trade marks in measures taken for public-health protection, particularly here, where the effects on smokers' behaviour are so dramatic."
"On ammonia, let me say that the Commission considers a ban to be very premature and cannot find a scientific argument for such an approach at this stage."
"It would be preferable to wait until the overall question of additives is dealt with in the first Commission report."
"However, it is also clear that concern on this question is fuelled by internal company information released through court proceedings."
"It would not be prudent to ignore this data."
"That is why the Commission proposes to deal with the ammonia issue in a measured way, after seeking scientific advice and having considered all the available information."
"It will, in particular, report on the alleged use of additives to increase the addictive nature of tobacco products."
"On the issue of additives in general, the Commission is ready and willing to give priority attention to this issue on the basis of the information it receives from manufacturers and importers."
"This was said in the declaration made when the common position was adopted."
"To do so before we have the necessary data would be speculative and premature."
"We need to have sufficient time to analyse this information and to consult expert opinion."
"In addition, the Commission wishes to preserve its right of initiative under the Treaty in this respect."
"On the size of the warning labels, I am sure that a satisfactory compromise can be achieved, based perhaps on the Commission's amended proposal of June, which already went towards the amendments made at first reading."
"The use of coloured photos to accompany texts is perhaps premature and not fully evaluated at this stage."
"The Commission would prefer to examine the available data and report back in due course."
"The creation of a maximum-sized warning label for some large packs would be a proportionate solution."
"Mr Davies said in relation to the coloured photographs that Member States might be given permission to have this form of advertising on the packet."
"I do not agree with that view for two reasons: firstly, this would run counter to the concept of harmonisation, which is the justification for using Article 95 as the basis; secondly, even if Member States wanted to advertise in this way, it does not require any sanction or authorisation by legislation at EU level to do so."
"The issue of vending machines falls outside the scope of this text but the Commission would be willing to examine it in another context to see what approaches would be possible."
"This is linked to the question of access to products, in particular where machines are situated in unsupervised areas."
"On the amendment dealing with GMOs, the Commission considers that this would be better dealt with as an additional recital rather than mentioning it in an article by itself."
"On laboratory tests, the amendment dealing with approval of tests is superfluous as another article provides for circulation of goods that are in accordance with the provisions of the directive."
"We also need to make provision for results of tests to be controlled where necessary."
"As regards frequency of notifications by industry, it seems clear that annual notifications are unnecessary."
"On the common agricultural policy, this is not an issue touched on by this text and to mention it in the recitals would not be legally sound."
"In any case, a full review of the common agricultural policy on tobacco is scheduled for 2002."
"On taxation, I quite agree that the price of tobacco products, and by extension the issue of tobacco taxes, is a key issue in reducing the attraction of tobacco for the young."
"However, this aspect is not the subject of the present directive."
"We have to be careful not to introduce elements which are not covered by the internal market or common commercial policy legal basis."
"The Commission reports on the application of the excise directives address this problem in the proper way."
"Finally, a total of 54 amendments have been tabled in the report and of these I am pleased to inform you that the Commission can accept 33, either totally or partially."
"It cannot, however, accept the following amendments: Nos 6, 8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 25, 28, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 40, 45, 46, 47, 49, 52, 53 and 54."
"Thus, the amendments that the Commission has accepted will make this a much improved text and take account of the main concerns expressed by Members."
"I should again like to thank Members for their positive contributions and Mr Maaten for his excellent work in this case."
"Summer time"
"The next item is the report (A5-0356/2000) by Mrs Honeyball, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on summer time arrangements [COM(2000)0302 - C5-0322/2000-2000/0140(COD)]."
"Madam President, this report is very straightforward: at present, directives on summer time only last for five years, and then have to come back to Parliament to be renewed."
"What this report is suggesting is that those arrangements be made permanent, so that we have summer time in place in perpetuity, as it were, rather than its having to be ratified by this Parliament every five years."
"There is no good reason not to accept that in principle."
"Indeed, there are many very strong arguments in favour of having summer time. These arguments include less energy consumption; transport; hotels and restaurants, which have found planning easier; leisure activities; increasing the quality of life; and helping to prevent disruption of people's bio-rhythms."
"Most Member States accept and want summer time, and thus this report is not at all controversial."
"The advantage of making summer time a permanent arrangement would be to make planning easier."
"Particular sectors involved in this, for example, IT and computers, transport, communications, air and rail, have said to us and to the Commission that they would find it very helpful to know that there will be summer time every year, that it will be permanent, so they can make forward-planning arrangements."
"There is also a good argument in terms of the single market, where again similar planning considerations apply."
"In terms of the substance of the report, what is being suggested is that the current arrangements, with summer time starting on the last Sunday in March and ending on the last Sunday in October, remain in place and are made permanent arrangements."
"However, amendments have been put forward calling for a review and for a report to be produced at the end of five years."
"As the rapporteur, I would recommend that these amendments be supported as they make a lot of sense."
"The main argument in favour of these amendments and of a report at the end of five years actually concerns enlargement of the European Union, which, following the Nice Summit, is particularly apposite and appropriate."
"The point is that if new Member States join us they may not have existing arrangements which conform with what we are proposing, and they may well need time to come into line with our arrangements and to bring about the sort of harmonisation we are proposing."
"In view of the changes that we will very likely be undergoing, it would not be a very good idea to introduce permanent arrangements now, with no opportunity for a review."
"That is the strongest argument in favour of having a review and therefore supporting the amendments to that effect."
"There are other issues we would still like to look at, issues like energy consumption and health and safety, as they relate to summer time; but the strongest argument is undoubtedly that we want to allow new Member States the opportunity to come into line with the arrangements."
"So, I would ask Parliament, when the vote takes place, to support all these amendments so that we can have the best possible arrangements for the existing Member States and for future Member States."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer time arrangements that we are examining today is a good proposal."
"It is a proposal based on extensive research carried out at the request of the Commission. The results of that research are interesting in that they contradict certain generally accepted ideas."
"First, most sectors of the economy have now incorporated the principle of summer time."
"What is more, some socio-economic sectors, particularly IT, transport, telecommunications and tourism, have asked for the change to summer time to become permanent."
"In fact, time is a basic datum which these sectors need to incorporate into their products and services."
"That means they need to know about the arrangements for changing to summer time in all the Member States in advance."
"Secondly, certain assumed negative effects have clearly not materialised."
"Thus, in terms of health, any problems experienced are of short duration and fully reversible."
"Nor do the results of the survey indicate any negative effects on animal biorhythms or working conditions on farms."
"On the other hand, the research reveals other, less expected, implications."
"Summer time seems to be in step with the way lifestyles are developing in our societies, due in particular to later working hours, and the extension of hours for shops, public services and transport."
"The extra hour of daylight provided by moving to summer time is particularly beneficial in the tourism and leisure sector, where increases in business directly linked to lighter and longer evenings have been recorded."
"Summer time definitely seems to go hand-in-hand with better quality of life, as the positive effects of the summer time period are far more significant than the transitional problems linked to the change itself."
"The European Parliament has only one amendment to the initial proposal from the European Commission."
"It calls for a report every five years on the incidence of the arrangements under the Summer Time Directive."
"If these reports show that the summer time arrangements need to be altered, the Commission could then bring forward appropriate proposals."
"The first report will be drafted by 30 April 2007, at the latest."
"I do not think this amendment runs counter to the aim of the Commission' s proposal."
"It will facilitate monitoring of the implementation of the time change without undermining the principle."
"At the end of the day we cannot but welcome the Commission' s proposal to make the change to summer time a permanent instrument of European policy by finally establishing the summer time arrangements for an unlimited period."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again I see that a far-reaching debate is raging about the pros and cons of summer time."
"In the main, this is, as I see it, more of a philosophical discussion than a serious debate about a real policy of substance."
"I do not therefore think that we should dwell on this matter for too long in this House; after all the Member States and also the public have already accepted the summer time arrangements to a large extent and they are acknowledged to be part of our calendar."
"We should, therefore, really not rack our brains over this any longer."
"In-depth research, as has also been called for in various quarters, would therefore in my opinion also be a waste of time and money. Surely we have, as I see it, much more serious problems to cope with in Europe, such as the transport situation, enlargement and, at this very moment, BSE."
"It is also obvious that there has to be agreement across the EU on when the clocks are changed because anything else - as has already been said - would lead to hopeless confusion."
"I also think that the public would rightly question the point or otherwise of much EU legislation."
"From the point of view of farmers - this has also already been said - repeatedly switching between summer and winter time is not exactly ideal for our farms, either as far as the animals are concerned or the actual work on the farm."
"Nevertheless, I will say quite openly that there are more advantages than disadvantages in favour of changing the clocks and in favour of keeping the summer time arrangements as they currently stand."
"We should leave the arrangements as they are and in my opinion prolong them indefinitely."
"Consequently, I can say on behalf of my group that we do not wish to accept any amendments."
"I have said this because I and my group are convinced that Europe has more serious problems and tasks to deal with."
"Summer time is not the problem for our common European House."
"Madam President, since the 1970s various Member States have applied the practice of switching to summer time."
"The dates for starting and ending summer time were harmonised, finally, a few years ago so that they have been the same in all the Member States of the EU since 1996."
"We have become used to the practice, as the previous speaker just said."
"The proposal that has now been made is, in the opinion of our group, a good one, and our group supports it, and no more amendments to it are needed."
"The main issue here is that summer time is applied in all Member States and that the date it starts and the date it ends remain uniform throughout the EU."
"It is to be welcomed that the proposal states that matters connected with time zones and summer time provisions should be matters for Member States to decide."
"Harmonisation is necessary only in connection with the practice of summer time starting and ending at the same time in each of the Member States."
"A harmonised summer time will remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, services and people and promote the more effective realisation of the internal market."
"Studies on the effects of summer time do not clearly reveal whether the effects, for example on agriculture, are positive or negative."
"The greatest concerns are mainly to do with the welfare of animals and the working conditions of farmers."
"The adoption of summer time has meant energy savings, even if they have only been very slight, according to reports."
"Studies show that traffic safety has improved with the evenings staying light for longer."
"Long, light evenings also mean opportunities for extended leisure time."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now to be enshrined in law that summer time, which without a doubt has proved its worth, will begin on the last Sunday in March and end on the last Sunday in October throughout Europe."
"These provisions are contained in the Commission proposal on summer time arrangements."
"In addition, for the first time the directive is to remain in force indefinitely."
"This is necessary and good."
"The Commission is simply required to report on the impact of the directive after five years."
"It is absolutely essential to the smooth functioning of European industry, particularly in the fields of transport, communication, tourism and IT, that it have a stable and long-term framework in which to plan."
"Countless statements from industrial sectors show that this long-term stability of summer time dates is urgently necessary for the harmonious functioning of the internal market."
"For economic and social reasons it is simply imperative that the summer time arrangements are clear, comprehensible and long-term, so that people can plan ahead and do not need to worry that one day this policy will suddenly be reversed."
"The amendments which have been tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur are therefore, in my opinion, unhelpful, because they tend to create uncertainty rather than increase confidence."
"A one-off review by the Commission in five years' time will suffice."
"I would therefore urge Members to adopt the same stance in Parliament as was adopted in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, namely to confirm the Commission proposal as it stands and thus reject the amendments."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the darkest time of the year approaches it is heartening to speak of summer, or even summer time."
"However, I would like to focus attention on this ritual of changing the clocks every spring and autumn, the purpose of which may be controversial."
"Farmers have told me that the welfare of dairy cattle is a priority, and their protection is also important for milk production."
"The peace of mind of ruminants is already being disturbed by mad cow disease."
"Additional stress should not now be caused them through having them deviate from their normal rhythm."
"Cows do not adjust to a change of rhythm in the space of just a day or two."
"It also causes problems for agriculture when during autumn threshing the morning dew ought to have disappeared according to the time by the clock, but, wonder of wonders, nature has not been following the directive."
"An additional problem is that not only is the natural rhythm of animals disturbed, but people' s alertness, which is partly dependent on daylight, is also affected."
"I think that the Commission' s arguments in its communication in favour of the necessity of summer time are by no means watertight."
"In my opinion, whether or not the arrangement is continued should therefore be re-examined as soon as possible."
"It is also questionable as to whether summer time should end just before November."
"In snow-white Northern Europe the memory of summer has already cooled by then."
"It would be reasonable to end summer time at the end of September, approximately six months after it starts."
"I am by no means totally opposed to summer time, as it also has its advantages."
"Nevertheless, I would ask the Commission to deliver a critical assessment of whether summer time is necessary in the future."
"I certainly believe that we could get along without it, although I am not prepared to give up the warm summer weather."
"But that is something politicians fortunately cannot make decisions about."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today is intended to extend the existing arrangements concerning the dates and times when the summer time period begins and ends, that is, on the last Sunday in March and the last Sunday in October at 1 o' clock in the morning Greenwich Mean Time."
"Allow me, first of all, to congratulate your rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, for her excellent work and the report she has produced."
"You will have noted that, compared with the earlier directives the arrangements proposed are of indefinite duration."
"The study ordered by the Commission in 1999, in accordance with the commitment it gave to the Council and European Parliament when the eighth directive was adopted, concludes that the arrangements are widely accepted both by the public and by the various sectors of activity."
"However, it has become apparent that adopting the arrangements for a comparatively short period could cause difficulties for certain sectors."
"For example, the transport sector in particular, but also other sectors of industry, requires stable, long-term planning on account of technical requirements connected with the preparation of transport timetables."
"There are also the requirements of manufacturers of computers or electronic tachographs and producers of calendars and diaries."
"Last but not least, the time-consuming and expensive repetition of legislative procedures at fairly close intervals at both Community and national level should be avoided."
"While these are all reasons militating in favour of adopting open-ended arrangements, as a precaution the Commission has made provision for drawing up, no later than five years after the first year of application of the directive, a report based on information supplied by each Member State."
"On this point I am pleased to note that the Commission's proposal has been favourably received by the European Parliament."
"As regards the amendments tabled, the Commission can agree to Amendments Nos 3 and 4 since they aim at making the system more transparent and emphasise the precautionary principle."
"As regards Amendment No 1, the Commission cannot accept the part of the amendment which obliges it to make a periodic report every five years, nor the reference to the enlargement process."
"It can agree to make appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report of 2007 referred to in Article 5."
"Concerning Amendment No 2 to Recital 6a, the Commission cannot accept it for two reasons: on the one hand the scope of the investigations should not be restricted to a few requirements, and on the other hand, the proposed amendment to Recital 6a does not relate to a specific article of the directive."
"Nevertheless, I would like to allay your concerns by saying that the Commission will of course instruct the Member States in good time, so that they can send in all necessary information and data related to the various sectors concerned by the issue."
"By way of conclusion, I look forward to a rapid adoption of the proposed directive to ensure that no difficulties are encountered in the sectors concerned."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Clinical trials of medicines for human use"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0349/2000) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use [8878/1/2000 - C5-0424/2000 - 1997/0197(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Liese)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, medical research which is essential for patients must be approved quickly and with minimum bureaucracy, but at the same time ethical boundaries must be strictly respected and the subjects must be given maximum protection from abuse."
"This was the European Parliament's objective in the legislative procedure on clinical trials, and I believe that today we can say that this objective has been achieved."
"In an informal trilogue last week, the Council told us that it could accept most of the amendments tabled by the lead committee and that there were a number of places where it wanted further drafting changes, which we can make through compromise amendments tabled by four groups tomorrow."
"For a long time, it seemed as though an agreement was going to be impossible."
"Positions here in Parliament were very far apart, but they were equally divergent between the Member States and the different institutions."
"We have now reached an agreement and I should like to thank all those involved for their part in achieving this: colleagues, the Commission, also the Council, and, in particular, the French Presidency."
"The compromises which we have agreed greatly improve the common position from the European Parliament's point of view."
"There is clarification that, as a general rule, consent in a clinical trial has to be given in writing."
"There is clarification that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted."
"There is recognition that non-commercial clinical trials, which industry either cannot or will not support, are nevertheless important and that rules need to be drawn up for them."
"I am particularly pleased that we have struck a very good compromise on clinical tests on people who are unable to give legal consent themselves."
"This issue of research involving those who are incapable of giving informed consent has caused heated controversy in the Member States, as well as here in Strasbourg in the Council of Europe."
"Positions also differed amongst those involved in this legislative procedure."
"Originally, the Council did not want to include any provision in the directive at all and wanted to leave it up to the Member States."
"The European Parliament decided at first reading that clinical trials of this kind should only be permitted if it could be shown that each individual clinical trial was of direct benefit to each individual patient."
"Now we have found a compromise, and I do not think that it is a compromise formula or a formulaic compromise; it is a proposal supported by the facts which provides a good solution to the problem, at least in this field."
"As far as the direct benefit is concerned, investigators running clinical trials have to identify those cases where it is necessary to administer medical products and carry out the accompanying examinations in order to draw conclusions for future patients."
"This is an important condition which we make here in our report."
"Then a distinction has to be drawn between children and adults who are incapable of giving informed consent."
"Children's metabolisms have particular characteristics, which is why medicines which are administered to children also need to be tested on children in clinical trials."
"This is not the case in many areas at present."
"Children are given medicines which have only been tested on adults, which means that children are badly treated."
"The report aims to ensure that children in Europe receive better treatment in the future, that they suffer fewer side effects and are given the right doses."
"We have drawn up very, very strict rules for this."
"The rules, which were drawn up in committee, which the Council will accept and which Parliament will hopefully adopt tomorrow, are stricter than those laid down by the Council of Europe in its so-called Bioethics Convention, but the rules explicitly permit research, and we think that this research - when it is conducted in accordance with the rules - is extremely important."
"In this respect I am therefore happy with the compromise which has been reached."
"I am unhappy with two aspects."
"Originally at the first reading we had demanded a shorter deadline for authorising clinical trials, and I had hoped that the deadline of 60 days, which is provided for in the common position, would be reduced somewhat, at least for the national authorities."
"You see, I believe that it is perfectly acceptable to grant a rather longer deadline to an Ethics Committee, whose work is not the main job of the people who work there, but surely the authorities should be put under some pressure to start the work quickly."
"Unfortunately, it was unlikely that a compromise would be reached on this basis in the Council, and I would therefore prefer to put the compromise struck with the Council to the vote rather than having a long conciliation procedure, with perhaps no agreement at the end."
"The situation is the same for the issue of whether the principal investigator should be a doctor or whether other professions should also be authorised."
"Parliament continues to want doctors to be the only ones to carry out clinical trials in all of the Member States because we believe that nurses and midwives should not be active in this sensitive area even if they have additional training, and neither should biologists or pharmaceutical chemists, who may only have worked in the laboratory and not have sufficient experience with patients."
"I must concede, however, that the Council was not prepared to compromise further here either."
"That is why we must, with a heavy heart, agree to this compromise."
"If we accept it we will still have a directive which guarantees therapeutic progress and which does not just leave the protection of patients in Europe as it is but improves it, and that is why I would plead in favour of this compromise."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive, before us today for the second time, falls within the delicate context of international competition in pharmaceutical research and major health challenges, particularly in paediatric medicine. It allows us to resolve the problem of clinical trials being held simultaneously in several Member States and at several locations."
"The common position forwarded to us by the Council is some improvement on the Commission' s proposal and especially on Parliament' s first reading."
"There are several points we can agree with."
"Thus, the principle selected for starting a clinical trial is tacit authorisation from both the Ethics Committee and the competent authorities in the Member States."
"The opinion of the Ethics Committee is determinant as it comes first and the absence of a negative opinion in fact means the trial can begin immediately without loss of time."
"Finally, we agree with the Council' s proposals on labelling medicines used in such trials."
"On the other hand, some other points could be improved and I am glad the Council is prepared, as I understand it, to make a number of compromises."
"I do not think there can be any question of compromise on the first point, which I consider essential. The consent of persons taking part in a clinical trial must necessarily be given in writing and if that is not possible, for example in case of temporary inability to write, a witness must be present when consent is received."
"Secondly, consent must be informed, which means, in particular, that the person taking part must have been informed of the conditions under which the trial is to be conducted, the potential risks that he runs and his unrestricted right to withdraw from the trial at any time."
"Finally - and I think this point is fundamental - we must ensure that the greatest possible protection is guaranteed to those who are not in a position to give their consent: the weakest, children and legally incapacitated adults."
"They must be able to expect direct benefit from the clinical trial."
"In particular, the opinion of minors must at least be listened to because account must be taken of their clinical and psychological characteristics."
"It seems to me right not to include adults incapable of giving consent in clinical trials that could be carried out on adults who are capable."
"Finally, adults incapable of giving consent should only participate in trials that relate to the condition affecting them and causing their incapacity."
"So, although there are still some points of disagreement with the Council, I would like to remind you that the result we are seeking to obtain through the adoption of this directive is the outcome of lengthy and fruitful compromise negotiations between Mr Liese, our rapporteur, whom I thank and congratulate on his inclusive and constructive approach, and the Council, which has proved cooperative and open to the amendments adopted at second reading in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"So after what Mr Liese has just told us, I am very hopeful that we will rapidly reach an agreement allowing us to avoid a long conciliation that would be not very productive in the end."
"Madam President, I would like to join Mrs Patrie in warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mr Liese, for all his efforts to find a consensus."
"We are dealing with a particularly important directive here."
"It may contribute to improving clinical research in Europe and hence the welfare of millions of sick people."
"The sector is sensitive. It is a matter of scientific progress, but also ethics and morals: in short, value judgments."
"Since the first reading, Parliament has concentrated on the protection of people incapable of giving informed consent to these clinical trials: children and adults with a mental handicap."
"These groups must remain within the scope of the directive."
"Excluding them would mean obstructing research into conditions specifically affecting them. In some cases scientific and experimental research is their only hope."
"Besides, we know that empirically dividing the adult dose to treat children has already led to tragedy in the past."
"Then there is the opposite extreme, children not treated because, although the specific medicine to cure them exists, it has not been tested for them."
"So we want these groups to benefit from advances in research, while laying down conditions for these trials which are as severe and strict as possible."
"That is the aim of Amendments Nos 36 and 37 in particular: full and objective information, adapted to children - a point I consider very important; informed written consent from parents or legal representatives; exclusion of any financial advantage; control of protocol by ethics committees."
"In these amendments we also refer, not once but twice, to the fact that the interests of the patient are always more important than those of science and society."
"Children and disabled people are fragile people who need maximum protection."
"But there must be no ban: these patients must not be shut out beyond the gates of hope research represents for them, sometimes the last thread still linking them to life."
"One more word, on another point I consider highly important, I mean Amendment No 30 which concerns non-commercial clinical trials."
"It is crucial that the directive take account of this academic research. Nor must it be penalised."
"It is especially beneficial to the patients concerned."
"I am particularly thinking of cancer research, but there are many others."
"Madam President, I am pleased that so many colleagues have emphasised how important it is to us - and this is, I believe, the central point in this debate - to protect particularly vulnerable groups of people, namely children and those who are unable to give informed consent, and to ensure that no research is carried out which is useful to others unless it is also of direct benefit to them."
"I should, however, also like to remind you that it was the Green Group which made this proposal at the first reading, in the face of much resistance - including, I am afraid, from the current rapporteur. We did so in an amendment tabled at the time which many colleagues here supported and which provided that no research should be carried out on those unable to give written consent unless it was of direct benefit to them."
"It was only, in my view, this amendment, tabled by us, that made this important debate possible."
"I should like to stress this once more: I am glad that the rapporteur has given ground on this point because it has allowed us to reach what I believe is a very good compromise."
"This compromise, which of course can be further improved upon by each Member State, constitutes a minimum standard, to ensure that we do not have a kind of ethical dumping in the European Union and to avoid a situation where it is possible to carry out research on those unable to give informed consent in one Member State and not in others."
"I should also like to stress once more that this compromise goes beyond the proposals in the Council of Europe's Bioethics Convention, because we have much greater protection for patients, with a much stronger link to their own interests, for example, consent given by a representative can be revoked at any time."
"I am also pleased, however, that we have succeeded in clamping down on germ-line gene therapy."
"It must be quite clear that clinical research which seeks to introduce germ-line manipulation by the back door must not be possible, because this would be a violation of human dignity."
"That is why I believe that this compromise is very good, particularly when you consider that the Member States are able to introduce even stricter rules."
"Through this compromise we are making it clear that there must be no ethical dumping at European level and that there must be no research which is of benefit to outsiders on those unable to give informed consent."
"Finally, I should like to cordially request that the Council re-examine our amendment on placebos."
"Here, as you know, we have proposed that research involving placebos should only take place if it can be proved that there is no other way of monitoring effectiveness, because we wish to avoid research taking place if there is no direct benefit, but at the same time we wish to enable research to happen."
"That is why we made this proposal, and I should like to ask the French Presidency to kindly make a note to answer this question."
"Madam President, health is the most precious of gifts and everything must be done to maintain and restore it."
"That is why medical science should be given every possible means of properly protecting individual and public health."
"Unfortunately, although the right measures are taken, they are unable to prevent new risks and diseases from emerging which the drugs available are unable to treat, and the medical community is obliged to find modern, more effective ways of meeting these challenges."
"Clinical trials are a necessary step in this direction, provided that they are conducted in a way which safeguards the dignity and the mental and physical welfare of the subjects."
"Current differences between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in the Member States are creating obstacles to and competition between pharmaceutical companies in their bid to make new drugs quickly available to patients."
"Hence the need for harmonisation at European level."
"Because it recognises the importance of this directive, the European Parliament has endeavoured to overcome its differences rather than hold up the legislative process, focusing on the following safety conditions for clinical trials: the written consent of the subjects to the clinical trial, the consent of the guardian or an authority provided for by law and of the treating doctor to the participation of persons with impaired understanding or a mental disorder which prevents them from giving their consent, the criterion being that the expected benefits of the drug being tested must outweigh any side effects."
"The participation of children in clinical trials must be regulated properly because it is a particularly sensitive issue."
"Finally, and here I am dissatisfied with the Council's compromise proposals, I think that the main investigator during clinical trails should be a doctor, because only a doctor has the knowledge and experience needed in order to evaluate the benefits and deal with any side effects or risks which arise during the clinical trial."
"Of course, the team conducting the clinical trial may include other specialists with the relevant qualifications."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to reach a compromise."
"Madam President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, and congratulate him on the excellent report he has presented, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the work done."
"The Commission would be happy if, after so much effort on the part of those concerned, we could achieve harmonisation, at Community level, of the requirements for conducting clinical trials."
"Indeed, this is particularly important for the protection of public health."
"As you know, since 1965 Community legislation on pharmaceuticals has required medicines to obtain marketing authorisation before being put on sale."
"Authorisation is only granted if three fundamental criteria are met: quality, safety and effectiveness."
"This requirement responds to two essential objectives: the protection of public health and freedom of movement."
"Conducting clinical trials, in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice, makes it possible to test the effectiveness and safety of medicines."
"Good clinical practice has been the subject of international harmonisation, in the form of guidelines adopted by the International Harmonisation Conference involving representatives of the European Union, the United States and Japan."
"However, as these guidelines are not legally binding, they are applied very differently in the various Member States."
"This involves difficulties both for participants in clinical trials and industrialists who want to conduct such trials in the European Union."
"That is what led the Commission to propose, in September 1997, a legislative framework, based on Article 95 of the Treaty, with the aim of harmonising the procedures applying to clinical trials in the European Union."
"The Commission modified its proposal in April 1999 to take account of the opinion of the European Parliament."
"The common position of the Council, adopted in July 2000, is essentially based on the Commission' s amended proposal and incorporates most of the amendments suggested by the European Parliament and accepted by the Commission, which entirely appreciates the European Parliament' s concern in tabling amendments largely aimed at finalising the protection of the individuals taking part in clinical trials, especially children and adults incapable of giving consent."
"Where it is essential for these groups to have medicines specially adapted to them, the challenge is to be able to carry out trials whilst ensuring their protection."
"In-depth work, carried out in full cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, has made it possible to draft a compromise which takes account of all the points raised and indicates where positions occasionally diverge."
"The Commission can accept all the compromise amendments."
"In fact, they meet the Commission' s objectives, that is, the protection of public health in the eyes of those taking part in clinical trials, the need to facilitate the establishment of clinical trials within the European Union, and the need for the pharmaceutical industry to be competitive internationally."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept compromise Amendments Nos 28 to 43."
"It can also accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 23 and 24."
"The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 5, 11, 15, 17, 25, 26 and 27, in principle, but on the other hand, it cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 18, 20 and 22."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Madam President, I am pleased to hear the Commission say that in principle it can accept Amendment No 25."
"But I was keen to hear whether the Council could accept it, if that were perhaps possible."
"The Council clearly has no intention of answering you, Mrs Breyer."
"I suppose you could contact the representative outside the House between now and 12.30 p.m. tomorrow, as the vote is taking place tomorrow."
"Public health programmes"
"The next item is the report (A5-0377/2000) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council extending certain programmes of Community action in the field of public health adopted by Decisions 645/96/EC, 646/96/EC, 647/96/EC, 102/97/EC, 1400/97/EC and 1296/1999/EC and amending those Decisions [COM(2000)0448 - C5-0400/2000 - 2000/0192(COD)]."
"Madam President, I should like to start by saying that I am most dissatisfied with the Commission for its unwarranted delay in submitting the proposal to extend the six public health action plans to Parliament."
"They include the action plan to combat cancer, the programme of action for the prevention of AIDS, the programme of action for the prevention of drug dependence and the action plan to promote health and, if they are suspended, it will mean an end to the projects and the work being carried out by the networks which have been set up."
"The codecision procedure to implement the new public health action plans for 2001-2006 cannot be completed by 12 December 2000, when 4 out of the 6 programmes expire, which is why we urgently need to agree to their being extended, initially by one year and then by a second year if the new action programme has not yet entered into force."
"This being the case, I agree with the rapporteur's proposal to speed up the procedures and avoid two readings by reaching an agreement with the Council and the Commission on the budget lines in question."
"I trust that we shall not have to deal again with this sort of delay in such vital areas as public health in the future."
"Madam President, may I start by pointing out that the programmes which it is proposed to extend, four programmes for two years' training and two programmes for one year's training, are directly related to the new health programme which is currently being discussed in the Committee on the Environment."
"Unfortunately, the new programme, which will run from 2001 to 2006, is still not ready and is not expected to enter into force for some time."
"Consequently, the request for an extension to the previous programmes - important programmes on cancer, AIDS, diseases such as pollution-related diseases or the monitoring of infectious diseases, i.e. programmes which are of tremendous significance to public health in general - was a logical step."
"If they are not extended, we shall have a huge gap in public health issues and programmes."
"We must not forget that the essence of the acquis communautaire from these programmes needs to be passed on to the new health programmes currently being drawn up and it is therefore only right that we extend them."
"What we have agreed with the Council and the Commission and, of course, with Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, so as to avoid a second reading and allow these programmes to continue without a break, thereby avoiding any gaps, is to extend the four programmes by two years, as the Commission has requested; however, the money will only be released a year at a time, so that if the new health programme is approved and enters into force in the meantime, there will be no need for an extension and the money can be used for the second year."
"If, of course, the new programme has not yet begun, which I do not believe will be the case, then we shall, of course, carry on and use the money for the second year."
"So that is what we have agreed; we have agreed that the two programmes which expire in December 2001 will be extended for one year and we have also agreed on the amount, which is the same, in fact it is slightly less than the amount which the European Commission originally requested."
"So we have, I think, proceeded very quickly and with excellent cooperation."
"I would even go so far as to say that we may well have inaugurated a new modus operandi for codecision issues."
"Instead of waiting for conciliation, which takes a very long time, we have, to all intents and purposes, dealt with the conciliation in advance, a method which I would recommend to the European Commission, the Council and the parliamentary committees."
"What a good idea to be able to prepare the way, to proceed as far down the line as possible, to be so close that, even if we need a second reading, we are already within a hair's breadth of a decision."
"I should, of course, like to thank all my colleagues, and the other groups, and of course I should like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, because we had a valuable convergence of opinion and were able to proceed quickly so as to avoid any gaps in the public health sector."
"I trust that we shall proceed in the same manner and will use the same method for the new health programme, so that we really can make headway on these issues, and that the European integration which we talk of, constantly telling ourselves that it is not something abstract, is not the sort of integration which only applies to external relations and defence issues."
"It is a series of convergences."
"It is impossible to conceive of a unified European Union without convergence in the health sector and in the education and other sectors. So I feel that, slowly but surely, we are making headway."
"Of course, we know that the health sector is still the responsibility of the Member States, but the Treaties do, of course, give the European Commission a great deal of responsibility for the public health of European citizens."
"So we are moving in the right direction."
"I see these programmes as the first signs of convergence, a convergence which should be a straightforward task, because European citizens stand to gain a great deal from action in the public health sector."
"Madam President, let me say right away that we shall be voting in favour of the Trakatellis report, but, once again, we see dysfunction in the European Union, because we are urgently adopting a link between two programmes, as if it were a surprise that programmes supposed to end in the year 2000, actually do end in the year 2000."
"I agree with Mr Trakatellis: you cannot play games with patients' health when they expect our help, or with non-governmental organisations which need these Community budgets to deliver the health policies on the ground."
"In general, it is high time the Member States agreed to give the European Union a greater margin of manoeuvre and a more substantial budget, on a legitimately supranational issue: diseases know no frontiers."
"Above all, a framework programme should not forget the specific actions on the pretext of refocusing."
"For example, even if the fight against AIDS is not fashionable, it still needs to be a priority because this tragic disease remains very present, particularly in the future candidate countries."
"In conclusion, we hold that the goal of a future European strategy must be the incorporation of health issues into all the other Community policies, so as to put an end to current anomalies, like allocating 50 million euros to the fight against cancer while subsidising the tobacco industry to the tune of one billion!"
"Madam President, our group supports Mr Trakatellis' s very well-produced report and also the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We believe that, as Mr Trakatellis very effectively pointed out, we need to make arrangements in order to move ahead with the implementation of programmes in progress."
"Since all of Europe' s citizens are being affected by common problems relating to food, work, and various issues, it makes sense for there to be common European programmes which are becoming increasingly important in the joint combating, prevention, awareness and action in relation to these issues."
"It is therefore desirable that the efforts dedicated to these matters should increase."
"It is precisely on this issue that we believe there is a notable lack of direction in the European Union, in the Council and the Commission, which, with the budgetary cuts - not wanting to reach the ceiling of 1.27% which the regulations in force currently allow - is harming actions such as these at a time when coordination between the different Member States is becoming increasingly important."
"We also agree with the need stated in Mr Trakatellis' s report to balance the different programmes and actions which are underway."
"Furthermore, we must take account of the fact that prevention and promotion as well as monitoring are all going to be increasingly important and therefore they should be given more resources and a higher profile."
"Lastly, we believe that we should try to ensure that, in the future, situations such as this do not recur, with a lack of speed on the part of the Commission in providing for the renewal of all actions on time."
"This is a worrying state of affairs, which has caused concern amongst the many organisations involved and the problem should be resolved once and for all."
"Madam President, I certainly support the extension of the Community health programmes until 31 December 2002."
"The continuation of certain public health programmes until the end of 2002 will cost EUR 80 million."
"This will mean that Community action can be taken in the area of health promotion, information, education and training, the combat cancer programme, the programme for Community action for the prevention of AIDS and certain other communicable diseases, and the prevention of drug dependence."
"I believe that the European institutions, primarily the European Commission and Parliament, should be given broader powers to promote the health programmes within the European Union."
"Certainly, the European Community action programme for the prevention of AIDS has done much to reduce the number of people contracting this awful disease within the European Union."
"Indeed, I intend to play a central and active role in ensuring that increased funds will be made available for cancer research within the Union."
"It is imperative that this budget is increased so that we can ultimately find out the cause of cancer and cure those who contract it."
"The prevention of drug dependence programmes must also be focused not only on black spots, but across many other areas within the European Union."
"International organisations such as Europol have estimated that the importation of drugs into the Union is actually increasing."
"So the battle to defeat international drug trafficking and to defeat the importation of drugs into the Union is still a very real challenge for the years ahead."
"The Irish Government runs a very successful programme called ""The Young People Facilities and Services Fund"" which supports the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas."
"It targets those areas experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, significant drug problems."
"This is an area that can be looked at in the context of the new Community health programme which is due to come on stream."
"I commend the rapporteur and the report."
"Madam President, subsequent to the Trakatellis report on the extension of the existing European public health programmes, I wish to express my concern at the direction in which European policy in the field of public health is developing."
"We can read the basic principles for European public health policy in Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam: ""Community action, which shall complement national policies. (...)."
"Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges."""
"I would also like to refer to the principle of subsidiarity, which stipulates that non cross-border tasks should be performed by the Member States."
"As I see it though, efforts have been made recently to raise the profile of public health as a relevant and fundamental topic for Europe, although this development is at odds with the Treaty."
"European public health policy only comes into play if there is a cross-border issue involved or if Member States cannot implement a particular task in isolation."
"Relevant examples include legislation concerning cross-border trade in human organs, tissue and blood, and the programme for orphan drugs."
"Since the Member States need each other where the aforementioned examples are concerned, I am in favour of a common European approach in such cases."
"There is no need for this when it comes to tackling problems such as cancer, AIDS and drug addiction."
"A European approach does not lend a great deal of added value over and above the efforts undertaken by the Member States."
"Certainly, when it comes to the provision of information and raising awareness, action at national level is to be preferred over that at European level."
"The European Union could do more in the way of raising health standards for the candidate countries, where even basic health care is lacking."
"In addition, relatively straightforward illnesses cannot be treated owing to lack of funds and other resources."
"I am also perturbed by the fact that the various healthcare systems of the European Union will come up for discussion in new proposals soon to be on the agenda."
"It is possible that national systems will be called into question in the process, or even adversely affected in the future, which I think would be an undesirable development."
"To summarise, Madam President, I must say the developments in the public health sector in the European Union go too far for my liking."
"Public health is national policy and should stay that way."
"I therefore do not support public health programmes that can be used as a stepping stone to erode national policy, when the programmes currently on the table scarcely provide anything over and above what the Member States themselves can offer."
"I thank Parliament, particularly the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, for the great efforts made to ensure that this proposal can be adopted in one reading and in record time."
"This is an example of how much can be achieved when all the institutions work well together."
"The text being agreed today on the extension of six public health programmes reflects what has been informally agreed between the institutions."
"The Commission can therefore accept all the amendments put forward by Mr Trakatellis."
"I understand that the Council has also signalled its agreement in principle."
"The extension is important for two reasons."
"First, it will enable some important public health activities to continue and to fulfil their objectives."
"Second, it provides us with the necessary breathing space in which we can take forward the discussions on our proposed new public health programme."
"Let me just reassure you about one thing."
"The work to be carried out in the extended programmes, and indeed all current health programmes, will be geared towards preparing some of the key actions foreseen by the new programme."
"Within the framework of the individual programme decisions, their work programmes will be adapted to these needs."
"As far as the text in front of you is concerned, I now hope that once it is voted by Parliament the decision will be adopted by the Health Council on 14 December."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Standing of victims in criminal procedure"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0355/2000) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal procedure [9650/2000 - C5-0392/00 - 2000/0813 (CNS)]."
"Mr President, I would like to begin my intervention by welcoming the initiative by the Portuguese Presidency, which has continued - quite rightly, in my opinion - with the French Presidency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we live in a society in which there are ever-greater cross-border movements. They are of truly massive proportions and have never been seen before in any era of history."
"In this matter, we simply have to remember, for example, that in 1997, within the European Union, more than 200 million people crossed the borders of their State of residence into the territory of other Member States."
"The European Union and the creation of the single market in turn involve the creation of an internal area without borders in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be guaranteed within the territory of the Member States, as laid down in Article 14 of the European Community Treaty."
"All of these factors, acting separately, but multiplying their effects when acting together, have meant that every day millions of people quite simply cross the borders of their State of residence into another State of the European Union, whether to live, to work or just to travel."
"This fact, whose economic and political consequences will be immeasurable in the medium and long term, nevertheless has certain negative implications for the citizens who make this move."
"One of these is the risk of becoming a victim of crime, both inside and outside the territory of their State of residence, ranging from personal robbery to, on occasions, terrorist crimes, which still cause cruel and inhuman damage in certain Member States of the European Union."
"Nevertheless, incredibly, the European Union has so far been incapable of creating appropriate formulae for fighting, in a united fashion, this scourge which knows no national borders because in judicial terms, the Member States continue to be shut off behind 15 different national borders."
"In the European Union, there is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods, people, services and capital has to live side by side with the maintenance of 15 national borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, which the Member States are making difficult to remove."
"This situation has unjustifiable consequences for those European citizens who move freely within the territory of the European Union."
"In the unfortunate circumstance that someone is a victim of a crime in a State other than their usual State of residence, that citizen has to suffer the bad experience of an unacceptable lack of protection, which is due to the inability of the States to build a genuine European judicial area."
"All victims of crime, regardless of their place of residence or nationality, must therefore be guaranteed respect for their rights and the certainty that they will receive the same treatment and speedy and sure compensation that all human beings deserve by virtue of the simple fact that they are human beings. This treatment should be received in any Member State in which a person is a victim of a crime."
"It is therefore essential that we create a genuine statute for the victims of crime, a common statute for all the Member States. The main objective of this initiative is to guarantee a minimum of compensation for victims in all Member States, guaranteeing them at least a common minimum."
"By the same token, the fact needs to be pointed out that European criminal legislation in the Member States has always concentrated its attention and efforts on the criminal, both in terms of the prevention of crime and in terms of programmes and measures for rehabilitation directed at criminals."
"This is the first initiative that gives special attention and importance to the victim."
"This initiative could be called innovative and, up to a point, revolutionary in terms of the way in which victims are treated."
"It is, without doubt, a new element in the European judicial system, in which, for the first time, victims have their own recognised judicial status and not, as has been the case until now, one which is derived from the crime."
"In many cases, the victim is the object of a crime in the territory of a Member State other than their usual State of residence, which means that their problems and suffering are exacerbated and complicated by a whole range of circumstances which are negative, but common and constant, in the treatment of victims: a lack of communication owing to ignorance of the language, a lack of information, loneliness, a lack of protection in certain areas in which each State has preserved its own legal system."
"Therefore, and with the aim of being able to respond adequately to the needs of this type of victim, international standards have also been created which take account of the defence of victims' rights and interests."
"I wish to highlight just two aspects of this initiative at the moment: European Convention No 116 of the Council of Europe of 24 November 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crimes."
"I would like to highlight that, despite its importance and the fact that it is a mandatory point of reference in Europe, the Convention has still not been ratified, as of 18 September 2000, by the following Member States of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain."
"Another international initiative is the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power adopted by General Assembly Resolution 40/34 on 29 November 1985."
"Ladies and gentlemen, because of what I have said previously, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(4) of the European Union Treaty, which lays down that one of the objectives of the Union is to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is guaranteed, we must ensure that this area of freedom, security and justice guarantees genuine access to justice so that the European public can benefit from suitable legal protection in any part of the Union."
"For this reason, the Citizens' Europe will not make sense unless we first adopt, amongst others, the necessary measures to improve and also take account of the rights of victims of crime, aimed in a global sense at safeguarding all their rights and interests, on the one hand, and, from a Community point of view, at harmonising the legislation of the 15 Member States on the other."
"Everybody, including the nationals of third countries who have been victims of a crime in any State of the European Union, must receive the same minimum level of treatment."
"The European Union cannot accept the idea that people might receive different treatment depending on the State in which they have been a victim of crime or on their nationality."
"This discrimination is patently quite unacceptable."
"Finally, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European legal area, albeit partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of an enormous number of European citizens who, until now, have been largely unprotected on becoming victims of crime outside their usual country of residence."
"With regard to the positive aspects of this initiative, I would like to highlight the definition of the concept of the victim and the adoption of measures which are intrinsically connected to the global attention which must be paid to them."
"For all these reasons, the majority of the amendments which are included in this report have been produced with the aim of respecting and recognising the rights of people who have been victims of crime, and of taking account of their interests and particular circumstances."
"To sum up, anyone who has been the victim of a crime must be guaranteed the same minimum level of treatment, their dignity should be protected, they should be guaranteed their rights to give and receive information, they should have access to justice and they should be granted compensation for the damage suffered immediately, effectively and in full."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two questions about this proposal played a decisive role in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The first question was to what extent there actually was a legal basis for this proposal."
"As rapporteur, I took the view that the undertaking proposed to us here was admittedly a laudable one, but that, unfortunately, it was simply the case that within the European Union and also in relation to the Member States there were relatively clear rules about who had which competences."
"As rapporteur, my opinion is that issues relating to organising criminal prosecution and procedural criminal law do not fall within the competence of the Treaty on European Union and that these matters should be dealt with by the Member States."
"Unfortunately, the Committee did not go along with my proposal in this specific case, but, as rapporteur, I should nevertheless like to make this opinion known."
"The second aspect which played a certain part was the issue of evidence recorded on video."
"You may remember the debate on the so-called Di Pietro report, which was held here in this House some time ago."
"At the time, this was already a highly controversial matter."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with the rapporteur's view that this recorded evidence was not a suitable instrument in a State under the rule of law and therefore deleted video recordings from the relevant paragraph of the article concerned."
"I would ask that this also be taken into account here in further discussions."
"Otherwise the proposal is very much to be welcomed."
"It would only have been better if it had been dealt with where it belongs, namely in the domain of the national legislator, who could decide all these matters in an exemplary fashion."
"Not everything needs to be regulated at European level; if it did an all-embracing competence would have been inserted in the Treaty."
"But this was not done."
"That is why we should perhaps consider once again whether it is right for us to vote in favour of this initiative."
"Mr President, I think it is extremely important that a number of minimum rights are indeed to be safeguarded for victims, in a manner which transcends national boundaries."
"That is what this report stands for."
"We submitted an opinion to the committee responsible on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"It was very important in our view for the report to reflect the specific situation of women, but also that of other vulnerable victims."
"When I say other vulnerable victims I am thinking, for example, of minors and children, but the list need not end there. There are other groups in our society that are very vulnerable when it comes to violence."
"I have in mind those of a different sexual orientation. I am also thinking of migrants and so on, who are, of course, particularly vulnerable victims."
"What did we request for this group of people?"
"Firstly, we said that people who are very vulnerable must be given absolute respect."
"I am thinking, for example, of the specific situation of women and children who fall victim to sexual violence or physical violence in the home."
"It is very important for them that if their case comes to court, this really must be able to take place behind closed doors, so that minimum publicity is given to the victims, who are usually ashamed of the fact that they are victims."
"Because of course, that is what it has come to in our society."
"I feel, for example, that it is very important for physically abused women to have access to information everywhere on where they can go, where they can find suitable accommodation and stay at a secret address."
"It is also essential for the police and the magistrature to receive special training."
"I was very actively involved in this issue in my own country, when I was a member of the government."
"I noticed how ill-prepared and equipped people in these agencies are - i.e. both the police and the magistrature - when it comes to treating people who are victims of sexual violence, for example, with respect, to questioning them, or providing a separate room for them, for example for women who have been raped and need to be examined. They should not be cross-examining these people in a room which is a general thoroughfare."
"It is absolutely imperative for certain measures to be put in place for this group of people, these specific victims."
"The report answers this need."
"I am extremely grateful that the Commission has adopted the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and we will therefore support the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us today is the result of an initiative by the Portuguese Presidency and is part of a range of measures designed to promote the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, in order to provide a useful response to the everyday concerns of the European public."
"Often, when we address issues of justice, we devote too much time to the penal system, to prisons, to crime-fighting forces, to criminal codes and even to the claims of those in the legal profession."
"It may be that we have devoted too little time to the victims, who are often the weakest members of society."
"This initiative targets three basic aspects: the victim' s right to information, access to justice and their right to compensation for damages."
"The priority of this proposal for a framework decision is to promote the protection and effectiveness of victims' rights in this process, specifically with regard to simplifying access to the law, to the courts and to legal information as well as to promote and protect victims' rights in the field of compensation for loss and damages."
"It is crucial that there should be a legal instrument that enables national legislation in the various Member States on the victim' s status to be harmonised."
"There are certainly various aspects which need to be improved and even put right, but what is important is that we vote for this framework decision, which is quite well-balanced."
"Indeed, we cannot talk seriously about a Citizens' Europe unless we take account of victims' rights."
"Amongst these victims, special attention should be paid, as Mrs Smet has already pointed out, to certain categories of victims, such as minors, foreigners, victims of sexual attacks and victims of terrorist acts."
"At the same time, special training should be provided for the professionals whose task it is to come into direct contact with victims."
"The necessary measures to ensure that the victims can re-establish their normal lives should also be provided, not only in financial terms, but also so that they may benefit, should it prove necessary, from legal, psychological or medical assistance or help from the social services."
"Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on her work and on the numerous improvements that she implemented in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I also wish to express my satisfaction at the improvements resulting from the reports by Mrs Smet and Mr Lehne."
"We were able to work together in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and I wish to emphasise this fact and express my gratitude for it."
"I only wish it had been possible to achieve the same consensus in Parliament."
"The few proposals for amendments that we tabled mainly concern issues of legal rigour and our understanding that victim support services do not have to be exclusively or even preferably run by the public sector."
"Often, in services that wish to have a human face, the best experiences are provided by institutions of social solidarity and other non-governmental organisations."
"Overall, the PPE-DE welcomes Mrs Cerdeira Morterero' s report, for which we have already voted in committee."
"Mr President, I too would like to stress the importance of the Portuguese legislative initiative contained in Mrs Cerdeira Morterero' s report, which has been put before Parliament."
"It is important for a number of reasons: firstly, because we are making headway in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice, in accordance with the Tampere programme, a programme which is difficult to put into practice because of the clash with the numerous State regulations and the nations' reluctance."
"Secondly, it is important because this vote has filled a gap, a gap which means there is unacceptable prejudice against European citizens, who travel freely through Union territory but, when they become victims of a crime, come up against the barriers of different legal systems, difficult to penetrate from every viewpoint, which penalise them further while favouring the offenders."
"Finally, this vote is important because Parliament has the opportunity to make significant improvements to the legislative proposal, precisely those suggested in Mrs Cerdeira Morterero' s excellent report and supported by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"However, the most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that people are finally becoming aware, at Union and other levels, of the need to change opinion on State intervention with regard to crimes."
"Until now, on the basis of the just principle according to which citizens should be prevented from administering justice themselves, we have restricted ourselves to giving the State the monopoly on punishing the guilty, but we have forgotten that this is not the only task of the State: wherever in the world victims call for justice, we all know what they are asking for, even when the legal systems are completely different: they are calling for amends for a wrong which would otherwise be unacceptable, and the State, which has the task of ensuring citizens' safety, when it is has not been able to protect them, must give all the help possible to victims, thus also showing that the Community takes the side of the party who has suffered the wrong and that the Community therefore condemns the offence and the offender."
"By adopting this report, the European Union is giving an initial response to a call for justice which has hitherto been disregarded."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Portuguese initiative and Mrs Cerdeira's first-class report and thank her for her open and consensual approach."
"The Liberal Group feels that a very good report has emerged from the debate in committee and we will be supporting the committee amendments when we vote."
"We will not be supporting subsequent amendments from either the European People's Party or the Party of European Socialists, with the exception of Amendment No 59."
"We feel that to call on Member States to sign the European Convention of 24 November 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crime fits better in the legislative resolution than in the body of the report on the framework decision."
"It is quite clear that if we are to create and to realise the area of freedom, security and justice provided for at Tampere then we will need legal aid in cross-border cases."
"I know from my own constituency of a lorry driver who was assaulted by his employers in the Netherlands and found himself unable to take them to court to gain access to justice."
"Therefore, Amendment No 4 is essential."
"We know, too, that we need the assumption that a victim of any nationality will be treated in the same way as a victim of the nationality of the country in which the offence takes place."
"I have a constituent whose car was broken into in Brussels and who found that the Belgian police wanted to know nothing about it."
"This is why we will be supporting Amendment No 14."
"We clearly need civil liberties safeguards and the recognition of the special needs of minorities and these are covered by Amendment No 25 and others."
"I had in my own constituency a Swedish family attacked; it was a xenophobically-motivated attack, their attackers believed them to be German."
"I would be very interested to know whether they found it as easy to gain access to justice in Great Britain as they would have done in their own country."
"Somehow, I doubt it."
"So, Mr President, Liberals support this report."
"We feel it is a major step towards the creation of a European legal area and will benefit millions of our citizens."
"Mr President, first and foremost I would like to congratulate Mrs Cerdeira on her speech and her report."
"Victims must not be victims twice over, first of crime, and subsequently of the system."
"The victim' s most important right in the course of legal proceedings is therefore the right to be heard during the session."
"This is also of fundamental importance."
"It is quoted in many international documents on victims of crimes and it is essential for the victim to be given access to their own lawsuit."
"It is also in the interests of the victim for the case to be brought to a swift conclusion, since slow proceedings can lead to the person feeling an ever worse sense of victimisation a second time round."
"Also, victims of sex crimes should no longer be forced to repeatedly give evidence."
"I also think video links could prove very useful when dealing with children who have been the victim of sexual abuse."
"So the debate on this issue is set to continue."
"It is extremely important for specialised assistance to be provided, as Mrs Smet indicated, irrespective of the nature of the crime."
"It is important, in this context, for a number of prejudices surrounding this issue to be dispelled; for example the amount of importance attached to certain forms of crime varies from country to country."
"In addition, it has been ascertained that when victims report crimes they are subjected to discriminatory behaviour."
"Member States should be compelled to set up special police units for victims of crime."
"What we also need is a legal basis and harmonisation of measures for the protection of victims."
"The study carried out by An Weghers within the framework of the Grotius programme provides the necessary basic information to this end."
"The useful information available in certain Member States concerning existing measures could play an important part in the harmonisation of a common package of measures."
"An initiative of this kind would also be a first step in the direction of crime prevention."
"But in view of the fact that organised cross-border crime is on the increase, the initiative would have to lead to a common prevention programme at European and international level."
"Until such time as a harmonised instrument for cross-border protection of victims is in place, it is incumbent on the Member States and the candidate countries, in cooperation with the NGOs, to improve the level of protection for victims, and where appropriate, examine under what conditions the victim is entitled to support for their return to their country of origin, or temporary right of residence, in the way that Belgium accords a status to victims of trafficking in human beings, for example."
"Compensation for the victim must take precedence over the payment of the fine and legal costs to the State."
"The Member States must ensure that the mediators come from all walks of life, men as well as women, and that they have a thorough understanding of the local culture and communities."
"It is also important in this context, for the next of kin, i.e. the family of the victim, to be apprised of the facts in a discreet and professional manner, should they so wish, and for them to be able to rely on receiving the necessary support and not have to learn everything from the press."
"Mr President, I support the extremely urgent Portuguese initiative promoting the legal protection of victims during criminal proceedings."
"The rapporteur - whom I congratulate - did well to highlight the unacceptable paradox of, on the one hand, a Europe without borders where goods and people move freely, a Europe which is on the point of monetary union, a financial and economic union, and, on the other hand, a Europe of 15 criminal law systems, all completely different."
"On the one hand, there are a potential 350 million people who are encouraged to travel and work in the name of the united Europe, but if they fall victim to a crime, a wrong-doing, Europe vanishes, the much-lauded European citizenship vanishes, the citizen becomes a person without rights who has to reckon with a foreign, often hostile State which gives out no information, creates a multitude of problems and does not pay damages where they are due."
"How many of us Members of Parliament are requested to ask questions on cases of this kind?"
"However, the Commission duly replies to us that it cannot go into the matter of national legal systems, even when obvious injustices occur."
"Just in recent months two cases have been referred to me."
"The first is the case of two Italian Alitalia pilots, Alberto Nassetti and Pierpaolo Racchetti, who died in France following an accident, in unexplained circumstances, during a test flight of an aeroplane."
"Six years have gone by and, beset by hundreds of problems and prohibitive legal costs, their families are still waiting for justice, they are waiting to know the cause of these deaths and who, if any, the responsible parties are."
"The second case involves a Greek student, Mikis Mantakas, killed around 25 years ago in Rome, following a terrorist attack carried out by the Red Brigades."
"The guilty party, Arturo Lojacono, was identified and sentenced, but sought refuge abroad."
"Italy has repeatedly requested the extradition of this multiple murderer from France, where Mr Lojacono lives freely, so that he can finally serve his time."
"Well, we are still waiting for a reply."
"So, together with the euro, I also welcome the advent of the statute for the victims of crime, so that a genuine European area of justice can be built."
"Mr President, the initiative to strengthen the standing of victims of crime is a real success story."
"In the beginning, most people were against it."
"Now, however, most of us agree, and that, I think, is a good thing."
"I welcome the proposal from Portugal for strengthening the standing of victims of crime in criminal procedure also, even though I have every respect for the views relating to legal aspects expressed by Mr Lehne earlier."
"People who are subjected to crime while exercising their right to freedom of movement must not have to suffer twice, inasmuch as they are badly treated."
"This is the case irrespective of the type of crime committed."
"It is a question of strengthening the standing of the victims, but it cannot be done without also talking about crime prevention measures."
"The best way of all of helping victims of crime is to ensure that no crime is committed in the first place, and the most important way of preventing crime is probably to disseminate information."
"Crime prevention measures must also aim to combat organised crime."
"Victims of crime must know their rights and what opportunities they actually have for receiving help."
"Most Member States provide some form of initial help for victims."
"Sometimes travellers need additional support and perhaps more support than the local population."
"It might be a matter of psychological support and help with the language as well as a whole number of other factors."
"It can be difficult for a foreign victim to follow the criminal procedures from a distance, and in this case it is clear that special measures are required."
"The victim must always have priority."
"Since it is not the perpetrator we must give priority to, it is disturbing to see the tendency in a number of Member States to start introducing nolle prosequi simply because the perpetrator meets the victim."
"I cannot support this sort of trend."
"Crimes must be solved, and if this does not happen it will, in the long term, threaten the democratic system."
"Who will then go out and vote if their problems are completely disregarded?"
"In my country, the number of cases of assault is increasing, and barely 20 per cent of these cases are solved."
"This percentage is too low."
"Crime is no accident."
"A penalty also involves respect for the victim."
"We must never stray from the basic principle that individuals must always take responsibility for their own actions, either at the level of the Member State or at EU level."
"The State must ultimately take responsibility for its failure to protect the victim."
"Therefore, I am pleased that the rapporteur has drawn up this report, which I commend with enthusiasm."
"I would like to thank her for helping to strengthen the unified view of victims of crime in the Member States."
"Mr President, at a time when progress is being made in the building of a European area without internal borders, it is important, as your rapporteur underlined, not to forget the thousands of people who every year are victims of criminal offences when they travel on the territory of the European Union."
"They are often in a difficult situation because they are far away from home and do not know the system or the language of the country in which the offence took place."
"The draft framework decision proposed by Portugal and supported by the French Presidency constitutes a first step in taking into account the situation of victims at the level of the European Union."
"The Commission welcomes this."
"The question of the situation of victims of criminal offences in Europe was first mentioned in the Vienna Action Plan and included in the conclusions of the European Council of Tampere."
"Further, it was the subject of a communication from the Commission on 14 July 1999."
"Part of the proposals made in this communication to improve the standards and the assumption of responsibility for victims were included in the draft framework decision presented by the Portuguese Presidency and which is submitted to you today."
"I acknowledge the work carried out on this text by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, your rapporteur."
"It was the subject of difficult discussions in the Council."
"As you noted, the draft framework decision contains three different types of measures: firstly, it enacts minimum rules with regard to the victim's rights; secondly, it enacts specific rules aiming to take into account the individual situation of those people who are victims of an offence in a Member State other than their State of origin and, thirdly, it encourages the States to develop measures for victim support."
"One can be particularly pleased with certain provisions, for example the possibility for victims to lodge a complaint at the place of their residence when they are not in a position to do so in the State where the offence took place."
"The Commission does not have any objection to the majority of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to three points."
"Several amendments refer to the official languages of the European Union, foreseeing the right of victims to communicate in one of these languages."
"This mechanism does not, however, appear to be appropriate."
"It is important to make it possible for the victim to have information in a language they understand."
"In certain cases it might not be a language of the European Union."
"In other cases, it might be possible to get the information needed in a language of the Union which is not their own."
"It is, therefore, more relevant to refer not to a language of the Union but, in a more pragmatic way, to confer on the victim the right to have access to the necessary information in a language that they understand."
"This could involve in certain cases putting an interpreter at their disposal."
"Secondly, Amendment No 49 stipulates that Member States guarantee to victims who so wish the right to remain in the State where the procedure takes place, where it is necessary for the procedure to run smoothly."
"This provision is very interesting."
"It requires, however, a more detailed study in relation to European legislation as regards asylum and immigration for the natives of third countries to the Union."
"That is why this text was withdrawn from the version under discussion in the Council."
"The Commission is currently thinking about a specific text on this important subject in order to protect victims as well as - in a number of cases - to facilitate surveys."
"Thirdly, the text invites the Member States to create a 'green number' , functioning 24 hours a day in all the official languages of the Union, in order to make it possible for victims to contact the services for victim support."
"This is indeed a good idea as it would allow the European citizen who is a victim of a criminal offence, when travelling in the territory of the Union, to feel in concrete terms the added value at European level."
"However, on the one hand the framework decision is not the appropriate instrument here and, on the other hand, its implementation involves a consideration that is rather complex."
"Does it involve having the same emergency number in all the Member States on the model of the fire service or the police force?"
"Does it involve having a centre at European level available 24 hours a day to inform of the possibilities of victim support?"
"Does it involve setting up a service in each Member State?"
"The Commission wishes to continue the feasibility study for such a project."
"It already works to support the networking at European level of the national services for victim support in order to ensure appropriate care of victims, particularly if they do not reside where the offence took place."
"The idea of a 'green number' will be examined within this context."
"At this stage, it is perhaps preferable to bring about a working relationship with the services for victim support, rather than putting in a text the principle of a 'green number' , which would be likely to have no future."
"The draft framework decision on which you come to a decision today constitutes a first step in taking into account the situation of victims at a European level."
"As I have just said, in order to go further within the framework of following up its communication of 14 July 1999, the Commission works on the adoption of concrete measures to support victims, in particular through the support envisaged for the European forum for victim services."
"In addition, with regard to victims' compensation, the Commission will submit a Green Paper next year."
"I am delighted by the favourable response shown by Parliament to this first text on such an important subject, so that the area of freedom, security and justice which we are gradually building may offer our fellow citizens support in situations that are often difficult to live with."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.46 p.m.)"
"Mr President, a rather serious problem arose this morning when the assistants were suddenly prevented from boarding the coach to bring us here from the Hotel Monopol, despite the fact that this practice has been applied without a hitch for the past 21 years."
"I should like to protest because there would have been five members in the coach and the assistants would have been late for work."
"It is a stupid regulation because the bus carrying five passengers could have been replaced by two cars, meaning that there would have been two drivers instead of one."
"This bureaucracy must have been thought up by our quaestors and we urgently need to abolish it so that members can take their assistants with them to work."
"Mr Posselt, we will pass on your arguments to the College of Quaestors so that they can adopt the resolution that they think best and so that it will be known to all Members."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I just wished to point out that I forgot to sign the attendance register yesterday evening."
"We will take note of it."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Vote on a request for urgent procedure"
"Mr Varela, chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, has the floor to give his opinion."
"Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE), chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to inform you that the Committee on Fisheries has decided not to accept this request for urgent procedure, as we were not aware of the Commission proposal until 20 November, when we no longer had time to include it on our agenda. It was therefore not possible for us to deal with it with the urgency that was asked of us."
"However, we will do everything we can to ensure that we will be able to debate it here in the next part-session of the new year."
"Thank you very much, Mr Varela."
"As there are no other speakers, the Commissioner has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. the regulation on control measures in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the north-east Atlantic fisheries stipulates that the provisions governing the application of these control measures only apply for the year 2000."
"The Council was unable to agree on a longer regulation at the time and the rules in question therefore expire at the end of this year."
"If we delay in amending this regulation, we shall have no legal basis for European Union control ships in the international waters of the north Atlantic after 1 January 2001."
"This will undermine the whole control system and the regional fisheries organisations, which will be weakened as a result."
"The control system has proven to be a first rate system and we should spare no effort to strengthen and develop it further."
"The Commission therefore supports the Council's request for urgent procedure and calls on the members of the European Parliament to support this urgent procedure."
"Mr Varela, chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, the committee responsible, has the floor again."
"Mr President, I regret very much that the Commission did not take all this into account before and did not inform us in sufficient time so that we could work on it in committee."
"However, the international measures mentioned will remain in force because this is an international agreement."
"They will not, therefore, be affected by the delay."
"Moreover, as I said before, I hope that we will be able to vote on this proposal during the January part-session."
"In any case, it is regrettable that they are asking us for an urgent procedure now, at the last minute, because we have had all of 2000 to process this proposal for a regulation."
"I think that the institutions, in this case the Commission, should work more responsibly to ensure that proposals reach this House in due time so that a rapporteur can be appointed, the Commission proposal can be examined, amendments can be tabled, they can be debated in committee and they can then come to the plenary, which they have asked us to do in a single plenary sitting, which is impossible."
"Having heard the speeches from the Commissioner and the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I put the request for urgent procedure to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"2001 budget"
"Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking the President-in-Office, who negotiated with us, with Parliament, in a shrewd and tenacious manner, often without the support of her colleagues, by thanking the Commissioner, who never once lost sight of global European interests, both on and off stage, and by thanking all my colleagues who backed me at the most crucial moments, even where they were of a different opinion, and who were supportive and joined forces in order to defend Parliament's position."
"My sincere thanks to one and all."
"Without such teamwork we could never have arrived at what is now a relatively comfortable, by that I mean perfectly tension-free situation."
"There now appear to be no further obstacles to Parliament's passing a resolution on the European Union budget for 2001 on Thursday."
"The chairman of the Committee on Budgets tells me that this is the very first time that agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament at conciliation."
"So well done everyone!"
"There is a proverb which says that money makes an evil master but an excellent servant."
"As the elected representatives of the people, we parliamentarians have acted in accordance with this proverb."
"We have not harped on about principles."
"We have not set budgetary objectives in advance and then tried to tailor our policy to them."
"We wanted a proper, economical, logical budget which would allow us to honour our political commitments and really help those who need our help."
"So we agreed with the Council during the night of 23 to 24 November on the main points of what is a perfectly reasonable, although by no means brilliant budget."
"Whichever way you look at it, it is reasonable not to give up in the fight against unemployment in Europe, which is why we keep insisting on the need for action at every political level - at local, regional, national and at European level."
"The European budget will include EUR 450 million to promote employment over the next five years by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"If we implement the action lines described in the charter on SMEs and help SMEs to apply new technologies, we shall, I think, have found a way of creating jobs."
"The agreed EUR 450 million is more than four times what the Commission proposed in the preliminary draft budget and frontloading EUR 100 million next year should get us off to a flying start."
"The Committee on Budgets proposes that plenary remove the reserves set up at first reading. This applies both to the performance reserve under the heading foreign policy and the administrative expenditure reserve."
"We have stated time and again that we support the reform of the Commission and that we agree to the 400 new posts, combined with a new early retirement scheme, but only subject to certain conditions."
"Some of these conditions have now been met."
"The Commission has submitted its analysis of outstanding commitments and its strategy for eliminating abnormal outstanding commitments."
"We put the final touches to a joint declaration by the Council and Parliament in a trilogue last Tuesday."
"We all agreed that the Commission should draft a report by the middle of next year on progress made in phasing out commitment backlogs, implementing programmes and simplifying project cycles, a report on how comitology is working, on progress made in implementing the reform package and on the performance targets of the main programmes under Category IV, to mention just a few aspects of the joint declaration."
"We now expect the Commission to start work at soon as possible."
"Apart from a few minor skirmishes started or continued by the Council at second reading, our second reading has been stripped of most of its contentious points, mainly because we have stated that we are prepared to help the Council achieve what it sees as the extremely important objective of reducing the increase in payments to 3.5%."
"This will be achieved mainly by removing the Structural Funds reserve set up at first reading and making fewer payments for Community initiatives, which need to be rebudgeted anyway. The Commission's Letter of Amendment no."
"2 which, following renewed calculation, has deducted around EUR 900 million from the sum needed for Category I, was also extremely helpful here. This Letter of Amendment is most welcome and I imagine that Parliament's consent to it is most welcome in the Council, because it also contains an estimated surplus for the current budget of EUR 900 million, which can be entered straight away under revenue for 2001."
"What worried us most right through the budget procedure was how to fund our foreign policy."
"Our financial perspective for Category IV was clearly way off target since the war in the Balkans."
"The Commission therefore suggested revising the figures by EUR 300 million."
"The Council fought against this tooth and nail and it was impossible to reason with it on this point, just as it was last year."
"For the Council, the financial perspective is a monstrance and must not be changed."
"It has made it into its evil master, to continue the proverb which I quoted earlier."
"We were therefore forced to do a deal with it on the EUR 200 million flexibility instrument, as if this did not represent a change to the financial perspective."
"But at least we now have a further EUR 200 million at our disposal, although we did in fact need another EUR 300 million."
"But we can at least fund what we think is the most important task, i.e. the democratisation and reconstruction of the western Balkans, from a total of EUR 839 million, including EUR 240 million for Serbia."
"We refused to allow our other foreign policy priorities to be whittled away still further."
"We can finance cooperation with the Baltic region and our crisis reaction forces and we have given MEDA EUR 40 million more than the Council provided."
"So, as you can see, we have cobbled together a solution for the 2001 budget."
"However, this solution is weak on political and budgetary planning, because it takes no account of the fact that money is needed over a period of several years."
"I should like to have responded to long-term requirements with proper multiannual planning."
"All this means, of course, is that we shall face the same mountain of difficulties during the next budgetary procedure."
"I hope that the person who succeeds me as Parliament's general rapporteur and the Belgian Presidency of the Council, which will be taking over in the second half of next year, enjoy their discussions."
"I know from my own experience just how difficult it is to keep all the groups in Parliament together."
"However, I also know from the discussions that it is far more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council position, obtain a mandate and accommodate pure national chauvinism in a fairly reasonable and tenable overall European decision."
"Naturally, that does not only apply to purely budgetary processes, as the Nice Summit so graphically demonstrated yet again."
"So we stand once again at the end of a year and ask ourselves how, in Heaven's name, we can make the Council see reason and make a good servant out of an evil master."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must, of course, start by joining Mrs Haug in thanking all the officials and members and the Commission services, although the words do stick in my throat somewhat when it comes to the Council."
"I have the honour of dealing with the minor budgets: here the procedure is relatively straightforward and we all know who has the final word."
"They may treat us shabbily in Nice but to reverse everything Parliament has done, as in the case of the European Court of Justice, knowing full well that we shall correct it all again this week, is just a waste of resources and we could have helped protect the environment by using less paper."
"Meeting Parliament half way would not have come amiss here and would have saved us some work, although I have no objection to the work because what I want for the future is an efficient European Court of Justice which can do its job and, more importantly, clear the backlog of translation work."
"If the Council had shown itself to be more accommodating, we could have brokered an agreement back in October."
"Having been allocated so little time, which is a pity because the budget - and the rapporteurs - deserve more than a derisory two and a half minutes, I must confine myself to just a few comments."
"We must consider internally how all the present requirements can be developed into transparent procedures in the area of promotions policy."
"I am delighted that not only the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors but also the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have already started to review their promotions policy and develop a transparent, merit-based procedure in which individual performance rather than seniority is the deciding criterion."
"I think that we are on the right path and, as part of the budgetary authority - in this case as the budgetary authority because the Council does not play the most decisive role here - we shall help to ensure that this continues in the future."
"We here in Parliament must also check to see that our budget still meets the criteria of honesty and clarity."
"Let me be quite clear here: we have a number of vacant positions here in Parliament, which save us several tens of millions of euros from one year to the next."
"We must therefore consider if the whole way in which we draw up our own budget is still correct, which is why our resolutions will call on our own administration - and I hope that the House will come on board here - to submit a full report on the vacant positions in the House, so that we end up with a budget which meets the criteria of honesty and clarity."
"I hope that work will progress on a European recruitment agency - or ""joint recruitment office"" as we call it in our very best German - so that we can jointly overcome the problems which all the institutions - the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - will face over coming years, i.e. the problem of staffing over coming years."
"I trust that we shall make real progress here."
"I have overrun by one minute and it was a pleasure to do so."
"Have I now been allowed more time?"
"If so, I shall gladly give it to the group because I only prepared for two and a half minutes and intended to overrun by one minute."
"I have therefore met my personal target."
"I should like once again to thank all my colleagues."
"As far as the other institutions are concerned, we have worked together to achieve what I think is a good result which cuts across all party, group, country and other divides."
"If the Council were prepared to follow suit next year, if it listened to Parliament more readily, it would be even easier to achieve a good result."
"Ladies and gentlemen, do not think that my heart has been softened by Mr Ferber' s arguments, but he actually had five minutes to speak and the services had only indicated two and a half minutes."
"Sorry, Mr Ferber."
"And if you wish to add anything later - because you had one minute left - I will give you the floor."
"Mr President, when a delegation from this Parliament was visiting the People' s Republic of China some time ago, we were in Xiamen, in the south-east of China, and there was an island visible on the horizon."
"We asked what is was called and they said, ""It is the unmentionable."""
"It was Taiwan and its name cannot be mentioned in China."
"Here the thing that we are not allowed to mention is 'revision of the financial perspective.'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should almost be kneeling down to deal with this matter, because it is a religious one."
"In the Council' s religion it is forbidden to mention the word revision."
"That is crystal clear."
"But I challenge my esteemed colleague, the President-in-Office of the Council, to explain to me what the difference is between the revision of the financial perspective and the use of the flexibility instrument: the majorities are the same, and the amounts can be the same."
"Apart from it being taboo, it is really difficult to explain why the Council refuses to recognise the need for a revision of the financial perspective."
"What is more, of the thirty-eight revisions that the Community has had since 1988, which is when this system was set up, twenty-odd have been annual revisions."
"So not even the argument for annual or multiannual revisions is an excuse."
"Perhaps another reason why we should discuss this on our knees is the attitude of some Members of this House, as all they seem to want to do is blindly obey the instructions of the Council."
"We have really fought a great battle in order to achieve a 0.02% increase in the Council draft budget."
"I do not know whether this is a great success for this Parliament."
"It can even be seen in the Structural Funds, where the Commission told us that 8 000 million additional payment appropriations were needed, and the result is that we have cut them by 340 million, which is, of course, the request of the Council, not of Parliament."
"I wanted to briefly point out that, when we adopted the financial perspective in force, in 1999, we were still - I say 'we were' due to the involvement of the Union - bombing the Balkans, particularly Serbia."
"And we left it that when the conflict ended we would revise the financial perspective."
"We agreed this between the Council and Parliament."
"The Council refuses to carry out this revision - it seems that now we should have the information - and I want to warn you: using the flexibility instrument two years in a row, two consecutive years, in fact, in less than fifteen months, and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the perspective, is financially draining the flexibility instrument because it prevents it from being replaced and from possible accumulation, which is planned for up to 600 million."
"But it is also draining it politically and this is much more serious, ladies and gentlemen, because it could lead to Parliament having a complete lack of confidence in the very system of financial perspective."
"To be honest, the Council is leading us to believe that the system is not satisfactory because one of the contracting parties is not fulfilling the political requirements involved in signing an agreement."
"The needs of the Balkans have not come to an end, they are multiannual."
"So now what are we going to do?"
"At the moment we are beginning to sacrifice MEDA, which went down from EUR 980 million in 1999 to EUR 741 million in 2001."
"It is the first victim of not having a revision."
"I wonder who will be the next victim?"
"I would like to know, Mrs Schreyer, what is going to be done with the initial proposal for revision of the financial perspective."
"The Commission has not withdrawn it."
"I would therefore like to know what you are going to do."
"Are we going to continue to fund the Balkans with juggling, as we have done now, at the end of 2000, ""pre-budgeting"" things and then introducing EUR 200 million in the 2001 budget?"
"What are we going to do in March?"
"I know that it will be the job of the Swedish Presidency, but in March we need to look at the perspective for 2002, and what are we going to do?"
"The matter of the Balkans will not have been resolved."
"To be honest, I think that I have to recommend to this House that it approve the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument because, in short, it enables us to solve the Serbia issue and because it is a revision that no one is daring to call by its name."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Emperor is not wearing any clothes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Nice European Council, where European integration made significant progress, which the President of France will shortly present to you, I am delighted to present you with the second reading of the draft budget of the European Union, as established by the Council on 24 November."
"It is a pleasure, but also an honour and an emotional moment for me to be here with you, at the heart of European democracy."
"The Council' s second reading was preceded on 23 November by a conciliation meeting between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The outcome of this long meeting was, I believe, a twofold success."
"It was a success for Europe because we were able to overcome our initial differences of opinion and a political success because this budget is an expression not only of a compromise, but also - especially - of our priorities."
"Indeed, the representatives of the three institutions spared no effort to conclude an overall agreement on the 2001 budget and I wish to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Council, both the members of the parliamentary delegation and Mrs Schreyer."
"The Council has therefore proceeded to its second reading of the budget, taking account of the agreements concluded with the delegation from Parliament, with the ever-present desire to vote for a budget that will enable us to fund all of the European Union' s priorities and a budget that matches up to real needs and to our true ability to make use of appropriations."
"This budget will also enable us to implement the reform of the common agricultural policy and to carry out the programming of structural actions as defined in 1999, as well as all of the major programmes decided on jointly by Parliament and the Council."
"I am thinking specifically here of research, the Trans-European Networks and culture or audiovisual creation, with the MEDIA Plus programme, on which an agreement was concluded on 23 November."
"I should now like to focus on the main progress made at the second reading in Council."
"The first point of agreement between the Council and Parliament concerns external action, that is, heading 4 of the budget, on which our institutions shared a common goal, which was to release substantial funding for the Balkans region in 2001, given recent developments in Serbia' s political situation, and to do so without passing the costs of this on to the other geographical priorities of the Union' s external action."
"The agreement reached on 23 November therefore defines an overall allocation for the Balkans of EUR 839 million, of which EUR 240 million are earmarked for Serbia."
"This very considerable amount, which matches the heavy requirements for 2001, will be largely funded by mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 200 million."
"Parliament thereby retains considerable room for manoeuvre at second reading to fund all its other geographical priorities and to do so within the ceiling of heading 4, as the Council had hoped."
"The second important aspect of the Council' s second reading concerns Letter of Amendment No 2, which enables the Commission' s new provisions in the field of agriculture to be implemented."
"The Council has accepted this Letter of Amendment in its entirety and, out of the same concern to act in accordance with the most recent data available, the Council has also accepted the European Parliament' s amendments on rural development expenditure, which demonstrate the progress that has been made in the adoption and implementation of national programmes."
"Finally, the Council voted, as had been arranged at the conciliation meeting of 23 November, in favour of additional credits to the value of EUR 60 million, for the funding of screening tests for BSE."
"This sum of EUR 60 million is a preliminary, rapid budgetary response to the Council' s decision to extend tests carried out on cattle."
"It must therefore be seen as a provisional sum."
"The BSE crisis will indeed require other measures, for which a budgetary assessment has not yet been completed and when a system has been more precisely defined, we will, of course, have to take account of its potential impact on the budget and to release the necessary appropriations whilst, as a matter of priority, studying the possibilities of redeploying funds within heading I. Additional funding can then be provided through a supplementary and amending budget within the financial perspective."
"I am delighted that our institutions have been able to reach agreement on adopting, at only one reading, all aspects of this Letter of Amendment No 2, which concerns not only agricultural expenditure but also the fisheries agreements and the inclusion of an estimated balance for the 2000 financial year in the preliminary draft budget for 2001."
"The third important aspect of this Council second reading concerns the agreement reached on the allocation for the ""Spirit of Enterprise"" programme, which continues and complements the ""Employment initiative"" for the years 2001 to 2005."
"The Council and the President have agreed on a very substantial allocation of EUR 450 million for this period and on an allocation of EUR 100 million for 2001."
"The credit for this result, which is proof of the priority given by the European Union to the development of small and medium-sized businesses and to employment must be given to your rapporteur, Jutta Haug, who is in the Chamber today."
"This action is also one of the Council' s political priorities, as expressed at the Luxembourg, Lisbon and Feira Summits."
"Lastly, agreement was reached on 23 November on an increase in payment appropriations for the 2001 budget, which is an increase of 3.5% over the 2000 budget."
"As you all know, this aim is particularly ""dear"" to the Council and I wish to emphasise that an increase of 3.5% will require a considerable effort on the part of the Member States, given that this is slightly above the increase in their national budgets."
"However, I am, of course, aware that this agreement will also require a considerable effort by Parliament, because it will require you to arbitrate on sometimes sensitive issues in your first reading."
"This agreement on the increase in payments has been made possible by the Commission' s proposal to rebudget an amount of EUR 1600 million in commitment appropriations for Community initiative programmes for 2002 and for subsequent years."
"This proposal, which is the result of the time limits necessary for the adoption of these programmes, has been accepted by the Council and by Parliament."
"It therefore means that payment appropriations requirements for the preliminary draft budget will be reduced by EUR 700 million."
"When the Council voted at second reading for a budget increase of 2.5%, it took due account of this new factor."
"For its second reading, Parliament therefore has the considerable margin for manoeuvre of around EUR 1 billion to fund its budgetary priorities, whilst remaining within an overall increase of 3.5%."
"The Council did not, of course, limit its second reading to the four points that I have just mentioned."
"It also accepted several European Parliament amendments in heading 3 on internal policy, particularly in order to take account of developments in legislation."
"Furthermore, the Council accepted certain preparatory actions and certain pilot projects within the limits laid down by the Interinstitutional Agreement, having consulted the Commission on their feasibility."
"Finally, the list of points of agreement between the Council and Parliament would not be complete if I did not mention two important texts that have been adopted this year."
"First of all, a joint declaration on improving the information provided to Parliament and the Council on the Commission' s financial programming, which was adopted in July, on the initiative of Mr Colom i Naval, which I welcome."
"Secondly, a joint declaration has just been adopted, quite recently, on the progress report on the reform of the Commission, on the initiative of Mr Elles."
"These two declarations improve the transparency of the budgetary procedure and of the reforms currently taking place in the Commission."
"I think that they are bound to improve the efficiency of these procedures, which is, I believe, an objective shared by all our institutions."
"Personally, I consider this to be extremely important."
"More generally, I wish to emphasise that the budgetary procedure that will be completed in a few days has clearly demonstrated the interest in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999."
"It is as a result of the consultation between the three institutions, which is provided for and regulated by this agreement, that we have been able to work together on this draft 2001 budget."
"Mobilising the flexibility instrument, which is one of the key innovations of the 1999 agreement, has therefore enabled us to conclude an agreement on the funding of the European Union' s external actions in 2001, whilst taking account of factors that may occur along the way."
"These additional appropriations will enable us to speed up the European Union' s aid programme for the Western Balkans in 2001."
"By the same token, within this Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council has left substantial margins within the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999, largely for heading 3 - internal policy - and for heading 4 - external action."
"These margins will give the European Parliament the opportunity, at second reading, to set its own priorities within the various Community policies and actions."
"Lastly, before you proceed to the final adoption of this budget, I wish to stress the importance the Council attaches to some of the fundamental budgetary rules, in the field of entering appropriations in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure."
"First of all, the entering of appropriations in the reserve can only be carried out by the budgetary authority if the corresponding legal basis has not yet been adopted, in accordance with the provisions of the financial regulation."
"The Council therefore, at second reading, re-established all the appropriations entered into the reserve by Parliament for reasons other than the absence of a legal basis."
"In this respect, I welcome the agreement that has been reached at first reading by our two institutions to abolish the conditional entering of appropriations in the reserve, which had been carried out by Parliament, for heading 4, the performance reserve, and for heading 5, with regard to appropriations relating to the reform of the Commission, under Letter of Amendment No 1."
"Secondly, I should like to insist on the respect for the rules that is incumbent on the institutions with regard to classifying appropriations as compulsory or non-compulsory expenditure."
"Your Committee on Budgets has proposed to change two budget lines by amendment at second reading, one concerning the early retirement scheme and the other expenditure relating to the fisheries agreement."
"I wish to draw the European Parliament' s attention to the fact that, under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement, these budget lines constitute compulsory expenditure, which was, moreover, acknowledged by Parliament at first reading."
"Consequently, appropriations included in these lines must be considered to have been definitively adopted following second reading in Council, in accordance with Article 272 of the Treaty and cannot therefore be further modified."
"To conclude this overview, I wish to join those who have highlighted the excellent climate in which this budgetary procedure has taken place."
"The discussions were at times frank, but were always relevant and underpinned by ongoing exchanges of views, which enabled us better to understand each other and therefore to more easily conclude an agreement, which I hope everyone will find satisfactory."
"A good budget is a budget that has been thoroughly discussed."
"This budget should therefore be born under the best auspices."
"I wish to personally thank Terence Wynn, chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the three rapporteurs, Jutta Haug, Markus Ferber and Joan Colom i Naval as well as all the members of the Committee on Budgets that I have had the pleasure of meeting during the six months of the French Presidency."
"I can assure you that the Council' s objective, throughout this budgetary procedure, has been to produce a budget for 2001 that will enable the European Union to respond to the crises that affect it within Europe itself but also those occurring beyond its borders."
"I think that, together, going beyond the priorities of each of our institutions, we have created, step by step, a budget for the 2001 financial year, which reflects the ambition that we all advocate, of a Europe at the service of its citizens."
"You must now give this outcome your approval."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the negotiations in Nice, a substantial result was achieved on the 2001 budget in a single joint night sitting."
"Unlike Nice, all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are, I think, well pleased with the final result."
"It provides a good basis for Community policy next year; to be honest, the Community approach has been most productive throughout the year, throughout all the preliminary discussions and, on behalf of the Commission, I really must thank you and your colleagues, Mrs Parly; you proved to be a very skilled midwife at the birth of this 2001 budget and focused the debates and negotiations on the core issues."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her highly original combination of total determination and willingness to negotiate which culminated in this good result."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Ferber and Mr Colom i Naval, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, and the members of the Committee on Budgets for being so committed."
"It was thanks to their commitment that negotiations were brought to such a successful conclusion. The 2001 budget which we now have before us gives us funds of EUR 96.2 billion for new commitments next year and EUR 92.6 billion for payments."
"That translates into a rate of increase in the budget, as you pointed out, of 3.1 and 3.5% in comparison with the previous year, roughly in line with the rate of increase in the national budgets."
"One very important point is that the total budget only accounts for 1.06% of the joint European gross national product and, in terms of expenditure ratios, is lower than this year's budget."
"This illustrates that we have applied budgetary discipline, but it also illustrates that the financial planning concept decided in Berlin, i.e. that expenditure for the current Member States is being cut back in order to find room to fund enlargement, is being taken into account and is working."
"However, we must also note that the figures before us today do not include the supplementary budget which still needs to be addressed in the wake of the BSE crisis."
"I shall come back to that in a moment."
"First: what is so special about the 2001 budget?"
"In the Commission's view, it is the fact that the second pillar of agricultural policy, namely promoting rural development, shows the highest rate of increase at 10%."
"I think this is worth mentioning because it means that we have a total of EUR 4.5 billion at our disposal."
"I really must disagree with the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, who stated recently in a newspaper interview that this amounted to no more than a toothpick, never mind a second pillar, because this fails to do justice to the size of the sum in question: 4.5 billion is a considerable sum of money - it is almost as much as we have for the whole of foreign policy and the size of this sum and this ratio need to be highlighted."
"We really can say, in foreign policy, that the policy of the European Union is having a huge effect, even with this budget, and I am positive that it is thanks to Community policy that we now have democratisation in the Balkans and a chance, hopefully, of stability in the near future."
"I am positive that no such success would have been possible with the old concept of bilateral friendships, with Member States being played off against each other."
"It is the outcome of Community policy and it is therefore excellent that we have again managed to include EUR 839 million in the 2001 budget for the Balkans."
"It was no easy task, but we managed thanks to the agreed use of the flexibility reserve, which was used to provide funds over and above the sum provided for or decided in Nice as a basis for the Balkan policy - namely a total of EUR 4.65 billion over the period up to 2006."
"In providing the EUR 200 million emergency package, the Union has also proven that it is perfectly able to act quickly and take full account of its foreign policy responsibilities."
"What is important is that no country in the Balkans will now be offered less aid than originally planned before developments in Serbia due to the democratisation of Serbia."
"I think it is also important to signal that we fully support the new potential for cooperation which has arisen at last."
"I should like at this point to take the opportunity to thank Mr Kouchner for his splendid work in Kosovo; we were also able to provide huge support here from our budgetary resources."
"The process of reforming the Commission is also extremely important, particularly with a view to good financial management."
"Good financial management needs sufficient, well-qualified staff."
"Allow me at this point, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the budgetary authority for its support and for approving 400 new posts."
"You have linked this with a call for a concerted effort to bring about improvements, especially in areas in which financial support programmes have been implemented late or badly and I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen - especially you Mr Elles - that the Commission will do everything it can to improve its past record on the implementation of financial programmes."
"But let us not delude ourselves: we need both good financial management and the corresponding means of payment if we are to eliminate outstanding commitments."
"Nearly a third of the budget is set aside for structural policy, in order to help regions in economic difficulty overcome their problems and make up economic ground, especially through the Cohesion Fund."
"The Court of Auditors recently confirmed in a special report that this objective is being achieved and that the money from the Cohesion Fund is being put to good use."
"Here the Community is demonstrating solidarity by using Community funds to provide real support for economic development and it goes without saying that the regions and countries which are now on the receiving end of our solidarity will be prepared in the future to demonstrate their solidarity with the new countries, as and when we enlarge the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with the new outbreak of BSE in cattle, immediate action was also required in the budgetary area in order to protect health and consumers and help the farmers affected."
"The budget being voted on today includes EUR 6 billion to subsidise beef production, in addition to the EUR 60 million budgeted in order to cofinance BSE tests."
"The agricultural ministers meeting in emergency session have proposed new measures in the wake of the BSE crisis, but we are all agreed that it makes no sense to postpone the resolution on the budget in order to include these new measures and that a supplementary budget will be submitted post haste in order to fund the necessary measures."
"A considerable amount of money will be needed, which is why I think that the Ecofin Council needs to address the budgetary consequences as a matter of urgency, because there are still points at which there is a discrepancy between our claims, or what we have in mind, and the funds at our disposal."
"Plus - and this was again stressed in Nice - we have to comply with the financial regulations and ceilings for the agricultural budget."
"Here we are in the peculiar situation of having even less room for manoeuvre because of the change in exchange rates."
"I was therefore most annoyed when the agricultural ministers, whilst fully aware of the BSE situation, rushed and served themselves from Christmas tables piled high with fruit and vegetables, bananas and nuts which required a total of 85 million in increased subsidies."
"I think that when a new emergency arises - and with the BSE crisis new priorities obviously need to be set in the agricultural budget - then certain consequences also apply and clear resolutions need to be taken and the core issues defined for the agricultural budget, which does, after all, total EUR 44 billion."
"As the Commissioner responsible for the budget, I am completely behind the emergency action which needs to be decided, including support for the beef market, but the fact that we subsidise beef production to the tune of EUR 6 billion on the one hand and must now pay out thousands of millions to subsidise its destruction is proof positive, in my opinion, of the urgent need for action in the whole agricultural policy sector. I trust that the European Parliament will support me here."
"Several decisions taken at Nice are highly relevant to the budget and the budgetary process."
"All the institutions will have their work cut out here."
"All the more reason to rejoice in the fact that negotiations on the 2001 budget were conducted in such a good atmosphere and led to such good results and, on behalf of the Commission, I should like thank everyone involved."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur I thank both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their kind words, but I did ask a concise question in my previous turn."
"It was asking for someone to explain to us rationally, if not in a Cartesian manner, the difference between an annual revision of the financial perspective and the use of the flexibility instrument."
"I would like to have an explanation."
"If not, I will have to interpret that silence is the response."
"Mr President, I should like to answer Mr Colom i Naval on the issue of the use of the flexibility instrument in revising the financial perspective."
"In fact, the repeated use, two years in a row, of the flexibility instrument could be considered, wrongly in my opinion, to be a form of revision of the financial perspective."
"Personally, I think that this is not true in terms of procedure and certainly not in terms of substance."
"The procedure for the flexibility instrument was laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement for the purpose, in exceptional cases, of funding specific expenditure over and above the ceilings agreed in Berlin, without calling the financial perspective into question."
"I therefore think that, with regard to content, there is no contradiction between the two approaches, but rather a form of complementarity."
"With regard to the specific cases that we have experienced for the last two years, in other words, Kosovo and Serbia, mobilising the flexibility instrument has enabled us to fund exceptional expenditure through an exceptional effort."
"In both of these cases, the flexibility instrument has enabled us to anticipate needs."
"In Kosovo, for example, there was a need to implement aid more quickly whereas in Serbia, the need was to commit a significant sum, even before a definitive assessment of needs was carried out and even before the distribution of roles between the various donors could be defined."
"From the Council' s point of view, therefore, mobilising the flexibility instrument does not represent a challenge to the viability of the financial perspective laid down in Berlin."
"Furthermore, the Council has defined a multiannual sum, admittedly indicative in nature, which is compatible with this financial perspective, for the framework programme for aid for reconstruction in the Western Balkans."
"I hope that I have answered Mr Colom i Naval' s question."
"After this illustration, which I am sure will be very useful to all Members, we are going to do the round of the opinions of the various parliamentary committees."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Haug for her hard work and her success in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That has been a high-order issue for the Committee on Industry, and we are very pleased with the success that she has achieved."
"However, it is not just a success for the Committee on Industry and for Parliament; it also reflects the priorities of governments in Europe."
"That is the point that causes me some consternation in relation to the position adopted in this process by the Council."
"My committee is very interested in the research area."
"We praised Commissioner Busquin, who has exceeded our expectations in that area."
"We have heard the Council say on many occasions that it wants to ensure that Europe becomes pre-eminent in research."
"Then we see the Council make a significant cut in payment appropriations, so that Mrs Haug then has to make some changes."
"We have heard from the Council today that it is prepared to improve the record by 3.5%."
"That is the context of the process we are engaged in."
"I congratulate our rapporteur. However, our committee is somewhat disappointed by the approach of the Council."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for the outstanding cooperation, and also the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn."
"I have two comments to make in connection with the document now on the table, and these are directed at the Council and the Commission."
"To start with, I want to talk about the overall agricultural budget."
"Of course we know that it comprises almost 45% of the EU budget, but if you add up what the EU Member States contribute and what the European Union contributes to the agricultural budget, you arrive at 1.9%, and a substantial amount of that is spent on the development of rural areas and environmental development."
"That is a mere pittance compared with what other trade blocks in the world spend."
"If you consider that American companies receive the equivalent of three times as much aid and a capricious country such as Turkey spends in excess of 10% of government money on agriculture and horticulture, then it is Europe that wants something for nothing."
"My second point concerns BSE."
"I think you should know that on the night of 23 and 24 November, when we sat round the table with Mrs Parly, we fought like lions to get more money for BSE."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development told us to use the financial leeway between the financial perspective and the final budget, which amounted to upwards of generous EUR 900 million at the time, EUR 600 million of which was to be used for BSE."
"We fought tooth and nail to add a few extra million euro."
"A week further down the line and two cases of BSE have come to light in Germany."
"This means that in actual fact we already need a supplementary budget of EUR 900 million."
"This would suggest that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this House was keenly aware of what needed to be done and was also fiercely critical of the Council and the Commission in this respect, for their handling of BSE policy."
"Swifter decision-making based on tests as opposed to draconian measures after the event would have cost considerably less and it would be too stupid for words, regarding this political policy, also on the part of the Council and the Commission, to say that from now on we will include the bill in the agricultural budget."
"That is impossible because we have an agreement with the Council and the Commission for the remainder of the agricultural budget, for all the necessary allocations, and that means supplementary budgets."
"It also means that this extra money must come from the Member States, and not be plundered from the existing agricultural budget, because - and I am addressing this comment to both the Council and the Commission - I assume you have given your word on this, regarding the agreement we reached."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Haug for her excellent work in preparing the budget."
"Mrs Haug and the Committee on Budgets have taken account of the proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Our committee' s main objective was to see that there were sufficient payment appropriations in next year' s budget."
"In this way, we ensure that problems with last year' s arrears are resolved and new programmes are introduced effectively."
"If necessary, the matter of payment appropriations must be examined in the supplementary budget in 2001."
"The amendments to cross-border cooperation are justified, but we were slightly off target with regard to Interreg and URBAN."
"The focus for transport is the development of the trans-European transport networks."
"I am grateful for the investment in sustainable transport, but it has to be said that transport and tourism appropriations are little more than token gestures."
"In the years to come we will need considerably more in these areas."
"Our committee will be monitoring the implementation of the budget."
"The effective use of resources will serve to improve the employment situation, particularly via SMEs and new technology."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like first of all to say that the European Parliament has scored a major victory in as much as the cuts in the Latin American, Asian and African poverty programmes have been made good."
"I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the Commission and the Council for this."
"Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Balkans should be regarded as pillars of equal standing in our external policy and not played off against each other."
"This must shortly find expression - as is clear from the debate - in the multiannual programme."
"Secondly, it gives me great pleasure to note that there is support from the whole of Parliament, right across the political spectrum, for the concrete objectives for tackling poverty, as have been proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation in the 2001 budget, partly on the basis of the historical data provided by the European Commission; in particular, the doubling of the budgets for basic education and healthcare in the regional programmes for Latin America, Asia, Africa and the European Development Fund, amounting to a total of around EUR five million, is a huge step forwards."
"Output instead of input."
"We are counting on robust instructions and spending from the European Commission, in line with these objectives."
"I would like to thank Mrs Haug most sincerely."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for the magnificent work that she has done as the rapporteur responsible for the budget and for her efforts in dealing with the requests that the various committees have made."
"As far as the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is concerned, the final result is not exactly the one that we would have liked."
"The quantities budgeted are very far below what we had requested, but we accept that this has been a general practice and we therefore accept the result as it stands."
"This does not mean that in next year' s budget we will not once again be determined to obtain what we think is fairest and most appropriate, and what will enable us to achieve the objectives of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Mr President, first of all I support the overall budget."
"It operates within the financial perspective."
"We have no more important obligation than to live within our means."
"I speak on what is probably the smallest line in the budget: EUR 2.9 million for the Ombudsman."
"That is a very small sum of money."
"It constitutes less than one cent per inhabitant of the European Union."
"Let us regard it as the ""citizen's cent""."
"We have to make sure that we listen to the citizens and if they have complaints, that there are procedures to redress them."
"That expenditure is well-spent."
"The Committee on Petitions very much hopes that its budget will now provide for a proper database so that citizens who are interested in pursuing their petitions will be able to see what progress is being made."
"We hope that will be achieved."
"Finally, information is an important concern for this Parliament."
"We must see that we keep our information programmes."
"In particular I would cite Euronews so that people can see in the media what Parliament and the Union are doing."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mrs Haug for her excellent work."
"I fully agree with the comments made by our colleague Joan Colom on the revision of the financial perspective."
"The amount for the common fisheries policy is scarcely 1% of the Community budget."
"However, this small quantity, which is essential for maintaining the activity of the sector and the economies of areas that are dependent on fisheries, is a very appetising snack, despite being small, each time we look at where to find money to fund new policies."
"Commissioner, fish is an essential element for a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in proteins."
"When European consumers go to the market with concerns about what they can buy, in fish they find a safe, quality product."
"They will therefore think that this 1% of the European Union budget is being very well used."
"The 2001 budget gave rise to a fair amount of indignation among the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the main reason being that 50% of the PRINCE information campaign was entered in the reserve."
"This decision would have prevented us from running the information campaign on the introduction of the euro in the year which matters, i.e. in 2001, at a time when uncertainty due to the fall in the value of the euro against the dollar and the need for information on the introduction of coins in 2002 are at their height."
"The Committee on Budgets decided during the last few days to propose to Parliament that the 50% be removed from the reserve and allocated to these lines."
"Our warmest thanks therefore to the members of the Committee on Budgets."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is satisfied and the Commission has the necessary planning security."
"Mr President, no great drama has been acted out around the debate on the budget this year."
"That does not mean, however, that things have been easy."
"The matter-of-fact approach of the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, has nevertheless shown its strength."
"The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Wynn, also deserves our thanks."
"It is a positive step, as far as culture is concerned, that the financing of multiannual programmes, i.e. Socrates, Culture 2000, Youth and the new Media Plus programme, are in order with regard to the budget."
"Hopefully, the problems that occurred in the implementation of the programmes are over."
"It is important that the Union should serve the needs of its citizens well."
"In the budget there is direct financing for European culture networks. There is no doubt at all that they need it."
"But the rules for financing are not yet working properly."
"There is too much that is arbitrary about all this."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport intends to look into this matter early next year."
"The modest sums involved must be spent well and fairly."
"Mr President, I speak for the European People's Party and European Democrats."
"I would like, in introducing our group's position on this, to welcome the work done by Mrs Haug and by our own rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, and also the Council President, Mrs Parly, for their significant assistance in achieving a budget on 23 November which, as the presidency has rightly pointed out, was a landmark in the way in which Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been able to help decide collectively a budget for the European Union."
"We have a budget which is under 1.06%, we have a budget, Mr Colom, which is within the financial perspective."
"I suspect that, to put it simply, flexibility is for small amounts and revision is for large amounts, but we will see in the next few years how that will go."
"But I would like to thank both the Commission and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their remarks about the joint declaration which we have put together, because that is also a first indication of how we are going to monitor improvements and performance in the running of the programmes, particularly in category 4."
"Turning to that for a moment, we have a lot of work in front of us and we await with interest the report by Mrs Schreyer, preferably before 30 June, so that we can use its contents for shaping up the 2002 budget."
"But in thinking about the question of the backlog on commitments and how we limit the duration of new commitments - obviously this comes into the domain of the financial regulation which we will have to negotiate."
"We believe it is absolutely fundamental that this progress report should be seen to restore the confidence of our citizens in the way in which the European Union institutions operate."
"A word on the reserve, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"You said, if I understood you correctly, that we should not be using the reserve because it was against the rules to do this."
"We use the reserve, particularly on first reading, to draw attention to particular points of weakness in the way in which policies are operating."
"The information policy in the institutions at the moment is a scandal and therefore, rather than putting money on the line for information policy when we know it is not being used effectively, we are going to be keeping much of that money in reserve waiting for the Commission to come up with the right proposals."
"Of course, the solution would be to allow us, as a joint budgetary authority, to lift funds being spent during the year and that may be an invention which we can insert into the revision of the financial regulation."
"Lastly, I would say, looking to the future, that Nice has shown us that there is perhaps a feeling that we are shifting a little bit towards intergovernmentalism, with the Council deciding on the numbers of our Parliament without our being consulted beforehand."
"Our confidence as one of three institutions, will only be maintained - and therefore the institutional agreement and the financial perspective maintained - if we manage to create mutual confidence and if we are consulted at every stage on our fundamental interests."
"Mr President, my thanks first and foremost to Florence Parly, who is just leaving but who, I think, is still within earshot."
"After the experiences of last year, I think she has created a very good atmosphere, both here and in the Council, with the active commitment which she has shown throughout her presidency."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Schreyer, who has continued to help us with her highly constructive approach and, of course, my friend Jutta Haug, who has done an excellent job, not forgetting Joan Colom i Naval and Markus Ferber."
"We are now at the point at which we must decide whether or not we can vote in favour of this budget next Thursday."
"Obviously we need to take a very close look at it and this is exactly what Parliament in general and we Social Democrats in particular intend to do. We believe that we managed to do a great deal of good during the discussions, both retaining and extending crucial priorities."
"With unemployment still at over 8% throughout Europe, the European Union needs to use the budget at its disposal to send out a clear message and to set about fighting this scourge in the economy to our citizens, which is why it is important that we have this 450 million at our disposal next year, starting with 100 million this year."
"It shows people that we take their problems seriously and are doing something about them."
"I am delighted that we have managed in Category IV of this budget to show those living in the greatest need or in the process of democratising their countries throughout the world that this European Parliament and this European Union has not forgotten them, even if we have our own problems to resolve, and that here too we are making sure that there is enough money to go round."
"It is important for the people in the Balkans to understand, following the long period of hostilities during which our side presented a united front, that they can also rely on us when it comes to reconstruction."
"There are people sitting in this House who are at pains to ensure that the money needed will in fact be provided as and when it is needed and that flowery words will be accompanied by specific actions."
"So I think that, along with much else which there is too little time to mention, we have a great deal to be pleased about."
"We have also passed a number of resolutions containing instructions."
"Allow me to say to the Commission, by way of example, that we have agreed to the 400 additional posts because we want to improve how various programmes are implemented, because we want you to be able to work better than you have been able to do in the past."
"But we also say in no uncertain terms that this implies a responsibility and a commitment on your part, because we shall be watching over you throughout this process."
"We shall be checking up, we shall be in contact with you and we shall be keeping tabs on what is happening, ensuring that there really has been an improvement before we are prepared to go even further with you."
"It is also a commitment vis-√†-vis the Council."
"I have a couple of questions to put to the Council - not that I am questioning the compromise."
"But should we really have to try year after year to see what is left over from the previous year, what can be carried over to provide enough money for regions such as Serbia and the Balkans?"
"Should we really have to check first and see what is left over?"
"Is our message to these people: we will give you what is left over and then we shall see if we can add anything to it?"
"Should that be our message?"
"No it should not!"
"By refusing to discuss the specific long-term aspects of this challenge with us, you have brought the whole spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement into question."
"You keep saying that the financial perspective is sacrosanct as far as you are concerned."
"But the Interinstitutional Agreement between the three institutions is also a valuable item and should help us to achieve joint planning security."
"The Balkans and other regions need planning security."
"Repeated use of the flexibility instrument also contradicts the Interinstitutional Agreement, because it was an instrument which this European Parliament secured in order to pay for contingencies and so that it could let it run up to EUR 600 million."
"It was never meant to be used for firefighting every year in areas which we have to fund in any case."
"You are undermining the Interinstitutional Agreement and let me assure you that we shall consider whether or not we intend to have a part in this next year."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the budget rapporteurs, Mrs Haug and Mr Ferber, for their excellent work. The same goes for Mr Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, for the splendidly accomplished conciliatory work he has done and for his constructive leadership of the committee."
"Next year' s budget will be very much based on strict budgetary discipline."
"Although agricultural expenditure, which accounts for almost half the entire budget, will increase by more than 5%, when the Letter of Amendment has been taken into account, the overall increase in the budget is just 3.5%."
"This means that great restraint has been shown in the use of funds in the other categories."
"This makes just 1.056% of GNP, which must be considered very low as the ceiling for the financial perspective is 1.11%."
"This means a saving of more than EUR 2 billion."
"This, however, conceals a danger."
"The budget will be seeing a structural distortion, as money spent on payment commitments comes to over EUR 3.6 billion more than that for appropriations for payments."
"This means that there will be an increase in arrears."
"For that reason, Parliament' s concern that the problem of arrears will have to be dealt with is a justified one, and that is why there has been a very real need for a joint declaration by Parliament and the Council."
"Furthermore, the fact that the Council and Parliament reached agreement regarding the EU' s budget for next year is to be greeted with satisfaction."
"It shows that both budgetary authorities are taking responsibility for the administration of the EU in an appropriate manner."
"However, it is unfortunate that Parliament once again had to fight with regard to funds for the West Balkans."
"Regarding other matters, I would say that for my group it is a positive move that a 450 million euro multiannual programme was agreed for the employment initiative; and, moreover, that it was agreed that funds remaining unspent from Community initiatives - totalling EUR 1 600 million- would be budgeted in the years to come."
"We failed to fill a considerable number of parliamentary posts throughout this year."
"This shows that in future there must be better use of personnel resources."
"With these observations, my group is prepared to adopt the draft budget."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur and, of course, the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for their excellent work."
"Our group will also vote in favour of this budget because it shows that, once again, we have reached an exemplary compromise, despite being under increasing pressure."
"The main sources of this pressure are unemployment, the BSE crisis and the Balkan stability pact."
"We have resolved and reached satisfactory compromises on all these urgent problems - and never once to the detriment of the interests of the EU."
"We wanted to secure the EU's ability to act and the confidence of the people."
"Nonetheless, I should like expressly to agree with Mr Colom i Naval, who said earlier that the financial perspective has become more and more of a straightjacket, preventing any real planning, any real long-term planning."
"Constant use of the flexibility reserve is undermining the transparency of the budget and in time this too will lead to a loss of credibility."
"Even the Notenboom procedure, whereby funds are transferred to critical regions, in this case to fund the Balkan stability pact, does not really guarantee a transparent budgetary procedure."
"It already looks likely that the huge risk of a clash between MEDA, Mediterranean rim projects and the Balkans will increase over the next few years, despite the fact that we all know that this is where money is urgently needed."
"On the other hand, we are also aware that the Council is perfectly capable of suddenly questioning the financial perspective when it comes to BSE, when it comes to national interests."
"I found Mr Chirac's statement at the Nice Council extremely interesting."
"I think the Council urgently needs to consider how it, for its part, intends to handle the financial perspective."
"In all events, Parliament will be a much tougher negotiating partner next year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are suspending the debate at this point in order to hear the President of the Republic of France and of the European Council."
"The debate will resume when appropriate according to the agenda."
"European Council/ French Presidency"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to welcome Mr Jacques Chirac, President of France and President-in-Office of the Council,"
"and the next item is the joint discussion on the report by the European Council and the Commission statement on the European Council meeting in Nice and the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council on the French Presidency' s term of office."
"I am delighted to give the floor, without further ado, to President Chirac."
"I wish to thank President Chirac and I shall give the floor straightaway to Mr Prodi, on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, I give you the floor."
". (IT) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the December 2000 European Council will be remembered as particularly lengthy and particularly complex."
"This was always likely, given its agenda and indeed that is precisely what happened."
"Positive decisions were taken at Nice, some of them long-awaited."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights was solemnly proclaimed."
"I personally have no doubt that this is a seminal text and I would like to remind those who feel that it does not go far enough - and I know that many in this House are of this opinion - that it was drafted and conceived with care precisely with a view to giving it legal status."
"Parliament and the Commission have already made it clear that, for their part, they intend to apply the Charter in full."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the original foundations of a European Company Statute were laid over 30 years ago."
"It is a legal instrument of obvious value which our operators had long been pressing for and which was sorely lacking during the major company restructuring we have experienced recently."
"I am happy to say that now there is no longer anything to prevent us from implementing it rapidly."
"With regard to enlargement, the strategy proposed by the Commission was endorsed."
"The Social Agenda was also adopted, the fruit of productive cooperation with the Presidency, as has been pointed out."
"The Commission's proposals on maritime safety and the creation of a European Food Safety Authority met with strong support, as did the decisions on our seven outermost regions."
"These are some of the issues which were put before the Heads of State and Government."
"I would mention one other issue which I can sense will be of considerable importance: the Council also discussed the way in which the summits are organised."
"The European Council took the wise decision to move gradually towards holding them all in Brussels."
"This will further reinforce the city's status as the capital of Europe"
"(Applause)"
"and, once the summits which have already been scheduled have taken place, one out of every two summits will be held in Brussels."
"Once the European Union has grown to 18 Member States, the decision will apply to all the summits."
"I sincerely believe that we should welcome this convincing initiative from Mr Chirac."
"(Applause)"
"Moving on to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of Nice, I would first of all like to pay heartfelt tribute to Michel Barnier for his work."
"(Applause)"
"He worked, as I did but to a greater extent, in collaboration with Parliament, particularly with Giorgio Napolitano and his Committee, with the two rapporteurs, Mr Leinen and Mr Dimitrakopoulos and, of course, with Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, whose commitment was total and absolute."
"Finally, Madam President, I would like to praise the truly exemplary clarity of your own speeches to the meetings of the Council."
"As you will remember, Madam President, the last time that I addressed this House, just before the Summit, I said that we needed a treaty with genuine added value."
"In particular, I promised to return to this House with a frank assessment of the outcome."
"Moreover, in your own address at the beginning of the Summit, you said that Parliament would judge the success of Nice in terms of quality as well as quantity."
"It will be a little while before we can make a full, accurate assessment of the progress made at Nice, but we can at this stage hazard a few observations."
"The first relates to the extension of qualified majority voting."
"This is a quantitatively important step forwards because it has brought 30 or so new chapters under this umbrella. As a result, qualified majority voting will increasingly become the general rule at the Council, and this must not be underestimated."
"Qualitatively, the same cannot be said."
"Little or no progress was made on the sensitive issues of cohesion, tax regulation and social legislation."
"(Applause)"
"In fact, in these areas, the Conference came up against the intransigence of some Member States."
"This is something which deeply disappoints me, not just because of the short-term consequences but because the attitude behind it shows a lack of openness and understanding."
"Anyone who sees Europe merely as a ""clearing house"""
"(Applause)"
"to approach when necessary and to stay away from when they cannot get what they want or once they have got everything they want from it is not just making an error of historical analysis but is cheating future generations, who have the right to expect much more from Europe."
"This inward-looking backdrop of reciprocal failure to make concessions does offer some small progress on justice and home affairs, however, although it has to be said that most of this progress has been deferred until after 2004."
"This is not to belittle it."
"It does, however, mean that the speed of development of the major new policy area of legal matters and cross-border crime, which was adopted in Tampere, is now under threat, and that the Tampere ""scoreboard"" will start to show delays."
"I hope that these delays will not be blamed on Parliament or the Commission."
"Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Chirac and the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, for making it possible to put paid to the main ambiguities of our commercial policy."
"A good balance was struck between the legitimate concerns surrounding issues such as cultural diversity, in particular, and the effectiveness of our powers of negotiating with our trading partners."
"Another source of satisfaction lies in the result in the field of closer cooperation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that what we have here is a tool that is vital for the enlarged Union, one that the Commission will make use of while taking care to play its ""guarantor"" role fully, firstly to make it possible for countries that wish to work together more closely towards major new common goals to do so, and secondly to counter any risk of fragmentation that unregulated use of such cooperation might bring."
"On the subject of the institutions themselves I would like to say three things."
"Where the Commission is concerned, there has been sweeping, far-reaching change."
"The Commission will be able to grow to 26 members. After that, the necessary and much hoped-for alterations will be made."
"These changes have been accompanied by the launching of major reform of the way in which the Commission is organised."
"The President will be appointed by majority rather than unanimous vote. After the vote of the Commission, the President will have the power to dismiss Commissioners and a wide degree of discretion regarding the actual organisation of the Commission itself, for example in matters such as the assigning of portfolios and the appointment of Vice-Presidents."
"Parliament's main gain is a statute for political parties at European level."
"The Commission defended - unfortunately with no success although the matter has not yet been closed - our shared concerns regarding the protection of the Union's financial interests by proposing that a Prosecutor should be established."
"However, it is worrying that MEP numbers are being used essentially to counterbalance the equilibria in the Council."
"Much greater attention will need to be devoted in the future to this and other related problems, and we must move from a defensive role to a more strongly proactive one."
"Lastly, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that gave rise to the most difficult debate and the most difficult decision."
"This was inevitable given the approach taken, but the outcome was regrettable for two reasons: firstly because it made a qualified majority more difficult and a blocking minority accordingly easier, whereas logically, in an expanding Union, the exact opposite is required;"
"(Applause)"
"and secondly because it has made the decision-making process even more complex, which runs counter to the legibility and transparency for which the citizens are calling."
"(Applause)"
"To respond to our citizens' demands, we had advocated a double majority as the only solution which is objective, comprehensible and widely supported by smaller and larger countries alike."
"(Applause)"
"At this juncture, we must pay particular tribute to the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, who fought to the very end for a more equitable presence for the candidate countries and to set the qualified majority threshold at a less unreasonable level - although one that is still too high."
"He thus confirmed Belgium's great historic role in the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must recognise that the hard-won conclusion of the Nice Summit was an achievement in itself."
"A conclusion had to be reached and, thanks to the efforts of the Presidency, we got there in the end."
"There are no leftovers from Nice."
"The next step is to work realistically towards ratifying the Treaty as soon as possible."
"This will enable us to move on to welcoming the new Members, in line with the Helsinki conclusions."
"We must proceed resolutely in that direction."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I feel - as President Chirac remarked - that the Nice Summit was characterised by the efforts of many to defend their own immediate interests, to the detriment of a long-term vision."
"Nice does, however, include a declaration on the future of the Union which gives me cause for some optimism."
"The Commission is aware of the importance of establishing a more precise division of competences between the European Union and the Member States. Incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, simplifying the layout of the Treaties and reviewing the role of our institutions."
"This review must be an open, thorough discussion on a vast scale, involving the governments, parliaments and citizens of the current Member States and the candidate countries and demonstrating the dynamism of a Europe which is still being built."
"There is a great need for such a discussion for the experience of Nice shows that the current method of reviewing the Treaties is no longer a valid one."
"(Applause)"
"Like the Community structure itself, the process being used to produce institutional change is under stress and needs to be changed."
"The Commission will come up with proposals for improving this process, and I am counting upon your participation and support."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after these initial, incomplete remarks which I have tried to put to you objectively and with conviction, I would appeal to everyone to remember that the final objective of the Nice Summit was, and still is, the unification of Europe."
"The new Millennium has given us an unprecedented opportunity to bind together the countries of our continent in a wide area of peace, stability and economic growth."
"Nice is a step in this direction: a shorter step than we had hoped for, or indeed, could have made, but a step in the right direction all the same."
"I therefore ask you to lend us your support."
"(Loud, sustained applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Chirac, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Chirac, our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats has always received you here in the European Parliament with the greatest respect, open-mindedness and esteem."
"The same applies today because we value you as a person and because your office so demands."
"We appreciate the fact that you were here in July and have returned here today, but the esteem in which we hold both you as a person and your office does not absolve us from honesty and we have a duty to express our convictions loudly and clearly today in your presence."
"You said at the end of the summit that the Nice Summit would go down in the history of Europe as a major summit."
"Unfortunately, our group cannot concur with that."
"(Applause from the right)"
"We witnessed an Intergovernmental Conference which dragged on for months, followed by a summit in Nice at which we felt, even as we watched on television, that the Heads of State and Government - and this is a perfectly human trait - had reached the end of their physical and mental resources."
"Allow me to cite an example: thank God, the awful proposal that Poland should have fewer votes than Spain, despite having the same population, was revised."
"What sort of impression would Poland have had, with its experience of national socialism and communism, had it not been treated on a par with Spain."
"Thank God this has been corrected."
"Mr President, I mention this because proposals such as this arise in the maelstrom of a summit such as Nice but should never be repeated in the history of the European Union."
"We say today to the people of central Europe: you are welcome in our European Union and it was Alain Lamassoure's proposal, which then became our group's proposal, Parliament's proposal, the Commission's proposal - and thankfully you too have adopted it - that we ensure that the first central European countries are able to take part in the next European elections in 2004."
"(Applause)"
"Unfortunately, we also witnessed the contrast between large and small countries over recent months - and this too should never be repeated, because it acts as an insidious poison in the European Union - with many large countries behaving most meanly and many small countries behaving most generously."
"(Applause)"
"And we have seen with great concern over recent weeks and months, that governments are taking ever greater recourse to intergovernmentalism and governmental cooperation and I can only hope that the spirit of Pierre Pflimlin, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet will be the spirit and vision which determine the future of Europe ..."
"(Applause) ... because we are firmly convinced that only a Europe of communities with strong European institutions can safeguard law, democracy, solidarity and peace for us on our continent."
"Nice obviously had its good and bad points; unfortunately there were a great many bad points."
"However, our yardstick for Nice from the beginning was the European Union's ability to act."
"Commission President Prodi, whom we thank, together with Michel Barnier - because we have not forgotten, Mr President, that Mr Barnier is a member of the Commission on your recommendation and we do not only want to criticise - has pointed out that it is precisely in the fundamental areas that qualified majority voting has not been extended in the Council of Ministers."
"For the European Parliament, which was the winner in Amsterdam, there has been no increase in codecision by the European Parliament and this is one of the great failings of the Nice Summit."
"(Applause)"
"I do not intend to comment further on the complexities of the decision-making process because Elmar Brok from our group will certainly do so directly."
"But we have not achieved greater transparency."
"We have hope for the future and we do also see the good side, such as your commitment to the foreign, security and defence policy and the increase in Commission posts."
"We take you at your word, President Chirac, and I was delighted to hear that you want to involve the European Parliament closely in the post-Nice process."
"We expect all the Member States of the European Union and their governments to configure a conference in which the European Parliament is involved and helps to set the agenda and the procedure."
"We take you at your word that this will happen and then we shall perhaps move together towards a brighter future."
"We have heard many fine words."
"You rightly speak of transparency."
"Above all, we need transparency in the Council of Ministers and we are most concerned to see that even the secretary-general - Mr Solana is more of high representative than a secretary-general - is prevented by the Community procedure from performing his duties as secretary-general as he would perhaps like to do."
"We were delighted to hear that the European Parliament will be fully involved in the post-Nice process."
"On this depends our final answer, whether we say yes or no to Nice."
"We want a post-Nice process in which the European Parliament is involved both in setting the agenda and in the decision-making process."
"If you secure this then we shall have the chance to work together in a spirit of trust."
"We shall have to keep a very critical eye on the Council over coming weeks and months in order to ascertain if it too is in a position to safeguard the transparency of which you spoke."
"These will be our yardsticks and, like you, we hope to be able to do our job so that we, the European Union, with our values, are truly open to the people of central Europe, who suffered a long time under Communism and who now wish to join our Community."
"We must open the door, but decisions must be made so that the European Union is also in a position to enlarge."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, finally the Summit concluded with a result."
"For now we have got out of the tight spot."
"Now we need to look at the text carefully in Parliament."
"For now, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, I can tell you what is on the Council web site, or at least what was on it at 10.00 this morning: the Treaty will be available when it has been approved."
"Please ask the Council staff to at least update the text."
"I think that 'something' was approved in Nice."
"In any case, the fact that an agreement has been reached is an achievement in itself."
"Because it was not about residue, leftovers or ends to tie up from what was discussed in Amsterdam and not agreed on."
"It was about fundamental issues for the governance of Europe, and we can now start working on this."
"We are taking your word on the content of the agreement but, from what we are gradually discovering, there is not much cause for satisfaction."
"It should be pointed out that, in principle, the aim of the Intergovernmental Conference was to improve the functioning of the Union in order to achieve enlargement."
"I am afraid that we have before us a compromise between national interests that has been hammered out all in one go, at night, which will make it even more difficult to make Community decisions in the future."
"Not only is the unanimity rule being maintained in a few crucial areas, but we also now have three types of qualified majority."
"The level of 62% of the population has been replaced, according to some, by 71% and, according to others, by 73.49% in order to achieve a qualified majority."
"The percentage is so high that it amounts to re-establishing a veto, especially for the largest countries."
"This is a step backwards that applies to all areas of Community life, and I predict, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that our fellow citizens - and I am afraid also the Members of Parliament and the Heads of Government - are going to have to go back to school for lessons in arithmetic."
"(Applause)"
"We will have to look very carefully at the role that has been allocated to the Commission and Parliament in the Union' s decision-making process."
"If we want the Union to reflect the interests of all of its Member States and all of its peoples as a community of values, according to the Community method, the institutions that can guarantee this are the Commission and Parliament, acting within the framework of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If those institutions are weakened and the Charter remains outside of the Treaty, how are we going to bring Europe closer to its citizens?"
"At the same time, the declaration on enlargement - which is a positive one - says that the applicant countries will be able to join the Union at the end of 2002, and the Heads of Government of the countries that are in negotiations have welcomed Nice."
"Now we have to take something into account: this is like when a child invites his friends to a birthday party and it is not sure whether there is enough room in the house or whether there is enough money for the food."
"We have to be responsible in our commitments."
"How have we come to this situation?"
"It is too easy to blame the President-in-Office of the Council, especially as the majority of the political families represented here are also represented in the Council."
"And we have come to this situation because the method of the Intergovernmental Conference no longer works."
"How can the Union make constitutional decisions by staying up for three nights?"
"What was the point of eleven months of Intergovernmental Conference, two conclaves and countless meetings of the General Affairs Council?"
"(Applause)"
"I would like to point out, by the way, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that this is paid for by taxpayers."
"How can decisions that reflect the dual legitimacy of the Union be made by only one side?"
"I would like to make an appeal to you: no more Intergovernmental Conferences behind closed doors."
"(Applause)"
"In the declaration on the future of the Union - which I welcome on behalf of my Group - for the first time there is a mention of the need to renew its working methods: the need for a wider debate in which all the parties involved can take part."
"There is already such a method."
"It is the convention method: nine months, a happy delivery..."
"(Applause)"
"...while in Nice, we still do not know what the child is like."
"And I really think that we should use the convention method to determine the future of the Union."
"To conclude, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is certain that, as far as the subjects of Nice that you yourself, Mr Chirac, pointed out - the European Company Statute, the Social Agenda, mad cow disease, maritime safety - there are sufficient causes to say that the Summit was a success."
"As far as the institutional matters are concerned, however, we will have to study them and make a judgment."
"Today, we cannot take a decision."
"We want to make a positive contribution, but now - and I will now conclude, Madam President - in order to live up to our ambitions, what we have to do is ask the Swedish Presidency to initiate the process of debate, in which we need precision timing, because it is what this Union needs, positively affirming our defence policy and developing the Community method."
"This is the challenge that we now face."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office and Mr President of the Commission, colleagues, my group welcomes the fact of the Treaty at Nice."
"That is my point of departure, because without a Treaty at Nice we would be in a significant political and institutional crisis; without a Treaty at Nice we would send a clear signal to candidate states that there were indeed serious obstacles in our path."
"Therefore the outcome is to be welcomed."
"With regard to the content of the Treaty of Nice, as others have said here today, we must reflect, we must see the texts, we must form a considered judgment."
"I can say that there are parts we like and much about which we are concerned."
"The ambition which was taken to Nice was the greatest European ambition for a summit meeting now for many years."
"It was the ambition to prepare the way for a continental-scale enlargement in Europe and that is the test by which we must judge the content at Nice."
"Is it capable of delivering an effective operational continental-scale enlargement?"
"That was the ambition, and many in this House fear that it may have fallen short of what was required."
"My group has nonetheless reached one definitive conclusion which others have also referred to today."
"That is that the current intergovernmental model of deciding these things reached and passed its sell-by date with Nice."
"After nine months, more than 330 hours of preparation in formal sessions, thousands of hours of preparation surrounding those sessions, it ended up in the spectacle of the extraordinary difficulty of the negotiators being stuck at the end still having to try to resolve everything because in all that had gone before, nothing of substance had been decided."
"That is not the way to do business for Europe, nor, in fairness to the French presidency, is it the way to ask any presidency to have to conclude such a complex process."
"We believe the time for change has come."
"(Loud applause) I should also like to comment, albeit at second-hand having followed in the media the detail of what happened at Nice, about the general atmosphere surrounding the discussions."
"When we look at the progress which has been made on the reweighting of votes, clearly it is complex and difficult to explain, but the emphasis that was coming out of Nice in reports to the media from the various national delegations was how things could be blocked rather than how things could be promoted."
"The atmosphere had more to do with the negative aspects of a great European project and vision than a positive promotion of what is deep and good about the European dream, and that is a disappointing feature of Nice."
"I want to salute the work of the European Commission."
"I want to salute the European fortitude of Romano Prodi."
"I want to salute the detailed work of Commissioner Barnier."
"I want to salute the European spirit of Mr Verhofstadt, the Belgian Prime Minister which held up to the very end at four or half past four in the morning."
"But those who stood up most for Europe, I think found it rather a thankless task and that is greatly to be regretted."
"I want to say for my group that when it comes to dealing with the European Commission, when it comes to the model that has made Europe achieve what we want to see, when we look at the dual legitimacy of the European process based on a Monnet method with a strong intergovernmental input, we do not see the European Commission and their advisers as petits fonctionnaires."
"They are central to our European politicians' mission and they are essential to that task."
"(Loud applause)"
"There are tensions now."
"There is a creeping tendency towards intergovernmentalism."
"But the Schuman-Monnet method has helped us not only to create but to deliver the European dream."
"I would say to those who trample on that: do so with great caution because you trample on our dreams when you break up a method which has worked so well."
"I know some sceptics do not like it but they never will."
"The substantial majority in this House, however, believe in it and the substantial majority in this House appreciate why it has worked."
"Finally, to contemplate the next phase 2004. I am pleased to hear President Chirac remark it will not be an obstacle to enlargement."
"I believe it will be an opportunity and we must grasp the opportunity also to raise the questions of reforming the Council, of reforming the method that we bring to these important tasks and to make sure that the Charter on Fundamental Rights becomes meaningful as law and not simply as a proclamation."
"This will give us a real opportunity to address the perceived shortcomings of Nice."
"I have listened carefully to what Romano Prodi has said."
"He said we must be ambitious but temper our ambition with reality."
"It is an important message and it is understood."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Republic, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my group takes a very dim view of the Fifteen following the rather unappetising spectacle they put on for the European people, who were probably amazed to see on that occasion, and at first hand, the real common vision, sense of solidarity and mutual trust that exists between the major European leaders."
"Although, despite everything, I welcomed the conclusion of an agreement with a certain amount of relief, I did so because, as Mr Cox said, a failure at Nice would have been used by the shameless opponents of enlargement if not to sound the death knell, at least to call for the indefinite postponement of this great project."
"We would then have sent the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe a signal of incalculable political consequences."
"There is nothing less secure today than a successful enlargement but at least the way remains open for action in favour of such a prospect."
"Besides, what a cruel illustration of the crisis which is not only institutional, but which, at a deeper level, is an identity crisis for European integration in the face of the titanic issues confronting the European Union!"
"The problem facing the Fifteen lies, I believe, less in their difficulty in providing sound responses, than in their refusal to address the right questions."
"We feel that the right questions are those on the lips of the impressive human tide which converged on Nice from all over Europe on the eve of the Summit."
"This was not a handful of troublemakers from the margins of society but workers who were uniting with the most representative waves of public opinion in their respective countries."
"Some of them were supporters of the beginnings of European integration and probably voters - men and women - from most of the political families represented here."
"Beyond their differences, all their questions in one way or another concerned a fundamental issue: the purpose of this integration whose institutions we wish to reform."
"For whom is it designed?"
"What is its point?"
"Where is this Europe of the Fifteen headed today, and even more to the point, the great Europe with twenty-seven or thirty, tomorrow?"
"Is it condemned to collapse under the current system of liberal globalisation?"
"Is its purpose to speed up the process of deregulation?"
"To make competition the be all and end all of their economic policy?"
"To try to destroy everything that is the essence of our societies through the rationale of commerce, to the point that people need to rally together to achieve a few exceptions and to concentrate all the power at the top, far from everyday life and far from the people?"
"Is there any more relevant question than that of whether other choices are conceivable?"
"Choices in which most members of the public can recognise themselves?"
"Major joint projects in Europe itself and on the international stage, in which they would find reasons and pleasure in committing themselves together, projects designed to achieve a shared dominance of the markets, a common, proactive political approach in the economic, social and cultural fields, real access for social actors to the necessary information and to the decision-making and control procedures, from their company to the institutions."
"What preliminary answers to these legitimate questions did the Nice European Council give the public?"
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was supposed to be a figurehead for this summit was dispatched without ceremony."
"Neither is the European defence force, along with the military language that has accompanied its miraculously rapid creation, able to give the European adventure the boost that it needs."
"Symptomatically, it is in the few areas in which the demand for concrete measures had been clearly demonstrated in our societies that a few positive agreements have finally been reached between the Fifteen."
"I am thinking of food safety, maritime safety, the declaration on the specific nature of sport with regard to competition rules or even the European Company Statute."
"With regard to the Social Agenda, although we would be hard pushed to find the specific objectives that we hoped for, at least it offers elements that will provide support for action in the next five years."
"That may be true, but this does not make a project and unless there is a common project, institutional reform could only lead to a form of soulless and unceremonious inter-State horse-trading."
"To conclude, I share my group' s view that the Nice European Council will ultimately have been the turning point for a kind of institutional and political construction that has shown its limitations and has reached the end of its useful life."
"The absence of a coherent, comprehensible, and inspiring common project, the refusal to hold a public and transparent debate on the various options due to an apparent consensus, which is inevitably liberal and hostile to any sign of independence from the established order, the exacerbation of violent relations between partners from the same Community and the excessive concentration of power in the leadership of States over the heads of their citizens - these are all issues that are not recent but which are now undeniable in the open debate on Europe' s future."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate you on the marvellous stamina that you demonstrated at the Nice marathon."
"My congratulations must end there, however, as I am sorry that you did not apply this stamina to the subjects that were entrusted to you."
"You said that the Nice Summit was a success because it finally led to an agreement."
"I would say to you, ""big deal!"" because everyone knew from the outset that the French Presidency was set on doing everything to ensure that an agreement was reached in Nice, largely for reasons of domestic politics."
"I wish to say, at the risk of destroying your illusions, that no one here has been fooled."
"The obstacles between the Fifteen that multiplied during the Summit are symptomatic."
"Any clear-thinking person can see that they herald the very serious consequences to which the project of a Federal Europe of 27 or 28 Member States is leading us."
"The most astonishing thing is that you are cobbling together this pipe dream at a time when the opinion polls suggest that the majority of Europe' s citizens are against this."
"Speaking mainly on behalf of the French members of my group, I will say that there is a permanent contradiction between the virtues attributed to this Europe and the aberrations seen in the daily workings of the Union."
"Europe' s leaders, of which you are one, are reduced to carrying out increasingly frequent operations to manipulate the media and public opinion."
"The technique is now tried and tested: always put off for another time the burden of proof; take decisions that are void of content or which will not be implemented for a long time and finally present the whole business as a magnificent success."
"The Nice summit is to some extent the apotheosis of this sleight-of-hand strategy."
"First of all, the Fifteen signed the agreement on the sly and under the smokescreen created by the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This document is a monument of ambiguity and was presented by some people as a crucial text, which would be a prelude to a future European constitution, and by others, as a simple declaration of intent with no legal force."
"This text has been exalted as the democratic progress of a citizens' Europe but no one has bothered, of course, to find out what the European public actually wants."
"You yourself, Mr President and your Prime Minister have presented this text as the triumph of French secularism and by Chancellor Schr√∂der as the victory of German religious sentiment."
"All it took to achieve this was quite simply to have the French and German versions of the Charter not say the same thing."
"We should have thought about that!"
"The Nice Summit then adopted a European Social Agenda, but this document has no binding power."
"It simply sets a handful of objectives for the next five years, which the Member States are free to decide whether to pursue or not, depending on the policies they choose."
"Then the summit announced that an agreement had been concluded on maritime safety."
"Hallelujah!"
"Is this a decisive agreement?"
"Not at all."
"It is simply a decision inviting the Member States' Transport Ministers to agree on the measures needing to be taken."
"Let us add to this list of triumphs the announcement of the creation of a food agency that will not come into operation until 2001."
"To crown it all, the European leaders who met at Nice decided to open a new institutional project in 2004."
"This will - apologies for it being so minimal - clarify the European Treaties, the precise status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and lay down the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States."
"There is clearly something rotten about the whole business."
"From evasions to pretences and from hypocritical agreements to sermons on the future, this Federal Europe is beginning to look like a house of cards whose roofs are growing higher and higher but whose foundations are quaking, because the real lesson of the Nice Summit is the enormity of the historical misunderstanding in which our continent has been mired since the Treaty of Maastricht."
"The Member States do not have the support of the people because there is no such thing as a European people and they are therefore forced by public opinion to advocate their national interests with increasing fervour, even if this means changing the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is already out of date, and even if this means increasing the number of European Commissioners to 27, even though the current Commission of Fifteen does not work."
"Mr President, I also wish to emphasise that, after Nice, France appears once again to have been the clear loser."
"Because you are paralysed with the fear of having fewer seats than Germany in the Council of Ministers, you have definitively capitulated on everything else: on the number of French Members in this Chamber, which is reduced from 87 to 74 - oh, I agree, this would not be a big loss - whereas Germany will keep its 99 Members without losing a single one: at least for the sake of those who believe that this House serves some purpose, the number ought to have been maintained; on the so-called ""demographic slice"" principle, which gives a considerable advantage to Germany; on one of the two Commissioners in Brussels and on our right of veto in the very many areas concerning our vital interests."
"The final result is preposterous."
"No one understands the operating rules of this labyrinthine system any more."
"It upsets almost everyone, beginning with those known as the smaller countries."
"The only clear outcome is that the European nation-states are on their way - unwillingly - to becoming nothing more than provinces within an authoritarian federal state, whose strategic and military objectives appear to be those of the United States."
"This will happen unless we oppose it."
"We must bring an immediate end to this insane abdication of the sovereignty of the European Nations."
"This is why, as far as we are concerned, we will ask the President of France to consult the French people at the appropriate time by means of a referendum on this Treaty."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the masochism with which French political leaders have, once again, allowed themselves to be ensnared in the trap of a Europe obsessed with complex, intricate manoeuvres is incredible."
"Having wallowed in cohabitation, these professional politicians have lain down in resignation over a treaty that they just had to sign in Nice as if Germany' s fate depended on it."
"Portugal and Belgium have, on this occasion, had a greater influence than France, which conceded on everything and obtained nothing apart from preserving a vague cultural exception, which is a pretext for a new concept, which Mr V√©drine has invented, for the sake of the cause, of a sovereignty that would be both national and exercised jointly."
"Even Edgar Faure must be turning in his grave!"
"At a time when these so-called leaders are incapable of transposing fifty or so directives except by edict, in other words, by decree-law, they are accepting, with straight faces, to reduce French representation in the European Parliament by around 20%, despite having given these representatives the task of protecting French interests under codecision."
"As far as France is concerned, each of these Treaties is, unfortunately, worse than the one before, but they confirm the rationale of Maastricht, a fine example of Mitterrandesque finagling that is likely to end badly."
"And what about poor Mr Chirac, who believes what Gerhard says, in the same way that Jaur√®s believed in world peace!"
"Into what situation will all these people have dragged France when the European bubble bursts and the French have nothing in their mouths but the bitter taste of having been conned once again by their mediocre and self-serving leaders?"
"Madam President, Mr President, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities regrets the fact that the Presidency has not followed up the message that was sent to it in July."
"At Nice, it simply boosted the power of the technocrats."
"The crisis within the Commission has not led to any reform of its role or of the way in which it functions."
"All that has been proposed to us is an increase of its President' s powers and I doubt that even this would have prevented the dysfunction demonstrated by the Santer Commission."
"The negotiations of the last few days have proved that it was nothing but a laughable process of haggling."
"People are fighting over power of influence and postponing the distribution of competences and the clarification of the European Union' s objectives until 2004, even though making everything uniform is still clearly the order of the day."
"We are told of parity between the larger States but the division is confirmed with 27 additional seats being allocated to just one country."
"Enough hypocrisy!"
"The right of each Member State to be heard within the Council should have been recognised in Nice."
"For this to happen, one vote is enough and would enable us to avoid the countless calculations of weighting imposed by qualified majority voting."
"Taking into account these interests and differences within the Council would have avoided the debates on the number of Commissioners to which each State is clinging."
"When I hear a Commissioner calling for an end to the cultural exception and for the extension of qualified majority voting to Article 133 in international negotiations, I must state that, personally, the loss of one Commissioner would not be particularly serious."
"This House ought to represent the expression of an elected majority that backs the decisions of ministers who, I would remind you, are answerable to their respective national parliamentary representations."
"You chose to follow another path."
"We find this truly deplorable and it will benefit neither Europe itself nor any Member State."
"With regard to the Summit' s conclusions, I am stunned to see the discrepancy between the proclamations on the services of general interest and the dismantling of the postal service, which is on the agenda for this part-session."
"My fear is that the objective of full employment, which is part of the Social Agenda, may suffer the same fate."
"As far as Europe' s image is concerned, this Presidency has been a failure."
"The common interest appears to diminish the signing of a treaty that is designed to provide solutions by transferring ever more sovereignty against the wishes expressed by the public."
"Furthermore, we could adopt the formula suggested by the Economic and Social Council and say that Europe is experiencing a serious lack of public debate."
"Sometimes out of convenience or as a matter of urgency, the issue is dodged or cut short and sometimes a debate does take place but the experts and the elites are often the only players that are heard, that are listened to and who really influence decision-making."
"The danger of this is that the public will feel alienated from the decisions that actually concern them directly."
"My group is disappointed by this Treaty and is worried about the future that it holds for us and we will therefore use all our power to oppose it."
"Madam President, President Chirac, I am delighted that you have found time today, in contrast to the previous occasion, to listen to my speech."
"I take it as a welcome sign of the fact that tensions have eased since then."
"While waiting for the outcome from Nice, I was put in mind of my old mathematics professor."
"Two out of four problems unsolved elicited a pitiless ""unsatisfactory"" from him."
"Until late into Sunday, it looked like Nice too might earn such a mark."
"Then a compromise was found."
"In essence, the total compromise is less than the sum of its parts."
"Nonetheless, from an Austrian point of view, it is a result we can live with."
"I personally welcome, above all, the juridification of all stages of the sanctions procedure, especially the facility for the Court of Auditors to exercise control."
"As an Austrian I know what I am talking about."
"The rule of law has triumphed here over political arbitrariness."
"Many have complained about the lack of progress on qualified majority voting."
"I take a more relaxed view."
"The heads of state and government may have exercised restraint in certain areas, but at least they did not use their right of veto after long hours of negotiation just for the heck of it."
"On the contrary, their restraint was driven by serious problems and concerns and the result of informed national opinion, which cannot be swept to one side and must be taken seriously."
"How can we make our citizens identify more closely with Europe if we do not heed their concerns?"
"For many citizens, things are simply moving too fast."
"Many still have no sight of the port into which the European Union is supposed to sail one day."
"As far as I am concerned, deliberate, considered action makes far more sense than rushing into the fray."
"However, what is worrying in this situation, and this is something which both I and Mr Poettering have warned against, is that the instrument of reinforced cooperation may be used as a circumvention strategy in areas in which no decision can be reached by a qualified majority."
"This sort of approach would not only contradict the ultima ratio clause; it would, in my view, also represent a serious threat to the development of the Union."
"Thank you, Mr Hager."
"At this stage in the debate, I shall give the floor once again to the President-in-Office of the Council, President Chirac, who would like to respond to the speeches by the group chairmen, following which, President Chirac will leave us and Mr Moscovici will take over."
"Mr President, I give you the floor."
"I want to thank President Jacques Chirac for being here this morning, and for his speech and his replies to the group chairmen."
"(The debate was suspended at this point and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"VOTE"
"Mr President, could we please check before the vote that enough members are present in the Chamber to give us the 314 votes needed or if the other two reports should perhaps go first, because there has been some confusion as to how long this break is supposed to last."
"In all events, we must be careful not to upset the compromise which we have now reached simply because some members are unaware of the fact that we are about to vote."
"On the subject itself, I have just one brief technical comment."
"This is a complicated subject. We must back medical progress and, at the same time, ensure that subjects are protected during trials."
"The committee accepted the report unanimously."
"Nonetheless, a number of proposed amendments have been tabled, as the Commissioner rightly says."
"They are compromise amendments designed to bring about agreement with the Council."
"The Council has asked us to accept the spirit of the report but to change the wording here and there."
"Hence these proposed amendments, these so-called compromise amendments from three groups."
"I think they reflect the views not just of these three groups but of other groups which have refrained from putting their name to them for technical reasons."
"I therefore call on the House to accept these compromise amendments and to reject the new proposals which have now been tabled by other groups so as to avoid jeopardising the compromise with the Council."
"Not because I am opposed to the proposals in principle but because I want to safeguard the compromise with the Council and avoid risking a complicated and tricky conciliation procedure for the sake of an amendment."
"In order to make full use of this compromise, I should like to ask the presidency to vote on proposed Amendment No 22, which is scheduled right at the beginning of the vote, after Amendment No 43, because Amendment No 43 reflects the compromise with the Council, while Amendment No 22 reflects the committee's original position and should only be adopted if the compromise does not win a majority here in the House."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 22:"
"Mr President, I just want to avoid any confusion. As we have already accepted the compromise, I recommend that the House vote against Amendment No 22."
"That will keep us in line with the compromise with the Council."
"Apart from that, thank you all for your support."
"(The President declared the amended Common Position approved)"
"Report (A5-0356/2000) by Mrs Honeyball on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on summer-time arrangements [COM(2000) 302 - C5-0322/2000 - 2000/0140(COD)]"
"Mr President, I should like to know if the European Parliament's jurisdiction for summer time has been newly acquired since Nice."
"Mr President, I voted for the report on regulations relating to the performance of clinical trials with a view to finding new medicinal products."
"Before I left Bergamo for Strasbourg, I told Mr Giuseppe Rossi, a pensioner from Bergamo about this, and he said that he was very happy about this regulation."
"However, he urged me to draw Parliament's attention - which I am very willing to do - to the fact that, when selecting the diseases for which it is intended to find complete cures by performing clinical trials on new medicinal products, priority should be given to diseases affecting the elderly, in particular, who do not have time to wait for trials to be performed, unlike youngsters who have all the time in the world."
"Therefore, priority must be given to the diseases affecting the elderly."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group has supported Mr Liese' s report."
"It was really necessary to simplify the plethora of legal and administrative arrangements applying to clinical trials in the Member States."
"Promoting the development of medicines in the Community is desirable because that makes it possible to give patients a better chance of benefiting from high-performance treatment."
"Research also needs to be promoted into medicines for children, and the Health Ministers of the various Member States must rally behind it."
"Two-thirds of children' s medicines were in fact designed for adults."
"For lack of data, their marketing authorisation (MA) does not provide for use with children."
"So use in paediatric medicine sometimes falls under the heading of empirical individual prescriptions, and we need to promote the development at pharmaceutical laboratories of specific products prepared for children and their pathologies so that the doses and forms of the medicines are suited to their bodies."
"Dr Liese' s report means we can establish shorter time periods, harmonisation of procedures, and above all, a high level of protection, especially for children."
"As a result of the determination shown by both the Member States and Parliament, laboratories previously discouraged by the complexity of clinical trials will perhaps find the courage to develop the market for children' s medicines, even if it is not yet big enough to provide a return on the investment!"
"Furthermore, the legitimate determination to protect patients who take part in trials at Union level is inseparable from respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"So the conditions for consent must be very strict."
"In our view, trials on people incapable of giving their consent should be banned."
"Here Dr Liese' s determination to lay down stricter conditions for consent by persons incapable of giving it is interesting."
"We think consent should be governed by national legislation."
"While it is appropriate to establish a set of rules to be taken into account, the Member States must retain the power to adopt stricter legislation, as France has done in this respect."
"That would merely be an intelligent application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Honeyball report (A5-0356/2000)"
"Mr President, when Mr Enrico Perniceni of Locatello Imagno in the province of Bergamo, my home town, discovered we were going to debate this directive he said: ""Mr Fatuzzo, I know that I am a very old man but I would like my time never to come."
"If my time does have to come, I would like it to be the same time throughout the European Union!"
"I therefore ask you to vote for the motion"" - which I did - ""because it is right for Europe to have a European time to go with the European currency, the European Parliament and the European flag."
"In fact, I feel that it is right for all the States of the European Union to be on the same summer time"" ."
"I congratulate my colleague Mary Honeyball on her first report for the European Parliament."
"Summer time should be a matter for the Member States but it is right that the EU should harmonise the start and end dates."
"I welcome the agreement to continue to begin summer time on the last Sunday in March and to end it on the last Sunday in October."
"Given the planning needs of certain sectors such as transport, communications, tourism and computer and other technology I welcome the proposal to make these arrangements permanent subject to a Commission review every five years."
"Summer time has, in practice, become normal time."
"There may therefore be cause for questioning the concept of 'summer time' when it relates to seven out of twelve months, that is to say the majority of the year."
"Do we really have to carry on with the change to summer time? It was brought in at the time of the oil crises, to save energy and has been extended to 2001?"
"First we should recognise that the advantages and value of the arrangement have largely vanished: the energy saving it was supposed to produce is completely unproven and merely symbolic."
"On the contrary, in addition to atmospheric pollution problems, the profound disturbance to human beings, especially children, of this double time-change, taking place in March and then in October, is clearly established and greatly resented by the people, many of whom are calling for the cancellation of this arrangement which upsets the rhythms of life."
"The report financed by the Commission to justify its proposal merely notes the inadequacy of the consistent data available and the contradictory nature of existing studies: so it does not provide any relevant grounds for maintaining the time change system."
"Now, the Commission proposes to make the change to summer time, and then back to winter time, permanent with no limit date."
"It means to impose this on the Member States without the option of exemption, and on the candidate countries, without taking account of their specific geographic position."
"Nothing, not even time, must escape its standardising will!"
"It must be the same time in Brest as in Brest-Litovsk."
"The advantages of time zones cannot possibly outweigh the benefits of standardisation!"
"Long live the single federal time!"
"Yet the choice of time applicable in each of the Member States is always a purely national decision, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The national governments must not give up that right."
"They must continue to be concerned about representing the will of the people who have elected them."
"Instead of the one proposed by the Commission, the best solution would undoubtedly be to give up the summer time arrangement and keep GMT + 1 hour for the whole year, at least as far as France is concerned."
"From this angle, I am glad two amendments were adopted by Parliament, one rejecting the Commission' s plan to apply the summer time arrangement for an indefinite period, and the other allowing the Member States, like the European institutions, to retain the option of reviewing this arrangement."
"Mr President, I should like to give an explanation on the Honeyball report."
"I am sorry, Madam, but I have no record here of your application to give an explanation of vote."
"As you know, an application must be submitted in writing in advance."
"It is obviously an oversight but, as I am sure you will understand, I cannot make an exception, otherwise we shall get embroiled in Rules of Procedure."
"That brings us to the explanations of vote on the Cerdeira Morterero report."
"Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Fatuzzo has the floor; I wonder which pensioner has said something to him this time."
"Cerdeira Morterero report (A5-0355/2000)"
"You are going to be surprised, Mr President, for this time, before I left for Strasbourg, it was Mr Carlo Fatuzzo the tourist who said to Mr Carlo Fatuzzo the MEP - we talk to each other sometimes in the mirror - ""Seeing as you are going to debate the issue of the protection of victims, remember that last year I went to Spain on holiday and, when I got out my wallet in front of the Sagrada Familia to make a donation in order to make my humble contribution to the conclusion of the work on this structure, both wallet and all the documents inside disappeared."
"I went to the Spanish police station immediately and reported the incident before you could say 'Jack Robinson'."
"But when I got back to Italy, Mr Fatuzzo,"" continued Carlo Fatuzzo the tourist, ""in order to obtain another identity card and another driving licence, I had to report the incident again, this time to the Italian police."
"I had to report the same theft twice."
"Therefore, roll on the advent of this directive which will simplify the procedures!"""
"The status of the victims in criminal proceedings is not always properly protected."
"This matter has been taken up in several Council of Europe instruments since the early 80s, but within the European Union it was not debated in the Council until 1998."
"Since then, there have appeared first the Commission proposal, in the run-up to the 1999 Tampere European Council, which put forward a number of measures in the fields of the prevention of victimisation and victim aid and support and upheld the need to draw up minimum standards especially for victim protection and for the access of victims to justice and their right to compensation for damages, including legal costs, and secondly the Portuguese Presidency' s draft framework decision on the status of the victim in criminal proceedings."
"This latter proposal is the subject of this report, which essentially warrants our approval, particularly as regards the simplification of access to rights, courts and legal information, and the promotion and protection of victims' rights in matters of compensation for loss and damages through redress mechanisms."
"We are very much in favour of strengthening the position of victims of crime and therefore welcome in principle the draft framework decision presented by Portugal."
"Above all, we are in favour of setting up, at European level, principles for how the victims of crime are to be treated. Nonetheless, the Member States ought themselves to be responsible for working out the details."
"We believe, however, that a couple of questions need to be analysed more thoroughly and would present the following points of view."
"Freedom of association is of fundamental importance in a democratic constitutional State, which is why we oppose a demand for non-profit-making organisations to be approved by the State before they are allowed to offer support to victims of crime."
"We also believe that transparency is a prerequisite if authorities and courts are to inspire confidence in citizens, which is why we oppose general rules limiting the press' s ability to write about what has come to light in the course of a public trial."
"Only in a few clearly defined cases (relating, for example, to sexual crimes and crimes involving child pornography, where secrecy is required) may there be exemptions from holding open proceedings in court."
"Finally, we think it may be a good idea for there to be video conferencing and other such facilities if there is reason for thinking that a witness or plaintiff might, out of fear or for some other reason, not speak the truth freely in the presence of the defendant."
". I welcome this report by my colleague Carmen Cerdiera."
"The report aims to ensure that all victims of crime in any EU Member State should receive the same minimum treatment."
"Appropriate measures should be taken to provide crime victims with the following rights: to provide and receive information; communications facilities; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; a suitable level of protection and privacy; the possibility to seek compensation under criminal procedure and to dispute settlement through mediation."
"The victim must be treated as a person in a particular situation of disorientation and distress - factors that are likely to be all the more acute if the crime happens to the victim in a Member State other than his/her own."
". Although we support the content of the report and are very sympathetic to victims of crime throughout Europe, I, as a British Conservative, have reservations regarding certain aspects of the report."
"I believe we have adequate protection for such victims under Article 6 of the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights, and this report is yet another example of unnecessary proposed European interference into an area which is already covered by agreements between Member States, as well as 25 other non-EU members of the Council of Europe."
"The British Conservative Party does not support EU prescriptive measures to harmonise criminal law in the EU which must remain the competence of the Member State."
"Madam President, I wholeheartedly support this report on better protection for victims of crime which demonstrates yet again in the EU's commitment to combating crime and protecting our citizens."
"We are trying to ensure that the rights and interests of victims of crime are better respected in all EU Member States, even when the crime itself has been committed outside the victim's usual country of residence."
"Consequently, many travellers and holidaymakers will benefit from this European initiative."
"This measure will help allow victims of crime to be able to claim full, immediate and effective compensation for any damage suffered, if possible to be paid by the perpetrator of the crime."
"Combating crime is crucial for my constituents in the North West."
"The Labour Government is cracking down on crime and disorder."
"With Labour, crime is already down 10% since 1997."
"Domestic burglary is down by 21% and vehicle crime by 15% - their lowest levels for a decade."
"The six-year decline in police numbers has been halted - 9000 extra recruits will take police numbers to their highest level ever."
"The Queen's Speech spells out that our next step is to cut violent crime and disorder by working together."
"The Tories, on the other hand, offer nothing but rising crime and falling investment."
"The Tories, on the other hand, offer nothing but rising crime and falling investment."
"Their record on law and order speaks for itself: during their time in office, the chance of being a victim of burglary increased from one in 32 to one in 13; the chance of being a victim of violent crime trebled."
"Madam President, the Labour Government is determined to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime."
"By introducing greater protection for victims of crime across Europe, our citizens will gain confidence in the judicial system and the police, not just across Britain, but right across the European Union."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"European Council/ French Presidency (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on:"
"the report by the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the European Council Meeting of 7 to 10 December 2000 in Nice;"
"the statement by the officiating President of the Council on the French Presidency."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"This has great relevance to the matter we are discussing since it touches on the freedom of the press and the independent ownership of the media in Russia."
"A few hours ago the owner of most of Russia's independent television, Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, was arrested in Spain."
"I am told he is due to be deported to Russia."
"I should like to protest at this most serious development and ask that investigations be made."
"Mr Gusinsky is presently in an aircraft on his way to Madrid where he faces deportation to Russia for criticising the Russian Government in his media activities."
"Lord Bethell, I think we would agree with you."
"We will look into the matter."
"We will make a note of it now and naturally we feel like you that the freedom of the press must continue to be observed in that part of the world."
"Mr President, it is my turn to salute the President of the Commission, who is here, and the Presidency of the Council, which is coming, and to underline that there has probably never been such unanimity expressed in this Parliament on the results of a summit."
"This morning we heard every group speak of failure."
"If we look for the causes of that failure, the main reason seems to be that in Nice we saw the European project suffer a little more damage and the European dream recede a little further."
"What is that dream about?"
"It is not about a trading area. It is not even about a cooperation area."
"The European dream is about a continent with common values building itself into a political power."
"Put another way, it is about neighbours who regard each other as members of the same family, and decide to build a ship together to weather the storms."
"But that would mean recognising that the common project is more important than selfish interests."
"Now, in Nice - and this is the criticism we all have - the project was not being considered, only the interests were being considered."
"It is as if the ship were already built and we were at the stage of sharing out the cabins, the officers' uniforms and the cargo."
"That explains why many of us found Nice heartbreaking."
"It was heartbreaking to see the debates concentrating on who would get one vote more or one vote less, and who would gain - Germany or France, the Netherlands or Belgium, Portugal or Spain."
"The only question that was never asked was whether or not Europe would gain."
"The results were heartbreaking."
"In future it will be necessary to assemble three different majorities for a decision to be taken - 75% of the votes, 50% of the Member States, and 62% of the populations."
"That is inexplicably Byzantine for the citizens."
"Heartbreaking results for the Commission which was regarded, not as the guardian of the general interest, but as yet another intergovernmental body, wrenched away from the collegiate rule and symbolically excluded from the 'confessionals' ."
"Heartbreaking results for Parliament: the refusal to see majority decisions seriously extended; the exclusion of Parliament from codecision and - I say this in passing - the shocking fact that the composition was fixed without Parliament even being consulted on that composition."
"Finally and above all, heartbreaking results for the citizens, who find themselves excluded once and for all from these carpet salesmen' s debates about a Europe where they are condemned never to understand anything."
"The European dream must be relaunched and the European project rebuilt."
"That will be the whole purpose of the third stage, the new stage we are entering."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, one image strikes us as we leave Nice behind."
"There are basically two Europes: one that works and one that asks itself questions."
"The one that works is the one that has after all, it seems to me, spent the six months getting the work done in six essential areas, under the leadership of the French Presidency."
"Let us just note for the record the Social Agenda and the European company; strengthening Euroland and the tax package; the conference on commitment capability and the progress of Defence Europe; safety, whether in food or at sea; young people' s mobility and the recognition of the specific features of sport or the Media plus programme; and the important statement on services of general interest."
"Yes, practical Europe continues to make progress, but what struck our fellow citizens at Nice was that the Europe asking itself where it is going and what it wants sometimes looks all at sea."
"There is one piece of good news, certainly. Europe is now ready, thirteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, to welcome the Central and Eastern European countries knocking at our door."
"But as we said in this Parliament, a narrow agenda means the issues on the table have to be dealt with."
"It does not offer a way out."
"At Maastricht, we had the euro to dream about."
"At Amsterdam, we had the area of freedom, security and justice, and the employment chapter."
"But at Nice, there was nothing but the crude sharing out of power and then we saw national egoism on parade."
"There will be no Nice leftovers, but was there a European spirit at Nice?"
"We are not sure there was."
"We all know there is a collective responsibility for this sad balance sheet, be it that of the 'small countries' or the 'big countries' , be it that of the founding countries or those joining later."
"Nice will make enlargement possible, but without a plan, without a soul, without ambition, without vision."
"We can say what we like about the state of mind of our fellow citizens, but the responsibility is ours and they expect us to deliver this European project, this European dream."
"I have a few comments to make, and the first is on the Charter."
"The Heads of State and Government sometimes give the impression that they almost took themselves by surprise at the Cologne European Council when they initiated a process whose results, in the end, would frighten them."
"How can we accept the fact that this Charter, which carries our dreams, hopes and ambitions, should in the end be proclaimed on the sly and that, at the end of the day, the only thing proposed for 2004 is an examination of the status of the Charter?"
"There is no longer even any mention of its possible incorporation and, in the final analysis, the only institution to emerge from this exercise strengthened is the Court of Justice, which will be able to incorporate this Charter into Community legislation, even before the Heads of State and Government."
"Then there is the issue of chief concern to this Parliament, qualified majority voting."
"How could we not express our disappointment?"
"The scope of qualified majority is narrower than expected."
"On the essential issues of tax and social affairs, there is no progress."
"Things are more difficult because instead of just one criterion, there are three criteria to be fulfilled."
"Things are more complicated because there are these appeal clauses in the new Treaty, making the process even more incomprehensible to our fellow citizens."
"From Parliament' s viewpoint, alongside qualified majority there is still the issue of codecision."
"For us, that is essential."
"It is sometimes caricatured as not being democratic, as taking too long, but democracy takes time, and time is necessary for debates."
"We call for that debate to be launched."
"Sometimes, it has seemed as if, at the end of the day, in the conference, at Nice, the European Parliament was serving as an adjustment variable."
"But yes, Mr Bayrou, let us admit that we also bear the responsibility for that."
"We were not capable of expressing how we wanted Parliament organised."
"On method, I think the Nice perspectives, from that point of view, are very interesting."
"The Heads of State and Government have just recognised at Nice what we were saying after Amsterdam: the Intergovernmental Conference method is no longer successful for Europe."
"So we welcome the prospect of a new method and we trust that, with the hope offered by the possibility of enhanced cooperation, Europe will continue to advance and will be capable of drafting a constitution for tomorrow which restores our fellow citizens' confidence in this tremendous project that is the European adventure."
"Mr President, despite what the President of the Republic says about the problems faced, in view of the spectacle at Nice, one must question whether the Union is really and truly prepared for enlargement."
"The candidates cannot have been pleased at the sight of the scramble for national power and status among the prime ministers."
"Sadly the common cause of Europe was a marginal factor."
"For the decisions on Council voting and seats in Parliament a more suitable venue would have been the casino at Cannes rather than the Acropolis at Nice, with Mr Chirac playing the role of chief croupier."
"Particularly regrettable was the failure to make reference to the Charter - a failure that will bring legal uncertainty and political frustration."
"However, my greatest fear is that Britain, France and Germany will now be able to subvert the delicate balance developed between states of various sizes and between the institutions over several decades."
"We will resist this forcefully."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as far as we are concerned, the outcome of the Nice Summit has not prepared the EU sufficiently for enlargement."
"In the twelve candidate countries, people prefer to talk in terms of the unification of Europe."
"That is quite revealing."
"We, i.e. many European citizens, grew up after the Second World War hoping that a united Europe would be able to play a part in the world some day for the sake of the freedom and welfare of humanity, of its own citizens and peoples."
"Yet this seems to be an even more distant dream than we had hoped now that Nice is over."
"After all, Nice was primarily an attempt on the part of the Member States to reach a settlement behind closed doors on the Amsterdam leftovers, with the safeguarding of national interests uppermost in their minds."
"But what they did not do was endeavour to equip the EU to pursue enlargement."
"Quite a number of speakers have made the same point this morning and I wholeheartedly agree with them."
"As representative of the parties united in the European Free Alliance, I would like to alert the Commission, but particularly the Council, to the dangers, should the EU wish to be no more than an intergovernmental association."
"The States preparing for accession will copy the example of our own Member States' egoism."
"The regions and peoples that do not have their own state will also weigh the situation up."
"They will work out what they stand to gain in Scotland, Catalonia and Flanders if, instead of playing the federal game, they opt to become a Member State themselves, with a guaranteed Commissioner, guaranteed clout in the Council, and a larger number of seats in the European Parliament than they can hope for at present."
"Must we give up the dream of a united Europe?"
"I think not."
"We are obliged to put our hopes in the post Nice process."
"We want this to be a real process in which the balance between the institutions of the Union and those of the Member States and the constitutive regions must be defined with respect for the subsidiarity principle."
"Mr President, there is a quotation from George Orwell' s book, Animal Farm which, in a way, describes what happened in Nice."
"It reads, 'Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others.'"
"Translated into what happened in Nice, this could read, 'All EU countries are equal, but it is the large countries which decide' ."
"What happened in Nice was not only that the European Union' s large Member States set the agenda, but that they also brought about Treaty changes which guarantee them the same power in an enlarged EU."
"On the basis of the Treaty of Nice, an enlarged EU will become a Union which is more centralised and in which the small countries pay the whole price of enlargement."
"For the Swedish negotiators, it would appear to have been more important to please the large Member States than to fight for our own influence."
"Sweden is therefore to be given fewer votes than comparable Member States."
"It is hard to see what there is in the Nice decisions which really makes enlargement of the EU any the easier."
"The decision-making process in the Council is to become more complicated, at the same time as it is to become more difficult to take decisions."
"Nice means more supranationalism and centralism, which are precisely what the EU did not need."
"The EU' s real problems are the lack of democracy and grassroots support, but those questions were not dealt with at all at the Nice Summit."
"I can also inform this Assembly that the results of a Swedish opinion poll were published today, showing that only 38 per cent of the population want to remain in the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we should honour the French Presidency, we should honour President Chirac."
"He was at the coalface, he fought and conquered for his vision of Europe - because he did have a vision."
"Congratulations too, to President Aznar, who won the 'Bingo' at the Nice Council."
"Congratulations to the British, who do not have to thump the table any more because they have found out how to stay close to the leader as we were taught to do by the great Dutch cycling champion, Zoetemelk: they cashed in too."
"It is our Parliament and our Commission, Mr Prodi, that lacks vision."
"It was our Parliament and our Commission that failed to realise there was a plan to assassinate the Commission: the assassination of the Commission will take place in a few years' time."
"A Commission with a commissioner for each Member State sanctions the transfer of all the Commission' s important issues to the Council."
"That means the death of the Commission, and our Parliament would rather gnaw on the bones thrown to it at the Cologne Council than confront this fundamental problem: without a supranational Commission, the Europe we want will not come into being."
"There will be a Europe of nations, there will be no federal Europe."
"This is our last chance."
"If we want to get back on the federal track, there is only one solution, Mr Prodi."
"It is the election of the Commission President by universal suffrage and powerful legitimacy for the Commission, and unless there is a real alliance on specific aims like those, between the Commission, Parliament and Member States like Belgium - which fought hard during this Council, represented by Mr Verhofstadt - then there will no longer be a federal Europe, there will be the Europe of nations which we have never wanted."
"Mr President, the fairly unanimous message from the President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission and heads of government is basically that the Treaty of Nice secures the framework for the unification of Europe."
"Some are happier than others about this, but the main message is clear: Europe can now be unified in an enlarged democratic EU which is also close to the people, thanks to the Treaty of Nice."
"These messages contain such huge and monstrous distortions of the truth that we have to go back to history' s most famous propagandists in order to find exact comparisons."
"For the fact is that what has been decided in Nice is enhanced cooperation, superpower domination, a Charter of Fundamental Rights, military development and the monitoring of democracy."
"What has been decided is unnecessary to enlargement, and what is necessary to enlargement has not been decided."
"The Treaty of Nice contains a series of quite decisive steps towards an EU of √©lites, together with corresponding steps away from a Europe of democracies and of the people."
"Centralised power and superpower dominance are increasing drastically, as if we had not already had enough of these."
"Is this a unification and democratisation of Europe?"
"No, it is an extension to the power of the √©lites and, in reality, the unfortunate agenda for Eastern Europe is, of course, subjection."
"It is we who decide about the applicant States."
"The EU does not negotiate with them."
"They are not involved in deciding what the Treaty of Nice will contain, and the EU dictates all the conditions of participation. Moreover, none - and I repeat, none - of the crucial problems associated with the enlargement project and involving the integration of incompatible social and economic systems are recognised as problems."
"The EU and the EU' s policy are not the solution, but the problem."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have little to say today."
"Just under a year ago, you sent Mr Tsatsos and me to attend preparations for this Intergovernmental Conference."
"Today I can tell you that our mission was a failure."
"Our remit was to help make the European Union more democratic and more capable of action so that it would be ready to cope with the enlargement which we so long for."
"It is not more capable of action - on the contrary."
"The decision-making mechanism in the Council of Ministers has become far more complicated and the hurdles have been raised."
"It will now be much easier to form a blocking minority in the Council of Ministers."
"In the decisive areas in which we require qualified majority voting if the European Union is to be capable of action with 27 Member States, we failed dismally."
"On several counts we even lost ground."
"We have to admit that we have not complied with the principle of Amsterdam from the democratic viewpoint."
"Where qualified majority voting is enshrined in legislation, we have qualified majority voting."
"There are four fundamental areas, including structural policy, Article 133 and two other instances in which the European Parliament has been excluded from policy-making."
"In other words, the democratic deficit is now even greater."
"Plus, the number of seats in the European Parliament has been laid down against our own wishes and without consulting us."
"I find this situation intolerable."
"Individual interests have prevailed."
"The winners are those who asserted their national interests."
"And they have all gone home to celebrate."
"No-one claims to have done anything for Europe; on the contrary, everyone is saying: I blocked something to protect my own national interests from the veto."
"This method has seen its heyday, this system of a Europe of chancelleries is on its last legs."
"We need a transparent, democratic, citizens' Europe if we are to have any chance of developing."
"Our method must be a method which allows us to set up an Intergovernmental Conference through a convention at which parliamentarians, not chancelleries have their say if we are to take this continent forward."
"For the rest, when it comes to law-making, the future Council of Ministers must be an open, parliamentary organisation in which transparency and scrutiny have their place, because we cannot carry on as we are."
"The only consequence which I can draw from all this is that, when it comes to voting on the Treaty of Nice, my vote will be a no vote."
"Mr President, in the coming weeks we shall have to carry out a rigorous, in-depth analysis of the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference and the fundamental questions which it has thrown up."
"I will not go back to the comments of the different speakers regarding the method nor the other subjects such as those covered by Mr Brok just now."
"Of the fundamental questions, the first is that the Nice conclusions do not guarantee on an institutional level the necessary continuity and the necessary development of the process of integration into the larger Union which is about to come into being."
"Therefore, even though we may not call them leftovers, the issues which were not adequately resolved in Nice will inevitably arise again."
"I refer to the changeover in qualitatively essential areas to qualified majority voting and to the very procedures for taking majority decisions."
"Time will show us which issues we need to return to, whether we like it or not."
"The second fundamental issue is political rather than institutional."
"The atmosphere of the Nice Council, the lack of openness, as President Prodi said, the blinkered vision characterising the attitudes of the different governments - the narrow-minded defence of national interests or policies - explain, it is sad to say, the root of the problem: a serious loss of the sense of shared European interest, of a common European vision."
"Well, the appropriate responses to both the institutional and political fundamental questions, which are our most negative legacy from the Nice Council, must be sought in dialogue, in the evaluation and development process which must be pursued under the title ""the future of the Union""."
"We must reflect seriously on what has happened."
"We managed to avoid an open crisis which would have threatened enlargement by coming to a last minute agreement on the Treaty, but we are left with a latent crisis which will have to be dealt with."
"Building a unified Europe requires far-sighted vision and coherence."
"In response to President Chirac, we are not calling for haste; we are asking not to have to take one step forwards and then one backwards, not to call for promotion of the drafting and proclamation of the Charter when we do not then dare to include it in the Treaty, not to call for the new wording of the Convention to be produced when we then do not even dare to suggest it as a potential post-Nice procedure."
"We want the objective of constitutionalisation to be called by its name; we are asking for a response, with a clear, coherent vision of the future of Europe, to the disappointments and fears which are spreading amongst the citizens over the current or future nature of the Union."
"Mr Prodi, Commissioner Barnier, this is our task."
"We have every confidence that Parliament and the Commission will proceed together in this direction, as they have done throughout this difficult year 2000."
"Mr President, the most important result from Nice was that, in spite of everything, there was a treaty, so that a place can now be prepared for the applicant States."
"Otherwise, the Summit was neither especially historic nor successful."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to discuss five points in the brief minute I have:"
"1."
"It is not acceptable for the large Member States to employ blackmail tactics against the small countries."
"This is contrary to the whole idea of the EU."
"2."
"It is tragic that no further progress was made on the issue of qualified majority voting."
"Now, the EU is to become sluggish and powerless to act, and decision-making is to become more complicated."
"3."
"Closed and exclusive, the Intergovernmental Conference is an old-fashioned and undemocratic method."
"The people must be involved in future."
"4."
"The forthcoming constitutional debate must lead to simplification, distribution of powers and increased democracy."
"The EU must acquire a common constitution."
"5."
"A new Intergovernmental Conference must not be used as an alibi for postponing enlargement."
"Our new colleagues must be allowed to participate in the discussions as new Members on equal conditions."
"Mr President, President Chirac has played down the negative reactions of many of the Members to the outcome of Nice, describing them as unrealistic and not pragmatic."
"In reality, it is the President who is being unrealistic if he thinks that it will be possible to enlarge the Union with such a Treaty."
"In my opinion, it is not more realistic to fight for one's own national prestige than to fight for the efficient functioning of the Union, and I would not say that huge numbers of European citizens came out to follow the naval battle fought by their leaders at Nice."
"My feeling is that the French Presidency's most serious error was to run the debate along the lines of a battle of powers between States - a mean, shameless fight over details - rather than as a relevant debate on the Union's policies."
"Terrified of jeopardising France's equal voting rights with Germany, the Presidency docilely allowed its proposals to extend qualified majority voting to 40 or so subjects to be knocked down to less than half this number."
"Yet even the pro-Europe- States did little to fight for its cause and, in the end, bowed before a disappointing compromise."
"As for the European Parliament, only the Commission defended its legitimacy and I therefore thank President Prodi and Commissioner Barnier for this, but they were alone in their endeavours and this was reflected in the final compromise."
"We truly hope this will be the last Intergovernmental Conference, considering that the Summit revealed a breakdown in Community solidarity."
"The real winners in this Conference were Blair and Aznar, the Euro-sceptics."
"It is their Europe, the Europe of the market and the right to veto which has won the battle. Our Europe, the Europe of democracy and a sustainable future, lost."
"There is one small ray of light although even that was mortgaged to the hilt by the French Presidency, and that is what is known as the post-Nice process. However, there are ambiguities which require urgent clarification."
"First of all, 2004 is too far away: we need to act sooner than that."
"We want a democratic process with the objective of a European Constitution to be defined by June and launched at the end of the year: the Charter took 8 months to draw up so a Constitution can be produced in less than 4 years."
"This is our next battle."
"I hope that, this time, the governments will fight with us rather than on the opposing side."
"Mr President, we had said that a failure would be preferable to a disappointing conclusion."
"In practice, we did not fail completely, but neither did we reach a conclusion."
"What came out of the Summit were contradictions and deferrals."
"The Charter of Fundamental 0Rights was proclaimed but has not been included in the Treaties and it will therefore not become legally binding immediately."
"The need for a European Constitution is greater than ever."
"The principle of European military defence was accepted but, for now, its function has not been clearly defined. That can only be guaranteed by making it autonomous from the United States and moving on from NATO, which is now completely outdated."
"The need for a social agenda covering employment, health, education, the environment and rights was mentioned, but nothing concrete was specified, not even the barriers to be overcome or how to overcome them to guarantee justice and freedom."
"Finally, enlargement to the east and to the south was planned and promised."
"That is all well and good, but the institutional rules to make it operative have not been decided upon with certainty."
"Individual interests and privileges prevail."
"We are even further from achieving the Europe we want after Nice than we were before."
"The Council must start to take notice of the European Parliament, leaders must start to take notice of the national parliaments and the national parliaments must start to take notice of the views of their citizens."
"Mr President, Nice was, and should have been, a historic date, the kick-off for the new Europe, the Europe of the new century, the great Europe, the Europe of all the Europeans."
"And what a fine project, eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall!"
"But for that, we would have needed vision, ambition, endurance, generosity of spirit, audacity. Alas, alas, alas!"
"We have long known that the great Europe could not be introduced through the institutions of the little Europe."
"We know we should think about Europe differently and we know we need new institutions."
"But, without a vision of the future, without knowing how to ask the right questions, we ended up with dithering, horse-trading and, finally, tinkering in Nice."
"Before the Nice Summit the French Presidency was saying 'better no agreement than a bad agreement' , and this morning, unless I misunderstood, we were in essence told 'better a bad agreement than no agreement at all' ."
"Certainly, the Nice agreement opens the way to membership for the candidate countries, but we are advancing down that road in the fog, foot on the brake, certain the European vehicle will not reach its destination in good shape."
"So let us forget about Nice now, and think about post-Nice -and you will forgive me if I pin my hopes on the plan for a grand convention advanced by Belgium for its Presidency, because the evidence is there, we must do something new, we must change the method, we must accelerate history: 2004 is too late, it is too far off, it is too dangerous."
"Yes, a grand convention including the European institutions, the governments, the parliaments of the Member States and the candidate countries which absolutely must be associated with this common house."
"That is my hope."
"Mr President, the results of Nice are disappointing, unsatisfactory and petty."
"The Union's ability to act on decisive matters has not been improved."
"The outcome of the compromises brokered in Nice is not more transparency, it is more cover-up."
"The democratic credibility of European policy has not been enhanced; on the contrary, the door has been opened to the insidious intergovernmentalisation of European policy and, by extension, to even greater bureaucratisation."
"We shall, of course, have the post-Nice process - that, at least, is a faint light at the end of the tunnel and we must not underestimate it."
"Enlargement has given you, has given us all the same task as Monnet and Schuman had fifty years ago: the task of developing a method, structure and vision for the future of Europe."
"At that time, this applied to half of Europe; now we must develop it for all of Europe."
"Enlargement would be a chance to do so, a chance, Mr President-in-Office, which you missed in Nice."
"That is my main criticism of you."
"It may well be that Nice prepares the EU for enlargement numerically."
"But the historic failing of Nice is that your resolutions are not based on any identifiable vision for a Union of 27 Member States."
"It is this spirit, the spirit of Monnet, Schuman and others, which was missing in Nice and which was sorely needed."
"Instead, the spirit of Nice clearly amounted to wondering how to block, how to intergovernmentalise, how to be feted at home as the defender of national interests, rather than how to take the European Union forward."
"If Monnet, Schuman, Adenauer, de Gasperi et al had acted thus, we would never have had European Communities and, as a result, we would still not have European Union."
"President Chirac referred to Heads of Government who point out that public opinion still does not understand or accept more or a different sort of progress."
"That may well be."
"But that is because, that is mainly because none of the heads of government has the courage to lead and educate public opinion pro-actively, rather than running along behind it."
"What is heart-breaking about Europe is that so few of its many leaders are prepared to risk their political career by standing or falling by the unification of Europe."
"Mr President, I am one of those who had for some time been placing their hopes in the miracle of Nice: an Intergovernmental Conference, a Summit, a Treaty which would both reorganise the European institutions and further the process of enlargement."
"But the miracle did not happen!"
"The clearest gauges of its limited success are the announcement of another Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 and the quality and import of the subjects at the centre of the post-Nice debate, which range from the distribution of competences within the Union to the value of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The miracle failed to materialise in the substance of the decisions on institutional reform."
"This failure was due essentially to the defensive tactics of the governments and their powers of veto, not to mention the limited involvement of the European Parliament."
"This is a sign of short-sightedness in that, today, Parliament is the only Union body which legitimises the will of the people."
"The miracle did not come to pass in terms of the organisation of the shared legacy of the Charter of Fundamental Rights either."
"Parliament and the Commission have declared that they would abide by it."
"What is preventing the Council from deciding to do the same?"
"There is just one small satisfaction: enlargement."
"Thanks to Nice, the institutional barrier can no longer be invoked."
"The winners at Nice, the only winners, were the candidate countries, whose path towards the gates of the European Union is being cleared."
"Only those who have always believed in the strategic value of enlargement have a genuine right to rejoice with them."
"Mr President, the main aspects of European integration remained unresolved in Nice and will remain so for many years."
"However, the national governments' claim to be the constitutional legislator of Europe has finally been laid to rest, as has the hope that the heads of state and government think of themselves as the trustees of the idea of European unification."
"No, what they have done is to turn Europe into a bazaar at which nationalistic, national interests are bartered."
"Amsterdam and Nice have given us a Europe of imperial rulers, a Europe of national administrations, not a Europe of political unification."
"What were they supposed to be doing?"
"According to Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union, they were supposed to be creating an ever closer political union."
"But no, the heads of state and government blocked the idea of European unification."
"Back home from Nice, they are priding themselves not on what they have given Europe, but on what they have withheld from Europe."
"They are holding the flags of national veto, hindrance and delay high."
"This is not the Europe which we have been talking about for decades."
"It is a Europe of administrations."
"Now it is the turn of the parliaments, now the time has come to show that the purpose of parliaments is to tame the power of governments and ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, it was the task of the Nice Summit to develop a Union capable of absorbing twelve new Member States."
"A European Union which can function efficiently, transparently and democratically."
"After all, the countries from Central and Eastern Europe want a robust Union, a Union capable of taking decisions."
"It is to be welcomed that the timetable adopted in Nice, with regard to the accession of the first countries from Central and Eastern Europe, is in line with Parliament' s timetable."
"But what is striking is that the Council spent four days in seclusion in Nice giving more attention to its own concerns."
"There was no answer to the question as to how the institutions of the European Union could function more effectively in an enlarged Union."
"The Council really looked after number one; to be sure, it improved things for the Commission to a certain extent and put a little sweetener Parliament' s way, as befits a father."
"But it all compares most unfavourably with the attention the Council gave itself."
"Four main problems loom large."
"Firstly, institutional imbalance: a great deal for the Council and not much for the Commission and Parliament."
"Secondly, national interests have triumphed."
"Only the Belgian Head of Government, Mr Verhofstadt, was a notable exception."
"Thirdly, a democratic deficit."
"Old deficits have not been made good and now new ones have come along."
"Fourthly, and finally, the decision-making mechanisms cannot be explained back home."
"It all gets very complicated."
"When Mr Prodi says there are no more leftovers from Nice, I would make so bold as to doubt his word."
"We must introduce qualified majority decision-making for the essential topics, or else the situation will become untenable."
"Nice will go down in history as the Summit of lost opportunity, the Summit of lack of leadership in Europe, the Summit of opposition and the Summit in whose wake the people felt even more isolated from the European Union."
"Mr President, the purpose of the Intergovernmental Conference was to prepare the European Union so that it would be able to operate after enlargement."
"I think the European Parliament is right to base its evaluation on two criteria, namely efficiency and democratisation."
"As the European Parliament's representatives, Mr Brok and I fought for both, but without the required results."
"We do, of course, admit that some progress was made on both counts."
"As far as efficiency is concerned, qualified majority voting was introduced in several instances, Parliament was granted the right to litigate in matters of a constitutional nature and the system of reinforced cooperation was made more practicable."
"Similarly, a number of positive moves were made as regards the European Commission."
"As far as democratisation is concerned, the points worth noting are that codecision has been extended on several counts and the European legislator has been authorised to define the status of European political parties and crucial preventive measures to defend democracy and freedom in the Member States."
"Unfortunately, however, for the European Parliament, the shortcomings in the Treaty have been exacerbated."
"Unanimity has been abolished for a whole series of legislative issues, but without giving Parliament codecision powers."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has not received so much as a mention in the Treaty."
"The European Parliament has too little say in the reinforced cooperation procedure."
"Fundamental areas still require unanimity."
"The decision-making system in the Council may well incorporate the principle of a double majority, but it has become somewhat complicated and has upset the balance between large and small Member States."
"Finally, the European Parliament will face a huge dilemma when it comes to make its final appraisal of the Treaty at the beginning of next year due to the clause on post-Nice developments."
"This clause adopts the European Parliament's opinion that further development of the European Union will be impossible using the intergovernmental method applied in the past."
"This method has had it."
"The clause on post-Nice developments, for all its exaggerated and wholly inaccurate eulogy of the Treaty, does give some light at the end of the tunnel, to quote my friend Mr H√§nsch."
"Given the procedure described, new proposals for the Europe of tomorrow need to be drafted by political and social bodies - mainly the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"Without this clause on post-Nice developments, the European Parliament would, I think, have been unable to accept the Treaty."
"With this clause, it is simply a poor treaty."
"However, careful thought and consideration are needed before the European Parliament decides to reject it."
"Mr President, first I would like to join in with the praises you have heaped upon Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos."
"I think all of us, from our own positions, worked as well as possible with Commissioner Barnier to contribute to this Treaty of Nice."
"It is true - I shall paraphrase Mr Bayrou - that I have been sitting here since this morning; first next to the President of the Republic, then by myself, and the criticism has struck me as moderate and friendly, but criticism all the same."
"Failure, disarray, skimped treaty, I do not want to summarise everything that has been said."
"Anyway, I notice that they reflect a contradiction we all live with."
"Europe is our common heritage, but all of us here belong to different nations and different parties, and the criticism of the Treaty of Nice - criticism of the European Union in general - is unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, utterly contradictory."
"Some people want more of this, some people want more of that: some people want more Europe, some people want more social Europe, some people want more liberal Europe, some people want less Europe full stop, and we have had some very fine samples of all that this morning."
"Some people want more federalism, some people want less and that is where we have to understand that no one can be completely satisfied."
"I think that deep down it is in the nature of a European compromise not to be satisfying."
"I am not saying the Treaty of Nice is exactly what we wanted but, to summarise what I think, it is the best possible treaty given the state of our institutions, the state of our vision of Europe and indeed the state of our ideas, and the state of Europe itself."
"Like the President of the Republic this morning, I too try to imagine what would happen if we had arrived here without a Treaty of Nice."
"The consequences of that for Europe would have been totally incalculable."
"I think it would have complicated enlargement and I do see satisfaction amongst the candidate countries."
"I think confidence in Europe would have been shaken in economic terms, and operationally we would have lost several years of ground."
"The French Presidency takes some satisfaction in having carried out its task, which consisted quite simply of achieving closure three and a half years after Amsterdam and five years after we began to think about institutional reform."
"I would just like to take up some of the criticisms, or lessons, I have heard here and there."
"First on the reweighting grid which has shocked Fran√ßois Bayrou, for instance, and bothered Pervenche Ber√®s."
"We should not forget that this is actually the first time since 1957 that the grid has been genuinely reformed and revised."
"We failed in Amsterdam, despite excellent work by the Dutch Presidency."
"Here we succeeded, although it is an extremely sensitive and complex issue."
"No, we were not playing roulette."
"I do not think the President of the Republic has a croupier' s temperament."
"We could not make everyone happy, so we tried not to make everyone unhappy."
"It was a bit like squaring the circle."
"We had a system which was actually simple, but from our point of view - which was not necessarily the Commission' s, and it will perhaps set that out for you - it produced excessive distortions, that is, the principle of the double majority."
"We have tried to work on a principle of simple reweighting in this squaring of the circle, and I think that on the whole the result is balanced."
"I would say to Mrs Sj√∂stedt that I sincerely believe the agreement has not been made on the backs of the 'small countries' ."
"There is real redistribution in their favour, plus guarantees."
"For example, in the early days of the European Union, as you know, two so-called 'big' countries could achieve a blocking minority, and today it takes three."
"In a Europe with 27 countries, at least one additional Member State will be needed, so no longer three, but four countries will have to join forces for a blocking minority."
"Anyway, before Nice we had the opposite situation where the 'big countries' were under-represented and redistribution was needed for them."
"In addition during the debate we added two so-called 'safety nets' ."
"A safety net of Member States: any qualified majority must include a majority of the Member States."
"There was a strong demand for that from those calling themselves 'small countries' ."
"Then, the 21 least populated countries, representing 30% of the population, will have 50.7% of the votes in the Council."
"There is also a demographic safety net."
"I honestly believe we have a balanced system - though I will not claim that it is simple and straightforward."
"Lots of speakers have mentioned the post-Nice process."
"Apparently that is an essential subject for Members of the European Parliament, which is not surprising."
"We often talked about it here, in October and November."
"The Presidency has never denied the importance of reflection - as you know - but do recognise that we had to concentrate on the difficult issues, and before we could have post-Nice, we had to have Nice."
"But I do not think we have ever smothered post-Nice, we have been keen to think about it."
"Other methods will be needed."
"Several people have mentioned it here and besides, you will have noticed that the conclusions on the post-Nice process include wide consultation of all sorts of players in society, including Parliament, and concluding with what we hope will be a short IGC."
"But, at the same time - and I say this amicably to Elmar Brok - I do not think the Council can meet under the control of the European Parliament."
"Yes, it can be involved, but I am not sure that more control or presence would facilitate matters."
"We operate under constitutional systems and the powers must not get confused."
"It is difficult."
"I belong to a country that invented separation of powers and I think what we sometimes suffer from is insufficient separation of them."
"But it is a good system which has stood the test of time."
"We need to think in depth about the future - and again I note the same contradictions in passing: those who want a post-Nice review are not necessarily in agreement about its objective."
"Take, for example, the debate on the constitution, where some want a federal constitution and others want a constitution based on subsidiarity."
"Before agreement is reached, the European Union must continue to operate."
"It is a thankless task."
"It is a painful, difficult task, but it needs to be done."
"This reform has been in construction for five years."
"The French Presidency has carried it out without self-satisfaction, but with satisfaction in the work done."
"Later we will see, together, all together, how to proceed."
"The milestones are in place, enlargement is possible, the European Parliament will have its place in the debate and in going deeper into the routes and ideas."
"I also want to say to Giorgio Napolitano - who has done a lot of work on this issue - that in the end the atmosphere at Nice, the spirit of the Heads of State and Government, and the spirit of the Commission was not defensive of national interests, but seeking a common direction within those national interests."
"One can understand that Heads of State and Government are preoccupied with the sensitivities of their own public opinions and Parliaments."
"But I say this sincerely to the European Parliament - we cannot build Europe on the backs of the citizens or behind their backs."
"This will be one of my last speeches to you and I would like, in conclusion, to say first what a pleasure it has been to speak here on so many occasions, with the Commission - the President of the Commission - but also to reflect on the role of the European Parliament itself."
"This will be the only time and I hope you will not mind."
"When you criticise the Nice European Council and the future Treaty of Nice - the criticism, though varied, is unanimous - be aware that you are also addressing all your governments and all the peoples of Europe they legitimately represent, who have also elected you."
"I think you should be aware of that because the three institutions, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, all represent them, each in their own way: let none consider themselves the sole guardian of the higher European interest, while the others are just traders and shopkeepers."
"I believe deeply in the Community method, and when we say Community method we mean balance between three institutions which need to coexist and get on well together."
"That is what I will take away from this debate, this Presidency and this Intergovernmental Conference."
"The work has been difficult."
"I am sure it will be useful for the future of Europe."
"This is ongoing work, but it cannot continue unless we all work together to uphold the European ideal."
"Thank you very much, Minister."
"I am sure Parliament will go on to consider the relationship between the institutions."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, Mr Barnier, I would like to speak on two points."
"My first point is that, contrary to what Mr Chirac and Mr Prodi have claimed, there are Nice leftovers, not just for the Fifteen but also, even more so, for the Twenty-seven."
"In effect, the question is: are we ready for enlargement and what are our objectives?"
"And not only is the issue of the Commission a leftover, but the lack of extension of qualified majority voting and codecision strengthens competition between the Member States, between the Fifteen and a fortiori between the Twenty-seven, and undermines the future of the European social model."
"As regards post-Nice, the following question has to be dealt with: do we want to continue at the same pace as Fifteen, and a fortiori as Twenty-seven?"
"I do not think that will be possible."
"We must lift the consensus rule, including in a future convention."
"The European public interest, of which none of us is sole guardian - Mr Moscovici is right about that - cannot be based on the addition of national interests which are growing and becoming neutralised and in that regard Prime Minister Verhofstadt had a salutary message for us all."
"Mr President, there is an expression in my language 'to take French leave,' which is what the President-in-Office has done, leaving without saying goodbye."
"Therefore, my first words should be to thank Mr Prodi, who has stayed."
"The Commission is showing that it is interested in the debate in this Parliament."
"As far as the Treaty of Nice is concerned, we can say very little, because we do not yet have the conclusions of the European Council, and therefore, until we see them, we cannot add much."
"I think there are two matters in which the European Parliament plays an important role."
"The first is the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Charter has been proclaimed and that is a good thing."
"But it has neither been incorporated into the Treaties, nor has a reference to the Charter been put in Paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"And, above all, I have the feeling that the proclamation was not a solemn one."
"It was a proclamation on the quiet."
"I would therefore like to thank our President, Mrs Fontaine, and President Prodi for what they have said: for the European Parliament and the Commission, the Charter is law from now onwards, and it is going to have an effect from now onwards."
"I think that this is positive."
"The other point from Nice on which Parliament will judge Nice is the extension of qualified majority voting and Parliament' s codecision."
"On this subject - from what I have been able to hear here this morning - the news is vague and does not seem to be very promising."
"We will have to wait before we can establish what Parliament' s opinion is."
"I remember that when Dimitris Tsatsos and I drew up the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we talked about Ortega y Gasset, who said, quoting old Cervantes, that often you have to choose between staying at an inn or continuing with the journey."
"Nice is the road to two important things, one of which is enlargement."
"Enlargement is going to take place - now we know it."
"This is also the case for the euro."
"I think that a collapse at Nice would have been a punch below the belt for the euro."
"Therefore, perhaps in this Parliament we are in a paradoxical situation that is completely different to Amsterdam."
"Perhaps, for this Parliament the European Council of Nice has not been positive, as it was in Amsterdam."
"But perhaps, for the European Union, the European Council of Nice is opening up the way for hope and for the future."
"We will see, Mr President, when we read the conclusions."
"Until then, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats reserves judgement on what its position will be."
"Mr President, after the Single European Act, after Maastricht, after the Treaty of Amsterdam, this Parliament had to judge the results."
"In all those cases we reached the conclusion that those treaties were not entirely satisfactory, did not respond to all of our aspirations, but nonetheless represented a step forward and were at least better than the status quo."
"We recommended that they be ratified."
"This time we have a treaty which, at least on one point, represents a step backwards and is arguably worse than the status quo: that is, the new system for qualified majority voting in the Council, which makes reaching a decision even more difficult than it is at present."
"It introduces a triple threshold: number of states, population, and the percentage of the votes set at a higher level than is the case at the moment."
"At the moment it is 71% of the votes."
"That is already very high."
"It was set high to make sure that under any permutation such a qualified majority represented a majority of the population."
"Now that we have a population criterion in there anyway, it should have been possible to lower the threshold in terms of the number of votes."
"Instead it seems that it has been raised, although I speak while waiting to see the final text: apparently there was an adjustment in the last hour of the IGC on that."
"I will evaluate that outcome when I see the text."
"Nonetheless that is a very worrying situation."
"For the rest the Treaty is a mixture of unsatisfactory and positive things - unsatisfactory but nonetheless better than the status quo, I suppose, at least as regards the extension of qualified majority voting, the extension of the codecision procedure for the European Parliament, and the provisions for enhanced cooperation."
"That is all better than we have now, even if not all of our requests and desires have been met."
"Finally, there are a few positive things: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty; the article on political parties and their statute; the right of this Parliament to take the other institutions to the Court of Justice - that is also an important factor of political control; the new formula for the European Commission, putting the so-called ""lex Prodi"" into the Treaty, strengthening the President and the new composition of the Commission - a reasonable compromise which I accept and will work over time; and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos pointed out, the way forward to the future."
"This is not the end of the story."
"New reforms will come and we must take advantage of that."
"To sum up, we have a mixture of the good, the bad and the ugly."
"We will now evaluate this in detail."
"I believe we will recommend ratification and moving forward to a new reform, but we must look at the small print to decide whether that is the right way forward."
"Mr President, I apologise because my remarks are slightly ill-prepared."
"I have come straight from a meeting and, because there are no televisions in the meeting rooms in this building, it is very difficult to keep in touch with what is happening in the Chamber, a deficiency which I hope will be corrected in due course."
"Many of us regard the Treaty of Nice as unacceptable but for many different reasons."
"The great difficulty concerning the Treaty of Nice - as many people have already commented - is that the lack of any text at this time makes it impossible to make a considered judgment."
"We do not know whether the carpentry shop in Nice has produced a Pandora's box for Commission activism or a coffin for democracy, but - whatever has emerged - it is being French-polished and we hope the final result helps the European Union."
"I believe that two failures are the lack of democracy, because the opportunity to open the Council up to public scrutiny has been ignored although many of us feel that this was the time to do it, and the illogicality of the re-weighting of votes, with one approach for the Council and another for the European Parliament."
"Many people looking at the Treaty of Nice will wonder why it was done in that way."
"I personally believe that the re-weighting of votes must take account of population, as is done in the European Parliament and should have been done in the Council also."
"A further reason for opposing the Treaty of Nice is the development of greater bureaucracy in the European Union."
"Who can genuinely argue that the thirty areas now under QMV are essential to the enlargement process?"
"I think most of the enlargement countries - while accepting the Treaty as it stands because it exists and opens the door to their accession in due course, sooner rather than later I hope - will look at those points and, like most of us, realise that they have no relevance to the day-to-day affairs of their lives."
"No reform of the common agricultural policy, no reform of the development policies which are vastly wasteful."
"Then there is the incorporation as a mandatory mechanism of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: in itself as in the United States today, a recipe for confusion between the courts in the European Union."
"There is the fact that under enhanced cooperation the European Parliament has no role, although certain leaders of national parties - including the leader of the Labour Party in his Warsaw speech - promised no reform of the structural funds in real terms until 2013."
"This is not a recipe for enlargement, it is a recipe for more bureaucracy, less democracy."
"Mr President, we have already made a thorough assessment of what happened in Nice, but we should remember that Nice began with a very restricted agenda."
"The Council asked this Parliament not to broaden the agenda because the intention was to concentrate exclusively on the Amsterdam leftovers."
"The Council said it wanted to do this in order to make the European Union's institutions operationally efficient so that it could work better with 27 Member States than it does today with 15."
"What was the result of this exercise and this work?"
"The result was, in fact, that the most fundamental and important factor for introducing operational efficiency, decisiveness, flexibility and workability into institution operations was not dealt with at all."
"What the Council concentrated on most were questions of power; in other words in Nice there were too many calculators and not enough policies."
"The images coming out of Nice showed a Europe in which every country was trying to look after itself, suggesting that the Europe of the future will be a battle between the large and small countries."
"I wonder whether these might not be arguments that better serve the interests of the Euro-sceptics and Europe' s enemies."
"I wonder whether this image we have been given of Nice might not be an appeal to the conscience of convinced Europeans, those who do not just want a single market, those who do not just want a single currency, in the face of what I regard as this ""non-time"" for Europe."
"In my view, Nice was the second part of Amsterdam and we are now in a phase, an interval, between Amsterdam and an IGC to be held in 2004 but with an unknown end-date."
"Right now it is the duty of convinced pro-Europeans to counter the image that came out of Nice and say that solidarity for us has a meaning and that it is possible to build a Europe in which large and small countries can coexist peacefully; in other words, there are no expendable countries in this European project and national egos are nonsense in this Europe."
"So I should now like to appeal to the House and the Commission: somebody has to put the case for this European project."
"The case for the European project is that it is not the sum of national interests but a joint project, as President Romano Prodi has said, and the institutions must now look to the future and join hands so that enlargement can take place, so that the citizens can look on Europe as we would like them to and so that politics can go back to building the European project rather than just upholding power, particularly the power of the larger countries."
"Mr President, it has been said, and I think rightly so, that Europe is born out of necessity and that only when necessity knocks at the door does Europe decide to take a step forward."
"And necessity gave an urgent knock at the door of Europe in Nice, in the form of sclerosis as a result of the prospect of an enlarged Europe."
"There can be many evaluations of what happened in Nice, and we have had ample proof of that this morning and this afternoon in the continuation of the debate."
"But the European Council in Nice, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a triumph for reality, a triumph of pragmatism over utopianism."
"Although we would all have liked to increase our powers in codecision - and despite the disputes between large countries, between large and small countries and between small and medium-sized countries - it is obvious that the following, although not spectacular, are all steps in the right direction, as President Prodi said this morning: a Commission whose president has his powers increased; a decision-making process in which more decisions - not all those that we would have wished - are taken by qualified majority; a clarification of the role of enhanced cooperation; and also - why not come out with it? - a reweighting, imperfect though it may be, of the votes in the Council of Ministers."
"But Nice, Mr President, is not the end of the road, but the starting point for a new phase with many challenges."
"We have to successfully complete accession, consolidate the internal market, deliver the single currency, develop a real common foreign and security policy and open up a new debate on the future of Europe."
"These are challenges that cannot be overcome, Mr President of the Commission, with our backs to the people."
"And in order to do this we will need more generosity, more realism, a greater involvement of the institutions that defend the Community interests, and in this type of conference, everyone will need to seek, as Jean Monnet said, and I will finish with this, their interest in the common interest."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are winners and losers, but Europe cannot claim to be one of the winners and democracy and transparency certainly cannot."
"That is, in fact, the gist of what President Prodi said today in a commendably clear and unequivocal manner."
"Let us take one thing at a time: the charter was not included in the Treaty, not so much as a mention."
"Progress was made on security and defence policy, it is true, but it has no parliamentary dimension."
"As far as qualified majority voting is concerned, it has only been extended slightly and the procedure is now even more complicated and less transparent than before."
"We do, of course, have reinforced cooperation, but how it will work remains to be seen."
"The ratio between large and small was, in the end, regulated in a perfectly reasonable manner, following a number of totally obtuse and unacceptable suggestions, and the Commission has been strengthened, even if the link with the number of members is not necessarily an overly reasonable or clever decision."
"Mr Moscovici is without doubt quite right to say that talking about it among ourselves is not enough; we must tell the people about it."
"It is true that the people are probably more critical of integration more often than we here in the Chamber."
"And with a better result, we would probably have had more trouble persuading the people, but then again we would have had more persuasive powers had we been able to bring a better result home from Nice."
"We would have been able to convey a better, stronger European result to the people with a better and clearer conscience."
"I should therefore like to come back to something which has been touched on a few times today already."
"Yes, we need to analyse the result."
"But I think that we should not do so until we have a clear and unequivocal promise from the Council as to how the process will operate from now on, i.e. with the close involvement of the European Parliament."
"What was found and said in Nice is too vague for me: yes to Parliament's involvement."
"What involvement?"
"I think it is a disgrace if we have to fight yet again for perhaps two representatives to attend as many meetings as possible."
"It is totally unacceptable."
"This Parliament must play a leading role in this process, just as it did at the convention."
"We want to prove to the heads of government that we know best."
"If we compare the convention with what happened at the Intergovernmental Conference, admittedly with less serious problems than at the Intergovernmental Conference and with fewer national interests than at the Intergovernmental Conference, then the convention and the modus operandi and methods of the convention clearly come out on top."
"I therefore take the view that we should only apply ourselves in detail to what has come out of Nice once it is clear that the European Parliament will have an important and decisive role in the future process."
"We want to prove to the heads of government that we know best."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all my colleagues have stressed the expectations that surrounded the Nice Summit, which was intended to allow the European Union to continue operating effectively, democratically and transparently after the historic enlargement we are awaiting."
"Certainly, the Nice Summit has made it possible to achieve significant progress on all the issues that directly affect the lives of our citizens, whether it be the preservation of health, the protection of the environment, social policy or indeed the adoption of a European Company Statute."
"Another positive point is that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been officially proclaimed, even if it is not intended to be binding at this stage."
"Finally, the decisions taken in the area of the common foreign and security policy represent undeniable progress."
"This summit would have been a triumph if the crucial revision of the Treaties had been crowned with as much success as the areas I have just mentioned."
"In fact, while we seem to have succeeded in avoiding total paralysis of the future enlarged European Union, it has not been possible to convert the ambitions of the French Presidency into a new draft of the Treaty."
"Be it the excessively limited number of areas transferred from unanimity to majority voting, or subject to codecision, be it the upward revision of the number of Members of the European Parliament in the Europe of tomorrow, or yet again, be it the uncertainty over the number of Commissioners after the enlargements, the Treaty does not come up to scratch, far from it."
"Beyond the technical aspects of that reform, what concerns us most of all is the growing difficulty the Member States of the European Union have in making joint decisions, in accordance with the common interests of their citizens."
"Let me conclude, as rapporteur for the outermost regions of the Union, by expressing deep regret at the rather disappointing conclusions of the Nice Summit, which do no more than acknowledge the Commission' s work programme."
"The outermost regions deserve better and Parliament will continue to work flat out - with Commissioner Barnier' s help, I am sure - to give them all the space they are entitled to within the Union."
"Mr President, Nice was no success."
"Notwithstanding all the self-congratulation by the French government this morning, the IGC simply did not finish on a good note."
"Admittedly, reinforced cooperation and the European defence force got off the ground, the English having imposed quite a few restrictions on the latter."
"The most essential issue, i.e. the switch from vetos to majority decisions, was not applied to the very areas where it was most needed."
"Taxation, social security, justice, asylum issues, agriculture, structural funds; the very areas that ought to have been provided for before enlargement, were left out."
"The Summit simply failed on that score."
"National interests took precedence over the interests of Europe as a whole."
"And what makes it more serious still is that in a number of cases where majority decision making was introduced, no provision was made for Parliament to have authority as colegislator."
"So the democratic deficit has grown a little larger."
"What possessed the Summit to have so little feeling for democracy?"
"Then there is the position taken up by the Netherlands."
"During the Summit it seemed as if the Netherlands was only out to win a kind of football match against Belgium."
"The result of this outpouring of energy was 12-13 instead of 10-10 in terms of points in the vote weighting."
"What is that against 300 votes?"
"Anyway, why was France so dead against counting in population density?"
"Surely it is a very common democratic principle?"
"So the Netherlands got one more vote than Belgium in the Council."
"But if we look at the number of seats in the European Parliament then the Netherlands drops from 31 to 25 and Belgium from 24 to 22."
"So the Netherlands paid a price for gaining a toehold in the Council."
"At the end of the day, it is clear that the traditional IGC format no longer works."
"When the time comes to make preparations once again for a summit in 2004, it would be better to use the convention format."
"Leave it to the 15 governmental representatives, 30 national and 15 MEPs to prepare for the IGC."
"It worked well for the Charter and it will also work better than a traditional IGC."
"And it is more democratic to boot."
"Mr President, as far as I am concerned, the Nice Summit simply failed to make the grade."
"Mr President, according to a press report, the initial comment by the Finnish Prime Minister, Paavo Lipponen, after Nice was: ""This agreement must be remade"" ."
"We must surely agree with him, although we know that this desire will only be able to be realised after many years have passed, if, as I believe will happen, national parliaments ratify the Treaty of Nice."
"Hopefully, however, Nice showed Finland and other small countries that emphasising the intergovernmental European nature of the Council' s role will mean a continuous cycle of defeats for small countries in decision making."
"No one at the meeting spoke for Europe."
"When the Commission then tried to do so, its President, as we saw, was literally thrown out of the door. I would like to say many thanks anyway for the gesture"
"It is nonetheless sad for the future of Europe that no European statesmen were in evidence."
"Almost every country brought its own internal political problems to the meeting."
"When they got back home, the prime ministers then emphatically pointed out how they had achieved victory with regard to these internal problems."
"""We were able to keep matters under our own control"" or ""We were able to block European decisions"" , they said in their own countries."
"The candidate countries were thus presented with a very bad example, which must have astonished the whole region, from Tallinn to Prague and Budapest."
"It is obviously a positive matter that enlargement can now go ahead."
"That message must be clearly sent to the candidate countries."
"After enlargement, meetings like Nice and the IGCs as they are at present will be impossible; integration will either really make headway or simply fall apart."
"Things cannot stay as they are now."
"It is to be hoped that Europe will yield statesmen."
"The difference between politicians and statesmen is that politicians know well enough what people want today, while statesmen know what they will actually want twenty years from now."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not one of those clever members who can already weigh up everything decided in Nice in detail, because I have yet to see the texts."
"But if we have learned and must learn anything from Nice, then it is that Europe is far too valuable to leave it solely in the hands of the Heads of State and Government."
"The model of the Intergovernmental Conference has had its day."
"That is the first and most important lesson to be learned from last week's negotiations."
"On the positive side, we have managed to break through the power boundaries."
"This is an old demand which we Bavarians have made time and again and for which we were ridiculed years ago; now it is the basis for Council resolutions."
"I see this as a huge success."
"But when I look at the wrangling which took place in Nice, it would perhaps have been more important to start discussing power boundaries straight away."
"That might have made it easier to find reasonable compromises here."
"In theory, the Amsterdam leftovers have been dealt with."
"In practice, however, compromises have been found on the basis of the lowest common denominator."
"Europe cannot be operated in the long term by working solely to the lowest common denominator."
"I only hope that Parliament will learn the right lessons from all this."
"This Parliament must become more self-confident, especially when dealing with the Council of Ministers, if we want to prevent bureaucracy and secret diplomacy from taking over Europe permanently."
"Mr President, it is not easy to criticise the French presidency during this debate as it is not present."
"I understand that President Chirac, Mr Vedrine and Mr Moscovici have other important meetings to attend."
"However, I am sure that the President of the European Commission, Mr Prodi, has important meetings to attend as has Commissioner Barnier and yet they have done us the courtesy to wait for the end of this debate."
"Mr Moscovici says we should not blame him, we should blame other governments at the Council."
"It is deplorable that he has not found it possible to find a deputy to wait for the end of our deliberations."
"We are after all hoping that we shall be joined by applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe who have been used to the arrogance of government and people not being present, to people giving speeches and then disappearing."
"I deplore the fact that Mr Moscovici has found no deputy."
"Has Nice been a success?"
"Mr Moscovici says that we must turn to our own national governments and criticise them."
"I am happy to do that."
"Mr Blair returned to Great Britain as a conquering hero because he had not surrendered this, had not surrendered that and had fought for Britain's interests."
"Well, of course, I support him in that but what has he actually achieved?"
"He tells us that he has ensured that enlargement will take place."
"I do not know whether the Commission will reply at the end of this debate but I wonder, in the absence of the Council, whether the Commission is equally confident that by 2004 this European Parliament will contain Czech, Hungarian and Polish Members of the European Parliament and Members from the Baltic States."
"Mr Moscovici says that of course you must temper your idealism with realism."
"I just ask him: Did General de Gaulle temper his idealism with realism, or Winston Churchill?"
"""Public opinion will not wear this."""
"""We cannot get this through the House of Commons."""
"""Oh, there is a referendum."""
"Is there?"
"Have we no leadership in the European Union?"
"Where is the Council? Where are the governments?"
"It is deplorable and the only hopeful sign is that the European Commission has clearly recovered its sense of self-confidence."
"This European Parliament will join with the European Commission in insisting that our demands are met."
"Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that Intergovernmental Conferences have reached the end of their useful life."
"We are on the eve of eastward enlargement, a turning point which is throwing the strategy of doing things step by step into crisis."
"If a response is not found to the democratic deficit of the European institutions, the Union will not be able to count on the support of the peoples."
"The list of problems tackled in Nice is long but, as President Prodi made quite clear, there was insufficient focus on the institutional reforms and the role of Parliament."
"It may be that we went to Nice with too many ambitions."
"Parliament's ambition does not, however, mean that it lacks a sense of responsibility."
"If we gave in to the realists, we would sweep the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the carpet and be content with a free trade area governed by the large corporations and national interests."
"Something is wrong."
"The young federalists who called upon the heads of government to be more courageous, to have the courage of the fathers of the European Community, have understood this."
"We need to set in motion a large-scale debate on the future of Europe: this must be the post-Nice process if we want to revitalise Europeanism in a profoundly different environment."
"Mr President, I will be very brief because the purpose of my speech is to thank you, to thank you not only for your kindness to us but also for what you have said."
"It is not courtesy which has prompted us to stay until the end of the debate, Mr Beazley: Commissioner Barnier and myself have stayed to hear your opinions, your convictions and your feelings, for it is my opinion that, if we are to build Europe, Parliament and the Commission must do so together."
"We have been quite frank with each other in today's debate about those parts of the Treaty of Nice which give us cause for satisfaction and even more open about those with which we are not content. Our reasons are different in some cases but we share the same feelings and concerns."
"We have made no bones about the need to continue with the same force and the same determination as before Nice, to achieve our objectives along the road to enlargement, which will be our greatest historical moment and which it is the responsibility of Parliament and the Commission to bring about in the coming years."
"We have also been completely clear, ladies and gentlemen, about the need for Parliament and the Commission to work together to build the new Europe, for this arduous task is our responsibility, but ours is also this great mission and this great potential."
"Thank you very much, Mr President of the Commission."
"I have received six motions for resolutions from the Members, tabled in accordance with Paragraph 2 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00 a.m."
"2001 budget (continuation)"
"In accordance with the agenda, we will resume the debate on the 2001 budget."
"Mr Wurtz has the floor."
"Mr President, at first reading, my group performed the symbolic political act of tabling a resolution rejecting the budget."
"We wanted to draw attention to the characteristics, unacceptable in our view, of the draft submitted to us at that time."
"We stood by the principle that there should be new appropriations for new policies."
"Instead of the intended redeployments, detrimental to the traditional priorities, we called for the multi-annual revision of the financial perspective, especially for external actions, although a similar problem arises for expenditure on employment and environmental protection."
"We decided - and we make no bones about it - that we did not want the Council putting us in a position tomorrow where we have to choose between two priorities that are equally legitimate in our eyes: the Balkans and the Mediterranean."
"We are now in precisely the situation we wanted to avoid."
"Under the terms of the compromise concluded between Parliament' s delegation and the Council, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation suffers a cut of EUR 200 million compared with the budget for 2000."
"A fine signal to send our close partners in the South."
"As for the Balkans, they have given rise to an arduous and very precarious financial set-up."
"This includes a transfer, to the 2001 budget, of 2000 budget appropriations for aid to Latin America, or appropriations for Morocco under the draft fisheries agreement and not used this year."
"In addition, and above all, the problem of financing for the Balkans will still be there in its entirety for the years ahead."
"Heading 3, internal actions, also warrants a comment, since the 'employment initiative' , re-baptised the 'Spirit of Enterprise programme' has been amputated to the tune of EUR 87 million, the Trans-European Networks by EUR 23 million, and environmental protection by EUR 42 million."
"In total, with about 1.09% of European gross domestic product, or even less, the 2001 budget will be one of the lowest of the last ten years, in relative terms, since it is well below the already very restrictive ceiling established under Agenda 2000 in Berlin in March 1999."
"That is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left unfortunately cannot support Mrs Haug' s report."
"Mr President, I would like to start by stressing the fact that this year's budget is due in particular to the work of all the Members of the committee itself, in addition, of course, to the work of the committee chairman, Mr Wynn, who has steered us with wisdom through the various situations, and tense moments which we have experienced."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Schreyer."
"However, this does not mean that we could have done more or better."
"I will focus on one aspect at a time."
"Firstly, the positive side: the approximately EUR 60 million of agricultural funds allocated for testing, which is a significant although, in my opinion, not conclusive step; the earmarking of around EUR 450 million for small and medium-sized businesses, for we have at last realised that the European economy is not based on multinationals but on small and medium-sized enterprises, which will give new impetus to development and employment; then the fact that the increase in expenditure is only 3.5%, and the increase in appropriations for the Balkans, which is of political importance."
"In this sense, our committee has made a fundamental achievement."
"I would now like to focus on two points which I feel require some attention and give cause for concern: firstly, the possibly excessive use of flexibility which, like all excessive things, is a negative factor, which means that we must not use it as a safety net; secondly, the fact that the creation of the new jobs is simply due to early retirements."
"This must not become a precedent in our institutions."
"Finally, I urge the committee to adopt increasingly a budgetary strategy aimed particularly at strengthening and protecting our currency, the euro."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and I would have said Madam President of the Council, but I do not see her among us."
"It is true that the Chamber is pretty thin, but unfortunately the debate on the budget lasted longer than planned and we - I and the speakers who follow me - will not have the opportunity to raise the matter with the Presidency."
"I, in my turn, would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Council and the Presidency on the work that has been accomplished, and the conclusion of this agreement which will allow us to vote for the budget for the year 2001."
"But I endorse all the comments made, especially by Mr Colom i Naval, on this extremely delicate issue of the financial perspectives."
"An agreement has just been concluded in Nice to make enlargement possible."
"Now, the previous enlargements gave rise to major financial allocations."
"The Member States were not afraid of public opinion at home then and the enlargement to Spain and Portugal was accompanied by a major mobilisation of resources."
"When I see that our budget is down by comparison with the year 2000, both in real terms and in terms of percent of GNP, and that we are so very far adrift from the objectives set in Edinburgh, I recognise that as the real problem."
"Refusing to harness ourselves to them means undermining the credibility of the construction and enlargement of the Union."
"Mr President, in the course of the budgetary procedure for the 2001 budget, the debates in this Parliament focussed on a limited number of issues."
"One of these issues was, and still is today, the increase in the financial perspective for foreign policy."
"The Council is right to reject this revision because there is no point in putting a ceiling on the expenditure in Berlin for a period of six years if these ceilings are going to be called into question every year."
"These maximum levels force the Commission to set priorities within the confines of a budget, in the way that every government has to."
"Another issue to be given an airing once again this year was the flexibility instrument."
"An instrument of EUR 200 million that has now been earmarked, in agreement with the Council, for aid to the Balkans."
"As Mr Colom i Naval rightly commented, using the flexibility instrument in this way misses the whole point, i.e. the assuaging of unforeseen budgetary need."
"To be perfectly honest, I do wonder whether he would have said the same if this instrument had been used in the same spurious way for MEDA, as proposed by Parliament."
"It so happens that I voiced this criticism during the first reading of the budget, and I do not recall anybody applauding it."
"Needless to say, I am not against giving aid to the Balkans."
"The Union as an association of nation States, born of the need for peace in Europe, has a duty of honour to finance the process of peace and reconciliation in the Balkans."
"However, I feel that when it comes to mounting such an extensive operation, we must take stock of the need for aid before opening our wallet."
"The zeal shown by the Commission and Parliament to equip the Balkans with aid reserves, contrast sharply with the cuts in aid for the candidate States."
"Mr President, we probably ought to reserve the flexibility instrument for the 2002 budget now for the candidate states."
"They might wish to join the EU earlier, completely out of the blue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the principles of thrift and social and economic balance have been taken into account in drawing up the budget and the rapporteur must be thanked for that."
"It is also good that, as the main source of employment, small and medium-sized enterprises have been allocated additional funds."
"This will help to create new jobs and continue the fight against unemployment."
"We are also aware of the assumption behind the Commission's Letter of Amendment No. 2, i.e. that around 900 million can be saved in Category I. However, this assumption no longer holds true."
"First, the euro has now gone up in value, thereby reducing any potential savings, and secondly, we must now assume that insufficient funds have been earmarked in the budget for dealing with the BSE crisis."
"We shall therefore be forced to accept a supplementary budget which will again seriously reduce, if not eliminate any potential savings in this category."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating our colleague, the general rapporteur Jutta Haug, on the way in which she has done her job, which has contributed immensely to the constructive atmosphere in which our work has been carried out in committee and in Parliament in general."
"The vote that is to follow this debate will mark the end of the long, complex process of approving the European Union budget for 2001."
"As a result of intense negotiations and successive compromises among the various institutions, the chances of its approval are reasonable."
"However, I should like to point out certain aspects that carry over to subsequent years."
"The budget represents, in payment appropriations, just 1.056% of the Community GDP."
"The financial perspective forecast 1.11% for 2001, which is not to mention the 1.27% that was being mentioned a few years ago."
"On the other hand, external cooperation programmes are still not multiannual, the difference between commitments and payments is still growing, some projects are still implemented very little or badly, there are unjustifiable and unsustainable payment delays, and Parliament has been confronted with faits accomplis with budgetary implications."
"Whereas there is no solution as yet for the first aspect mentioned, the GDP, and I am sure that Parliament will soon demonstrate its persistence with regard to the second, I must say that with regard to the third aspect that I have highlighted, I believe that the great novelty in the budget process in coming years is the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council for the Commission to draw up a report by 30 June 2001 to be submitted to the first two institutions regarding the progress achieved in a number of basic fields, such as the reduction in the amount outstanding, the simplification of the project round, improved programme implementation, a commitology review, the reform of the Commission, the definition and execution of implementation objectives, particularly in external cooperation, and the provision of more thorough information for Parliament in several fields."
"If the submission of such a report is not seen as just one more formality, the hopes that many of us have placed in this new step will be justified."
"Mr President, at times we have sounded like a mutual admiration society in the way in which we have congratulated one another on this."
"I may just deviate from that trend slightly in relation to the Council - not necessarily the French Presidency - but the Council in general."
"Let us not kid ourselves, this is a good budget."
"It is not the budget that I or many of my colleagues would have wanted. However, we can be satisfied with it."
"In football terms it is like a l-1 draw."
"However, because of the flexibility instrument, we think we have won the penalty shoot-out."
"The Commission's original proposal for a revision of the financial perspective to take EUR 300 million from category 1 for category 4 was a worthy idea: worthy of support and eminently sensible."
"Unfortunately, a majority of my colleagues did not agree with me and therefore we could not go along with it."
"Neither was there a qualified majority within this House to revert to Article 272."
"Therefore, we had to find a solution within the means that the interinstitutional agreement affords us so that we could get a decent budget."
"That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument."
"The result is the best that we can hope for without either a revision or Article 272."
"Mr Colom i Naval made his remarks this morning because it was clear to those of us who were present when the IIA was agreed that the flexibility instrument should not be used for the same purposes in consecutive years."
"I admire the answer Mrs Parly gave this morning but we have turned a blind eye to that."
"Kosovo and Serbia are in effect the same thing."
"We have ignored what we agreed."
"We have also said that the flexibility instrument would not be an annual reserve for category 4 but that is exactly what it has become."
"That is why it is not only Mr Colom i Naval who is frustrated at the way things have developed over this budgetary procedure in the last two years."
"It must be said, and I put it on record, that the French presidency has been a good partner in trying to find solutions."
"On classification, I have no problem with the two points that were raised: pensions are compulsory expenditure."
"What we are talking about is an early-retirement scheme which as yet has no legal base; no one knows whether what will be proposed is compulsory or non-compulsory and it is, after all, a p.m. that is on the line."
"On the fisheries agreement, we have only changed the remarks for the A lines."
"In other words, the remarks which concern non-compulsory expenditure."
"In both cases we have not changed any figures. There should not be a clash on that."
"Just because we have a budget and we have agreed a deal at conciliation, let us not imagine that all our problems have disappeared."
"The problems will remain until we sort out what we are going to do about external expenditure."
"There are times when I foolishly assumed this year that once the Commission had made its proposals for a revision we could reach an agreement with the Council."
"I was wrong."
"Then when I discovered that there would be no discussions on that revision regarding Article 25 of the IIA, I was, to say the least, somewhat disappointed."
"The Council's attitude in this game of football seems to be not to worry about the ball but to get on with the game."
"Let me just say to the Council that, as far as this game is concerned, we have not run out of balls and this side intends playing until we get the right result."
"Finally, I thank all those who have been involved in this - not just the rapporteurs - but also the secretariat of the Commission, Parliament services and the political group staff."
"Mr President, firstly, I too would like to thank all those who contributed to the determination of the budget, the Commissioner, the Council and the rapporteurs."
"I would also particularly like to thank Mr Wynn, who, I believe is seeing out his first full year as chairman of the Committee on Budgets during a budgetary procedure, and I think he has made an outstanding job of it."
"I am satisfied with this budget."
"I am particularly satisfied because we stayed within the financial perspective again."
"I believe Parliament must uphold its agreements, and they can only be broken in cases of extreme need."
"I have not identified any such cases this year."
"The Commissioner is still proud of this and says that the agricultural expenditure will increase by an enormous percentage this year as compared with previous years."
"That is indeed the case but then these are agreements that must be kept."
"They were concluded before she became Commissioner and I think it would be to her credit if she were to uphold the Berlin agreements."
"What else has a bearing on the agricultural budget? We are all familiar with the content of the letter of amendment in October and if all goes well, if the dollar stays at 91 cents, then we could end up with a surplus of approximately EUR 1.3 billion in category 1A."
"Suppose that does not happen and Mr Duisenberg says it is not going to happen, how are we to finance the BSE crisis?"
"That is what I want to know."
"Are we going to make cuts in other agricultural expenditure, are we going to defer it to other years, is it still possible to use the surplus for 2000 or can we devise an insurance system, which already features in an earlier parliamentary resolution?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, representative of the Council, rapporteurs, each budgetary year the European Parliament gains budgetary importance."
"We do not gain this importance out of nowhere, but from the Treaties, although sometimes the Council finds it hard to admit it."
"Last year, with the Bourlanges report, the flexibility instrument was mobilised for the first time, and an institutional declaration was also obtained recognising the possible financial insufficiency of category 4."
"This year, the Haug report has taken advantage of this institutional declaration last year to discuss the need to revise the financial perspective."
"It has been demonstrated that it was not the right time for a revision, that there was enough margin to fulfil the commitments to the Balkans and to the MEDA programme without altering the forecasts of Berlin 1999, and it has been shown that the compulsion to have a revision is only in the intentions of those who voted against Agenda 2000 in its day."
"However, the European Parliament cannot carry on forever reducing its external commitments."
"This year the flexibility instrument has been used again, but we should not continue down this road."
"We do not want there to be a proposal for revision for next year in the Colom Resolution, because we want to wait for the World Bank evaluation, but we share his criticism that this method of resolving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the major external objectives of the Union and the very definition of the financial perspective."
"This time, more than ever, the secret of success will be in correctly implementing the budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must first congratulate the general rapporteur, Mrs Haug, the President of the Commission and my colleagues who have been involved in negotiations on the excellent work that they have done."
"The final outcome of the negotiations is positive, which shows that in order to achieve some objectives, what matters is not getting there alone and early, but getting there altogether and on time."
"We wanted a budget that would combine our efforts with those of the Member States to contribute to economic growth and increasing employment, and therefore the agreement that has been reached on the multiannual amount for the small businesses programme is a good thing."
"However, sustaining this and Parliament' s other political priorities needs to be compatible with budgetary stability in spending."
"It is true that the Union is in its most favourable economic situation for 10 years, as is proved by the fact that the net balances have improved a great deal."
"But, precisely for this reason, I think that the agreement reached on payment appropriations is reasonable, because it combines efforts in the right direction for sustained growth."
"Parliament' s budgetary strategy marks a before and an after at this start of the millennium."
"Because the negotiations not only lead to the final amounts and their distribution, but also to the implementation of instruments which are going to enable us to measure to what extent the political will of this Parliament translates into facts."
"And I am going a little further, because it is not enough to have strict and transparent rules for implementing the budget, such as the cancellation of commitments if they have not been implemented after two years."
"This should go hand in hand with a commitment from the College of Commissioners to a fair and efficient distribution of human and material resources for the management of the various policies, that is, they must remember the political priority of Parliament and the management priority of the Commission."
"Mr President, now that we have arrived at the final decision on the EU' s Budget for 2001, we can say that we have come through a year of constant struggle to produce the Budget successfully within the framework devised when the financial perspective was adopted in Berlin in March 1999."
"We can now say that this struggle has been successful."
"We shall be able to adopt a Budget within this framework, which is a great success."
"I believe, in actual fact, that both the Member States and the taxpayers are grateful that the charges are not still higher."
"I also see it as a clear success that we are able to go into a new Budget year with a greater margin than in the past."
"When we make use of 1.06 per cent of the Member States' GDP, this gives us a margin greater than ever before and greater than that predicted in Berlin less than two years ago."
"This gives us an opportunity to be an active partner where enlargement to include the countries in Central and Eastern Europe is concerned and when it comes to helping establish peace and prosperity in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia."
"For all this to be possible, there will have to be extensive prioritising in the future, too."
"This will be necessary if we are successfully to honour our long-term commitments, something which is clearly possible if our objective is to work for an EU which is strong but, at the same time, circumscribed."
"As I see it, there is a major threat in the present-day situation, namely BSE."
"It is nonetheless important to note that we must cope successfully with this too within the current Budget framework."
"This means that, if the solution to the problem requires still more money, this must be provided by means of other savings in Category 1 or through the Member States' accepting a larger portion of the cost."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to focus on one fundamental point in my comments on the budget lines for environmental, public health and consumer protection policy."
"Generally-speaking, the proportion of the budget earmarked in order to safeguard and maintain the environment is far too small."
"This is particularly annoying in that environmental policy is a horizontal policy because environmental policy - or at least successful environmental policy - must be applied as a cross-border policy."
"We all know that."
"Which is why safeguarding and regenerating the environment is a job which has to be done at European Community level."
"But this also means that we need to be given proper funding once and for all."
"We cannot just keep on issuing endless directives and regulations, often without sufficient background information, scientific basis and generally to unbelievably short deadlines."
"Allow me to make a comment: I am not the only one who constantly has the impression in these circumstances that my only purpose in sitting on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is to prevent the worst in the frenzy and rush of regulation which is thrust upon us."
"We must not lose our sense of environmental direction by promoting small, local measures, however badly they may be needed, or by blindly shelling out money to institutions which appear to produce little in the way of results, which applies, in my view, to the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen."
"What European environmental policy needs is a scientifically-based framework for action."
"That is something we do not have."
"And that is because we lack the foundations."
"We need to invest in scientific research and analysis."
"Only then shall we be able to work out realistic prospects, prospects for linking environmental and health policies to other policy areas, prospects for what promises to be a successful and realistic approach to problem-solving."
"That is the only right and the only sensible way of investing the money at our disposal on behalf of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have three comments to make on what has been said during this debate."
"The first relates to something which you reminded us of this morning, Mrs Schreyer."
"Compared with many national budgets, the increase in the Community is somewhat higher but, in relation to expenditure ratios, it is still very low and sets an excellent example for many national budgets."
"We must tell the public that, if the national foreign or other secretaries of state keep handing work over to be carried out at European level, such as the whole Balkans programme, then we must also bear in mind that this work requires money and that funds must be made available."
"My second comment relates to the common foreign and security policy."
"Tremendous progress was made here during the 1990s."
"During the conflict in Bosnia, Europe was still not in a position to speak with one voice: one country was purported to be on the side of the Serbs, another to be on the side of the Croats."
"We almost seemed to be back in the policy of alliances of the 19th century."
"Now, at the end of this century, at the end of the 1990s, Europe is speaking with one voice, Europe is the biggest civil reconstructor in the Balkans, bigger than the United States, and is doing a good job; through its budget and its policy it really did help to make peaceful revolution possible in Serbia."
"This needed to be said quite clearly about European policy at the end of this financial year and after this decade of confusion in the Balkans."
"Foreign states are becoming more important to us and we hope that, with the new posts provided, the Commission will do the job which we expect it to do."
"We are being up front with our praise and you may be sure that we shall seek to exercise strict control in the future."
"There is much talk of post-Nice."
"Nice was yet again the scene of national haggling for individual states."
"We have overcome this to a considerable degree in foreign policy and I hope in the forthcoming budget debates that we shall take more decisions of substance and spend more time on the problems and less time haggling over national interests in this budget."
"Mr President, honourable members, I only intend to comment on certain aspects raised during the debate."
"First, the structure of the budget in 2001: one speaker said that the agricultural budget would not rise sufficiently."
"However, I must stress that the agricultural budget has a very high rate of growth, namely 5.7%."
"If we include the expected supplementary budget, it comes out at nearly 8%, while other areas, such as training policy, the whole of internal policy - including research -, foreign policy, administration and accession aid have together only risen by 1.1%."
"We really must stress, therefore, that Parliament too has exercised immense budgetary discipline in the areas in which it has the last word but has, I think, brought about an excellent result with clear priorities nonetheless."
"On Mr Mulder's comment: you noted that, because the budget at second reading was below the margin in agricultural policy, the risk of a change in exchange rates needed to be included in the calculation, because it would be not unwelcome if the euro were to rise against the dollar."
"I would draw your attention here to the rules of the Interinstitutional Agreement, which state that a ""currency risk"" of up to EUR 200 million must be financed from the agricultural policy and that only then can recourse be taken to the currency reserve."
"However, my view is that we should in fact take care in the supplementary budget to keep this reserve at EUR 200 million so that we do not have to take other measures if there is the slightest change in the exchange rate."
"To Mrs Sommer's comment that too little account is taken of environmental aspects in the European Union budget, allow me to point out that one third of the budget is spent on structural policy and that we have mainstreaming in structural policy; we have gender mainstreaming to ensure that structural policy measures provide equal opportunities for men and women."
"The money must be used in order to increase employment and - and this is the third mainstreaming - it must be used in order to improve the environmental situation."
"That gives us an enormous amount of money to play with."
"May I also point out that the EUR 4.5 billion under agricultural policy for developing the countryside, which we discussed this morning, includes numerous measures to promote environmental protection."
"In addition, agricultural policy also includes something in this area which is not standard practice in environmental policy and which fundamentalists may occasionally take a dim view of: namely that compensation is paid for refraining from taking environmentally damaging action."
"Here are your measures which quite explicitly promote environmental protection."
"I should like to comment again on the charming question put by Mr Colom i Naval this morning. He asked what was the difference between revising the financial perspective and using the flexibility instrument?"
"You are, of course, quite right to keep reverting to this question."
"I see it like this: revising the financial perspective means that if we make an increase on one side, we must at the same time decide where savings can be made."
"This requirement does not apply to the flexibility reserve."
"In this respect, the finance ministers' reluctance to revise the financial perspective is even harder to understand."
"Oh well, we live and learn."
"I guess this example also illustrates the fact that sometimes principles count for more than budgetary intentions."
"I think it is a good thing that we have succeeded in activating the flexibility instruments and giving Serbia the help it needs on this occasion, although I fully agree with you that our strategy must be such that we prevent the phenomenon from arising whereby a European flexibility instrument wanders from one region or country of Europe to another, depending on where it is needed."
"In closing, I should like once again to stress that, in the Commission's view, the 2001 budget provides an excellent basis on which we can together forge a good Community policy for Europe and I should like to thank you for the excellent cooperation."
"And we shall have the opportunity of continuing this excellent cooperation on the supplementary budget in January."
"But first I should like to wish all those involved in the budget a Happy Christmas!"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Parliament also wishes you a Happy Christmas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday from 10.00 a.m."
"Common strategy towards the Russian Federation"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0363/2000) by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the application of the European Union' s common strategy on the Russian Federation [2000/2007(INI)]."
"Mr President, our relations with Russia underwent a fundamental change when the cold war ended."
"Fear of military violence or of a dictatorship that might advance further, is a thing of the past."
"The attitude of the European Union and its Member States is now more one of a feeling of joint responsibility for the restoration of Russian society."
"It can be regarded as a kind of moral duty but also as being in the interests of the European Union, which, of course, has nothing to gain from lawlessness and poverty in a very large neighbouring country."
"Yet for many of us, the development of the Russian Federation is still a dubious matter and that is why I can imagine that people sometimes have their doubts about it, even in this Parliament."
"In any case, the best thing we can do in our strategy towards the Russian Federation is to follow a twin-track strategy."
"On the one hand, we must indict those who violate human rights and wield a disproportionate amount of power, clearly and forcefully, and on the other, we must enter into cooperation in a variety of sectors."
"Both approaches are necessary if we are to help Russia become a flourishing, democratic constitutional state."
"This is in our mutual interest."
"That means condemning the gross violence in Chechnya and looking for ways of helping to end the war and assuage the suffering. So it is necessary for the European Union and the OECD to be present there."
"We know, I am happy to say, that people in Russia are not indifferent to our criticism of what is happening there."
"That comes up in quite a few conversations one has in Russia."
"After all, Russia too wants to be assessed by the same standards that we apply to ourselves."
"We would also do well to be severely critical of the visa measures vis-√†-vis Georgia that have recently been undertaken, and provided for in amendments."
"I am expecting a more extensive discussion to take place next month via the topical and urgent debate, and would suggest that we only give a limited preview of this debate in these resolutions."
"In particular, I hope to be able to adopt half of the amendment tabled by the Greens on this issue."
"It also behoves us to criticise the relations between Russia and the Baltic States, which are still to be regularised."
"It will not be the fault of the latter."
"They need Russia to regularise and establish its affairs with them effectively."
"As far as cooperation with Russia is concerned, the Russian response to the strategy document of the European Union offers some good starting points."
"The entry into force of scientific and technological cooperation with the Russian Federation is a good example."
"In retrospect, the interruption of this cooperation was not a success, particularly as there appears to be little coordination in actions of this kind, between the European Union on the one hand and other major players, such as Japan and the United States, on the other."
"We must take this lesson to heart for future reference."
"The Northern Dimension is a clear example of cooperation that is to be put into concrete form."
"In point of fact, this concept is underused, politically speaking."
"It is an important concept, particularly in the fields of energy provision, care for the environment, the clearing up of nuclear waste, and the decommissioning of nuclear submarines."
"In addition, it is possible to achieve various forms of cross-border cooperation that will prevent sharp disparities in wealth from arising."
"Initiatives concerning cooperation with the region of Kaliningrad fit into the same framework."
"We would argue in favour of having a separate budgetary line for developing this Northern Dimension in a coherent manner, along the lines of the one that we already have for cooperation with the three Baltic States."
"However, I am of the opinion that the importance of Russia is not really reflected in the budget, but we disagree with the Social Democrats on that score."
"If you take a close look, then roughly speaking, Russia is slightly ahead of Morocco in terms of budgetary importance, which cannot be right to my mind."
"I could live with it though, if recital G on this aspect were to lapse, and in so doing if it were to be possible, with the support of the Social Democrats, to achieve a broader majority for this resolution, because this would send out a clearer signal to Russia."
"We are hoping that the cooperation will extend to external policy."
"The resolution refers to the Commission as the initiator of policy and to the High Representative as the coordinator of policy."
"There are various regions where we could start the ball rolling, such as the Balkans, the Caucasus region and Central Asia."
"A more relaxed discussion of mutual security interests would also have its uses, bearing in mind that, naturally, from my point of view and that of others and the majority of my group, NATO, and within this framework, our bond with North America, are absolutely paramount in matters of security."
"We will follow the developments in Russian society and internal politics with great interest."
"We hope that a truly civil society will soon flourish there and form the permanent basis for a real political democracy."
"I hope that links will be established at all levels between organisations, individuals and associations in the EU and their counterparts in the Russian Federation."
"This will help to spread awareness of the values we all share."
"Mr President, Russia has yet to come to terms with herself, to decide what sort of society she wants to create and define her position in the world."
"For over seventy years, her development was distorted and held back by the monstrous experiment of communism which grew to threaten us all."
"I must say I very much welcome Mr Oostlander's report for its very reasonable and balanced approach, praising constructive reforms while criticising blatant human rights abuses."
"But let me say a couple of words about our strategic relationship."
"While encouraging a strong economic relationship between the European Union and Russia coupled with efforts at political cooperation, we must take care that we do not create for ourselves some sort of strategic dependency."
"For example, it has been suggested in the context of European defence policy - about which I have to say we continue to have reservations - that the European Union might turn to Russia to provide strategic airlift capabilities to complement the arrangements already in place between the WEU and Ukraine."
"Now I am in favour of encouraging Russia and the Ukraine to move in our direction and cooperate with other alliance countries in crisis-management tasks, but I would not be in favour of us moving in their direction or adjusting our policies in order to accommodate them."
"It would be a very dangerous situation if the Europeans were to become logistically reliant on Russia."
"If we do not have our own strategic airlift then we already have a tried and tested ally in the United States - and in this context I am sure that Mr Oostlander has no desire for Russia to supplant the United States as a strategic partner for Europe."
"We must work in the closest possible harmony with the United States in our dealings with Russia and certainly must not give Russia the impression that there are divisions to be exploited."
"This would be in no one's interests."
"Secondly, we must take great care to ensure diversity of production and supply in terms of energy."
"Already some 40% of natural gas supply for the EU comes from Russia, and an increasing proportion of oil imports now come from the CIS countries, where known reserves are larger than those in the United States and North Sea combined."
"Many of the transit routes for these are through areas of great conflict."
"It is in our interests to do all we can to help stabilise that region by economic and political means, ensuring that we do nothing to encourage or sustain instability in the Caucasus and the southern regions of Russia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy towards the Russian Federation was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union."
"That alone illustrates the importance which the EU attaches to its relations with the Russian Federation."
"The dual strategy of cooperation and criticism which Mr Oostlander develops in his report is, in the opinion of my group, eminently suited to the situation in the Russian Federation."
"However, this sort of strategy is a complex subject and all the institutions and the Member States must approach it in a strictly coordinated and circumspect manner."
"As the Oostlander report demonstrates, this is not always easy and Parliament must ensure that it works in a very orderly fashion here."
"Now to the most important points in the report: the Russian Federation is important to the Union for both security policy and economic reasons, of that there can be no doubt."
"The PCA provides the necessary contractual basis here and - if it is applied fully - the instruments needed in order to react to a whole spectrum of developments."
"The agreement contains a human rights clause and provisions governing the establishment of democratic rule of law."
"Our economic relations with the Russian Federation have fluctuated enormously over past years, depending on various crisis situations."
"But, most importantly, there is a lack of foreign investment in the Russian Federation, coupled with a huge drain on the profits of Russia companies."
"Unless the Russian Federation rectifies this situation by creating, post haste, the necessary legal and security framework and hence a more friendly investment climate, there would appear to be no way out of the economic crisis, high oil prices notwithstanding."
"And programmes such as TACIS can only be of limited help here - more to the point, they barely scratch the surface."
"The Commission's priority task should therefore be to improve the effectiveness of the funds deployed under the programme and, more importantly, to enhance its visibility."
"What is important, I think, is that it should continue to be the political responsibility of the administrative staff and should not turn into project management."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we often underestimate the fact that a balance struck with the Russian Federation is a guarantee of peace in Europe."
"This highlights the importance of the strategy towards the Russian Federation and, at the same time, the importance of your report, Mr Oostlander."
"However, as we have already said, the Russian Federation is a difficult partner."
"Even if President Putin guarantees the democratic development of his country, that does not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russian Federation."
"Basic democratic order is not a fact of life in the Russian Federation and this is a problem, especially when it comes to cooperation with the European Union, because, for us, any such cooperation must be based on respect for human and minority rights, and we have made that clear."
"This means that the twin-track strategy posited in the report is very, very important."
"We want outstanding cooperation with the Russian Federation, but we cannot accept the Russian Federation's continuing to wage war on its own people in Chechnya, a war which has continued uninterrupted for a year now."
"We are also hugely critical of the Russian Federation's provocative visa policy towards Georgia and call for this decision to be revoked at once."
"Nor can we tolerate the manner in which the freedom of the press is trampled underfoot in the Russian Federation."
"I think the Prodi plan may bring a new dimension to cooperation with the Russian Federation and provides an important basis."
"Let us not forget the basis we had in the European Union, with the coal and steel plan guaranteeing lasting peaceful cooperation between France and Germany."
"And look where we are now."
"The energy community with the Russian Federation may well take on a political dimension in exactly the same way."
"That means that we have a joint responsibility for peace in the Caucasus, for environmental protection in the Russian Federation and for the rights of its indigenous people."
"Mr President, we must establish cooperation with Russia, a country wounded in its statehood, so that she can become a European state that aspires to education and culture."
"Mr Oostlander' s report is crucially important and it sets out to achieve this cooperation."
"We have to use our combined powers to heal the wounds that ten years of crude capitalism have inflicted on Russia."
"Boycotts will not resolve the problem."
"Things are now going badly for Russia."
"There is no middle class: there are just the super-rich and the super-poor."
"Half the population live below the poverty line."
"The country is in sharp moral decline: it is almost like Sodom and Gomorra."
"There are fears that the number of HIV-positive cases will rise in the next few years to close on 600 000, and the disease is also beginning to hit young people hard."
"Eighty per cent of new infections concern people under the age of 25."
"The birth rate is dropping, the mortality rate is going up, and the net loss in Russia' s population amounts to a million a year."
"That goes to show just how bad things are for the people there."
"The country is also burdened by the need to protect nature and human beings from old mistakes."
"There are still 300 tons of anthrax bacteria manufactured for purposes of biological warfare in existence there, and just a small dose is lethal."
"Dozens of tons of waste plutonium have to be destroyed as a result of disarmament negotiations."
"The EU must help Russia, because in that way it is also preventing risks that would threaten itself."
"The most important area of cooperation is energy policy, which is connected with superpower politics, which governs, for example, the transportation of oil and gas from the east to the west."
"Today 30-40% of EU gas comes from Russia, and in ten years' time the EU will be almost totally dependent on Russian gas."
"There is no northern, western or southern alternative for this."
"The EU countries should not be a geopolitical extension of the United States in matters of gas and oil pipelines."
"The EU is no threat to the Russians, but a unipolar world under the leadership of the USA is."
"The Russians cannot, at least not yet, oppose NATO' s sly expansion through the militarisation of EU structures."
"Slyness does not become us: we must build a Europe of economic cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should pay tribute to Mr Oostlander for having stressed the importance of the role of the Commission and, in particular, of Mr Patten as the Commissioner responsible for external relations, in the implementation of this common strategy."
"Contrary to what previous speakers have said, I do not believe that this strategy has been successful to date."
"Unfortunately, the major financial scandals which continue to punctuate relations between Russia and international finance, and a number of projects involving the international community, clearly illustrate as much."
"I cannot really agree with Mr Oostlander' s approach to the issue of human rights and democracy in the context of the Russian Federation."
"I have put forward a number of amendments intended to place rather more emphasis on these issues."
"Mr Oostlander does not customarily welcome my amendments and I was not therefore very surprised to see that they had not been included."
"Regarding Chechnya, in particular, I do not think it is possible to say, Mr Oostlander, that the solution cannot be purely military."
"I think that the solution cannot be military, as the situation clearly demonstrates, and that it can only be political."
"Mr Putin himself - and we would not even be going as far as him - said that the issue of the future status of Chechnya is not the main issue."
"Yet we do not dare say as much in our report."
"This, I believe, is not acceptable."
"Nor do I think it acceptable, moreover, to fail to state that it is absolutely intolerable, after one and a half years of war in Chechnya, that our Commissioner for humanitarian aid, Mr Nielson, has not yet truly set foot in Chechnya."
"Nor do I think it acceptable that the European Union should fail to respond to the murders of journalists covering the war in Chechnya."
"These are not isolated instances but repeated occurrences."
"A member of my party, a radical militant journalist, was murdered several weeks ago in Tbilisi, a city clearly under the control of Russian troops."
"I do not feel the Commission and the Council can fail to respond to an event of such seriousness."
"Mr Van Orden is quite right in what he says regarding the Caucasus."
"We are currently witnesses to an absolutely dreadful deterioration of the situation in Georgia."
"The country is completely destabilised, literally strangled by the Russian Federation."
"It is on the point of collapse and the European Union is offering no practical response to this rejection, this ban by the Russian authorities regarding the introduction of visas."
"It could respond by cancelling visas for Georgians travelling to the European Union. It could and should start to consider Georgia' s accession before it is too late, before there is another Balkans situation at the very gateway to Europe."
"Mr President, the current line taken by the Kremlin does not give the least cause for optimism."
"On the domestic front, President Putin has explicitly opted for an enforced recentralisation policy, his watchword being 'all power to the Kremlin' ."
"When it comes to overseas affairs, Moscow does not wish to comply with international obligations."
"The attitude of the Russian diplomats at the OSCE Summit held in Vienna at the end of November, spoke volumes in this respect."
"There is to be no withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova, nor are the Russian military bases in Georgia to be closed."
"Incidentally, how does the EU view the latest Russian manoeuvre against Georgia?"
"I am referring to the introduction of a visa obligation for Georgians, with the exception of the Abkhazians and the South Ossetians."
"Surely that is completely out of kilter with the rapporteur' s idea of a certain degree of convergence between the foreign and security policy of the European Union and Russia in the Caucasus?"
"After all, that would be sending out the wrong signal to Kremlin boss Putin at entirely the wrong moment."
"The famous Russian opposition politician, Grigori Jawlinski, has made it into western newspaper columns again lately."
"Using cutting words he condemned the uncritical stance of the West towards the occupant of the Kremlin."
"He said western politicians do not understand Russia."
"Indeed, they fear Russia."
"Hence they choose the line of least resistance."
"They want to have a friend in the Kremlin."
"It makes no odds to the west what is happening with Russia, its people and society."
"Mr Oostlander' s report contradicts the latter sentiment and I would like to compliment him on that."
"And yet Jawlinkski' s portrayal of Europe' s struggle with the phenomenon of Russia is very apt."
"Mr President, may I, on behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, thank and congratulate Mr Oostlander."
"His was a well prepared report. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, and Common Security and Defence Policy got its most important proposals approved and in the final vote we supported the adoption of the report."
"Mr Oostlander' s report clearly denounces the excessive use of force that Russia was guilty of in Chechnya."
"Failings in the implementation of human rights and democracy have also been clearly brought to light."
"On the other hand, the report supports a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia."
"Cooperation with Russia needs to be reinforced."
"A separate budgetary heading is being proposed for the Northern Dimension and increased aid to Russia, in general, is being recommended."
"The report also supports the development of energy cooperation between the Union and Russia."
"It is important for the Union that the availability of oil and natural gas is secured by creating alternatives."
"Moves to exploit the gas and oil resources in the Barents region should be speeded up, while, at the same time, production in the Komi and Caspian Sea regions and the infrastructure for transporting the products out of those regions should be improved in terms of technology."
"Now that the Nice Summit seems to be opening up the avenue towards swift enlargement of the Union, it is important to show determination in getting to grips with those problems which enlargement threatens to create for relations between the Member States and Russia."
"We need flexibility, particularly in arrangements regarding trade and the mobility of people."
"However, the main solution is for cooperation between the Union and Russia to be enhanced, bringing down the barriers between us."
"As the Union expands it will also be important to think about its internal differentiation, which might, for its part, ease border area problems."
"On the other hand, there is reason to hope the Russian Federation will also consider decentralising the power of decision and the issue of internal differentiation, allowing the possibility of abolishing borders."
"By this I mean, for example, making special economic areas of Kaliningrad, Murmansk, Karelia and other parts of Russia bordering the Union."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Oostlander for his outstanding and comprehensive report, for the extraordinary amount of time which he has invested in it and for his receptiveness to suggestion."
"Anyone looking at Russia from the outside and with the odd personal experience from visiting the country itself and speaking to Russian counterparts will soon be in danger of selectively tailoring reality in the Russian Federation to fit his personal image."
"Current discussions on the Russian state symbol show that there are several takes on reality in the Russian Federation."
"The national flag of Peter the Great flutters alongside the army's red flag and the national coat of arms showing the Tsarist double-headed eagle is displayed while Stalinist national anthems are being sung."
"These symbols are perhaps not as contradictory as they first appear, each reflecting as it does a facet of an authoritarian state."
"But a whole spectrum lies between these diametrically-opposed historical perspectives and pro-active Russian society will certainly refuse to be reduced to or guided towards any of these authoritarian alternatives."
"I personally become more and more enthusiastic when I meet young, open, well-educated Russians and more and more depressed by Russian structures, be they state, economic or even mafia structures."
"The best way we can help the Russian Federation is, on the one hand, to refrain from wholesale damnation and clearly address unhealthy structures or individual policies, such as the Chechen policy and, on the one hand, to value positive developments, without talking up, writing up or thinking up the Russian Federation as a whole."
"We can contribute towards stability from the outside by sending the Russian Federation clear and specific signals as to how we wish to configure our cooperation."
"Once Poland and the Baltic States accede to the EU, we hope to use the greater geographical proximity to the Russian Federation to strengthen cross-border cooperation in the area of Saint Petersburg, Nowgorod and Kaliningrad."
"Transport, energy, the environment and internal security are right at the top of the list of possibilities."
"Negotiations to find creative solutions as regards the future freedom of transit for the people of Kaliningrad through Lithuania and Poland should also be completed before Poland and Lithuania accede to the EU."
"Why not make the Oblast of Kaliningrad a pilot project on two counts: first in relation to the potential for economic cooperation between the Russian Federation and the EU and, secondly, to test the Russian Federation's ability to implement fundamental reforms such as rural, fiscal and administrative reforms in advance in this area with our support?"
"That is the way to bind the Russian Federation to the EU."
"Mr President, in recent years the European Union has finalised various documents relating to the Russian Federation which form a good basis for close relations with it."
"The common strategy is one of them."
"Despite all its contradictions, Europeans clearly see Russia as part of Europe and have a huge interest in a stable, democratically-organised Russian Federation with good economic prospects which plays a confident part in and helps to shape international policy."
"The West also needs the Russian Federation as an important international partner if Europe is to be reshaped after the change."
"It is this interest which has led the Union to develop specific fields of activity in numerous areas in the common strategy towards the Russian Federation and other documents."
"They include consolidating the rule of law and strengthening government institutions."
"They also include developing a civil society as an important precondition to consolidating democracy."
"In the economic sector, the Union is endeavouring to integrate the Russian Federation into a common economic and social area."
"The Union is already the Russian Federation's most important processing, investment and trading partner, accounting for over 40%."
"But there is still huge potential here."
"Experts have calculated that trade between the European Union and the Russian Federation only accounts for one-third of what might be expected, given the Russian Federation's gross national product and its proximity to EU markets."
"In the political sector, the common strategy towards the Russian Federation proposes entering into a standing dialogue on policy and security and creating a permanent mechanism for such dialogue."
"It would be interesting to expound on this, but time is too short."
"The EU sets great store in its Russian policy by environmental protection and nuclear safety."
"Unfortunately, this momentum in relations between the Russian Federation and the EU has come up against a counter force - cue Chechnya, which has seriously hampered relations."
"The substance and methods of the internal consolidation being pursued by the Putin regime will have a significant influence on the nature of our relations."
"We can only hope that the current pragmatic and realistic partnership will perhaps one day become a real strategic partnership."
"Mr President, given the economic and geopolitical importance of Russia, the European Union believes it must seek a common strategy on the subject."
"The report contains many empty phrases and, in particular, pious hopes."
"It is not just because each of the major European powers is primarily concerned with safeguarding the interests of its own capitalist groups, but in the final analysis, what does capitalist Europe have to offer Russia?"
"Economic growth?"
"Yet for the last ten years the Russian economy has done nothing but collapse."
"An end to the preponderance of queues?"
"Yet what use are more or less well stocked shops if, with unemployment, and retirement pensions and wages at a low level or not even paid, one third of the population is living below the poverty line and does not have any money to buy the goods?"
"Democracy?"
"Yet under the guise of democracy there is domination by official and unofficial mafias."
"Freedom?"
"Yet the freedom which the reintroduction of capitalism has brought Russia is freedom only for a narrow range of bureaucrats left over from the previous regime to pillage natural resources and transfer the proceeds to Western banks."
"And indeed, what does freedom mean for the Chechen people?"
"In voting against this report I wish to stress the inability of the capitalist economy and the western world to bring progress and prosperity to the peoples of the Russian Federation or indeed to the majority of peoples on this earth."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Oostlander for his sterling contribution as rapporteur."
"As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I fully support the two-strategy model which Mr Oostlander presents, involving vigorous, consistent and sustained criticism of all crimes, especially crimes within Russia against human rights, but also involving close and intimate cooperation with Russia, our large neighbour in the East."
"Recital KK in the report states the following: 'given that Russia is in a political union with Belarus, it is appropriate in the interest of Russia' s democratic legitimacy for President Putin and the Russian government to point out clearly and consistently the comprehensive need for democratic progress and reforms in Belarus, not least in the light of the report submitted by the parliamentary troika from the EU, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Minsk on 16 October 2000' ."
"I am the author of that paragraph, which has been applauded in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I should here like to highlight the value of our really emphasising the seriousness of Russia' s in actual fact being in a political union with Belarus."
"With reference to the report we presented in Minsk, we first of all emphasised that the Belarus Parliament is at present lacking in powers, cannot legislate, does not have the right of veto against Presidential decrees and cannot adopt budgets."
"Secondly, we pointed out that electoral law has disqualified a quarter of the candidates in this so-called parliamentary election in October."
"Thirdly, we discussed access to the media, which is unfairly organised in a State-controlled system."
"Fourthly, we discussed the administrative criminal law which makes it illegal to urge a boycott of elections."
"Belarus is therefore in political union with Russia."
"It is important for us to emphasise the seriousness of this for Russia too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, questions of human rights are important to us, and they are not the private affairs of any one country."
"The war in Chechnya is a case in point, and, for example, this labour legislation now under discussion will reduce employees' rights quite drastically."
"We have, however, tried a boycott policy, and that had no effect on this war."
"The twin-track strategy proposed by Mr Oostlander offers a way out, for which I thank him."
"This is the first strategy on Russia in our history."
"Multi-faceted cooperation will help to stabilise conditions in Russia."
"That will be the first step, after which attempts will be made to achieve respect for the law, which will be the second step, and then, economic development will bring more stability, all of which will bring about the features of civil society we expect."
"The result will finally be more human rights, which we all desire."
"This report thus creates the possibility for constructing a multilayer structure."
"For this reason I think it will be an important breakthrough."
"We have already laid the foundations of a period of cooperation with Russia during which the political leadership has changed."
"We uphold the criticisms, but we will not sever our contact as we did after the civil war, which was followed by Stalin' s persecutions and all the terrors."
"The Northern Dimension, which is important, will receive its own budget funds under this proposal, which is a very important issue."
"I, myself, suggest that energy should be made the driving force behind this important project, as that is something we need, that is where the money is, and since we have the money, we can also spend it on the infrastructure, on hospitals, environmental issues and so on."
"Money from energy: both sides need cooperation for that, and especially in parts of northern Russia, which I would urge Russia to turn to."
"It is peaceful there and soldiers are not needed to guard the pipeline."
"Do you intend to support a project such as this, Commissioner Patten?"
"Mr President, a few days ago, the Duma decided that the Soviet anthem would be Russia's national anthem."
"The music and words and the decision by the Duma are not overly significant."
"What is significant is that the majority of Russian citizens supported this move."
"What I want to know is why these people did not choose the Marseillaise or God save the Queen as their anthem of hope for a brave new world, preferring instead to turn the clock back to a regime which many of my fellow members have described as inhumane, criminal and so on."
"What is the significance of the ten years since Russia was suddenly catapulted into the free market and into contact with western values?"
"Do we not know what their significance is?"
"The responsibilities are, of course, mainly Russia's, both for the past and the present."
"But do the European Union, the United States and the other powers bear no responsibility?"
"This is the mafia we are talking about."
"Where does the mafia have its roots, if not within the Kremlin itself?"
"Who were Yeltsin's protectors and agents all that time?"
"Who fought tooth and nail to support Yeltsin inside Russia?"
"This is power hijacking we are talking about."
"Which banks is the money from foreign loans and/or the money hoarded inside Russia paid into?"
"Is it the Bank of Havana or the Bank of Algeria?"
"It is paid into the large western banks!"
"And how is it controlled?"
"And where are the prostitution networks operating?"
"What I am getting at is that someone must take responsibility for what has happened over the past ten years, including the European Union."
"From what certain speakers have said, the winner-takes-all model obviously applies."
"The cold-war model has been replaced by the winner-takes-all model."
"What are we afraid of?"
"Dependency on Russia?"
"Can the entire European Union, with Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and everyone else present in Nice really depend on Russia?"
"Or will we opt for mutual dependency as we do with every other large power in today's world?"
"The point at issue here is Russia's role."
"What was Russia's role when NATO was taking decisions on a neighbouring area, on the Balkans, without so much as a nod to the UN, to which Russia belongs, or to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe?"
"How come this power was not terrified?"
"What I am trying to say is that we need to change our stand: we must not feel and we must not sow the seeds of fear; we must look for a partner which needs our help and support."
"I very much welcome this report and I should like to pay tribute to Mr Oostlander for producing it."
"His report has been welcomed by all parts of Parliament except, perhaps by those who look back with nostalgia to the not-so-golden days memorialised by a very large number of brave Soviet dissidents."
"But it is an excellent report which, like the common strategy itself, underlines the importance that we attach to the relationship - the strategic partnership - between the European Union and Russia."
"The report endorses what is being called our ""double track strategy"" towards Russia, a strategy that combines plain speaking on issues like Chechnya - to which I will return in a few moments - with a continuing effort to build an effective relationship based on shared values and cooperation."
"The common strategy and Russia's medium-term strategy for relations with the EU have created a new dynamism."
"The common strategy identified initiatives in foreign policy, security and the fight against crime."
"Other areas where we seek to bolster European Union cooperative efforts towards Russia are the rule of law and democracy building, civil society, twinnings as well as regional and cross-border cooperation and, above all, the Northern Dimension Initiative, to which a number of Members referred."
"We strongly support the Russian Government's economic reform programme which is vital to improve the investment climate."
"In this context, as Parliament will know, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi launched a far-reaching dialogue on energy."
"These are all areas in which the Commission has a powerful contribution to make, as the report repeatedly makes clear."
"Our technical assistance programme - in particular Tacis - already responds to many of the priorities identified by this report."
"The core Tacis Programme, worth EUR 34 million, focuses on education, the rule of law, democracy and civil society development, including regional media freedom, protection of individual rights and support to self-government."
"The subsequent action programme - to a value of EUR 58 million - focuses on institution-building, on the rule of law in the economic field and on improvements to the business and investment climate."
"The honourable Member's report rightly stresses the need for our Moscow delegation to play a bigger part in the management of our financial assistance, and I am determined to see significant progress in this direction as part of our wider reform of European Union external aid programmes."
"The report comments on the Northern Dimension."
"We too see this as an important mechanism for regional cooperation for the development of the north-west Russian regions as well as Kaliningrad."
"I am anxious to work closely with the incoming Swedish presidency to make concrete progress on the Northern Dimension."
"This means concentrating our efforts on key areas like the environment - which has been referred to by a number of Members - and nuclear safety, on Kaliningrad itself and on improving coordination between different sources of funding."
"We are acutely aware of the urgent need to tackle environmental threats from nuclear storage facilities and rusting decommissioned submarines, especially in the north-west part of Russia, for example, around the Kola Peninsula."
"This is a formidable task."
"It requires a combined international and Russian effort."
"The Commission has taken a leading role in the negotiation of an international agreement establishing the multilateral nuclear environment programme for Russia."
"Those negotiations are now at a key stage and we hope for significant progress by March 2001."
"There is also a pressing need to raise environmental awareness in Russia."
"This is exactly the objective of the environmental work programme for the Russian Federation, initialled last June in the framework of our partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Just a word on Kaliningrad: the partnership and cooperation agreement already offers an institutional framework for our dialogue with Russia on trade, visa and border issues."
"At the same time the development of the region has already benefited from Tacis projects amounting to about EUR 30 million since 1991."
"We are now finalising a communication to the Council on Kaliningrad."
"We are in the process of opening an office in Kaliningrad."
"I very much hope to visit Kaliningrad myself in the early part of next year, and not just because Immanuel Kant spent the whole of his life there."
"It is a serious issue that we need to address as part of the Northern Dimension."
"In all of the areas I have outlined we are working closely with Russia to our mutual benefit."
"We are working to strengthen Russian democracy, reinforce the rule of law and transform the Russian economy."
"That is all to the good, but there remains one serious impediment to further improvements in the ties between Russia and the European Union: I refer, of course, to Chechnya."
"At the last European Union Russian Summit in October, President Putin acknowledged the urgent need for a political solution to the conflict."
"I have to say to honourable Members - and I will abbreviate what I might have said at much greater length - we are profoundly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Chechnya."
"We are concerned about the continuing reports of human rights abuses, for example from NGOs like M√©decins sans Fronti√®res and Human Rights Watch."
"We hope that we will be able to make a great deal more progress with the Russian authorities in addressing those issues in the months ahead."
"We are profoundly concerned about the likely fate of thousands of refugees in Ingushetiya and Chechnya this coming winter."
"It is because we take our relationship with Russia so seriously that these issues matter."
"They cannot just be brushed under the carpet."
"We have to return to them again and again, but we must also continue, as the honourable gentleman's report wisely recognises, to engage with Russia."
"We must avoid the mistake to which an honourable gentleman referred earlier, which was made at the start of the last century, when Russia was effectively excluded from European affairs after the Leninist revolution in 1917 with disastrous consequences."
"We shall therefore persevere with the common strategy to build on the progress achieved to heed many of the points raised in the honourable gentleman's report, and above all to strengthen the hands of the Russian Federation."
"Just one further word about a point that was raised by a couple of speakers in the debate - and that is the question of Georgia and visas."
"We have already expressed serious concern over the way in which Russia unilaterally introduced visa requirements for Georgian citizens on 5 December."
"The entire international community, not excluding Russia, is committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the independent states."
"Actions by any country in the region which could have the effect of undermining that sovereignty carry significant implications."
"If more favourable visa requirements are applied to the inhabitants of secessionist regions or if they are exempted altogether, this would imply support for the legitimacy of their regimes."
"Georgia is a member of the United Nations, a member of the OSCE, a member of the Council of Europe, and it has a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union."
"It deserves our support."
"We call upon the states of the region to use the OSCE mechanisms to resolve their disputes quickly before real damage can be caused."
"I congratulate the honourable gentleman once again on an extremely good report on a very important issue, to which I am sure we will return in this Parliament over the next few years again and again."
"The honourable gentleman has given us a very important and useful political and intellectual infrastructure for our future discussions."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0559/2000)."
"Question No 1 by (H-0864/00):"
"Subject: Genetically modified organisms and crops Since the Spring of this year there have been many cases of the release into the environment in various EU countries of genetically modified organisms and crops, namely cotton, oil seed rape and maize."
"In some cases measures have been taken, but not in others, and in certain instances no official announcements or findings have been made."
"It should be pointed out that in many cases Directive 90/220/EEC has clearly been repeatedly breached."
"What action does the Council intend to take to address these problems and, in particular, what position does it intend to adopt in the short and longer term?"
"As you know, the Council adopted a common position on the revision of Directive 90/220/EC."
"The new text provides for much stricter conditions on the use and marketing of genetically modified organisms."
"The Commission considers that once this new directive has come into force, it will make it possible to improve the current situation."
"The Council, meanwhile, wishes to see this directive adopted rapidly in order to provide a stricter framework for the introduction of new GMOs onto European Union territory."
"The Council also wishes to point out that it is in fact up to the Commission to monitor the implementation of Community legislation."
"In transposing the directive into their national legislation, Member States will have to ensure that the directive in question is properly implemented and will have to send the Commission a brief factual report at each year end on the monitoring of the use of all products placed on the market, in compliance with Article 18 of the directive."
"Moreover, the Member States and the Commission meet regularly in order to exchange information on experience gained in the area of risk prevention related to the spread of GMOs in the environment."
"Finally, at the Internal Market, Consumers and Tourism Council on 30 November 2000, the Commission presented an information report on the labelling and traceability of GMOs."
"The Council will examine the Commission proposals at the Environment Council on 18 and 19 December."
"Thank you very much, Minister, for your answer."
"The question was as follows: there have been cases where this directive has been breached and GMOs have been released into the environment."
"I gave examples in my question."
"You are placing me in a very difficult position."
"It is the task of the Commission to ensure that the directive is adhered to."
"It has probably not done so or has done so inefficiently, I do not know."
"It is the task of Member States to implement the directive, transposing it into their national legislation."
"In the case in question, the Member State has not done so."
"I should like to think this was an oversight."
"In Greece, we have been told, in the case of modified cotton, that it would be exported."
"The Commission' s answer to a question similar to the one I have asked was that farmers were to be compensated and that the genetically modified cotton was to be exported."
"Will the Council be able to help me out of this difficult position?"
"To whom should I turn for information?"
"Is it really legal to export this type of material?"
"I still find it hard to believe, Minister, and I should like an answer."
"I would remind you that the Council has determined its common position on this proposal and that conciliation therefore is drawing to a close."
"The entire procedure should be concluded by 4 January 2001 at the latest."
"This common position sets much more stringent requirements for the Member States."
"I therefore believe that this is where you will find an answer to your questions."
"Mr Papayannakis, I have given you all the information I have."
"Could the President-in-Office agree that there can be substantial benefits for the environment, human health, developing countries and European science and business from GMO crops?"
"Is there a risk that Europe could miss out on the benefits if we respond to hysteria rather than to scientific fact?"
"The Lisbon Summit declared that the European Union was to be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world."
"Is the Council prepared to give a lead by championing the biotech industry with a faster rate of field trials and product approvals by the Member States?"
"I fear that you are taking us into a fundamental debate which we do not have time to go into here and now."
"I believe we must assess both the scope and the limitations of any scientific progress."
"Mr President, this debate is already overdue because the BSE crisis has huge implications for feedingstuffs, both home-grown and imported."
"We currently have a ban on animal and bone meal, which is why we need to find a clear position here. It is because of the BSE crisis that we are pressed for time."
"When, do you think, we shall be able to say that we can supply 100% non-genetically modified feedingstuffs in Europe?"
"Will this label be available shortly so that consumers can rely on there being a supply of 100% non-genetically modified feedingstuffs?"
"I must answer the honourable Member in the same way that I answered the previous questioner."
"This is a debate which needs to take place, but I think that Question Time is not the right place for it."
"This is quite unsatisfactory."
"That is what Question Time is about!"
"We have a question, we are entitled to ask a supplementary question and we certainly expect to have a proper response from the Council of Ministers."
"That is why we have come here."
"Mr President, I hope you will remonstrate with the Council."
"I should at least like to respond to the honourable Member' s lack of satisfaction, so that these remarks may be entered in the Minutes, as I cannot allow him to get away with saying something as unfair as that."
"We are involved in a highly regimented procedure here: the Council is required to give answers to a great many extremely specific questions in a very short period of time and there is, I believe, no one here who would claim to be able to expand upon extremely complex social issues in just one minute."
"It would be both unwise and foolish for the Council to attempt to do so."
"I am therefore perfectly willing to propose that such a debate be held, on condition that the most appropriate forum is chosen."
"I feel that it would be irresponsible of me to give impromptu answers regarding GMOs in only a minute, and that would not be in keeping with the policy of this presidency."
"Question No 2 by (H-0871/00):"
"Subject: Situation in Chechnya How does the Council assess the present situation in Chechnya, and what efforts has it made in the last six months to try to stop the bloodshed?"
"The Council continues to be deeply concerned by the situation in Chechnya, where violence continues and the humanitarian situation continues to be very worrying at the onset of winter."
"For the moment there are no signs of a political settlement to the conflict."
"The Council has expressed its concern at many meetings with Russia at all levels, particularly seeking to induce Russia to avoid the excessive use of force and to avoid any extension of the conflict, to carry out independent and efficient inquiries into human rights violations, to support the OSCE Assistance Group in fulfilling its mission and, finally, to ensure that humanitarian aid is distributed properly."
"In particular, the Council has pointed out that only a political solution could bring this crisis to an end."
"At the last EU-Russian Summit on 30 October 2000 in Paris, the matter was raised by both presidents."
"Mr Putin agreed that there was an urgent need to find a solution of this kind."
"For the first time, Russia accepted wording to this effect in the joint declaration issued following the summit."
"In this context, while remaining resolutely opposed to talks with what he refers to as ""terrorists"" , Mr Putin has indicated the need to distinguish between terrorists and those who have fought in good faith for Chechen independence."
"Indeed, Mr Putin has stated that the Assistance Group may in the near future return to Chechnya."
"I would point out that this has not yet come about."
"Mr President, two brief supplementary questions."
"First: did the Council contact President Maskhadov, who was democratically elected under the supervision of the OSCE, and other forces of democracy in Chechnya in a bid to find a peaceful solution?"
"Secondly: has the Council obtained information from the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented locally?"
"I do not have information exact enough to enable me to answer your supplementary question."
"All I can say is that we shall continue to liase closely with the Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we in Parliament have tried in vain to urge Mr Nielson, the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian matters, to visit Chechnya, not just for the sake of an official visit but to carry out a serious survey of the humanitarian situation."
"We have not succeeded in convincing him."
"Could the French Presidency take the baton from us and contact Mr Nielson, urging him to go to Chechnya in the near future?"
"The Commission will, naturally, be informed of the content of our debates."
"Mr President, a point of order: it is standard practice in the House for questions which cannot be adequately answered orally to be submitted in writing."
"I would ask the President-in-Office to at least answer our questions in writing if he cannot do so orally."
"As you know, we are studying ways of reorganising our work."
"One of the points covered by the document presented by Vice-President Provan is the form to be taken by Question Time to the Council and the Commission."
"Effectively, we have noted that Council, Commission and Members of Parliament have all been somewhat dissatisfied on several occasions."
"Therefore, if the Council so wishes, it can reply in writing, as you request."
"However, it must be borne in mind that it is, in effect, sometimes impossible, sometimes difficult and rarely a simple matter to reply to supplementary questions."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that it was standard practice under the other presidencies to give a precise answer to a supplementary question."
"The President-in-Office must know if he met Mr Maskhadov or not."
"How can he say he does not have any precise information?"
"I would like to state that I am in complete agreement with what the chairman said just now."
"This Question Time is clearly not satisfactory."
"I have attended the European Parliament on many occasions and have been involved in all sorts of very interesting procedures."
"This is not one of them. You can see for yourselves that the Chamber is far from full."
"There are perhaps a dozen people here."
"I say that this is not satisfactory either for the Council or for Parliament."
"Please do not get agitated."
"(Interruption by Mr Posselt)"
"Please, that is enough; this is really a trivial issue."
"I am simply trying to present a procedural issue. Indeed this is something about which I have written to your President, Nicole Fontaine, and she agrees with me."
"I feel that the procedure must be reformed in a quite simple way to enable Members of Parliament to receive more specific answers on subjects which must be better organised."
"The Council Presidency, sir, is not a government or a single person, but a country working together with the departments of the general secretariat of the Council, and here we give you the precise answers which we have to precise questions."
"If you are going to indulge in filibustering, then it is going to take hours."
"The procedure must therefore be amended or reformed."
"This is something I must stress and, sir, it has nothing to do with totally misplaced value judgements."
"Question No 3 by (H-0876/00):"
"Subject: Council's position on the problems linked with alcohol shipments subject to excise duty This serious issue is a problem in many Member States (Belgium, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy)."
"What improvements does the Council intend to make to the basic directive, 92/12/EEC, to ensure that the shipper' s and recipient' s responsibilities are precisely apportioned, precluding any possibility of fraud?"
"What is the Council' s opinion of the possibility of eliminating this serious problem through computerised monitoring operated by customs authorities in the dispatching country and in the country of arrival or transit? Could this possible solution be put into practice very rapidly, in view of the fact that the Commission has shown particular interest in solving the problem through proposals and high-level groups, and is clearly ready to take firm action in this area?"
"The Council would remind the honourable Member of the conclusions adopted at the Council meeting of 19 May 1998 regarding fraud in the alcohol and tobacco industries."
"On that occasion, it stressed the need for Members States and the Commission to tackle fraud in the area of excise duty on alcohol and tobacco."
"It also approved the summary of the report from the high-level group on fraud in the alcohol and tobacco sector."
"Finally, it stressed the importance, subject to the results of a feasibility study proposed by the Commission, of a computer-based monitoring system as a long-term objective."
"The Council also undertook to make provision, in the meantime, for the immediate implementation of an efficient selective early warning system."
"Since then, the Commission has worked to achieve this."
"The Council urges the honourable Member to address that institution on the subject directly, in order to ascertain the details of the above-mentioned measures and the state of progress in implementing them."
"Mr President, I think the question was quite specific."
"The Member in question, that is yours truly, did attempt to approach the Commission, which informally provided him with information regarding a situation which could be described as a deadlock."
"This directive dates from 1992."
"The problem is well-known - common knowledge in fact - and it is part of the more serious issue of tax evasion, to which we are all extremely sensitive, but it is also extremely damaging to the firms which have no way of coordinating or monitoring it at all."
"This is why I have had to approach the Council."
"I now take note of the fact that you have spoken of an undertaking."
"As a supplementary question, I would like to ask whether you are in any way able to forecast your action, seeing as the Commission appears to be ready and willing whereas, if I am not mistaken, there seems to be some reticence or disagreement within the Council."
"I would be extremely happy if you could dispel this doubt, for I am sure that all will then proceed very quickly."
"I can give you the Council position, which is that, in general, the current situation regarding fraud in the area of both indirect and direct taxes and the possibility of stepping up administrative cooperation in these areas were discussed quite recently at the Ecofin Council meeting of 5 June 2000."
"On this occasion, a report from an ad hoc group on combating tax fraud commissioned by Coreper on 8 September 1999 was referred to the Council."
"This report shows, as you quite rightly state, that tax fraud within the Community has reached worrying levels."
"All the Member States have confirmed their determination to intensify the fight against fraud both internally and in their relations with others."
"The Council has asked the Commission to present at the earliest possible opportunity proposals based on all the recommendations which met with unanimous agreement in the course of the work of the ad hoc group."
"This also refers to measures which might be undertaken in order to solve the specific problems of excise fraud."
"This is the context in which I informed you that, without my being aware of any particular disagreement, the Commission has worked to this end and I think you might therefore safely ask questions of the Commission without fear of any divergence of opinions with the Council."
"Are you under the impression that the Member States now have the means to achieve the objectives?"
"I tend to feel that we need to put a lot more Community power behind the fight against fraud, and I think that the coordination between the Member States has failed to come up with the goods so far."
"Will the new measures do the trick?"
"You are right, the fight against fraud is never sufficiently well developed."
"As you know, over the years we have set up various instruments which are starting to work, but I quite agree that this is a fight which we must wage ceaselessly."
"This is what we should be striving for."
"Question No 4 by (H-0881/00):"
"Subject: Increased carrier's liability The French Presidency has proposed in Council that carrier's liability be increased."
"This would mean that a carrier, for example an airline, would be penalised if it brought persons without valid visa or identity papers into the EU."
"In many Member States carrier's liability requires the carrier to arrange or pay for immediate return of the persons concerned, combined in some countries with fines."
"The Presidency now wishes to introduce mandatory fines."
"Carrier's liability is an effective method of preventing asylum seekers from reaching the EU."
"Many refugees with grounds for seeking asylum cannot obtain the passports or visas required for entry into the EU."
"Carrier's liability means that their requests for asylum cannot be examined in the EU."
"Instead they are dealt with by airline, airport and other transport staff."
"Does the Council consider that the latter are competent in practice to decide the future of asylum seekers?"
"The proposal the honourable Member refers to is an initiative from the French Presidency with a view to the adoption of a Council directive on the harmonisation of financial penalties imposed on carriers transporting third country nationals to Member States' territory without the necessary documents for entry."
"This text, which was presented to the European Parliament for consultation on 6 September 2000, is currently being examined by the competent Council bodies."
"The aim of this initiative is to implement a European-wide coherent policy against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings, which is a real scourge."
"Increasing carrier liability is one of the essential aspects of this."
"Moreover the proposed directive introduces a minimum instrument common to all Member States regarding carrier liability, setting requirements for checks to be carried out by carriers and harmonising the penalties currently laid down by Member States."
"It is not a matter of establishing new penalties against carriers but rather of harmonising those already provided for under the terms of the Schengen Convention."
"I should like to draw the honourable Member' s attention to the fact that recital 3 of the draft directive does indeed stipulate that application thereof shall not be prejudicial to the commitments arising under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967."
"The European Union has, on many occasions, stated its absolute respect for the right of asylum."
"This has to be reconciled with effective action to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings."
"This is imperative and is something that was explicitly called for at the Feira European Council following the tragic events in Dover."
"Mr President, I want to thank the French minister for his answer."
"I nonetheless believe that the proposal tabled by the French Presidency is completely unacceptable and that it really has only one aim, namely to keep asylum seekers out of the EU, something which may in practice lead to an increase in illegal immigration."
"It is also the case that it is not only refugees under the Geneva Convention who may be granted asylum but also significantly larger groups."
"These groups are obviously not excluded under the new proposal."
"I also asked a specific question concerning the powers of airline and airport employees to make actual decisions on asylum matters."
"If it is true that those who are regarded as refugees under the Geneva Convention are to be excluded, what actual powers do check-in staff at an airport in Istanbul possess to decide a refugee' s fate, for that is what this issue is about."
"I think it is a very relevant question because the fate of refugees is being placed in the hands of, for example, airline and airport staff."
"In my opinion, such staff are not competent and are lacking in training in this area, and it is therefore basically irresponsible to give them this power."
"That is more a statement of opinion than a question."
"I would repeat that we are bound to take effective action against this scourge which has given rise to tragic events, and we must do so while ensuring that the European Union continues to respect the right of asylum entirely. Let me stress that: absolute respect."
"Individual countries may have problems."
"We are working on that."
"It is up to that country to voice its concerns."
"This is, however, I believe, the road we must take."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I should like to ask the following supplementary question. How major and extensive does the Council consider this problem to be, and how seriously does the Council view the fact that transport companies organise travel to the EU for persons without valid visa and identity papers?"
"That is precisely the question which I was attempting to answer. Let me repeat that it is a subject of the utmost, the very utmost gravity."
"Question No 5 by (H-0882/00):"
"Subject: Everything but arms proposal Is the Council content that this proposal from the Commission - which may well have dire consequences for already hard-pressed sugar beet farmers in the European Union - should be passed without any consultation of the directly-elected European Parliament?"
"The proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) 2820/98 so as to extend duty-free access without any quantitative restrictions to products originating in the least-developed countries, which the Commission put forward recently, is the result of Community initiatives to improve market access for the least developed countries."
"In this respect, the ACP-EC partnership agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000 stipulates that the European Community shall by 2005, at the latest, allow duty free access for essentially all products from all LDCs."
"In view of the ongoing reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar, rice and bananas, the Commission proposal stipulates that market access for such countries will be gradually liberalised over a period of three years from January 2001."
"The proposal provides for granting products from LDCs duty free access, amending the generalised tariff preference scheme currently implemented by the Community."
"Insofar as this proposal relates to common trade policy, it is covered by Article 133 of the Treaty, which does not call for the European Parliament to be consulted."
"I can assure you, nonetheless, that the Council is examining this proposal with a great deal of interest, and is in particular looking into the potential implications for Community producers of the proposed duty free access and into whether this proposal is consistent with ongoing plans to reform the common organisation of the market in certain industries such as sugar, for example."
"Last month when I asked a supplementary question in Question Time, this President-in-Office simply avoided giving me a supplementary by saying: ""I can only repeat my previous answer"" and reading out the previous answer again."
"This time I will give him a chance not to read out the previous answer but ask him for an undertaking and an agreement."
"Does the President-in-Office agree that there should be no decision made on this proposal until there has been a full impact assessment of the effect on the Union, the ACP countries and the LDC countries?"
"Yes or no?"
"The Presidency and a number of Member States have already received various letters from the Comit√© europ√©en des fabricants de sucre (European Committee of Sugar Manufacturers) regarding the Commission' s proposals, which they will take into account in their deliberations."
"The real impact of the duty free access proposed for European producers will be a key factor in the Council' s final decision."
"I should like to repeat a question which I asked Mr Moscovici last week in plenary."
"Perhaps he had too many questions to deal with to be able to answer me then."
"Perhaps you could answer me in these more intimate surroundings this evening."
"It is about the role of the European Parliament's in-trade policy, which is the spirit of Mr Newton Dunn's question."
"Do you think that it will be possible for you, me or anybody in Europe to advocate greater transparency and accountability in the WTO in-trade policy as long as this place has no formal and serious role in scrutinising and vetting trade policy decisions taken by the Council of Ministers and the European Commission?"
"To cite my dear friend, Mr Newton Dunn, perhaps the best way to answer this is: yes or no."
"I should just like to make you see, on this, my last visit here, what the point of this exercise actually is."
"The Presidency is not here to express the opinions of any given individual or any given government but rather to state what the position of the Council is at any moment 'x' or time 't' ."
"So, while I may have my own personal opinions as a political leader - and I do have opinions on the subject, believe me - I shall confine myself to expressing the Council' s current position."
"You mentioned the Cotonou Agreement."
"Are you aware that the Cotonou Agreement also expresses a commitment to undertaking impact studies which might affect non-LDC countries as well as to have consultation?"
"Neither of those two things has happened."
"It is not good enough to have consultation after the events."
"Are you aware that apart from sugar producers in Europe, concerns are being expressed, especially by countries that are commodity-dependent - particularly in the Caribbean - on sugar, bananas and rice, as you have mentioned?"
"I can assure all the Members of the European Parliament who have asked me questions that the Council will take their comments into consideration."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following two questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):"
"Subject: Measures for the prevention of mad cow disease Has the Council looked into the possibility of a temporary blanket ban on the use of meat and bone meal, with a view to preventing the spread of mad cow disease?"
"What measures will it be proposing in the immediate future for those countries which have been declared high-risk?"
"and"
"Question No 7 by (H-0932/00):"
"Subject: Immediate danger from bovine spongiform encephalopathy The continuing cases of 'mad cow' disease have made consumers, as well as livestock producers, extremely worried."
"The decisions taken by the recent Agriculture Council enraged the citizens of the Member States, whose health is being jeopardised by continuing consumption of meat that is unfit to eat."
"When does the Council intend to take effective measures to protect consumer health by changing organisational methods and development conditions for livestock rearing, through the use of livestock feed containing protein of plant origin, such as legumes, through radical reform of the CAP, a ban on beef exports from France and any other countries where a similar problem appears, universal inspection of cattle and a ban on the production and use of meat meals for feeding ruminants?"
"The Council wishes to point out that its policy is always to afford consumers the highest possible level of protection."
"In particular it has sought, by means of its recent decisions, to ensure that the meat available to consumers is guaranteed to the maximum in this respect, especially by means of its decision with a view to guaranteeing the improved traceability of the origin of meat and elimination from the food chain of a list of specified at-risk materials, which now includes bovine intestines."
"As a precautionary measure and in order to eliminate risks of cross-contamination, the Council has decided to suspend, as of 1 January 2001, the use of meat meals in feedingstuffs for production animals."
"Finally, non-tested animals aged above thirty months may no longer enter the food chain."
"A purchase and destruction system is to be set up for such non-tested bovine animals, in order to compensate livestock farmers at the market price."
"The Council considers that this package of measures should make it possible to avoid the risk which the honourable Members have decried."
"Regarding the method of organisation and the criteria for the development of livestock farming, the Council would point out that, in the context of its decisions taken under the Agenda 2000 reform, emphasis has been placed on greater incentives for extensive production, particularly by means of bonuses."
"Furthermore, on 4 December 2000, the Council noted the Commission statements on the cultivation of protein-rich crops and called upon this institution to look more deeply into this matter in the near future and to draw conclusions with reference to current policy in this sector and with regard to set-aside, including, if necessary, by presenting appropriate proposals."
"The Council' s objective in all these decisions is to restore consumer confidence within the European Union."
"However, in consideration of the need to uphold the principles governing the internal market, it aims to favour Community-wide measures over measures concerning specific Member States."
"First of all I have to say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet answered Mr Korakas' question."
"Secondly, and with regard to my specific question, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council very much for his answer."
"I think that the Council has been bold and has been quick to take some important measures."
"However, we are faced with the very serious problem of the failure to comply with the measures agreed."
"The Council knows that in 1989, both the production of feed with animal proteins for feeding ruminants in the United Kingdom and for the production of meat meals were banned."
"This indicates that the measures that we adopted at the time were good and have guarantees."
"But our problem is that they are not applied, that there is fraud in fulfilling them."
"I would therefore like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if the Council of Ministers is going to give guarantees that the Community rules will be complied with, if it is going to give guarantees that the existing measures banning meat meals are going to be complied with."
"Which inspectors are going to deal with it?"
"What checks are going to be made?"
"Is this a concern that has been latent in the Council of Ministers?"
"Answer me please, specifically: what food safety guarantees are going to be given that all these measures are to be applied?"
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I have outlined the decisions that the Council has taken."
"As you yourself stated, these are bold decisions of recent date, the latest of these being from 4 December, that is a week ago."
"The French Presidency has, from the very outset, been concerned to bring about a European response to this crisis, which is a crisis in terms of foodstuffs, society and health."
"Right up to the end, the presidency has stressed and urged that measures be taken, and you may be sure that when France resumes its position as a simple member of the European Union at the end of the presidency, it will continue to stress that this must be done."
"At any event there is now, I believe, a general increase in awareness throughout Europe which will enable whatever measures necessary to be taken in order to combat this disease."
"I wanted to ask if there has been an evaluation of the measures that have been taken."
"I tend to feel that if drastic measures had been taken earlier, we would not be facing such a disastrous situation now."
"Is that how the Council sees it?"
"As you know, we continually act according to the latest state of our knowledge, and so I cannot completely endorse this analysis. I believe, moreover, that we should improve our knowledge, and that is also the point of establishing a European food safety authority, on which the Nice European Council took a decision in principle at last week' s meeting."
"This authority must now be set up, and I think the European authorities have now become very aware of the issue, and that we must forge ahead."
"Mrs Maes, I am told - for none of us knows the Rules of Procedures off by heart - that you were not entitled to ask this second question because the Members are only entitled to ask one supplementary question during Question Time."
"As the author is not present, Question No 8 by Mrs McKenna lapses."
"My understanding is that the services were told two days ago that I would be taking over the question for Mrs McKenna because we knew then that she would have to go back to Dublin on urgent business."
"I have not been informed of this by any of the assistants and I cannot accept the proposal made now."
"Question No 9 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0890/00):"
"Subject: Algerian ban on WAFA party"
"The international press reports that the Algerian Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Yazid Zerhouni, refuses - in violation of the procedures provided in law for setting up political associations and parties - to recognise the WAFA party led by the former minister, Ahmed Taleb, which has been set up in full compliance with current legislation."
"This party, which aims to reconcile Islam and the modern world and which could make a significant contribution towards reviving the country's ailing democracy and, therefore, strengthening the rule of law, finds itself subjected to a ban on the well-worn pretext that it would represent 'a threat to State security'."
"What initiatives has the Council taken, or will it take, to persuade the Algerian authorities to respect their own laws and thereby also promote the revival of democratic debate and the political process, thus enabling Algeria to emerge from the serious crisis in which it finds itself?"
"Under the Barcelona process, Algeria endorsed a number of principles including respect for the rule of law."
"The Presidency Conclusions adopted at the end of the fourth Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles on 15 and 16 November 2000 explicitly mention the need to boost political dialogue among the 27 members, including at ministerial level, particularly on the following subjects: the process of consolidating the rule of law and respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"The bilateral political dialogue which the European Union is conducting with Algeria does indeed focus on the objectives you stressed in your question, i.e. restoring debate and a democratic political dynamic."
"In fact, three years ago, the European Union initiated this kind of political dialogue at ministerial level on the basis of specific guidelines: firstly, condemnation of violence and terrorism, solidarity with the Algerian people, the need for the Algerian authorities to undertake political and economic reforms, the need for dialogue between the government and the opposition, the European Union' s goodwill with regard to developing relations and cooperation with Algeria, and, finally, the wish to see an open comprehensive political process implemented in Algeria."
"These are the initiatives which the Council has taken or intends to take with regard to the Algerian authorities."
"I can assure you that the European Union intends to continue and step up its political dialogue with the Algerian authorities, especially involving the ministerial troika."
"Has the Presidency representative, in this instance the French Ambassador to Algeria, actually met Mr Ahmed Taleb?"
"Have either the French Ambassador or other Council leaders initiated talks with the Algerian authorities in order to ascertain how they might get around this situation?"
"According to the information I have, I just wish to state that the European Union did indeed initiate political dialogue at ministerial level in 1997 and that, in principle, the French Presidency is to have a meeting between the troika of ministers and Algeria, but as yet no date has been set."
"As far as I know, the Council has never so far discussed the matter of refusal to recognise the WAFA party or issued any statement."
"I am told that it was noted within the working party that this measure indicated a power struggle within the Algerian administration."
"As you can see, I do not have any inside information or, unfortunately, any more specific information."
"I, or rather the Council, will answer your second question in writing."
"Question No 10 by (H-0892/00):"
"Subject: UN special session on children The UN General Assembly's Special Session on Children, in September 2001, will discuss the situation of children world-wide, and consider adopting a new plan of action to make children's rights a reality across the world."
"Would the Council outline its policy priorities for the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children?"
"Does the Council intend to consult widely with civil society organisations, as requested by the UN Secretary-General, in the setting of its future policy priorities for children, both within the European Union and in the developing world?"
". (FR) I have already had the opportunity, a few weeks ago, to express my comments to you on the preparations for the UN General Assembly Special Session devoted to reviewing the results of the World Summit for Children which is to take place in September 2001."
"At that time I stressed the importance of preparing thoroughly for this event and the truly fundamental role which the European Union should play in these preparations."
"Consequently, on 20 November 2000 last, on the anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ministers of the Members States with responsibility for matters relating to children and a Commission representative met in Paris and adopted shared commitments which will contribute to enhancing European Union action in making preparations for this special session."
"I should like to answer your first question and inform you of the political priorities we identified as part of our preparations."
"The chief objective of the special session will be to renew the international community' s commitments to children' s rights and children' s welfare."
"To this end, an assessment of the last ten years must be made with regard to the commitments and objectives set at the World Summit. The commitments expressed in the Millennium Declaration, which complement the World Summit, should also be taken fully into account."
"These commitments concern access to education, reducing maternal mortality and under-five child mortality, and combating transmissible diseases, especially AIDS."
"As regards your second question, the Council is in complete agreement with the point of view of the General Secretary of the United Nations that all the institutions concerned and also experts, research bodies or academic institutions which have a special interest in children' s issues should be involved in this exercise."
"The involvement of non-governmental organisations in the preparatory process and in the special session would seem to us to be a basic condition to making this meeting a real success."
"We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001."
"We are in constant liaison with the representatives of the non-governmental organisations, including by means of seminars."
"In the course of such exchanges, we have benefited from their experience and their commitment to children."
"We can congratulate the French presidency on taking this initiative to prepare for the UN special session."
"You obviously have made a commitment to involving civil society."
"Will you also make a commitment to actually consulting children, since the events involve them?"
"I hope that their views will also be sought in the months ahead."
"Secondly, it is also the case that while many Member States are very active on the issue of children's rights it is actually much more difficult in a European Union context to be as proactive."
"What progress do you think we might make in securing a legal base for the European Union's work with children and the promotion of children's rights?"
". (FR) Indeed, Mrs Kinnock, Sweden is also going to organise a conference on refugee children in Stockholm in the spring of 2001."
"Question No 11 by (H-0894/00):"
"Subject: Turkey's obligations under EU-Turkey partnership arrangements In its proposal regarding partnership arrangements between the EU and Turkey, the Commission indicates that the European Council is to re-examine the situation regarding unresolved differences, particularly with regard to their impact on accession procedures, so as to help ensure that they can be resolved within the International Court of Justice before the end of 2004 at the latest."
"In its own resolution (A5-0297/2000, Minutes of European Parliament Sittings of 15 November 2000), the European Parliament also points out that the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in 'Lo√Øzidou v Turkey' (No. 15318/89) has not yet been implemented and calls on the Turkish Government to comply with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights."
"Does the Council intend to include in provisions regarding partnership arrangements stipulations regarding acceptance by Turkey of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague and compliance by Turkey with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, in accordance with the unanimous wishes of the Council of Europe?"
"Yes, political agreement was reached within the General Affairs Council regarding the text of the accession partnership agreement for Turkey and on the framework regulation which defines its principles and conditions."
"The Presidency is very pleased with this result, which marks a significant stage in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy for Turkey defined last year in Helsinki."
"The Council has not radically changed the initial Commission proposal as adopted by the Commission on 8 November 2000."
"There have just been some amendments to the priorities relating to political criteria and to reinforced political dialogue."
"Regarding the reference to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, there has been no change to the Commission proposal."
"The partnership agreement contains a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In addition, it stresses the need to enhance the legal avenues for remedying human rights violations."
"It moreover stresses the importance it attaches to improving the judicial apparatus and the training of Turkish magistrates, particularly in the field of human rights."
"Regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes, the text of the accession partnership agreement points out, in accordance with the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, that this issue is an important matter, to be dealt with in the context of the political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey."
"Like the other candidate countries, Turkey must make every effort to resolve any outstanding border disputes."
"I thank the Minister for his reply."
"This question was submitted while the issue of the partnership was still pending."
"I appreciate how tiring the past days must have been and I shall therefore focus my second question on the subject of the Lo√Øzidou case, i.e. the judgment against Turkey by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in the matter of the seizure of the property of Greek Cypriots in the occupied section of the island."
"The Lo√Øzidou case has already given rise to two judgements against Turkey."
"Does the Council intend to discuss this issue with the Turkish Government within the context of this partnership which you have referred to?"
". (FR) I have quite simply pointed out, Mr Alavanos, the general and specific conditions under which this accession partnership agreement was adopted."
"This is the context in which negotiations with the candidate country will be going ahead. We have accepted its candidacy and now we have specific requirements and expectations of that country."
"As the author is not present, Question No 12 by Mrs Karamanou lapses."
"Question No 13 by (H-0897/00):"
"Subject: Fundamental rights and justice With reference to Mr Moscovici' s answer to my question and supplementary question of 14 November (H-0854/00), it remains entirely obscure why the Council thinks that the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments will in itself do anything to secure due fulfilment of the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, now repeated in Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter."
"I refer to guarantees such as the right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance of one' s own choosing or, if one has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; to have the free assistance of an interpreter if one cannot understand or speak the language used in court; right to trial within a reasonable time, or to release pending trial."
"With regard to individual cases such as those mentioned in my supplementary question, how can the Council claim that a process of mutual recognition will of itself make any improvement at all?"
". (FR) As the Council has emphasised to the honourable Member in the previous answer, the process of the mutual recognition of judgements will afford better protection of individuals' rights."
"The mutual recognition of judgements will in fact make it possible to better guarantee personal security as it will facilitate the fight against crime on European Union territory by improving judicial cooperation."
"In the long term, the conduct of inquiries and the prosecution of offences will cease to suffer from the limitations due to the diversity of national legal systems."
"Next, mutual recognition affords improved legal safety within the European Union in that as it ensures that a judgement pronounced in one State will not be called into question in another Member State."
"This is application of the non bis in idem principle: the same case may not be retried, final judgements cannot be called into question."
"This is a very important aspect of the protection of individuals."
"It seems to me, with great respect, President, that the Council has yet again failed or refused to address the particular problem which I asked it to address."
"Last time Council might have claimed it lacked notice of that question."
"This time I put essentially the same point for the second time in one month and hope for some kind of an answer."
"Citizens of this Union are detained pending trial for totally unacceptable periods of time, their detention is extended and extended."
"This occurs particularly in Longuenesse jail in France and applies to truck drivers from the United Kingdom and other countries."
"I find it wholly unacceptable that this problem should be simply swept under the carpet, and we are assured that the mutual recognition of judgments will help in some way."
"I want to know why this question, this very plain and simple question, is not being answered."
"Are the rights of defence being adequately honoured and will mutual recognition do anything to help?"
"Let me give you the Council' s interpretation of your question, and its answer."
"Regarding the specific cases you mentioned, mutual recognition will not lead to validation of a judgement which flouts essential rights such as the right to legal representation of one' s own choice or the right to the free assistance of an interpreter."
"On the one hand, these are rights which all the States have endorsed and which constitute the shared foundation of our criminal justice systems, and, on the other hand, mutual recognition is a process which is by no means automatic and which depends on the nature of the judgement in question."
"So, as the Council stated in its previous answer, the programme for mutual recognition can only bring improvements in terms of fundamental rights."
"Mr President, I have to say that the President-in-Office is turning not answering questions into something of an art form."
"I would like to press him further."
"What will the Council do to ensure that the states do the kinds of things he has just been setting out?"
"What guarantee do we have, that the theory that you have just stated will actually take place?"
"I have no further information to give you."
"I think we simply have a little misunderstanding here."
"What I am in fact trying to explain to you is that the Council is indeed taking action to meet your expectations."
"Question No 14 by (H-0899/00):"
"Subject: Mandate of the Rapid Reaction Force An EU rapid reaction force is currently being set up."
"What has been decided about the mandate on the basis of which these troops will be deployed, and for what purposes will they be deployed?"
"It is up to the Council to decide upon the possible launch of a military operation conducted by the European Union as part of the Petersberg assignment."
"In accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union, the Council shall adopt this decision unanimously, as is the case, moreover, for any other decision with implications in the area of defence."
"It is, furthermore, up to each Member State to take a sovereign decision at national level whether or not to commit their national forces to the operation."
"The Nice European Council recorded the conditions which might lead the Council to take a decision in a crisis situation."
"According to these, with a view to setting up an operation, the Political and Security Committee (COPS) may submit a recommendation to the Council on the basis of advice from the Military Committee."
"The Council, whose deliberations are prepared by COREPER according to the customary procedures, may take a decision on the basis of this."
"The decision to launch an operation would, in principle, take the form of a joint action."
"The COPS, as the kingpin of European security and defence policy and the CFSP, has a central role in defining the European Union' s response to a crisis."
"In particular, it provides the political scrutiny and strategic administration of a military crisis management operation."
"The option of deploying a rapid reaction force exists for the whole range of crisis management missions, the Petersberg missions as defined in Article 17(2) of the Treaty on European Union, humanitarian and evacuation missions, peacekeeping missions and combat troop missions for crisis management, including peacemaking missions."
"Mr President, Minister, I would like to ask if any decisions of principle have been taken regarding whether there should be a mandate from the UN or any other international organisation in discharging such tasks as these, as, under international law, a mandate from an international organisation is needed before any country' s territory can legally be attacked in this way."
"Furthermore, I would ask what sort of legal definition has been presented or made in the Council regarding tasks connected with the deployment of crisis management troops?"
"There is a report available which was appended to the Presidency' s report at the Nice European Council on European security and defence policy."
"This will give Mr Sepp√§nen all the answers he requires."
"It is a rather long document, but all the information is laid out there in precise detail."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 15 to 21 lapse."
"Question No 22 by (H-0918/00):"
"Subject: Bearing of taxes on the operation of the internal market In an article in the Financial Times in November this year, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, affirmed that he does not want to see tax harmonisation and common tax levels in the EU by stating that tax rates 'are in the hands of the national parliaments and must remain so'."
"At the same time, in the same article, he considers that, in order for the EU to become dynamic and competitive, there is a need to switch to majority voting on taxes 'where necessary for the internal market to function'."
"Which taxes does the Council consider to have no bearing on the dynamic and competitive operation of the internal market?"
"With your permission, Mr President, that will be the last question that I shall be able to answer during this Question Time."
"The honourable Member' s question concerns the unofficial opinions expressed by the Commission President."
"It is not therefore up to the Council to state an opinion on this matter."
"I should just like to point out that the Treaty system differentiates between taxes and indirect taxes which must be harmonised in order to ensure the proper establishment and smooth running of the internal market - according to Article 93 - and the approximation, laid down in Article 94, of legislation which has a direct bearing on the establishment or running of the common market, including legislation on direct taxation."
"The decisions taken by the Council on the basis of Articles 93 and 94 were taken according to the rule of unanimity."
"Following the Treaty of Nice they will, unfortunately, continue to be taken according to the rule of unanimity."
"I should like to thank the French presidency for its answer."
"I nonetheless want to ask whether the Council welcomes this type of very contradictory and unclear statement from the Commission' s President."
"It is nevertheless the case that, if the desire is to create close cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, it is unfortunate if the Commission' s President produces vague statements of this kind, for his statement can only be interpreted in terms of his wanting to open the way to tax harmonisation despite creating a smokescreen for this."
"I must repeat that I cannot comment on statements attributed to the President of the Commission."
"However, the matter of whether decisions on taxation should be taken by majority vote was examined in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As you know, it was not possible, unfortunately, to make any progress in this area at Nice."
"Question Nos 23 to 32 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia"
"The next item is the report (A5-0364/2000) by Mr Baltas, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission report on the feasibility of negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia [COM(2000) 311 - C5-0506/2000 - 2000/2244(COS)]"
"Mr President, I have great pleasure in presenting the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Croatia and the European Union to this part session of the European Parliament."
"Croatia has made considerable progress in the economic, the political and the social sector and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the next logical step."
"Allow me briefly to summarise these three main sectors."
"First, the economic sector."
"Obviously, huge efforts are still needed before the Croatian market functions in line with the acquis communautaire."
"However, efforts are clearly being made and the results of structural and economic reform can already be seen, especially in the transparent procedures being used for privatisation and the protection being offered to foreign investment."
"The Stability, or rather Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which provides for financial aid and general financial assistance through the relevant Community programmes, will strengthen this progress in the economic sector and speed up preparations for Croatia's accession to the European Union at a later date."
"The progress made by Croatia is evident not only in the economic sector but also in the political sector."
"The new coalition voted in during recent elections in Croatia has decided to put its money on democracy and the rule of law."
"This embracing of democracy and the rule of law go beyond mere words to daily actions: institutions are being created and legislation - such as the legislation on protection for refugees, the right to asylum and immigration - is being reformed."
"Also worth mentioning here are the attempt by certain representatives of the Croat community in Bosnia to destabilise the government in order to recreate the wartime statelet of Herzeg-Bosna and the government's compliance with the terms of the Dayton agreement and collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"Progress has clearly also been made in the social sector and at this point, I need do no more than read you an extract from the conclusions of the Council of Europe:"
"""Croatia has made significant progress in fulfilling its commitments as a member of the international community, in particular with its ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the European Charter of Local Self-Government and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."""
"With the changes and democratic developments in Yugoslavia, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Union and the present motion for a resolution on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, there are good prospects for democratisation and stabilisation in the Western Balkans and Croatia can play a specific and decisive role here."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia has come along at just the right time."
"Parliament also has cause to congratulate itself on rushing approval through before the end of the year."
"Just how right it was is confirmed by the summit in Nice which ended just yesterday morning."
"The following is an extract from the chapter describing the Western Balkans:"
"""The Zagreb Summit of 24 November, which brought together for the first time countries in the region which had returned to democracy, welcomed the historic changes which have occurred in the Western Balkans, initially in Croatia and then in the FRY. ..."
"It confirms that the process of stabilisation and association is at the heart of the Union' s policy vis-√†-vis the five countries concerned, which each receive individual treatment."""
"Mr President, the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement takes account of the new democratic developments in Croatia and highlights the European prospects for this country, which has managed in the course of the past year to achieve its aim of joining the international community of states."
"Its membership of the NATO Partnership for Peace and of the World Trade Organisation, its bilateral agreements with the EFTA states, its free-trade agreements with the CEFTA member states and the negotiations that began recently, on 8 November, on a wide-ranging Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union are all evidence that Croatia has embarked on a clear change of course since the elections of 3 January 2000."
"The European Union emphasised this again by the summit held in Zagreb on 24 November."
"However, it also became clear at this summit that the situation inside Yugoslavia remains as brittle and strife-ridden as ever."
"If this pattern of behaviour continues, where in case of doubt each party fights the other, it could break up the Stability Pact for South-East Europe, which is based on regional cooperation."
"For even now states like Croatia are asking whether the obligation to cooperate on a regional basis might not end up delaying their own accession to Europe."
"Croatia, like a more democratic Serbia, where I hope that democracy will be consolidated on 23 December, could become major factors of stability in these regions destroyed by wars and ethnic conflicts."
"It is important for the European Union, as also the European Parliament, to do their utmost to provide economic protection and support for the democratic process in these countries."
"Even if they still have a long way to go before they can join the European Union, economic and political help quite simply offer the principle of hope, and Mr Baltas' report takes that principle into account."
"But we should also apply the principle of differentiation in this region."
"Croatia has made significant progress, especially by ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."
"The European Parliament's report rightly notes that."
"Another point in Croatia's favour is the changed attitude of the newly elected Croatian authorities to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"Croatia has always felt part of western Europe, western culture."
"It needs all our support and encouragement along its chosen road to economic and political reform."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me congratulate Mr Baltas very warmly on his report, in particular for the fact that he drafted it so quickly, for it was both important and correct to react quickly to the changes in Croatia as Mr Stenzel said."
"I also had very good talks with members of the former government."
"Some were very useful, but the whole thing always had to be seen in the context of extreme nationalism, of very sluggish cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal and a very hesitant approach to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"That has changed."
"The new Croatian government has not only recognised but actually supports Europe's Balkan policy."
"And that is why it was right to react quickly."
"I can see no contradiction between the one-to-one relations between the European Union and Croatia and the various Balkan countries, and regional cooperation."
"We need regional cooperation."
"We need it, for example, with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it is most welcome that the government has said it will support the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single state, which has not always brought it friends among the Croatians in Herzegovina."
"But that is a bold, clear and definite step and it must be followed up."
"In the end we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia, meaning cooperation on both sides."
"On the one hand we must continue to insist that the ethnic Serbian refugees who have fled Croatia can return there, that this is not just the will of the government but can also be achieved against quite considerable local resistance in individual regions, villages and areas."
"But of course we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia not just for this process but also in order to stabilise the region."
"Even if we are being a little cautious and reticent at this point we and Mrs Pack is here too have told Mr Kostunica quite plainly that we must also require the new Yugoslavia, which we hope will emerge stronger from the elections on 23 December, to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal, to cooperate on a regional basis, to be prepared to resolve the conflicts peacefully."
"My third and final comment is this."
"The Zagreb summit sent out a clear message."
"We in this Parliament have already incorporated the further developments clause in the agreement with Macedonia."
"Now, however, we must also prepare the way carefully."
"That makes the decision, or non-decision, of Nice rather disappointing: the complexity of the majority-voting system makes things difficult enough for the current round of enlargement, but they will become much more difficult when it comes to enlargement towards south-eastern Europe."
"Here the Union still has much work to do."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too can answer yes to the question whether Croatia deserves a Stability and Association Agreement."
"Croatia is increasingly becoming a factor of stability in the region."
"It is making positive progress towards democracy."
"However, let me emphasise that even though we welcome this progress, this does not mean we think Croatia has reached its goal."
"It must now take the next steps towards legislative reform, especially in relation to minority rights, freedom of the press and an independent judiciary."
"It is up to the Commission to take a very critical look at precisely these aspects now in preparation for the Stability and Association Agreement."
"Let me also stress that Croatia is endeavouring to put its relations with neighbouring states in good order."
"That means it really has made quite positive progress here."
"It is particularly important to show Croatia that we regard it as quite crucial what role it takes on with regard to stabilisation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federation there."
"Indeed, that is the precisely the yardstick by which we must measure Croatia's progress towards stabilisation."
"I think it would be a disaster for the EU to tie economic support to an agreement on the return of the refugees in the Association and Stabilisation Agreement."
"That issue must be based on other conditions, namely whether access to asylum in Croatia is compatible with international standards and whether it is a humane access to asylum."
"I believe this question has to be treated separately and must not be part of the agreement."
"Mr President, our Group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the feasibility of negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with the Republic of Croatia."
"We also think that the Commission has acted at the appropriate time to launch this proposal."
"We think that the work has been done in record time, and we congratulate Mr Baltas on his efficient work in committee."
"We think that it is timely because, although at the time, we, as the European left, criticised some countries of Western Europe for their role in the break up of the former Yugoslavia, through encouraging, facilitating or instigating hatred and aggression, both ethnic and of other kinds, which resulted in the emergence of Croatia, at this time, when its recent past has also changed, I think it is a very good sign that the European Union is taking a step forward to help recover the mood of tolerance, democracy, respect for human rights and living in harmony with other republics and areas in the region, because it is of vital importance for the European Union."
"We should not forget the suffering of the almost three hundred thousand people, of Serbian origin, who were violently expelled in a week, by terrorist methods, from Krajina, and had to flee to Serbia."
"I think it is important to recognise that it was wrong and that those people be helped to return, if they wish, to their homes."
"That would prove that tolerance, living together in harmony and respect for different opinions are possible in the Balkan region and it would improve the prospects for our future in the area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome the start of the negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which will at last open up the prospect that country deserves."
"Unlike its neighbour Slovenia, immediately after independence in 1991 Croatia was not able to develop in a way as to allow it to become a candidate for accession at this point."
"For at the time, in 1991, one third of the country was occupied."
"At the time the Croats were driven out."
"In 1991/92 more than 250 000 Croats were expelled from Kraijina, from western and eastern Slavonia."
"They were not able to return to their homes until the, to my mind, justified¬≠ recapture of these areas."
"There they found their property and possessions in ruins."
"Unfortunately, during this recapture Serbs who had the right to live there were expelled in return, not just by the Croats but sadly also by their Serb ringleaders, who, of course, did the same in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Sarajevo."
"Unfortunately, we also saw serious attacks carried out during this recapture."
"But we should not confuse cause and effect."
"We then punished Croatia for this recapture by denying it our friendship."
"We refused to grant it any aid."
"And because we refused to help, many things then started to go wrong in Croatia, with wrongful privatisation, corruption and so on."
"The new government has now taken a European line in many policy areas."
"It is seeking to cooperate with The Hague."
"It has stopped supporting separatist movements in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"It is currently adopting difficult austerity measures in order to meet the preconditions."
"So I believe Croatia has deserved this support."
"It can become a factor of stability throughout the region."
"Mr President, during the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to support many Croatians in their efforts towards the freedom and prosperity that they, like other peoples on our continent, identified with their integration into the European institutions."
"In the 20th Century, Croatia has gone through the same stages that many of us that are now part of the European Union had to go through."
"In the last 60 years, Croatia experienced a particularly awful form of fascism."
"A fascism like that in Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain: a characteristically European path, therefore."
"Then the Croats, through a particularly militant anti-fascist resistance, freed themselves from Nazism."
"This journey of resistance is part of the best of European heritage."
"After a new and long period of authoritarianism came the outbreak of independence, led by nationalist forces and others based more on purely democratic aspirations."
"In the struggle between them the Croatians had to go through a new chapter of ultra-nationalist authoritarianism, supported paradoxically by their Serbian counterparts, through the occupation of part of their territory and through the war."
"With peace and the consolidation of democracy, the Croatian people have chosen the path of moderation and tolerance, freedom and respect."
"And they have clearly identified that choice with their full participation in the project for European construction."
"The entry of Croatia into the Council of Europe made a decisive contribution to the positive developments that have been taking place in the country, and was a step further along the road to the stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union, which we are debating today and which we want to become a reality as soon as possible."
"This agreement is nothing if not a step further towards Croatia' s accession as a full member of the European Union, and there is no place on that path for any conditions other than those that the other applicant countries have to comply with."
"The Croatians have a right to that accession, but, moreover, I think it is obvious that the European project would be incomplete as long as Croatia was missing from the mosaic, along with its other neighbours from the former Yugoslavia."
"We will therefore vote in favour of the proposals put forward by our friend Mr Baltas and we commit ourselves to continuing to support Croatia in its efforts to become one more member of the European Union."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be able to comment on the excellent report by the honourable gentleman, Mr Baltas - produced, as several honourable gentlemen have said, with considerable expedition - on the Commission's feasibility study for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia."
"This has of course been a historic year for south-east Europe."
"It was Croatia - we should not forget - that got things moving with its elections under a year ago."
"So I am delighted that we celebrate the end of the year by launching negotiations with Croatia for a stabilisation and association agreement."
"We initiated those negotiations appropriately enough at the Zagreb Summit a fortnight ago and the first full negotiating session takes place on Monday in Brussels."
"We hope to make swift progress in these negotiations and to be able to conclude them rapidly."
"How rapidly depends to some extent not just on us but on the Croatian negotiating team who are extremely well prepared."
"I have to say that, on the basis of Croatia's performance this year, I have every confidence that we will be able to set a brisk pace."
"Certainly that is what Croatia has done during the course of the last months: setting an example to its neighbours, demonstrating how rapidly it is possible to turn a country's political fortunes around, given sufficient vision and political courage."
"I want to pay a warm tribute to Croatia's leaders and to her people for what they have achieved."
"Croatia has, for example, bravely transformed its relations with The Hague, based on the wise assertion of her President that it is only by establishing individual guilt that a country can truly be absolved of collective guilt."
"Wise advice, applicable not just in Croatia but wherever war crimes are alleged."
"As Mrs Stenzel pointed out, Croatia has joined the PFP and WTO, and it has taken on a host of other international obligations."
"The new government has made radical changes to Croatia's relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, clearly distancing itself from extremists in Herzegovina and instituting a more open financial relationship with the Croat components of the federation army."
"It has pioneered free trade agreements with FYROM and Slovenia and now with Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"It played an extremely helpful role in supporting the democratically elected government of Montenegro in withstanding pressure from the Milosevic regime."
"At the same time, the government has started to make real reforms at home - politically and economically - that have led us to conclude that Croatia would be able to uphold the substantial obligations which a stabilisation and association agreement entails."
"Last month, as the House knows, Croatia hosted, with extremely impressive efficiency and diplomatic finesse, the historic Zagreb Summit."
"I do not think that is a bad record for a year."
"So I am pleased, if not surprised, that Parliament backs our judgement that it was right to proceed quickly to begin these negotiations with Croatia."
"I share many of the observations in the report."
"I strongly agree, for example, that we need substantially to increase our financial support for Croatia under the CARDS regulation."
"We have a team of officials in Croatia this week to look at programming for next year."
"I strongly endorse Parliament's view."
"I know that it is the strong view of the Croatian Government that countries participating in the stabilisation and association process must be judged on an individual basis on their own merits."
"The agreements must be tailored to their particular circumstances and adjusted to the rate of progress that they have made."
"That is certainly our approach, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months testifies to that."
"We also naturally want to see countries participating in the stabilisation and association process taking the lead not just in establishing closer relations with the European Union but with each other too."
"This is not - and I want to emphasise this point - a sort of back-door attempt to try and recreate Yugoslavia."
"It is an underlining in our relations with these countries of what has been our own experience."
"We coped with appalling political division."
"We coped with turmoil by coming together, by trying to work together economically and politically."
"It should not come as a surprise to countries which want a better relationship with us, which want a closer relationship with us, which want to join us in the European family, when we insist on exactly the same for them."
"In the last year Croatia has embarked boldly and decisively on the road to Europe, but there remains, despite recent progress, some way to go."
"We will need to see a strong continuing commitment on the part of Croatia and on the part of other governments in the region to refugee return - a point which a couple of honourable Members referred to."
"Above all we will need to see continuing economic and institutional reform, the establishment of a genuinely free economy, reform of property law, the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and the protection of the rights of minorities."
"There will also need to be serious reform of the media, with a real effort to create a genuinely open and pluralistic media environment, living up to the highest professional standards of impartiality and independence, especially in television."
"So we will continue to need the support of this Parliament as we urge our Croatian friends to press on with these reforms, many of which will bring pain before the gains are evident."
"We welcome Parliament's support so far, not least on the important question of the legal base for the stabilisation and association agreements."
"This is an important point for us and we will, I hope, be able to count on Parliament's support when we come back to consult you formally once we have negotiated the agreement."
"The conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement will, of course, be subject to the assent of this Parliament."
"With the start of these negotiations, Croatia has embarked on a new era in its relations with the European Union."
"Croatia has won many friends in Europe for the role it has played in the last year and for the progress it has achieved."
"Of course, in many respects the hard part is only just beginning, but I have every confidence that the people of Croatia are equal to the challenge, equal to the difficult path of reform, the path to Europe that now lies ahead."
"We in the European Commission look forward to helping Croatia to meet that challenge and to helping Croatia along that road."
"As I said at the outset, this year began with the people of Croatia and their new democratic government lighting a candle."
"I think it was remarkably important for the whole region."
"We owe it to Croatia to give the government and people of Croatia every help in the years ahead and we are extremely grateful to the honourable Member for his wise advice in ensuring that we pursue this route."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"I should like to thank all colleagues who contributed to the debate and kept so well to their speaking time."
"It is unusual for this Parliament."
"I will be severe from now on."
"Developing closer relations with Indonesia"
"The next item is the report (A5-0323/2000) by Mrs Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on developing closer relations between Indonesia and the European Union [COM(2000) 50 - C5-0288/2000 - 2000/2152(COS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission issued its communication on relations between Indonesia and the European Union a year ago, Indonesia seemed to be on the way to a true democracy under the Wahid government, which had newly taken office."
"A year on, the picture looks far less optimistic."
"The road to democracy, to respect for human rights, to a sound administrative and legal system, to the eradication of corruption, seems to be a long road beset with obstacles."
"Here is a great deal of opposition to the Wahid government and the process appears to have come to a standstill."
"This opposition to the democratically elected government comes from various quarters, from military circles, from the supporters of the corrupt Suharto regime, from groups of fanatical Muslims, and from armed militia circles."
"The President is also still under fire over the Bulog and Brunei affair."
"However, it is important that the Vice-President and the President of Parliament have declared their loyalty to the President."
"The problem the government is struggling with is seen most clearly in the regions that were used as migration destinations owing to over-population, and that were also misused as conquered land."
"Worst of all is the situation in Irian Jaya and the Moluccas."
"It is incomprehensible, in this respect, that the Laskar Jihad was given the chance this spring to go to the Moluccas in their thousands, in order to stoke up the conflicts there again."
"This has left the Moluccas with thousands of dead and several hundred thousands of refugees."
"People are very afraid at present - and that includes the 50 000 Moluccan citizens in the Netherlands - that the situation will escalate further around Christmas."
"We have received reports to the effect that the Laskar Jihad is preparing to launch a new offensive, in West-Irian among other places, but also in small countries such as Gorom and Lusalaut."
"People are being killed because they are Christians."
"People are being locked up in churches and forced to convert to Islam."
"There are even reports that the Laskar Jihad has banned all Christian church bells from ringing at Christmas."
"What we are seeing is religious terror."
"As rapporteur I find that intolerable and I would therefore ask the Commissioner what the European Union can do with respect to the Wahid government in order to prevent further bloodshed."
"Then there is Irian Jaya."
"The violence is escalating there too."
"More people died this weekend."
"Last week, hundreds of students were picked up and four of them were returned to their parents as corpses."
"There are still some Papuan leaders under lock and key too."
"We expressly wanted to respect the territorial integrity of Indonesia in our resolution, but surely that cannot mean the people of Irian Jaya having to renounce their own culture and identity?"
"That sort of violence only stirs up feelings of hatred."
"I would like to lend my voice to the warning issued by the United States government to the effect that the violence must stop."
"The EU ought to take the same line."
"Peace is very far from being restored in Timor and Aceh."
"In Timor, the militias block the return of the refugees and relief workers are besieged."
"And the murder of the Dutch journalist Thoenes has not been investigated yet."
"Three more relief workers died in Aceh last week and fifteen died at the beginning of December."
"Mr President, these regional problems are the worst in Indonesia at the moment."
"As such, the plans to give these regions more autonomy are to be welcomed, as are the undertakings to leave more revenue from raw materials to the regions."
"As far as the overall approach in Indonesia is concerned, things are in fact heading in the right direction."
"But it is precisely these problems in the regions that are still very much apparent."
"What can the role of the European Union be?"
"Indonesia is one of the most important countries in the ASEAN area."
"It is important for the whole area for Indonesia to be a stable, democratic constitutional state with good relations within and outside ASEAN."
"The European Union must support the democratic and socio-economic developments, but not unquestioningly."
"We must attach conditions to our aid and support."
"We must see signs of progress in the democratisation process, the human rights situation must improve, the violators of human rights must be tried, corruption must be tackled and the power of the army must be further reduced."
"Should this fail to happen then aid will have to be suspended if necessary."
"There should also be far more coordination of aid at European level."
"The EU embassy in Jakarta could assume a coordinating role."
"We also ask the European Commission to follow this policy line in our resolution."
"Lastly, with all due respect for the sovereignty of Indonesia, if violence erupts again in the Moluccas and on Irian Jaya around Christmas, then international action should not be ruled out in our view."
"I have in mind sending UN observers to the crisis areas, where action is urgently needed, but also humanitarian relief action if necessary."
"The murder really must stop."
"Certainly that committed by army units, militias and militant Muslims."
"Otherwise, what is the difference between the Wahid government and the old Suharto regime?"
"We are very concerned and expect the European Commission to respond to these developments."
"Mr President, I would like to compliment Mrs Maij-Weggen on her excellent report, and thank her for the pleasant cooperation we have had."
"Political stability and respect for human rights and the constitutional state are key to economic recovery following the Asia crisis."
"They are also pre-requisite to closer cooperation between the European Union and Indonesia."
"On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I will restrict what I have to say to three points."
"We are concerned about the high degree of corruption and nepotism in the Indonesian economy."
"Too many members of former ruling families still wield power."
"This is a major obstacle to economic recovery and social stability in the region and therefore needs to be tackled."
"Secondly, it is essential for the private banking sector in Indonesia to be restructured."
"The agency for the restructuring of the Indonesian banks, the so-called Ibra, has so far been unable to allow the merchant banks to resume their loans service."
"What is more, the Ibra has considerable financial interests in various enterprises."
"It is even the sole shareholder in a few companies."
"These enterprises ought to be privatised."
"At the same time, this would create new opportunities for much-needed foreign investment."
"Finally, economic relations with Indonesia are now based on the ASEAN agreement."
"So far, the ASEAN countries have made little progress as regards economic integration, even though the establishment of a free-trade zone between the members has been mooted for years now."
"My committee has therefore asked to conclude a bilateral cooperation agreement between the European Union and Indonesia."
"I will take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Patten to investigate this possibility, along with his colleague Mr Lamy."
"Mr President, the positive developments that have been seen in Indonesia are unquestionable, to the extent that they suggest that a new relationship and effective cooperation with that country are in order."
"Thus the terms of the Commission' s communication at the beginning of the year are justified, even if it is marked by a certain euphoria surely resulting from those changes."
"The internal challenges facing Indonesia are, however, enormous and complex, as revealed by more recent events."
"There is the explosive situation in Irian Jaya, exacerbated by the use of repressive methods; there is also the difficult situation in Aceh and the Moluccas; in addition there is the dramatic situation experienced by refugees in the camps in West Timor - and the lack of measures that could change it - where the militias still act with impunity; and all this is tied up with the pressure from the former Suharto regime and the significant capacity for manoeuvring of military groups clearly identified with it and openly linked with integrationist and nationalist movements."
"These facts can only concern us, and therefore the initial optimism that was so clear in the Commission' s communication should be reconsidered and tempered to some extent."
"There is no doubt that cooperation with Indonesia should be strengthened, and it should be directed into support for the authorities of this country in fields such as improvements in administration, the fight against fraud and corruption, the judicial system, environmental protection and improvements, or humanitarian aid for the displaced and refugees."
"But the level of this cooperation must take into account the effective progress the country may make in solving regional problems and the methods used for solving them, its respect for human rights, and also the country' s collaboration in the positive development of the Timor Lorosae independence process, particularly in solving the problems faced by the West Timor refugees and in prosecuting and sentencing militia members who have behaved criminally and only recently murdered three United Nations workers."
"I believe the report by our colleague, Mrs Maij-Weggen, who in fact knows the situation well, satisfactorily addresses these aspects and therefore deserves our full approval."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on the excellent job she has done."
"The democratisation process in Indonesia deserves due recognition and therefore support."
"One of the clearest expressions of this process, but also of the contradictions that make it so fragile, was what happened in East Timor."
"When the right to self-determination had been accepted, in the time between the popular vote and the recognition of the result, armed militias supported by Indonesian troops executed a detailed plan to destroy public infrastructure and thousands of homes, ruin crops and farming implements, and persecute the population, which, in terror, took refuge in the mountains and in West Timor."
"As part of a delegation from this Parliament, I was one of the international observers of the ballot and witnessed the Timorese people' s amazing thirst for freedom, but I also had the impression that as soon as we had gone nothing would be left standing."
"There are still contradictions like this in Indonesia, whether in the Moluccas, Aceh or Irian Jaya, and they are still manifest in East Timor too."
"The prosecution of those who committed crimes in East Timor and are now in Indonesian territory has yet to take place."
"It is unacceptable that they should escape justice because of a recently enacted law."
"More than one hundred thousand refugees remain in West Timor, virtual human shields for the originators and perpetrators of crimes in East Timor."
"I was in these refugee camps earlier this year."
"In them are those who committed crimes and those who witnessed them."
"The justice which is not being done and the refugee camps which are becoming permanent are areas for confrontation between the old and the new powers in Indonesia and reveal the fragility of the democratisation process."
"Only this week, top UNTAET officials were at serious risk when they left the Indonesian parliament building in Jakarta after meeting the country' s president."
"We can support the democratisation process, as we have been doing; what we cannot do is take the place of the protagonists in this process."
"Mr President, Indonesia is struggling but is emerging victorious."
"The revolution in the country and the way in which it took place, remain the basis for cautious optimism."
"But the excellent report by Mrs Maij-Weggen also underlines the fact that Indonesia' s problems have increased rather than decreased."
"The country is not unique in that respect."
"After all, these problems are characteristic of a country that is having to undergo a multifaceted transition."
"It must develop a new identity with a better balance between the centre and peripheral areas."
"On the economic front, the market must throw off the shackles of far-reaching state interference and attract new investment."
"The poverty issue is extremely pressing."
"A hybrid society must be turned into a transparent one."
"Corruption must be tackled."
"The EU could lend a hand there, by talking to European companies."
"Old structures must be dismantled so that Indonesia can at last get a grip on itself."
"Many current problems are down to a lack of democratic control, for example over those parts of the army that resist change and loss of privilege."
"In many places, violence prevails over dialogue."
"What gives most cause for concern is the situation in the Moluccas, where Jihad fighters are left to their own devices in a manner which is insupportable."
"The government in Jakarta should do far more to get a grip on the situation on the ground, and the EU must continue to bring the necessary pressure to bear, partly as an expression of the increased responsibility that the European Union must take for the region."
"If these efforts should fall short of the mark, then we cannot afford to rule out the possibility of the international community becoming more actively involved."
"When a country starts functioning as a constitutional state again, it must also settle old scores."
"This process is moving very slowly."
"The old structures resist the due process of justice."
"This is hardly surprising given that they have been accessories to crimes in many cases."
"We ask, and demand, that the culprits be tracked down and tried, be they the Suharto family or the murderers of the Dutch journalist Sander Thoenes."
"Relations between Indonesia and the EU can only improve further if we know that our allies really hold sway there, and that the constitutional state is functioning properly."
"Mr President, the traces of Suharto are very far from erased in Indonesia."
"Military influence may have been reduced but is still far too great."
"Corruption is still rampant."
"Ongoing violence on the Moluccas, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya is causing great suffering among the people."
"President Wahid and Vice-President Sukarnoputri have been unable to demonstrate a great deal of governmental power so far."
"It is very important for Europe to support the economic and democratic developments in Indonesia."
"But as Mrs Maij-Weggen has already said, this assistance comes at a price."
"It must benefit the poorest sections of the population."
"The violation of human rights must stop, the proceeds from corruption must be traced, and above all, wealth must be far better distributed."
"It is very difficult to hold this immense realm together."
"Fortunately, the time when a handful of Dutchmen were able to do so is now past."
"But poor administration, where the military are left to wreak havoc undisturbed, feeds the desire for independence."
"The origin of the conflict on the Moluccas mainly lies in Suharto' s ill-considered migration policy, which disturbed the population balance."
"The situation on these islands is still alarming."
"Only if an impartial army steps in will there be a chance of peace."
"The international community must bring maximum pressure to bear on Jakarta in order to put an end to the violence on the Moluccas."
"More humanitarian aid must be delivered."
"The same applies to ECHO, which, I might add, is doing a first-rate job out there."
"Irian Jaya is also suffering the effects of migration policy."
"Here too the local people are frustrated by the immigration of Muslims and the hard line taken by the military."
"It is of paramount importance that those guilty of human rights violations are not allowed to get away with it."
"I concur with those of my colleagues who are demanding an immediate judicial inquiry into the murder of Sander Thoenes."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen has written an outstanding report and I would therefore conclude that Europe must do all it can to support the country on its way to democracy, but at the end of the day, it is up to the Indonesians themselves to erase the traces of the Suharto regime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by bringing two dates to your attention."
"Here, tomorrow, we shall have the presentation of the Sakharov Prize."
"A year ago, this prize was, in fact, conferred on President Xanana Gusm√£o."
"At that time, we honoured the efforts, the courage and the example of the Timorese people."
"In February this year, the Commission embarked on a new political initiative with regard to Indonesia, to which we also gave our approval here."
"In my view, I am sad to say, I think we were all a little hasty."
"I am sad to say this because I too would have liked things to have turned out well in Indonesia."
"I too would have liked to see the benefit of the doubt that we hastened to give reciprocated."
"But, unfortunately, this year has shown that it was not to be."
"As Mrs Maij-Weggen pointed out here in her introductory statement - which I emphatically support, together with the force of her report - the situation in Indonesia is deteriorating."
"We must learn from this lesson by sending Indonesia clearer and unambiguous signals, not contradictory ones."
"I believe Indonesia is a great country, but it is at a crossroads, and it depends on the efforts of the international community and the European Union whether, at this crossroads, it will swing for good towards democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, or whether the disorder will increase."
"To this end, we must learn to choose priorities: we cannot mix environmental issues, social policy issues or economic policy issues all at the same level as the key problem of respect for democracy and human rights, which clearly has to be a political priority in our relationship with Indonesia."
"I also say we must give a clear signal, because we cannot have a two-speed policy: sometimes we seem to criticise but then we seem to do nothing."
"We must learn from this year' s experience, which has been a beneficial experience, and give a very powerful signal indicating the change that we want for Indonesia."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, makes crystal-clear what the real political problems are in Indonesia."
"She is quite forthright in naming the opposing forces of the essential and exacting process of reform."
"She rightly refers to them in her report as still being very powerful."
"However, following the latest reports from the Indonesian archipelago, we are compelled to ask whether the situation does not in fact look more serious, more precarious still for President Wahid and his brothers-in-arms, than the report would suggest."
"Yesterday, an insider summed up the situation in the Indonesian archipelago with the following sentence: 'the reformation is stagnating and the restoration minus the Suharto family promotes stagnation.'"
"Stagnation of the reformation in no way implies that the way to a democratic constitutional state - and I quote the rapporteur - 'is truly leading nowhere' ."
"Hence now is the time for the European Union to carefully support, as far as it is able, the democratic forces, which are neither numerous nor strong."
"In view of the historical burden that sits on the shoulders of two present-day Indonesian regions, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya, Indonesian and western understanding for this distressing historical millstone alone would relieve a great deal of political tension and suffering."
"This is most definitely a task for the European Community."
"The report that winged its way to me from Indonesia offers a ray of hope."
"Despite these uncertain times, a growing number of people within the Christian churches out there are calling for people to do some soul-searching."
"They want people to stop working to secure the interests of their own groups and show sympathy towards their fellow human beings, including Muslims, out of the love of Christ, which offers hope of reconciliation to the entire, and sometimes sorely afflicted, archipelago."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen on an excellent report."
"I know she has great experience of Indonesia and, in particular, the Indonesian Moluccan community living in Holland."
"The position we have to take regarding the territorial integrity of Indonesia is simple: we have to abide by international law and by the United Nations Resolution 2504 of December 1969."
"That resolution categorically affirms that Irian Jaya is part of Indonesia."
"It is something that all our countries have agreed to, have signed up to, and have a responsibility to support."
"It was a recognition by the global community of the legality of the vote in Irian Jaya to become a permanent part of Indonesia and reaffirm United Nations Declaration 1514 of 1960 which prohibits any act aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a country."
"The situation in Irian Jaya is totally different, legally and constitutionally, from the situation that pertained to East Timor."
"Parliament should not confuse the two."
"Irian Jaya is an integral part of Indonesia historically."
"East Timor never was."
"The rule of law must therefore prevail."
"Yes, of course we must ensure that Indonesia maintains its progress in the prosecution of those members of the security forces accused of human rights violations."
"In this case we must wield the carrot and the stick."
"Any outside intervention other than support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and inflammatory to all parties."
"There will be no winners if we take an imperial stance on this issue."
"I use that word advisedly."
"What we can do in the European Parliament and the EU is to ask the new democratic Indonesian Government not to over-react."
"Over-reaction will play into the hands of the separatists, turning terrorists into martyrs and heroes."
"The other activity we can undertake immediately is to give massive support to good governance projects in Indonesia: support in terms of manpower, money, NGO activity, setting standards and criteria so that the devolved administrative arrangement now agreed by President Wahid can be underpinned by creating lasting democratic and civil society institutions."
"If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds, not merely words."
"Mr President, I should like to add my words to those of my colleagues, regarding both the content of the report and in congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on her realistic approach to it, and especially for being true to the values and principles of our European Union."
"I believe it is essential, when stating the route to cooperation with Indonesia, to be vigilant about the application of values and the establishment of the rule of law."
"This Commission proposal has come at a crucial moment, since Indonesia is at a crossroads in a serious economic crisis, and our help in encouraging the establishment of the rule of law and in encouraging support for those interested in setting up a democracy and making Indonesia a strong country but one that respects human dignity, is fundamental."
"If I may, I should like to make two proposals and one request to the Commission."
"The first proposal is that Parliament sends a delegation specifically to visit the refugee camps, not only in West Timor but everywhere, because according to the Maij-Weggen report there are about a million refugees."
"It is important that we should not confine ourselves to approving the report but that we should follow it up."
"Secondly, it is important that the Indonesian authorities allow non-governmental organisations free passage to get medical and humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of Indonesia and to the Timorese who are in a situation of such human misery that these organisations should not be denied access."
"It is absolutely essential that humanitarian principles are adhered to and respected."
"Lastly, I should like to ask the Commission, through Mr Patten, to be vigilant in enforcing these principles, because, although I support the idea that the European Union should encourage cooperation with Indonesia, this should not be at any cost, and I therefore call for detailed monitoring of the allocation of this aid."
"Mr President, I welcome this report but I feel it is a little up-beat."
"The situation has improved and we must encourage President Wahid, but there are still horrendous problems."
"The government is weak and constantly under attack, the military resists civilian control, the economy is fragile and, above all else, human rights are poor."
"That is why we must link development aid to progress in human rights abuses."
"We must make sure, also, that the murderers of the Financial Times journalist, Sander Thoenes, are brought to justice; and the murderers of the three humanitarian aid workers and one torture victim killed only last week by Indonesian security forces in Aceh are brought to justice, also the perpetrators of past crimes. That should include a new trial for President Suharto."
"I am pleased that the UN issued indictments today because of crimes against humanity in East Timor, and Indonesia should be aware, with or without cooperation, that those trials will go ahead."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my honourable friend Mrs Maij-Weggen on what is generally regarded as an excellent report."
"It is a very comprehensive report and particularly useful in updating us on developments since the adoption of the Commission's communication last February."
"Since then time has certainly not stood still in Indonesia."
"I sometimes reflect on what a great American friend of mine, who was once ambassador in Indonesia, said: he thought that of all the most important countries in the world Indonesia was one about which we knew all too little."
"I think the report is extremely valuable in shedding light on what has been happening."
"So I am grateful to her and the committee for the motion for a resolution."
"In particular I am pleased that the points made generally seem to be supportive of the action of the European Union and in particular of the action of the European Commission."
"The key message of the Commission's communication was the need to recognise that Indonesia was undergoing a difficult period of transition in which the forces of reform needed our support."
"That support is to be provided through an enhanced political and economic dialogue, as well as enhanced targeted development cooperation."
"The communication was written in a positive spirit, reflecting the new dawn in our relationship."
"It is fair to say - I suspect in the presence of the Indonesian Ambassador - that Indonesia recognised and welcomed that."
"Almost a year later it is useful to consider whether our proposals and analysis are still valid, given recent political developments in Indonesia."
"In particular this last year has seen growing and worrying unrest, instability and human rights abuses in the regions and, in particular, in Aceh, Irian Jaya and the Moluccas, where the Commission recently adopted a decision for a further EUR 2m from ECHO to help the displaced persons in both provinces."
"The situation is far from stable in all three areas."
"Only this weekend, as a number of honourable Members have reminded us, three local employees of a Danish non-governmental organisation were murdered in Aceh."
"I strongly condemn these murders."
"They are a reminder of the extremely dangerous conditions faced by all aid workers in many parts of Indonesia."
"I want to pay tribute to their bravery and dedication."
"I know that the House would want to do likewise."
"The Commission and the Council have reconfirmed their support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia."
"I am glad that Parliament is doing likewise."
"However, at the same time we have also underlined the Indonesian Government's responsibility to maintain law and order and to protect human rights in its territory."
"It is a challenging task for the democratic government of President Wahid, not least to combat what he has called the dark forces of the past that are trying to play out a national struggle for power on distant battlefields."
"It is essential that he rises to that challenge."
"At the same time he needs to meet the genuine aspirations at local and regional level for a fair share in economic growth and greater autonomy."
"A special case is the still unresolved question of West Timor."
"Clearly it is unacceptable that tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees are still held hostage at the mercy of armed bandits who, in the name of Indonesian patriotism, try to get away without punishment for their criminal past."
"The government of Indonesia has undertaken some steps, but much more needs to be done and much faster."
"I listened with interest to the proposal made by the honourable Member towards the end of our discussion."
"The extraordinary transition of Indonesia is far from over: democracy is still young and very fragile."
"Only two years ago Indonesia was still ruled by a military-backed authoritarian leader."
"The massive economic collapse in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis has aggravated social tensions and ethnic conflict."
"It is clear that Indonesia's difficulties will not be solved overnight."
"The key challenges are still those which we identified in the communication."
"First, the consolidation of the rule of law, including civilian supremacy over the military and the combating of corruption; second, the implementation of regional autonomy in a way that reduces the incentives for separatism; and, third, economic restructuring."
"So what does the future hold for our relations with Indonesia?"
"Above all we must continue to express our support for the necessary but fragile democratisation and reforms and we must ensure, as we did throughout the crisis, that our markets remain open."
"An honourable lady earlier in the debate referred to our relationship with Indonesia as part of our relationship with ASEAN."
"I must say that what is noticeable in our relationship with Indonesia is the extent to which that country has profited from our generalised system of preferences."
"It was the fourth greatest beneficiary in 1998."
"While EU exports dropped in 1997 and 1998 and have only stabilised since, European Union imports from Indonesia have surged significantly providing Indonesia with a trade surplus which has cushioned them against the crisis."
"How should we engage Indonesia in the coming years?"
"The main mechanisms for doing so have been outlined in the communication: more and more open dialogue both political and economic."
"The senior-official meetings launched this year will continue with our second consultative forum in early 2001."
"We also want to see enhanced contacts with the forces of reform and the reorientation of our development cooperation."
"On this last point I am pleased to inform Parliament that the Commission has launched a new programme under the title of ""good governance"" which tries to help overcome structural weaknesses in the management of public affairs."
"Furthermore a country strategy paper, outlining our long-term development strategy, will be discussed with our Indonesian partners in 2001."
"Like Parliament, the Commission has also identified corruption as a continuing problem."
"The support we are currently giving to the office of the attorney-general in Jakarta is intended to help him in his attempts to combat corruption."
"One last word: I believe that there is reason for cautious optimism as regards our long-term relationship with Indonesia, but we - that is the European Union with all our institutions - need to keep up our support."
"Indonesia matters hugely to us."
"It matters because of its size - the world's fourth largest country in terms of population; it matters because of its economic scale; it matters because of its regional role; it matters because of its environmental impact."
"In between a previous colonial occupation and taking this post with the European Commission, I wrote a book and made some television programmes about Asia and I remember visiting Indonesia shortly after the riots there in 1998 and interviewing the then President Habibie."
"I remember having the distinct feeling that this great country was poised somewhere on the high wire between riot and reform and that we would be very lucky if the democratic process produced a government such as the one that has been produced today."
"It is our task to help that government across the wire to the other side of the chasm."
"If it does not make that journey successfully, the consequences for all of us, the consequences in particular for the region and the consequences for Indonesia, would be dire: either the largest Islamic democracy in the world and one of the most successful democracies in Asia, or very considerable problems for the whole region."
"It is important that Parliament continues to show an interest."
"It is important that Parliament continues to press the European Union as whole to give a helping hand to Indonesia, but it is particularly important that the government of Indonesia - the president and his followers - take the brave but essential decisions that are required to ensure that Indonesia can go forward respecting civil liberties, guaranteeing and consolidating democracy and giving the people of Indonesia a prosperous and stable future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Protection of Communities' financial interests"
"The next item is the report (A5-0376/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission communication 'Protection of the Communities' financial interests - The fight against fraud - For an overall strategic approach' [COM(2000) 358 - C5-0578/2000 - 2000/2279(COS)]."
"Mr President, in its communication the Commission writes that the protection of the Communities' financial interests concerns us all, the bodies and their members at political level, the European and the national public service and their staff."
"But the need to guarantee equal, effective and deterrent protection throughout the European Union particularly affects the chief contributor, namely the European taxpayer."
"That is whom we represent here and to whom we are accountable."
"So I welcome the fact that the Commission document presents an overall strategy showing how it proposes to tackle the misuse of EU funds."
"However, I think the proposed period of five years, 2001 to 2005, is too long, for if we look back we will see that the issue of fighting fraud has been on the table for a long time now."
"A constantly growing budget has, unfortunately, also led to more irregularities and fraud."
"The single market has also opened the borders to fraudsters, while they remain closed for investigation and criminal prosecution."
"It is true that the regulations for the protection of the Communities' financial interests and on-the-spot checks were adopted, UCLAF was set up and then, one and a half years ago, OLAF was created, and articles on fighting fraud were enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and then in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"These were all good measures, but they are not enough."
"The fraudsters are still one step ahead of us if not more."
"The enlargement of the Community and the introduction of the euro could bring further risks with them."
"That is why we must bring together police, administrative and criminal law resources and instruments, both between the Member States and with the EU."
"The Commission's four guidelines set out approaches that I find very welcome."
"First, an anti-fraud legislative policy."
"Here we must apply Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam as the legal basis and develop it further, in order to bring the different national legislations under a common denominator and accordingly standardise penalties and procedures."
"The Commission intended to submit a document on this at the end of November."
"I have not received it so far."
"But above all, the legislation must be clearer, to prevent law-breakers from exploiting any loopholes."
"Secondly, a new culture of operational cooperation."
"It is important that all the Member States pull together."
"After all, more than 80% of the fraud in EU monies is carried out in these states."
"So far it has not been the case that they have joined forces, because otherwise they would all have ratified and therefore enforced the 1995 convention long since."
"Meanwhile parts of it have become out-dated and the Nice summit has not improved matters either."
"But the Commission also wants to create a new internal culture, as President Prodi promised."
"It is to be implemented through internal reform."
"We are keeping a watchful eye on this process."
"The third guideline is a supra-institutional approach to preventing and fighting corruption."
"What is at stake here is the credibility of the European bodies. That is a most important point, and here we must emphasise the importance of setting up OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, which is not so very new any more, and of its activities."
"We must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently, especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure."
"That is equally necessary for the Office and for the Commission."
"We propose appointing a hearing officer to give some protection to the rights of the accused."
"We call on the EIB and the ECB finally to accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement relating to OLAF."
"The system for fighting fraud must finally be perfected by enhancing the penal judicial dimension."
"We support the Commission's proposal to appoint a European Public Prosecutor as a first step towards creating a European judicial authority, given that this is something Parliament has long been calling for."
"This Public Prosecutor, assisted by Deputy Public Prosecutors in each Member State and supplemented by a judge in investigative procedures, in accordance with the 'Corpus Juris' expert report, would satisfy the principle of legal certainty and subsidiarity by acting as a kind of investigative and coordination office, without encroaching on the powers of the competent national courts."
"His remit must be limited strictly to the protection of financial interests; the rules and mechanisms governing his operation can then be regulated by reference to secondary legislation in the codecision procedure."
"I am aware that there are still many reservations about this."
"They need to be allayed, because it is only through constitutional and uniform regulations and measures, which the Nice summit did not, alas, produce, that we can tackle these kinds of crimes."
"I thank the Commission for its efforts and its work ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, when it comes to money, we all know it is no joke."
"The same applies to the European Union."
"That is why we and the other EU bodies agree that we must give priority to protecting the Community' s financial interests."
"However, we are of different minds on the question of how and by what means we can guarantee this protection."
"If we are to fight fraud efficiently, we must bring together all police, administrative and criminal law resources, for this is a matter of the European taxpayers' money and indeed of far more than that."
"It is a matter of trusting in the care taken by the European institutions, and above all of trusting the way the Commission handles the monies entrusted to it."
"Indeed we know this trust may be failing somewhat in view of the sum the Commission itself named in its 1999 report on fighting fraud, namely a loss of some EUR 850 million as a result of fraud and irregularities."
"So the Commission must carry out internal reforms so as to finally make good its announcement that fraud will no longer be tolerated and that it will consistently follow up all cases of fraud."
"OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, must operate alongside it."
"The report before us rightly devotes most space to that institution."
"The conclusion of the OLAF Supervisory Committee of 5 December makes it strikingly clear that OLAF is still far from being independent or functioning properly. It says that the obstacles the Commission sets in the way of recruiting OLAF staff can under certain circumstances constitute an irreversible risk to the fight against fraud."
"I expressly call on the Commission to refrain from any interference in OLAF's activities."
"Finally, I am in favour of appointing a European Public Prosecutor, so that those responsible for fraud face criminal prosecution."
"Mr President, this is the Commission's big moment that is what I would like to call out to you."
"The Nice Summit brought no progress in the protection of the Union's financial interests either."
"It is now crucial for the Commission very rapidly to put forward resolute and imaginative proposals so that we can move ahead within the existing legal framework."
"Mrs Theato's excellent report points to a number of options."
"It once again confirms the proposal set out in the report by the five independent experts on the reform of the Commission, namely that it is possible to set up a European Public Prosecutor's Office on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"As early as May, this Parliament called on the Commission to present proposals for a first stage, during which the European Public Prosecutor would be responsible only for offences and crimes committed by members and officials of the EU institutions against the financial interests of the Union."
"Its task would be to direct the relevant OLAF investigations and to make it easier for the competent national courts to prosecute these crimes."
"I am sure, Commissioner, that once this first step is taken, the discussion about the European Public Prosecutor's Office will no longer seem like a religious war between those for and those against, which has blocked all progress so far."
"And the Commission has this chance to take a first step, especially after Nice."
"Mrs Schreyer, you have our full support if you take this first step."
"The previous speakers have already had quite a lot to say on the question of OLAF."
"The Supervisory Committee's latest and very serious opinion on recruitment has also been quoted."
"Mrs Schreyer, you have repeatedly emphasised to this House that as the Commissioner responsible for fighting fraud you see it as your special task to guarantee OLAF's independence."
"Please tell us whether you do or do not support Mr Br√ºner on this crucial issue."
"We know that the Commission discussed this question at its last meeting, without coming to a decision."
"Do tell us what you think will happen now on and how we can get out of this impasse!"
"Mr President, I can be very brief because this is not the first discussion we have held on the issue."
"In this context I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for her persistence in entering this item on the agenda again and again, for her persistence in repeatedly calling for a European financial Public Prosecutor."
"I think precisely that should be the end result, of Nice too."
"We must continue to work towards it with perseverance."
"We can see that there are major deadlocks in the Council, that some Member States have made no progress since 1995, that there are still deadlocks."
"However, we also see, and that is something I really welcome, that the current Commission has taken up this issue and endeavoured to draft a document for Nice, and that it is working on this issue together with Parliament."
"I believe that is an opportunity for us in this situation, because Parliament and the Commission can achieve something jointly."
"And the only way to break the Member States' resistance is by working jointly."
"Above all, we must seek to create openness."
"We held a hearing a short while ago."
"I believe we should continue with this."
"We also have to convince the members of the national parliaments, because that is the only way we can go on working and make progress."
"We urgently need a step in this direction, in order to persuade our electors, and especially our taxpayers, that the fight against fraud really is taken seriously at European level too and that we shall seek to ensure that the same criteria apply at European as at national level."
"Mr President, my group has a lot of sympathy for ensuring that the efforts to combat fraud, corruption and money laundering are more efficient, and we find it completely unacceptable that cross-border crime is increasing alarmingly and that the money which the Member States' tax payers hand over to the EU is administered so badly and is to such a large extent channelled away from the purposes for which it was intended."
"If we are nonetheless to vote against this report, it is because we do not believe in the effectiveness of the resources proposed by the report for combating fraud and crime."
"Despite our having every possible sympathy for the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, and for her sterling efforts, we are opposed to establishing an independent European prosecution authority because it is a staging post towards the federal Europe we oppose."
"It is the very establishment of a form of economic administration at EU level that creates the problems, because those models for redistributing EU taxpayers' money which have been established by the so-called 'Community' are poorly designed and in many cases quite unwished for."
"The less money there is in the EU' s coffers, the less fraud there is."
"In her speech at the meeting last month of the justice ministers of Germany' s constituent States, Mrs Theato expressly said that the open frontiers facilitate criminal activities."
"I agree."
"The Schengen Agreement is a catastrophe for probity, but who has created Schengen?"
"The EU has done so."
"We do not believe that more solutions at Community level can improve the fight against crime because the efforts will be characterised by just as much indifference, slovenliness and secrecy as the EU' s administration in general."
"We can clearly see from the treatment of recent years' auditors' reports that powerful forces here in Parliament too are busier preventing the clearing up of fraud than in prosecuting the people responsible."
"We welcome negotiations between the Member States concerning uniform legislation in the area of crime, but we shall not submit our countries to a federal EU prosecution authority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Theato report in committee and also in my group, the Radical Group, and I will vote against it tomorrow because of the Manicheism and inward-looking attitude characterising both this report and the activities of the Committee on Budgetary Control in general or, at any rate, some of its members."
"Anything that is good derives from the Committee on Budgetary Control and all that is bad comes from elsewhere; this is why the report is full of references to the previous resolution."
"As we said three months ago, you would think that the whole world were under the rule of the Committee on Budgetary Control alone."
"Mr President, we will vote against the report for two reasons: firstly because there used to be UCLAF, and you would have thought that UCLAF were an avenging angel come down to earth."
"UCLAF could do not wrong and we forced a Commission to resign on the basis of UCLAF's inquiries."
"Now - for some strange reason - the former UCLAF officials are no longer in favour and we have to banish them and give an OLAF director the power to decide the life or death of these hard-working officials; upon the decree of the Committee on Budgetary Control, these officials have to leave OLAF, being originally from UCLAF and UCLAF was all that is wonderful for some people, to the extent that we forced the Commission to resign."
"The other reason why we will vote against the motion is because, with regard to the request to establish the post of European Public Prosecutor, it is not enough to have included a reference to the juge des libert√©s but we must ensure, once and for all, that there is a system of guarantees: indeed a Prosecutor alone with no system of guarantees is a step not towards democracy but towards an inquisition-like system which is likely to be dangerous, so much so that the proposal was not adopted at Nice."
"Mr President, it is always a pleasure following Mr Dell'Alba, because he makes a British Euro-sceptic sound very sensible in this place."
"I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur - someone I like and admire as a person and politician - on this report, but unfortunately I cannot."
"Had it not been for the amendments concerning OLAF being adopted at the committee stage, I would have struggled to find any part of this report to support."
"Fortunately this idea found very little support at Nice last weekend."
"The Council - as pointed out so eloquently by Mrs R√ºhle earlier - does not like this idea either."
"My personal view is that the European Public Prosecutor is just the first step along the road to corpus juris, a body of common law across the continent."
"Indeed I believe that is what the Commissioner feels too."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, you would be so kind as to let me know whether that is the case - whether this is the first step to something that would be a common body of law across the continent."
"I thought I heard you say something similar to that in committee."
"I should also like to know why the Commission's paper on this subject had its release delayed until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro."
"Perhaps the Commission knows that whilst this proposal has some support in the political classes of Europe, its support stretches no further than that."
"Often in argument for a European Public Prosecutor, you hear that these proposals are only to protect the Community's financial interests - something that everybody should agree with."
"Interestingly though, they are often sold as being a small step - there is not much behind them."
"So why all the concern?"
"Well, for those of us who are still wading through the Court of Auditors' report, we will find that one definition of fraud against the Community is the black market - paying for goods √† la belge, as they say in Brussels."
"This is fraud against the Community because the EU takes a small percentage of all VAT transactions."
"So another question springs to mind: if the European Public Prosecutor is allowed to investigate every VAT transaction across Europe, how big will that office be?"
"There are so many other questions - the relationship with OLAF, who appoints the European public prosecutor, who they report to and how it affects the Member States - that I am afraid I am urging the British Conservatives and others to vote against this report."
"Mr President, I have to follow Mr Dell'Alba and Mr Heaton-Harris and this will be tough."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report and in particular for making the effort to come here as I know she is not feeling very well tonight."
"The report deals with the protection of the Community's financial interests and how we deal with that and these are the major questions."
"It is always the area where we see hugely inflamed headlines in the papers and we need to tackle these issues seriously otherwise we are going to continue with a largely Eurosceptic public like the people represented by Mr Heaton-Harris."
"We must not forget that 85% of the money is spent within the Member States and we must also not forget that Parliament' s and the Commission's role is to take a pan-European approach to these things."
"We must also remember that fraud also concerns money that is not collected, something that happens very often."
"We lose serious amounts of money because it is not collected by the Member States."
"It is interesting that several countries, however much they protest about fraud, still have not signed up to the Convention on the Protection of the Communities' Financial Interests."
"I put an amendment down to name these countries because it is about time they were named and shamed."
"We need to bring these countries out into the open to reveal their hypocrisy."
"It was quite interesting to hear what Mr Prodi said today because he sounded quite enthusiastic about the European public prosecutor which is quite a shift from what we have seen in the past."
"I must emphasise, from the point of view of the political group, the amendment that was tabled by Mr B√∂sch was critical of the report because it talked about concentrating on the institutions of the European Union, the public prosecutor being relevant only in that sense."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against fraud detrimental to the European Union is a high priority of the Commission's activities and is an important aim for the reform of the Commission's overall financial management."
"Today we are debating Mrs Theato's report on the Commission's report on its strategy for fighting fraud."
"The Commission presented its report in June this year and I welcome the fact that we can debate the reports as early as today."
"The Commission takes an overall approach in its strategy for protecting the Communities' financial interests and fighting fraud; overall means that it involves all levels of activity and also all the players, all the players in the European Union institutions as also in the Member States as also in the candidate states or third countries that are responsible for dealing with European money."
"The strategy is built around four main lines of action: an anti-fraud legislative policy, operational cooperation between the relevant authorities, an interinstitutional approach to combat fraud in office and enhancement of the penal judicial dimension."
"Since time is short I will present the individual points briefly."
"The first strategic line of action consisting of comprehensive legislation to combat fraud includes legal provisions to prevent, detect and prosecute cases of fraud. For if a policy to protect the Communities' financial interests is to be effective, it must be based on clear and easily applicable legal rules that contain provisions on efficient financial management."
"It is precisely in this area that thanks to the creation of OLAF we have a very powerful instrument. We are expanding its field of application step by step, which means first and foremost making greater use of OLAF for the collection and evaluation of information, as a kind of intelligence service for the fight against fraud."
"The next step will be to organise OLAF's working methods in such a way as to turn it into a real platform of services for the Member States and for the authorities involved in the fight against fraud."
"As Mrs Theato rightly points out in her report, OLAF occupies a crucial position in the Commission's anti-fraud strategy, which is why, and I want to stress that very strongly, the Commission is extremely keen to see this authority built up rapidly."
"There are, however, a number of difficulties with regard to the legal basis for setting up OLAF."
"You know that the Commission would have preferred OLAF to be set up as a totally independent authority."
"But, and here I am addressing Mr B√∂sch, a different legal basis was created. OLAF is independent in the operational field while on the other hand it has to carry out tasks for which the Commission is directly responsible."
"That is bound to create difficulties, which must of course be resolved. I can only assure you once again, in regard also to the issue of the recruitment authority: the director of OLAF is entirely independent in the appointment of staff, and that applies not only to the lower level but also to the more senior and top levels."
"What you are addressing now is the following issue: will OLAF also use an advisory committee in order to bring more transparency into the selection process for senior officials?"
"Actually I am sure that it is also in OLAF's interest to make the selection of senior officials transparent."
"I just want to point out the following: we now have to live and work with this legal basis."
"The Supervisory Committee is constantly putting forward interesting proposals and considering the further development of the legal basis. In this regard the Commission is very open to proposals and reforms."
"The third line of action is common action by the European institutions to fight and prevent fraud in office, and here let me point out that the Commission's complaints against the EIB and ECB because of the disputes about OLAF are still pending and that the complaint by 70 members of this House against OLAF's investigative powers is still pending."
"Finally, the fourth line of action concerns the penal judicial dimension, and along with it, the penal judicial consequences of established, detected or presumed fraud."
"Here the overall situation remains as unsatisfactory as ever, especially as regards cooperation with the Member States, not because of any unwillingness but because of the structural inadequacies and difficulties that exist in this field."
"That is also why the Commission took the step of submitting a draft document on establishing a European Public Prosecutor's Office to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice."
"More and more countries took a positive view of this proposal during the preparatory discussions for Nice. That did not give rise to any hope that the Treaty would be amended accordingly, but did justify the hope that a decision would be taken in Nice on how to move forward on this issue."
"Unfortunately, no such decision was taken in Nice on the Saturday evening, because of the objection of one state, which I find most regrettable."
"Nonetheless, the Commission will not be discouraged and we will ensure that there is a public debate."
"The next target date is 2004, the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Reform of budgetary control procedures"
"The next item is the report (A5-0383/2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on reform of budgetary control procedures and institutions [2000/2008(INI)]."
"Mr President, I am more than aware that this report will not rate amongst the greatest, most radical contributions to the European debate."
"The fact that there is such a ""huge"" turnout here tonight is a recognition of that fact by others."
"Nevertheless there are a number of factors and issues within this report."
"It should be seen as an opportunity for Parliament to reassess its work in relation not only to budget control but specifically to the discharge procedure."
"We must not forget that it was the reluctance of Parliament to give the green light to the way Euro-taxpayers' money was spent in 1996 that precipitated the fall of the Commission in 1999."
"What we are seeing as a result of the resignation of the Commission is a radical reform process."
"However, we must be careful within the European Parliament not to miss seeing the log in our own eye because we are concentrating so hard on the splinter in our neighbour's eye - the Commission."
"We have problems as well, perhaps not quite as big as the Commission's, but it is important that we recognise we also have problems."
"It is clear that the nuclear button in the shape of the discharge procedure cannot be pressed at the first sign of trouble."
"So the European Parliament needs to use this powerful weapon at its disposal in an extremely sensitive manner."
"The discharge procedure gives Parliament an opportunity to assess the financial management and financial resources of the European Union, to propose measures for its improvement and to express an overall political judgement on its quality."
"It is clear that the main focus of our work, within the Committee on Budgetary Control, will be on Commission management, and that ultimately we recognise that the Commission bears responsibility for implementing the budget."
"However, we must not forget that 85% of the money is spent and misspent within the Member States of the European Union."
"For far too long the Member States have hidden their guilt behind the complex mass of Commission officialdom who cannot answer back."
"Let us take one example: late payments."
"If EU money does not arrive on time, people lose their jobs."
"This has happened on several occasions in relation to the structural funds, for example."
"We have EU laws to protect business from such mismanagement and the Commission has now promised to introduce its own regulations to ensure prompt payments."
"But if the Commission coughs up money just to see it sitting in a Member State's coffers gaining interest, the problem persists as far as the end-user is concerned."
"So, where are the reforms from these guilty Member States?"
"Here we have a problem, because we as the Committee on Budgetary Control and as a parliament are only as good as the information we have to work with. We depend on the Court of Auditors to provide us with the ammunition to fire at the problem areas."
"However, the reluctance of the Court - and for that matter the Commission - to name the guilty countries impedes our work."
"We are trying to extinguish a fire and are suffocating in the smoke."
"We need to know the source of the flames."
"The Court of Auditors and the Commission can hide behind the complication of the statement of assurance, but we will not be steered off our course."
"We have heard that, because spot checks are involved, it would be unfair to name the Member States."
"My colleague, Mr van Hulten drew an interesting parallel with spot checks on athletes who have had their whole careers ended."
"If they are guilty, they are named and shamed."
"We should do the same within Parliament."
"We also need to be given the complete picture when the annual report of the year under consideration is published."
"That means we need to know which countries paid back what."
"We need to know what is happening in terms of recovery."
"It is imperative also that we stick to the remit required of us and that we concentrate exclusively during the discharge process on the year in question."
"We have other mechanisms to highlight previously undetected instances of fraud."
"Another key recommendation in this report is to try to expand the responsibility of the discharge beyond the exclusive domain of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Controlling the Commission's management and spending is the main justification for the existence of the European Parliament and the discharge procedure is the chief instrument by which this is done."
"We have tried to get other committees involved in the past but they have not responded, so we want to try to change the regulations within Parliament."
"We are trying to watch the Commission and the Member States and this report is an attempt at doing that."
"Mr President, I would like to start by protesting at the fact that this debate is being held at night."
"It is shameful that we have to debate this and other important matters at night."
"It is shameful."
"And no one can understand it, including myself."
"Mrs Theato has come to this night sitting despite being ill and I have left a dinner with the representatives of ""¬°Basta Ya!"", winners of this year' s Sajarov Prize."
"This situation has to change."
"Next I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which is so important and, contrary to what has been said, so necessary."
"Moreover, I think that her report is part of our new way of understanding what should be politically correct in the institutions, and that is transparency."
"In this morning' s debate on the European Council in Nice we criticised the fact that the meetings were held at night and behind closed doors."
"It would be good to know what goes on there and perhaps, if the doors were open, the Member States would behave differently."
"That is precisely the major contribution made by the Morgan report."
"Its aim is that in this whole process there should be transparency, that we should not beat about the bush, that fingers should be pointed and that it should be made clear that the services are doing things badly."
"For example, I would like to criticise the fact that, when the report of the Court of Auditors was presented, the Council was absent, as if it is not interested in this Parliament."
"I also think that it is worthy of criticism that the Council is not present at the meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is precisely where the faults that arise in 80% of the budget, which the Council spends, are discussed."
"One day we will have to change this sort of absence of the 'innocent hand' of the Council, which is never guilty of anything."
"Mrs Schreyer, you have just mentioned the Council, saying that there was a Member State that opposed the creation of a European Prosecutor."
"It is time for the politically correct thing to be to say which Member State it is and to give its full name."
"This also happens in many reports."
"This very morning, for example, in the debate that we had in the Committee on Budgetary Control, we saw how the representative of the Commission, when we asked him to indicate the Member States that do things badly, answered: ""Look, the monitoring of what the Member States do is done through sampling, and there is no reason to penalise the Member States whose irregularities have been revealed through sampling."""
"Well I do not care. They should say that, according to the sample, such and such a Member State is not doing things right."
"I would like to finish by saying that it is important for there to be monitoring of the approval of the accounts, and for me this is the most important thing, that is, that there is reason for amendment not only by the Commission but also by the Council. It is also important to include observations in the reports on the Member States about how they comply with or fail to comply with the conclusions on the approval of the accounts."
"I would like the Member States, at least the Presidency and the representatives of the Member States being discussed, to be present for debates in Plenary, and also in committee."
"Mr President, I would like to start by commending the timeliness of this initiative and the diligence with which our rapporteur, Eluned Morgan, has carried it out."
"The aim of the discharge procedure is to analyse processes and procedures in force and to detect any inadequacies in them so that the institutions can then proceed to reform them."
"To achieve this aim fully, I shall highlight four requirements that I consider essential in the work of the budgetary control authority."
"First of all, balance in considering all the budget headings: it is unacceptable that the analysis of own resources performed by the Court of Auditors should explicitly exclude all revenue from undeclared economic activities, in contrast to the zeal with which it treats many administrative elements, sometimes with no substantive content, of various forms of expenditure."
"Secondly, transparency with regard to cases and events: whenever the Court of Auditors refers to specific cases it should identify the institutions involved, thus taking responsibility for the claims that it makes."
"Thirdly, thoroughness of analysis: it is incomprehensible that a large number of high quality special reports by the Court of Auditors are omitted from the Annual Report in favour of other matters treated without any prior analysis and on the basis of debatable criteria of political timeliness."
"Fourthly, accuracy in the use of statistics: statistics can be a valuable tool for analysis but they can also be a dangerous tool for distorting reality."
"Using statistics to compare irregularities detected by different institutions as a result of strict or not so strict controls may be more liable to hide what is happening than to expose it."
"High rates of detected irregularities may just as well indicate the zeal of enforcement authorities as suggest corruption in the regulatory system."
"Mr President, even though the rapporteur has stated modestly that the report could have been better, I would still like to offer her my compliments."
"As has already been mentioned, the instrument of discharge is one of the most important weapons that Parliament has."
"It is therefore absolutely vital that we treat it with care."
"The Court of Auditors supplies reports and one of the most important recipients of these reports is Parliament."
"I therefore feel that Parliament would be well-advised to let the Court of Auditors know exactly what it expects from these reports."
"Also, a number of people have already said that we want concrete, succinct reports so that we know where we stand, and reports which are easy to read."
"We must name countries, specific cases and institutions; all these things would make it easier to understand."
"My group also thinks it is extremely important for there not just to be an SOA for the entire budget, but also one per sector."
"In the final analysis, we must be able to assess whether it is getting better or worse."
"I also think the idea mentioned in the report that members of the Court of Auditors should appear in the specialised committees of this Parliament, is an excellent one, because we cannot follow everything ourselves, instead, we must combine forces."
"As far as Parliament itself is concerned, the problem is the Treaty."
"The Treaty states that we can grant discharge but it does not say that we are entitled to refuse to grant discharge."
"I feel Parliament must sort this out."
"We must be able to do it ourselves, but I feel that refusal to grant discharge is an extremely important political matter."
"Indeed that is why it says in the report that if it should come to that, Parliament must immediately hold a debate on the political consequences thereof."
"Amendment No 8, tabled by the Liberal Group, states that it is important for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to further elaborate the recommendations of the Morgan report so that they can be used."
"Mr President, this excellently crafted report shows that the Committee on Budgetary Control can take a coherent and convincing position on such a controversial issue as the importance of budgetary control procedures and bodies."
"Budgetary control will always be a tough and thankless business, because it is not a question of handing out compliments but rather of pointing out weaknesses, mistakes and omissions and thereby improving the way the Commission handles the European taxpayers' money."
"In colloquial terms, what this report is saying is that in future the Committee on Budgetary Control will be more watchful and will want to hear names named when it comes to the unknown whereabouts of European tax monies."
"Neither the Commission nor the Member States will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility, certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other."
"Point 21 of the report contains a very courageous decision in announcing that the discharge will be postponed if the Commission withholds information."
"I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch."
"Had Parliament taken this decision sooner, it could not have given the 1998 discharge."
"For in fact, the Commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions, especially with regard to the Fl√©chard affair."
"I also want to highlight point 20 of the report."
"It is a clear declaration of belief in the rights of each and every Member to request and obtain information from the Commission, including confidential documents."
"This declaration of belief in the rights of individual Members is particularly important because these are precisely the rights the Commission is calling in question."
"It does make us rather apprehensive, Commissioner, to find that the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe MEPs' rights."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Morgan for her report and to say that I believe it is an important report and good report."
"It has been the product good cooperation at the committee level and I want to acknowledge that Mr Pom√©s Ruiz and Mrs Theato made their contribution too."
"This report will go some way towards clarifying the responsibilities that we have and helping the European Commission as well to understand what its role is and what is expected of it."
"I would also like to echo the words of Mr Mulder when he spoke of the importance of the procedure for granting discharge and stressed that it must be taken extremely seriously."
"The people who work on the Committee on Budgetary Control sometimes do not realise the importance of this instrument in guiding the work of the Community in so many fields of their responsibility."
"We must pursue this task with firmness but also with moderation and understanding and we must understand that over the years - perhaps because public spending at European level was such a small percentage of the entire public spending of the European Union, 1% as against 40% on average by the Member States - it was seen as a detail."
"I think it is true to say that it was very hard to get the Member States to understand that they had to apply the same concern and the same care to guarding the resources of the Union that they did to guarding their own resources."
"I heard - and it is not an isolated incident - the United Kingdom Minister for Social Welfare say on television that if he could stop fraud he could save GBP 6 billion."
"He said that quite honestly and regretted that it was so."
"But if a European Commissioner said that we would expect them to resign the next morning."
"So let us understand that fraud is not a problem peculiar to the European Union."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Morgan for writing this report especially considering the remarkably tight deadlines that she set herself by falling pregnant."
"I am sure that this House wishes her every success in that particular project, although I am slightly worried that the baby's first words might include the words ""discharge"" and ""procedure""."
"I would also like to commend to the House the way in which from its conception this report was drawn up using other reports already passed by our committee."
"Some here will know of my interest in the budget in general, and as budget rapporteur for the Budgetary Control Committee, I wrote a report in which a number of conclusions that are included here were conceived, mainly in paragraph 16 of this report."
"From that embryonic stage, they have now come through their period of gestation and are born within this report."
"They concern a number of courses of action that the Budgetary Control Committee can take when it finds problems in different areas, including recommending to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations intended for the headings concerned in the following year's budget; to authorise no transfers of appropriations to take place involving increasing the headings concerned for a certain period until further internal investigations are concluded; up to asking the President of the Commission to ask for the resignation of any individual Commissioners concerned with the serious problems found, a kind of EU Caesarean."
"Finally, I would commend the rapporteur's proposals about speeding up the contradictory procedure and the various statements on the special reports, although I do have to say to the rapporteur that I intend to disagree with the five-month timetable proposed in the report for dealing with these."
"Perhaps a nine-month timetable would be in order."
"I am sure that the rapporteur would be pleased to hear that there are few differences between the main groups to breach in these circumstances."
"Forceps are not required to tweeze out any agreements, and we will be voting for her report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can tell from looking at it, Mrs Morgan, this report has taken a great deal of work and discussion within and outside Parliament, within and outside the Commission, and within and outside the Court of Auditors."
"But after all that shows just how politically significant it is."
"I want to congratulate you very warmly on this successful and balanced result."
"After the events of the past year, your aim is to create a budgetary control and discharge procedure which is more transparent and above all more efficient and effective."
"I may assure you that the Commission is constantly seeking to improve its own procedures."
"It will therefore also take this report as food for further thought."
"You took a very useful and I believe also a very self-assured step in involving the Commission as also the Court of Auditors in your deliberations before drafting the report."
"Those institutions made a targeted effort to find ways of improving the discharge procedure."
"Regarding access to documents for the discharge report, which is indeed an important issue, let me point out that the Commission's point of departure in its activities is the Interinstitutional Agreement reached in July this year, especially Annex 3 on access to confidential information."
"I can assure you that the Commission will honour this agreement in full."
"Let me point out to Mrs Stauner who just raised certain questions that under this agreement the committee chairperson puts questions regarding confidential information to the Commission or forwards them to it."
"Let me tell you that the committee chairperson has put no questions on this to the Commission."
"The report calls for detailed reviews of operational activities, thorough checks of budget headings and irregularities together with an assessment of the Commission's internal performance."
"We are convinced that with its administrative reform the Commission has made and is still making substantial progress here."
"And indeed Parliament also paid tribute to this reform programme."
"Mrs Morgan's report devotes much space to the question of whether in future the Court of Auditors should appraise the activities of each directorate-general and each department individually."
"In this context let me remind you that Article 276 of the EC Treaty refers to the discharge of the budget in general and not to individual parts or areas of the budget."
"In the same context let me observe that of course the risk of errors in implementing the budget regardless of whether they are major or minor ¬≠differs widely from one department to another because they have totally different operational budgets and face different risks."
"In the agricultural sector, for instance, Mr Fischler's total budget comes to approx. EUR 443 billion, while the budget of the Directorate-General for the budget is almost non-existent, so that, of course, there is hardly any risk at all there."
"During the general debate it will of course have to be decided whether there will be different levels of tolerance of errors, because naturally it is very much easier to implement the budget in, for example, the administrative sector, where salaries are paid."
"I would say the tolerance of errors should be more or less zero there, while in the area of external services, of foreign policy, quite different risks arise if, for instance, we provide humanitarian aid in a war zone."
"That too would have to be taken into account."
"You can see from what I said that I think it would be useful to discuss these proposals further in order to find out how to assign responsibilities more clearly here."
"After all, that is also what you seek to do in relation to the Member States."
"Let me point out that I will take the opportunity to discuss these proposals at the next meeting with the Member States' representatives concerned with financial control."
"And I will happily report back on this discussion to the committee."
"Once again, congratulations on your report."
"Mr President, just a quick correction."
"Commissioner, the point of departure for forwarding information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"I just wanted that made clear."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Takeover bids"
"The next item is recommendation for second reading (A5-0368/2000) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on company law concerning takeover bids [8129/1/2000 - C5-0327/2000 - 1995/0341(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislative project at second reading is a really complex project, which does not make it easy to explain the context we are dealing with here."
"I will try to do so nevertheless."
"In my view, the common position before us, which we have to decide on today, has a number of crucial weaknesses, which for the rest nobody has disputed so far during the debate in terms of principle."
"The first crucial weakness is the lack of harmonisation."
"This common position, which after all concerns the takeover of companies, seeks to protect the shareholders."
"I regard that as an aim most definitely worth trying to achieve."
"But in fact it also requires certain framework conditions."
"After all this is supposed to be a framework directive."
"In regard to a number of issues in connection with hostile takeovers, with takeovers in general, which simply have to be regulated, this common position does not really regulate anything."
"Take for example the issue of what is called the takeover threshold, as from which a compulsory offer can be made, the issue of what is called the equitable price to be offered to the shareholders, or even the issue of the circumstances under which cash payments are made obligatory."
"We have merging stock markets in Europe."
"I believe that against this background it is urgently necessary not just to leave these questions open but to settle them."
"For that simple reason the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I am presenting today includes a whole raft of amendments containing concrete proposals on how these issues could be resolved."
"I also consider it right to make these proposals, for if we do not settle these matters we must at least ask ourselves seriously, in face of the problems involved, whether there is any point at all in this directive."
"To inscribe in a directive that shareholders must be paid an equitable price is about as useful as saying that an apple will fall from the tree when it is ripe."
"Then you should also say in it what that equitable price actually is and what this whole business is really about."
"The second major problem in this directive is Article 9."
"The purpose of the directive is supposed to be to create a level playing field in Europe."
"But unless the directive is amended, the end result of this common position would be that not only do we not have a level playing field with North America, we do not even have one within Europe."
"The Americans have what they call the 'Business Judgment Rule', i.e. the possibility of mounting a defence against takeovers."
"The common position provides on principle for a strict obligation of neutrality in Europe."
"That means that in future it will be easy for American companies to take over European ones."
"The other problem is that there is no level playing field in Europe either."
"In a number of countries, the United Kingdom being the classical example with its London Stock Exchange, which has been much described, company law provides for the possibility of in effect excluding takeovers by restrictions to the right to vote in the company statute."
"So the end result of Article 9 as it now stands would be that some companies in some countries in Europe could be taken over much more easily, while other companies in other countries in Europe could virtually never be taken over if they have provisions of that kind in their statute."
"That is why Article 9 also needs to be amended."
"The next problem is the issue of the competent supervisory authority."
"The common position devotes three pages to regulating this issue."
"If it takes three pages to do so, then clearly there will be enough points of reference and opportunities for dispute and we will create no legal certainty."
"That is why I believe we must also improve Article 4."
"I just want to make one more observation."
"In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we managed to find compromise amendments over and above the groups."
"These compromise amendments do not please everyone in this House."
"That is in the nature of compromise amendments."
"But what is crucial is that we realise that this directive has serious weaknesses and that is beyond dispute."
"The only way to remedy these weaknesses is by deciding to opt for conciliation here by a majority of 314 votes."
"It is quite clear that the result of the conciliation will not in the end be the same as what the Council decided or what Parliament decides tomorrow."
"The result will be another compromise."
"If we do not adopt these amendments before us tomorrow, we will not achieve that further compromise and the directive will remain as bad as it is now."
"So I can only ask this House to endorse the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's compromise amendments."
"If certain circles in the Commission or elsewhere fear the directive could come to nothing, then I must honestly say I do not think so."
"Since the conciliation procedure was first introduced between Parliament and the Council, which is now more than six years, only a single directive, the one on the bio-patent, came to nothing in the conciliation procedure."
"A short while later it was, nonetheless, adopted both by the Council and by Parliament."
"I really do not know why we should not eventually succeed in reaching a compromise in this case, as with all other directives."
"So I certainly do not share the concern voiced here."
"We are pursuing a perfectly normal procedure."
"We should complete the second reading successfully and then seek a good compromise in the conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to remind Members of the House of Rule 9(2), referring to Annex I, Article 1: ""Before speaking in Parliament or in one of its bodies, any Member who has a direct financial interest in the subject under debate shall disclose this interest to the meeting orally."""
"In view of the fact that Mr Lehne proposes to strengthen the role of company directors, it is quite obvious that Members may want to declare that before speaking."
"It does not stop them from speaking; it may not affect our rapporteur; but certainly it applies to some members of his group who hold senior positions in the Bertelsmann media group."
"Mr President, I ought to declare that I am a director of the CN Group."
"My friend Mr Lehne has given the position of the EPP Group."
"I am going to give the position of the British Conservative delegation and a number of other Members."
"However, it is not necessarily a full and accurate description of the EPP Group's position, which he has given."
"When a public company is listed, the management and owners are telling the world that investors are free to buy and sell stock in it without the shadow of management or the state rigging the market against them."
"The European single market is a pan-European market place but within which the market in shares must be treated like other markets so that national boundaries, even if they delineate different jurisdictions, do not interfere with the essential equivalence of the rules across the market place."
"Within the single market investors, be they private, corporate or pension funds, should be able to exercise the rights of ownership to the benefit of the companies in which they invest and for those investors in them."
"In my country, we have real reservations about the common position, but in the spirit of good will have been prepared to accept it."
"Unfortunately, we believe that some of the proposed amendments do not improve it."
"On the contrary, some will fatally damage the project of a single pan-European take-over regime."
"To be effective, useful and in the public interest, such a directive must: first, avoid direct involvement of the courts, but rather have a regulator with wide powers of discretion under the rule of law; secondly, clarify and have workable rules on jurisdiction; thirdly, clarify definitions of equitable price and set proper thresholds; fourthly, ensure management cannot improperly frustrate shareholders taking their legitimate decisions about the future of the company in which they own a stake."
"If we fail to get this directive right, it will tell the world that Europe will not face the realities of the global market."
"That will not mean that it will not have to do so in due course; rather it will merely mean that adjustment will be more prolonged and painful and the victims will be European jobs and European prosperity."
"Mr President, it seems that we are finally at the end of the road on the proposal for a directive which will regulate takeover bids."
"It is a proposal that has gone down a long and, I fear, stormy road in order to overcome some of the existing problems."
"It is true that there have been many problems."
"It is also true that the political agreement obtained in the Council last year enabled some of them to be resolved."
"I will therefore offer a few thoughts on the function of Parliament: in a codecision procedure, in which a political agreement has been reached on a complex matter, what should be the role of the European Parliament?"
"Should our role be limited to saying ""Amen"" to the Council' s proposals?"
"I do not think this should be the case, ladies and gentlemen."
"By this I do not mean that, once that agreement has been obtained in the Council, Parliament should decide to blow it out of the water."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are politicians and therefore, we are always in favour of reaching political agreements."
"These thoughts are fully applicable to this report."
"The Council has reached an agreement that should be respected on its main points, as the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, has done in his magnificent report, on which I sincerely congratulate him. And I congratulate him not only on respecting the main points of that agreement, but also on seeking formulae which - and I stress, while respecting the main points - try to improve the legislative proposal."
"This is, in my understanding, the role of a colegislative institution such as Parliament in the codecision procedure."
"The amendments that our Committee is tabling can be grouped into three blocks."
"In the first block are a series of technical amendments that aim to either clarify concepts or fill gaps."
"I am not going to dwell on them."
"In the second block are a series of amendments that aim to improve the participation of workers when there is a takeover bid."
"We cannot close our eyes to reality: when there is a takeover there is staff restructuring, redundancies and so on, in short, measures which affect jobs."
"It is therefore important that workers and their representatives should be informed, from the start, of what is being planned and that they can make their voice heard in the actual takeover procedure."
"The third block contains those amendments that have been most controversial during the procedure."
"And I would like to have the power of conviction to prevent you from having any fears about the consequences that could be deduced from the approval of those amendments."
"It is true that the European Parliament Rules of Procedure do not make this easy, making these debates into a pure and simple dialogue between the deaf."
"What can we do?"
"The first amendment refers to Article 4, which establishes what will be the competent authority for supervising the bid."
"In paragraph 1 it is established that it will be that of the Member State in which the company concerned has its headquarters, if - logically - its securities are admitted to trading in that Member State."
"What happens if they are not admitted to trading in that Member State?"
"An answer is proposed that does not appear to be compatible with another amendment tabled by other Members, undoubtedly in good faith, requiring the criterion of headquarters."
"Because if the securities are not traded there, why should they be supervised by that authority?"
"The second controversial amendment refers to the duty of neutrality."
"Here we met with very conflicting and even opposed positions, and a formula has been reached that permits some exceptional hypotheses in order to carry out some defensive manoeuvres when it is not possible to call a general meeting."
"My Group and I are going to support these amendments."
"Mr President, I fear that we are in danger of losing the plot or losing sight of what this directive is about."
"It is part of the financial services action plan; in our Commissioner's own words, ""a key element in the creation of a fully integrated market in financial services, giving investors and consumers more choice""."
"The proposals introduce three key elements at a time when there is a change in control of a company: protection of minority shareholders, transparency in relation to bid information and regulatory supervision of the process."
"But what are we in danger of doing as a Parliament, by virtue of the amendments tabled?"
"Firstly, we are being far from transparent."
"Some of the amendments seem to be a covert attempt to introduce some elements of a company statute through the back door."
"Secondly, we are adopting rigid structures and procedures when the recommendation of the Commission was actually light-touch, allowing Member States leeway to reflect national practice in corporate culture."
"Lastly, the issue of clarity: the lack of this is especially evident in the debate about jurisdiction, an issue of which I have a little experience."
"The common position suggested some form of split arrangement."
"Now we have a proposition that would lead to muddle, forum shopping, potential litigation at a delicate moment in a corporate deal."
"This is not helpful."
"Jurisdiction should be solely in the hands of the Member State where the target company is registered."
"This is fair for minority shareholders, transparent and, above all, clear."
"Indeed I would ask the Commissioner to consider whether he can accept my amendment on this crucial point."
"The Financial Times editorial today talked about bid politics: that it has taken no less than 10 years to get this draft and that we, Parliament, could destroy that in 10 minutes tomorrow by voting through misguided amendments."
"I hope that will not be the case."
"Mr President, I should like to assure Mrs Wallis that I shall vote for her Amendment No 19 for the very reasons which she has given - and I hope my group will be following me."
"This is a matter on which clarity is of the utmost importance."
"Similarly we will reject the critical part of Amendment No 17, which would exclude shareholders from deciding on the merits of a bid for a company that they own."
"The ground for this is that it is not for governments, supervisory authorities or incumbent management to accept or frustrate a bid."
"It rests with the company's owners - the shareholders themselves."
"That is the principle on which perhaps we will divide tomorrow: what should be the over-riding concern of a law regulating takeovers."
"If you think that the correct thing is fairness and transparency towards all shareholders - majority and minority alike - then that determines your vote on a number of the issues here."
"There are some points where I would be happy to go along with the compromise amendments, particularly those affecting the position of employees."
"I understand Mr Lehne's desire to get the thing taken into conciliation and further clarified."
"I have some sympathy with his point."
"But we must approach this with the governing principle of shareholder protection in our minds."
"Mr President, the aim of this report - to establish common rules in Europe on takeover bids - relates only to a tiny minority of large corporations and their major shareholders, who dominate company ownership."
"In the legal wrangling between the Council and Parliament, there was not even any mention of the workers, technicians and employees who actually turn the wheels of these companies which the large financial groups are fighting over."
"The European institutions care little about the job losses and closures caused by almost every company takeover or merger."
"Personally speaking, I have no interest in the legal problems these large shareholders may have, and I will vote against this report."
"However, I would like to express my solidarity with the people exploited by these companies, and if Parliament had any respect whatsoever for the workers, it would at least prevent takeovers causing redundancies."
"Mr President, after 18 years working in financial services, I do not believe this directive is needed."
"In the UK the regulation of takeovers through the voluntary code of practice administered by the takeover panel has been highly successful: a good example here of a pragmatic approach to a highly complex issue where legislation will be less appropriate."
"It should not escape our attention that the takeover market is primarily British."
"Activity in London exceeds the whole of the combined volume in the rest of Europe, therefore this measure will damage the United Kingdom."
"Many believe that the imposition of a legal code is simply a protectionist device to enable less efficient European companies to protect themselves from takeovers by resorting to complex legal actions."
"Are European companies so afraid of competition that they feel the need to shelter behind a restrictive law which will stifle rather than improve European competitiveness?"
"If not, then Members should vote against this directive."
"Mr President, company structures in the European market need to be made more efficient if Europe is to hold its own in the global market."
"It must also be possible to restructure companies between one EU country and another."
"This directive will probably not create the clear regulations which are now needed on the international stock market, but the battle is not yet lost."
"The problem is that stock exchange law is closely associated with company law and that it is difficult to harmonise the one area if the other is not harmonised."
"However the regulations are drawn up, someone will suffer."
"In a small market like Sweden' s, with relatively concentrated ownership, harmonising the level at which offers must be made at 30 per cent will create problems, and we are demanding greater flexibility."
"Greater flexibility is also required when it comes to the complete duty of neutrality recommended by the Council."
"German companies will have problems because Germany' s company law prohibits vote diversification."
"Greater understanding must be shown for national characteristics. Otherwise, there may be devastating consequences for an individual Member State' s company structure."
"It would, however, be easier to solve the problem of which supervisory authority is to have jurisdiction."
"The most flexible solution would be to choose the supervisory authority in that country in which the target company has its head office."
"Companies may be quoted on different markets, and companies with head offices in Sweden are not always quoted in Sweden."
"It would be strange to say the least if, for example, American authorities were to be responsible for a takeover involving two European companies."
"Anyone who wants to avoid such consequences has the opportunity to vote in favour of Amendment No 19, which makes it clear that it is the target company' s head office which counts."
"If we do not defend the duty of neutrality, there will be no point to the directive."
"If, moreover, we open the door to defensive measures, we shall perhaps make it more difficult to restructure European markets and, especially, to protect small shareholders."
"I just want to emphasise that the Conciliation Committee has a very big responsibility and that success requires everyone to pull together."
"Mr President, it has been said that this is a very important, crucial piece of legislation we have before us."
"It is at the heart of the EU financial services action plan."
"But, more than that, the bigger prize is that we are able to take forward the Lisbon agenda of creating a competitive, dynamic European economy."
"For that we need an efficient market in goods, services and capital."
"Mr Bolkestein, I share your concerns: we cannot afford to risk losing this directive, because the EU economy would pay the opportunity cost for years of not being able to restructure European companies."
"Yet the amendments tabled by our rapporteur will take us in that direction."
"I fear it will undermine the effect of corporate restructuring necessary to build that EU competitiveness in global markets."
"If we are to achieve global excellence in, for example, the telecoms sector, we must ensure that recent take-overs such as Vodafone, Mannesmann, France Telecom, Orange, will show that European models work, cannot be blocked by hostile action or poison pills."
"That would be turning our back on the opportunity to achieve the competitiveness that we desire."
"My delegation of Labour MEPs cannot accept, therefore, the changes in Article 9 to allow company boards the right to defensive measures to frustrate takeovers without getting shareholder approval."
"Mr Bolkestein himself has said that it is crucial that the management of target companies consult shareholders in this case."
"Our primary objective must be to protect our investors, to ensure a fair and equal bidding process."
"It must be to ensure efficient flow in capital markets; and we must not end up by producing legislation which protects potentially inefficient managers and props up failing companies."
"That is in nobody's interest."
"It will result in investors not seeing the EU as an integrated capital market; it will undermine investor confidence and it will result in capital flow out of Europe."
"The rapporteur's amendments create confusion in the area of litigation and it would be wrong of us to vote for confusion in potential litigation cases."
"I have to say that I cannot understand Mr Lehne's approach in the British Economist, where he has himself agreed that his compromise is unworkable, but that he put it in to keep the socialists happy and he is prepared to take it out in conciliation."
"That is not acceptable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important that after more than ten years of deliberations at EU level the important question of the minimum harmonisation of take-over law can be regulated by a useful framework directive, although, as Mr Lehne said, the final proposal raises a few technical problems as also problems of content and we assume that unfortunately this proposal can only be improved through the conciliation procedure."
"But it should be pointed out that the situation has definitely changed since the first reading."
"Foreign investment within the EU doubled between 1997 and 1998 and cross-border mergers and take-overs have reached record levels."
"Hitherto we have not had binding rules on take-overs either in Community law or in the legislation of a good number of Member States."
"The directive on take-over bids therefore seems necessary to ensure fair competition and for reasons of legal certainty."
"I am in the fortunate position of being able to say that since 1 January 1999 Austria has had its own take-over legislation."
"Austrian take-over legislation, and in particular its implementation by the take-over commission, has more or less proved its worth since it entered into force."
"Here in the European Parliament we are chiefly concerned with finding minimum European rules to regulate the major fields of tension in take-over law, for instance the boards against the shareholders, large shareholders against small ones, companies against the stock market."
"Furthermore, it is essential for the Member States to have the possibility, in accordance with the overall objectives and in the framework of the directive, to adopt useful, further-reaching rules, such as for example the provision on the promotion of equal treatment of all shareholders that we have in our current Austrian take-over law, by ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, first I want to welcome the work Mr Lehne has done and the fact that he took up this whole job again."
"It is a pity the report took so long."
"Once again, time is running away with us in politics."
"It is economics that sets the pace."
"The reason this feels like a rather eerie debate has less to do with the time of night and even less with the sparsity of Members now present, but more with what is in fact going on."
"We are talking about a Europe that is supposed to unite, and what do we hear?"
"British lobbyists against this Europe, against any hint of the social model that keeps being paraded in the electoral campaigns."
"It would be really nice if British Labour obviously we cannot expect anything like that from the Conservatives any more would for once move outside the borders of the City of London."
"Once upon a time it was said that 'Britain rules the waves', now we hear that 'Britain is drifting away'."
"Why are we always taken hostage for this little City of London?"
"Why are we not honest enough to say that take-overs will become a major social problem if we do not cushion them?"
"Why do we not dare to stand by what we keep announcing in our campaign speeches?"
"In concrete terms we know that 70% of mergers go wrong."
"BMW/Rover was a disaster."
"Daimler/Chrysler is visibly becoming a crime, when we look at what is going on there."
"Does Mr Lehne's report go far enough?"
"No, but I do believe it is a first step in a certain direction."
"I personally and I wish that for once the same would apply to British Labour too will support the amendments that lead to more regulation."
"We do not want to see American conditions here at home."
"We do not need them."
"The European economy is doing very well."
"In the United Kingdom the social differences are widening ever further."
"We need this for insider deals, for cartel law. Does might come before right?"
"That is the question."
"But the answer is that the Lehne report is at least a small step towards empowering the people of Europe."
"Mr President, it is interesting to follow Mr Martin as an English speaker and I can assure him that things are certainly not falling apart in the British economy even though my party would like a change of government."
"A point I want to make with regard to this takeover directive is to bring the argument very firmly back to millions of electors in my country and millions of people who have pension plans and savings that are based upon investments in the stock market."
"Mrs McCarthy quite rightly reminded us to declare an interest."
"So let me declare an interest."
"I have a pension fund from my previous employer."
"A lot of its value is based on investments in the British stock market and I rely on investment managers to keep my investment safe and to develop it for my future retirement."
"That, of course, is a major strength, Mr Martin, for the British economy because we have those funds there at a time when our society is growing older and we need to provide those pensions."
"We do not have an overhang of publicly funded pensions."
"That is something that everyone in the European Union is going to have to tackle and this takeover directive, in the final form that comes through has to address that issue."
"The problem with the amendments that we have before us is that, if this goes through, the people who are managing my pension fund will not be able to maximise that value for me."
"That applies to millions of ordinary individuals working in companies up and down the United Kingdom."
"It is their future that we are talking about."
"This is not some abstract concept."
"It goes to the heart of the British economy and it is something that increasingly will be critical for the future of the European economy as well."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for the attention it is giving this proposal and for the work that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and particularly the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, have carried out."
"This attention is certainly justified, in view of the importance of the text, which the Heads of State and Government made a priority during the European Council of Lisbon in March 2000."
"After all, were it to be approved, it would bring about a considerable improvement in the operation and stability of the European financial markets."
"I am particularly delighted that I can at last discuss this common position, which we had a long wait for, but which was finally adopted by the Member States last June by unanimous vote."
"Some of the amendments proposed by Parliament further improve the text of the Council' s common position because they highlight points that could lead to interpretation difficulties and push for speedier transposition of the directive."
"Hence the Commission approves Amendments Nos 7, 14 and 18."
"It prizes Amendment No 18 particularly highly, the aim of which is to reduce the deadline for transposition, in accordance with a wish already expressed by the Commission on numerous occasions."
"Indeed, it has constantly highlighted the need to waste no time in implementing this directive, which is something all interested parties have looked forward to so much."
"The Commission has also taken note of the statements brought to the fore by Amendments Nos 5 and 13."
"Whilst the Commission has no objection to these suggestions, it would point out that they do not belong in this directive."
"The current text guarantees employees appropriate information on the conditions and repercussions of the bid."
"Stipulations that go further in this area are not in keeping with the objectives of the directive, which relates to the protection of the share holders."
"The labour conditions and employee rights in the event that enterprises are restructured are provided for in other Community directives."
"The Commission would also like to demonstrate its interest in Amendment No 12."
"This amendment seeks to introduce an instrument enabling a majority shareholder to take over the remaining securities."
"However, this procedure, which already exists in certain Member States, does not just affect the field of public takeover bids but extends much further and could, if necessary, be studied more closely as part of the general review of company law undertaken by the Commission."
"So I would suggest adding this topic to the list of subjects that could be submitted to a committee of experts."
"Much to its regret, the Commission is unable to approve the other amendments, and this is for a variety of reasons."
"Amendments Nos 2 and 10 are unacceptable because they alter the scope of application of the directive."
"The directive relates to all public and exclusively public offers to purchase or exchange, be they voluntary or mandatory."
"Amendments Nos 4 and 15 are unacceptable because they do not belong in the intended stipulations."
"These only concern holders of securities in the first case and the supervisory authority in the second."
"Amendments Nos 8 and 9 are without foundation."
"After all, it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory."
"Finally, the Commission studied the content of the amendments in depth but it cannot accept a single one of them."
"For example, Amendments Nos 6, 11 and 16 appear to pass over the existing national provisions that the text of the common position is in fact trying to bring closer together."
"Amendment No 6 in particular, contains an amalgam of ideas that were all addressed to a lesser or greater extent during the discussions on the directive, and were rejected because they did not seem to be suitable."
"Particularly the appointment of the competent authority, whilst the text of the common position came about after consultation with the supervisory authorities themselves."
"Then there is the definition of the percentage that confers control over the company, which ties in with other provisions in the field of company law, which differ considerably from Member State to Member State."
"Amendment No 17, in its turn, should it be approved, could make it impossible for there to be any kind of hostile takeover bid."
"The Commission has no objection to extending the neutrality obligation to after the official deadline of the bid, as proposed in the first paragraph."
"However, the Commission cannot go along with Parliament' s proposal to allow the board of a particular company to determine the future of the company without taking account of the shareholders' position, by simply submitting its decisions to the judgement of the competent authorities or the judge."
"A solution of this kind threatens on the one hand to lead to confusion over the role of the supervisory authorities, which must remain independent and impartial, and on the other hand to the systematic institution of legal proceedings that can be time-consuming and expensive and which benefit neither the companies concerned, the members of their Boards, nor the other interested parties, and particularly the employees."
"The situation in the United States can teach us a thing or two on that score, and should be a warning to us to proceed more cautiously."
"On a final note, may I remind you that this is a framework directive, as requested by Parliament at an earlier stage."
"Nevertheless, the directive stipulates firstly, that a committee of experts from the Member States and from the Commission are to supervise the implementation and application of the text, and secondly, it includes a review clause for making any changes which may prove necessary in the future."
"Lastly, the Commission would point out that should this House approve the proposed amendments, it could prove very difficult for an agreement to be reached between the Council and Parliament."
"That said, the Commission is convinced, and it is supported in this by the economic operators involved, that the text, which is the product of over ten years of negotiations - which is longer than is needed to take account of all interests - is a good starting point, and it is high time we took action."
"Finally, a further two new amendments have been tabled about which I have the following comments to make."
"Amendment No 19 is unacceptable, for the same reason that Amendment No 6 is unacceptable."
"As for Amendment No 20, which is similar to Amendment No 17, the same applies to both, albeit for slightly different reasons."
"The first part is acceptable, just as it is in Amendment No 17."
"The second part is not because the term 'Aufsichtsrat' - to use the German expression - is encompassed by the Dutch term 'bestuur' (board) and is subject to the same obligations as all managers of a company."
"The third part of it is unacceptable for the same reason that no so-called 'social amendments' are acceptable."
"That is what I wanted to say on the issues raised by Parliament and needless to say the Commission is looking forward with enormous interest to the vote on this subject."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Resale right"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0370/2000) by Mr Zimmerling, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the resale right for the benefit of the author of an original work of art [7484/1/00 - C5-0422/2000 - 1996/0085(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is considering at second reading the harmonisation of artists' right of resale, thus taking up again a directive for the benefit of artists as also galleries and auction houses in Europe that has been under discussion since 1996."
"First I want to thank those colleagues who have assisted with this project."
"It was very difficult to resolve the problems in a way that was useful for those concerned."
"In the end we did manage to do so thanks to the goodwill of all the groups in this House, as shown in particular by the decision in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I owe special thanks to Mr Dehousse and Mr Echerer, whose many discussions helped bring about workable compromises."
"Right of resale is the unassignable and inalienable right of creative artists to receive a share of the profits made from the selling on of their works."
"As such it forms part of societal copyright protection and is the expression of the societal acknowledgement of artistic creativity."
"It needs to be harmonised because although it already applies in many EU states, it has not so far been recognised in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland or Austria."
"That leads to considerable distortions of competition because it means that in one country an artist profits from the resale, whereas in another he gets nothing."
"That is not acceptable in the European market and is contrary to the requirements of the single market."
"The report proposes the following specific amendments to the Council's common position."
"Right of resale should extend to the professional trade in works of art."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes graduating the amount of royalties to be paid by the seller on the basis of a percentage rate of 4% for the portion of the sale price up to EUR 50 000 and 1% for the portion above EUR 200 000."
"Moreover, the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years, which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales."
"So here we must not allow a collective management firm to be involved."
"The new minimum sale price of EUR 1 000 repeats a proposal the European Parliament made at first reading."
"Most transactions in Europe take place up to the threshold sale price of EUR 4 000 provided for in the Council's common position, so that this area needs to be harmonised now."
"For amounts below EUR 1 000, however, there is no need for harmonisation since this does not affect the European market and on the basis of subsidiarity no European right of resale should apply."
"Furthermore, we have deleted the Council's proposed ceiling of EUR 12 500 as the highest amount of royalties an artist may receive, since there is no reason why successful artists should be penalised."
"In regard to the time limits for implementing this directive, on my proposal the committee decided to set a deadline of two years for each Member State to transpose it into its national law and during which the rights of the successor in title must be enforced in countries that have not hitherto recognised the right of resale."
"The time limits of five and ten years wanted by the Council and in particular by the United Kingdom are unacceptable because in effect this would simply enshrine the status quo and would only benefit the art market in the United Kingdom."
"The reservations voiced in several quarters can be summarised in two major groups."
"On the one side, UK lobbyists fear job losses."
"However, I do not see any risk of art markets relocating to Switzerland or the USA, since the insurance and transport costs exceed the costs involved in the right of resale and make it unprofitable to relocate."
"In addition, it is in the interests of both Switzerland and the USA to introduce a right of resale once we have adopted a harmonised right of resale in Europe."
"The second problem concerns Austria, where groups of artists have formed who fear the directive will have adverse effects and therefore oppose it."
"This is based on the quite mistaken assumption that it is compulsory to involve collective management firms, as has hitherto been the case in Austria."
"But that is precisely what the directive does not provide."
"Accordingly, this matter should be put before the Austrian legislator instead of attacking the European legislator who is only creating positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses."
"So I hope our UK colleagues will not show the same national tendency to block progress that we saw in Nice but that this Parliament will adopt a forward-looking European directive on the art market."
"Mr President, 11 out of the 15 EU countries recognise the right of resale. However, it is in force only in eight countries, and this is with varying degrees of success."
"The right of resale is not recognised in the legislation of Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Outside the European Union, neither Switzerland nor the United States recognise the right of resale."
"At first sight, establishing a legislative text concerning the right of resale would seem to be justified by a desire for equity and in order to benefit creative artists."
"In fact, the resale right does not benefit artists, quite the contrary: it hinders the market which should be dynamic and be able to grow with a minimum of restrictions."
"Consumer dynamics and sales potential are matters of concern to living artists who discern an increase in their market value and reassessment of their work."
"The resale right gives rise to complicated court cases, which are truly costly compared with the often modest sums involved, which generally do not reach the beneficiary."
"It entails additional administrative tasks, which serve to fuel criticism of European standards."
"It penalises the efforts of galleries who should be focussing on helping artists."
"It gives rise to fear, creates extra costs and administrative hassles for well-meaning potential buyers."
"And on occasion, it can lead to absurd situations: given that the right of resale is calculated on the basis of the resale price, in the event of depreciation transferring a work of art is more lucrative than actually creating one."
"Is it therefore necessary to extend this legislative text to the countries who do not want it - I am referring here to the United Kingdom which is currently at the top of the European art market - if to do so would be to threaten their competitiveness?"
"Mr President, to repeat a felicitous expression used by GESAC (the European Association of Authors' and Composers' Societies), the draft under discussion was subjected to unjustified attacks during its review by the Council."
"The agreement reached by the Council is no longer an accurate reflection of the Commission' s initial proposal, which was widely supported by Parliament at its first reading."
"The Socialist Group, as well as the greater part of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was astonished at the attitude of the Council of Ministers, whose position is unacceptable in several respects. The suggestion that transposition periods for Member States should be increased to 15 years is the least acceptable element, given that the Commission' s original proposal was four years ago."
"As a matter of principal, a 15-year time limit is unacceptable in such a rapidly changing world as our own. The industry will change beyond recognition in that time, mainly due to technological progress."
"In addition, setting this type of precedent at a time when the European Union is set to double in size would be to give out the wrong signal to candidate states."
"It would be better to give up the idea of a directive rather than establish such a time limit."
"The Socialist Group did not therefore want Parliament to discredit itself by accepting proposals which make a mockery of the votes cast at the first reading."
"So we are delighted, firstly, that Mr Zimmerling, the rapporteur, understands and shares our feelings on the issue of the time limit as well as many other problems, which he detailed this evening."
"We are moreover delighted that almost all the democratic groups share the same constructive point of view."
"Once again, the debate and the upcoming vote will be decided between those wishing to forge ahead with European integration and those who are prepared to let themselves be side-tracked by national interests (of dubious legitimacy) rather than the interests of European creative artists."
"It is furthermore essential that we find a common position on the matter in hand, since this is the only way that the European Union will be able to carry any weight internationally and to defend the interests of creative artists worldwide."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is difficult to understand why those who are against harmonising income tax should be in favour of this directive."
"Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party were very critical at first reading, and we still are."
"We believe that there would be damaging consequences for the European market if this directive were to be implemented before international harmonisation had taken place in this legal area."
"We do not believe that the deadlines for implementation should be shortened in the way proposed by the rapporteur."
"Nor do we believe there is proof that national minimum regulations concerning resale right are required in order to improve the internal market."
"As a previous speaker said, flourishing galleries and good systems of grants are important for young artists."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this dispute between all sorts of lobby groups I have always listened to what the European artists say."
"In my country, which does not have the right of resale, the artists are opposed to this directive."
"Understandably so, when you look at Austrian tradition in its home market, an internationally recognised market."
"I will have a hard job persuading the people in my country, but I am firmly convinced that the harmonisation of the right of resale, on the basis of the EP's proposals, will bring benefits to all concerned."
"I also hope for the Commission's support, at least on one of the three major points of dispute."
"And I am also thinking a step ahead."
"In the very near future we will have to make more effort to seek a dialogue with the collective management firms, we must jointly seek simpler and more transparent structures and ensure that the administrative costs of this directive do not become absurd."
"Collective management firms are not just a kind of collection agency, they are very important partners for the artists of Europe when it comes to their rights."
"The opinions expressed on the right of resale reflect the views not of the political groups but of the Member States."
"I have understanding for the different cultural traditions, but at the same time I beg this House to show the same European spirit that prevailed this morning."
"It is not just a question of individual national artists, national gallery owners and national auction houses."
"It is a question of the European art market and all the players involved, and especially the European creative artists."
"I put my trust in the wisdom and farsightedness of this House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although as I am sure you know I am a friend of European regulations when they are necessary, and against a European bazaar for national special interests, I have promised to put the concerns felt by the platform against the introduction of the right of resale and by the art world before this House, which represents the citizens of Europe."
"The right of resale remains as controversial as ever."
"In the end, the issue is the competitiveness of the European art market, which is already finding it hard to fight off foreign competition."
"In my own country, the artists themselves say that they feel they are being forced into this against their will and point to Germany, where fewer than 1% of the 42 000 artists have gained from the right of resale."
"The galleries, which play a crucial part in promoting young artists, are anxious and also oppose the right of resale, since it has to be applied even if a work of art is sold at a loss."
"The auction houses are concerned because the maximum amount of EUR 12 500 is no longer to apply."
"I think it is important to voice the concerns of the auction houses, the artists, the galleries, the art world of a country and a platform of artists in this debate and to take them into consideration."
"That has nothing to do with special national interests but contributes to an open and transparent political debate."
"Mr President, the Commissioner will also know there was unanimous consensus in Council on the common position."
"I hope you are going to take as robust a position on Mr Zimmerling's amendments as you did on the Lehne report."
"It is also an issue about the vitality and competitiveness of the European art market."
"If it was centred on Berlin I am sure that Mr Zimmerling would argue quite differently on transposition times and thresholds."
"Without an international droit de suite, the fact is that the European art market will go offshore."
"There is evidence to prove that."
"I too, like Mrs Echerer, must listen to artists."
"They are divided."
"There is K√ªnstler gegen Folgerecht. They are divided."
"It is arrogant of Mr Zimmerling to dismiss the views of people for whom we claim to legislate in this Parliament."
"We legislate in their interests."
"We should listen to their views as well."
"We can also see that the Folgerecht does not actually advantage many artists."
"In Germany, for example, in 1998, of 7 000 artists who transferred their rights, only 274 actually got any money from it and 40% of the droit de suite was taken up in costs in levying the sum."
"So there are some problems with how it currently operates."
"I want to use this opportunity to register my dismay that the Commission has failed to provide any analysis or evaluation of the economic impact of droit de suite."
"It is far too important a piece of legislation for it not to have done this work."
"I still fail to understand how the Commission reached the arbitrary threshold of EUR 1 000 with no scientific evidence to back that up."
"Therefore I must plead for a long transition period to open serious negotiations on an international droit de suite, without which we will lose the European art market, wherever it is located, whether it be Paris, Berlin or London."
"I do not believe artists will gain from that either."
"Mr President, I try to adopt a practical approach to this issue because I have one of the biggest art auction houses outside of London in my constituency."
"They had raised their fears about these proposals and I went back there recently and we looked at some case studies together."
"We took paintings from a recent auction that would have been affected by this proposal."
"With one item there would have been considerable difficulty in tracing the artist's family; only tracing agents and collecting societies would have benefited."
"In another case, the item would undoubtedly have been sold elsewhere, i.e. in America."
"The one artist we were able to contact who would have benefited was not interested and said it would all be too complex to help him or his family."
"I am afraid this leads me to the inevitable conclusion that we do not need this, and that without international agreement in place, it is one piece of internal market legislation that we can do without."
"Mr President, the droit de suite is an unknown legal right in the United Kingdom and we do not believe it is a beneficial addition to our law."
"This is because, as has already been pointed out, many artists have recently testified it does not in fact help them."
"Furthermore, as experience in France shows, the main beneficiaries are the heirs of dead, rich painters, not poor, living ones."
"At any event, why as a matter of principle should it be right to impose a levy on the sale of a second-hand picture and not to do the same to the maker of a second-hand car or the tailor of a second-hand suit?"
"It is also unnecessary in the single European art market, which for years has worked quite satisfactorily without it, as has already been pointed out this evening."
"In short, there is no need for harmonisation of this sort in this area."
"Nevertheless, we in the United Kingdom have, with misgivings and in a spirit of compromise, accepted a formula which includes its eventual introduction in the UK."
"It is complicated and takes years to come into effect."
"Cynics might say: a bit like the Treaty of Nice."
"But London, the centre of the art market in Europe, will disproportionately suffer if much of the trade goes off-shore to Geneva or the United States, unilaterally exporting British jobs with it, unless an international regime is put into place to eliminate global market distortion."
"If the substance of the compromise is not honoured, we would rather this unnecessary directive did not reach the statute book."
"If it did so, it would be a great injustice, especially to those whose livelihoods depend upon the art market and, in particular, the art market in London."
"I can assure the House that, if my party leader William Hague wins the general election, he will match the present Prime Minister's commitment to oppose this proposal in the essential interests of our country."
"It goes beyond what was agreed in the common position."
"Mr President, I would like to give my response to the comments made and the questions asked."
"The Commission welcomes the majority of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and congratulates Mr Zimmerling, the rapporteur, on this dedication to achieving agreement and the way in which he has been able to gain consensus on the most important questions, particularly that of the time limit, which is, in Amendments Nos 11 and 15, brought down to four years in total, made up of a two-year transitional period and two-year transposition period."
"This seems to be a reasonable period to enable the profession to adapt to the change and for national authorities to introduce the necessary changes in regulations."
"The second important issue is that of the total amount, which is removed in Amendment No 7."
"However, this amendment can be only partially approved."
"The Commission believes that to divide royalties into five portions, as set out in the common position, remains more effective than the proposed method, since it avoids possible loss of sales, especially in the highest portion of the sale price."
"The third and final issue is that of the threshold, which Amendment No 6 brings back down to EUR 1 000 or, in other words, to the Commission' s original proposal."
"I repeat, this amendment can be only partially approved since the Commission is not in a position to agree with you and make the threshold compulsory."
"The Commission believes that, on a national level, the abolition of the right to resale below this threshold cannot be justified due to the internal market. In some Member States, this may put artists at a disadvantage, in contrast to the situation prior to harmonisation."
"Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 7 which relates to this issue should also be rejected for the same reasons."
"To sum up, Mr President, the Commission is able to approve Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 and is able to approve Amendment Nos 6 and 7 only in part for the reasons mentioned previously. The Commission is able to approve Amendment No 9 as a recital and not as an article."
"However, the Commission is unable to approve Amendment No 4, which relates to the compulsory aspect of the threshold, or Amendment No 8, since the distinction made between heirs who are able to benefit from the right of resale is not the same as the concept of ownership of this right and arises solely from national law."
"A similar amendment was rejected at first reading."
"Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10 for the reason that to draw up and maintain a list of third countries where the right of resale is in force would create practical problems and would not enhance legal security."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.15 a.m.)"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I wish to inform the House of the news of the closure of a car factory in Luton in the United Kingdom, with the loss of many thousands of jobs."
"I am sure the House will be concerned to hear of this latest example of decline in industry in Europe."
"I have duly noted the fact."
"Competition between postal services"
"The next item is the report (A5-0361/2000) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/67/EC on opening to competition of Community postal services [COM(2000)0319 - C5-0375/2000 - 2000/0139(COD)]."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"If we are to debate this important question today, it is essential to have the amendments that were tabled in the various languages for us to know what we are debating."
"They are not available."
"I tried last night and first thing this morning."
"It seems to me an impossible state of affairs when we are debating a very important subject and amendments have come in late, together with those that went to committee, and we do not have them in our mother tongue."
"Mr Atkins, the services tell me that the delay was only for this week."
"They thought the translations could be made available in spite of this fairly difficult and densely packed timetable."
"Nonetheless, I have no doubt that this Chamber will have been able to examine each of the amendments in detail and I think it is possible to have the debate on this report."
"In any case, all the translations will be available to MEPs between now and the time of the vote."
"Madam President, I want to talk about the same point of order as Mr Atkins."
"I do not think it is usual for the discussion preceding a vote to be a discussion of amendments."
"We discussed the latter in committee."
"What is more, I was able to obtain these amendments yesterday and I believe that we are called upon to have a general discussion today."
"We shall have ample opportunity tomorrow to vote on the additional amendments tabled at the last minute by all the groups."
"I think that this important matter, close to the committee' s heart, ought to be debated today."
"That is what I propose, Mr Savary."
"Madam President, I believe we must discuss this matter today, because we are prepared for it and are waiting to discuss it, but I wish to refute Mr Savary's arguments regarding the amendments."
"It is actually scandalous that these are not available in time for our debate."
"It is certainly important, to my mind, that we know which honourable Members have tabled which amendments."
"For that reason, conducting a debate without access to the amendments must remain an exceptional situation."
"It is an extremely unusual procedure, and what Sir Robert Atkins says is essentially correct."
"Unfortunately, however, we have now reached the point at which we can no longer defer this discussion."
"I therefore ask, Madam President, that we begin the debate, but let me put on record that this practice of conducting a debate in ignorance of the tabled amendments is a highly abnormal practice."
"I share your point of view."
"Ideally, our Chamber ought to be able to have the debate after familiarising itself with all the documents and amendments."
"I nonetheless think that, as you have indicated, we can, in the present circumstances, enter into the debate in the normal way, and I therefore propose giving the floor to our rapporteur, Mr Ferber."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was actually our intention to let you all send your Christmas post and to wait until all the Christmas mail was delivered, after which we should have had ample time in January to discuss postal services in general."
"However, a majority of the House decided that we should hold the debate today, so that is what we shall have to do."
"When we discuss postal services, we have to speak about three things."
"What has surprised me slightly as rapporteur over the past few months is that we have somewhat lost sight of these three things."
"Firstly, we must ensure that postal services are provided at affordable prices; secondly, we must ensure that the services are of a high quality, and, thirdly, we must ensure that we are able to guarantee the availability of at least a minimum range of postal services in all parts of the European Union."
"This is what the people of Europe rightly expect of us."
"To that end, we have received a proposal from the Commission in accordance with the directive which was adopted in 1997."
"It is a matter of examining how much monopoly is needed to achieve these aims - especially the universal availability of services - and how much competition is possible alongside such a monopoly."
"I have always taken the view, as far as postal services are concerned, that there should be as much competition as possible and as much monopoly as is necessary."
"This, I believe, is a maxim that should be taken to heart."
"I very much regret that the numerous studies on postal services conducted by the Commission in recent years do not give any clear indication as to how much monopoly is required for a guaranteed universal postal service."
"Such an indication would have made my work a little easier and would certainly have helped Parliament too."
"As things stand, everyone has been able to pick and choose from this wide range of studies as he or she has seen fit."
"So what exactly is it all about?"
"It is about the degree of monopoly we require."
"The Commission proposed that the monopoly service be restricted to letters weighing 50 grammes or less."
"At the committee stage, we agreed on a compromise, namely letters up to a weight of 150 grammes."
"The Commission proposed the full liberalisation of cross-border mail."
"We in the reporting committee agreed on a compromise, namely that the same weight ceiling should apply to cross-border mail and national mail."
"The Commission proposed that legal certainty be created in the realm of the so-called special services, which is understandable, given the problems that exist here, especially in the Directorate-General for Competition."
"We decided in committee to leave the question of special services as it is regulated in Directive 97/67/EC."
"The Commission proposed a review of the directive in 2004."
"Our committee proposed that this be undertaken one year earlier."
"We also agreed that the period of validity of this directive should remain unchanged."
"Back in 1997, at the time of the decisive vote on the last directive, I told Martin Bangemann, who was the Commissioner responsible at that time, that the only good thing to be said about the old directive was that it had an expiry date, that it would eventually lapse."
"I believe it is right to continue this practice, because it exerts pressure on the markets, and that is absolutely essential if we are to achieve what the people expect of us."
"As citizens of our countries, we pay for this monopoly every day with overpriced postage stamps throughout the European Union."
"The quality of the postal services has not improved over the past 500 years!"
"We have to think about all of that. It is not the responsibility of postal administrations to create jobs throughout each country, but it is their responsibility to move mail from A to B. If we just concentrate on what the core business of postal administrations is and on the need to ensure that markets are opened up judiciously and gradually - not abruptly, but gradually; the Commission went for abrupt change in its proposal, but we in the committee agreed on a different approach - then it will certainly be possible to safeguard what needs to be safeguarded."
"I ask you to support the compromise we worked out in committee."
"Madam President, the opinion of the committee of which I have the honour to be draftsman, which was approved by a very large majority, introduces limitations to the rapid liberalisation of the postal services, opting for a gradual and controlled opening to competition without market distortions which would be detrimental to the services' customers and users and to the national universal service companies."
"Thus, we propose that the opening should take into account Article 16 of the Treaty, which raises the provision of traditional postal services to the category of services of general interest, given the place they occupy in the shared values of the Union and their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion, for which reason they should operate on the basis of principles and conditions that enable them to fulfil their missions."
"Naturally, we point out weaknesses in the draft directive, requiring that the economic and social impact of liberalisation be made known and an assessment be made of the economic effectiveness and service quality provided by the companies so that Parliament can decide with certainty and clarity."
"Without jeopardising the modernisation of all postal services and the opening to competition, Member States must continue to preserve their rural network of counter services, which help bring the remote places closer to centres of decision making and are thus indispensable to the social cohesion of the smallest urban or rural communities."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has been even more demanding as regards price limits on services reserved for the universal provider, but it proposes the same 150-gramme weight limit and jointly rejects the 50 grammes laid down in the draft directive."
"The difference from the basic report is a simple matter of detail included within the framework of a parliamentary discussion, which, incidentally, has been extremely well conducted by the rapporteur, Mr Ferber."
"It is also guaranteed that cross-border mail will remain a service reserved for the postal services, and also, if VAT comes to be levied on postal services, that the tax should be levied at a reduced rate so as not to raise the price of stamps in the Community."
"My committee has clearly rejected the idea of special services, which, as I understand it, were aimed at draining the universal service of any profitable activities, leaving it only with services where costs outweighed prices, and it also made subject to liberalisation the so-called new services, defined as ""all those that the universal service provider does not undertake or is not naturally obliged to produce"" ."
"Madam President, there would be much more to say, but I shall confine myself to adding that only rarely has there been such political consensus on an issue among the various committees called upon to express their opinions in this Parliament."
"Postal services, like schools, roads, and bridges, are part of the European cultural landscape and our shared concept of civilisation."
"This Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and will continue to support them."
"- (FR) Madam President, I should first of all like to pay tribute to all our fellow MEPs who have worked so hard on this matter and, in particular, the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Markus Ferber, who has exhibited a most commendable sense of compromise and balance."
"As we have just been reminded, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has tabled a number of amendments and slight modifications to the Commission' s proposals too."
"As is well known, there are two conflicting visions here of what are called public services, and I hope that it will be possible to reconcile them one day."
"According to the first view, public services cannot be truly European unless they are transformed into markets, that is to say unless the private sector is given the infrastructures, know-how and networks patiently acquired sometimes in the public domain and, where postal services are concerned, practically always in the public domain."
"The second view is that, if postal services are to be opened up to competition, there must be no conflict between traditional and modern practices. It must also take place in a Europe of rights, that is to say a Europe whose citizens, and in particular, those who are in most difficulty, are assured a minimum of what may be considered essential rights."
"Naturally, the latter view should be taken of postal services for, as has just been seen, the post office is not just an ordinary public service."
"It is a public service in which the human and social dimensions are very important."
"It is a public service whose network is sometimes the last civic link with democratic institutions in difficult places such as inner cities."
"It is also a public service which has a notable territorial aspect to it."
"For all these reasons, the postal services which are now to be opened to competition and which are to a very large extent already in competition where very many products are concerned and which are themselves subject to competition from new technologies and are faced with new consumer expectations, as we are agreed, cannot be treated as a mere market."
"As we have all agreed, it is therefore only right to talk in terms of a universal service, that is to say a service offered to everyone throughout the territory of the European Union."
"What is unacceptable, however, is for the cost of the service to be identical in every country, given the differences in geography and population density."
"What might be acceptable for the Netherlands or Malta, that is to say a reserved sector reduced to 50 grammes, may not be practicable where Greece or France is concerned because of the geography of these countries."
"That is why I, personally, am happy that we have compromised by setting the minimum weight/price limit at 150 grammes."
"Finally, the universal service should be in a position to develop."
"There is no reason why the service offered to people should not incorporate all kinds of technical and economic progress, and I believe that, from this point of view, doing away with special services is a step for which no clarification had first been provided."
"Finally, a new date for liberalisation is unacceptable until a prior assessment has been made."
"That has been the major misunderstanding in this debate."
"The Commission ought to have provided us with an impact study of the various phases of liberalisation."
"It has not done so. It must do so next time without fail."
"Madam President, I welcome the fact that in committee we managed to achieve a balanced compromise on this issue and I hope that Parliament will adopt that position in substance tomorrow."
"In response to Mr Ferber and his contention that postal companies do not have an obligation to create jobs, I agree with him, but believe that we have a responsibility to create an environment where companies like postal companies can deliver a good, efficient, universal postal service and to ensure that the jobs thereby provided are good-quality jobs."
"That is our responsibility."
"No one is arguing that there should be no change in relation to postal services."
"Technology and changing markets will drive change, in any event."
"I agree with the generally declared objective that there should be gradual and controlled change; but I disagree that the Commission's proposal is in any way controlled or in any way gradual."
"It seems to me that the Commission's proposal goes too far, too quickly, and that, in fact, it would devastate some national universal service providers."
"I know from my own experience in Ireland that the Irish postal company would indeed be devastated."
"Forty-six per cent of its revenue would be opened to competition."
"It would not be able to survive in such an environment, it could not deliver universal services in Ireland, it could not maintain the current level of local post offices in Ireland as a result of such competition."
"I urge the Commission to reconsider its position and accept Parliament's position."
"But, in particular, I urge the Member States in Council to consider their position; and I am quite concerned that despite the fact that Members of the governing party in Ireland are supporting the compromise position here in Parliament, the Irish Government is not supporting that position."
"Madam President, Commissioner, may I begin by reiterating my thanks to my honourable colleague Markus Ferber on behalf of our group, because he sought compromises within the committee and he found them."
"You know how difficult this issue is; it is laden with ideological overtones, sometimes from both sides."
"We therefore owe him our thanks for rallying a large majority behind a sound compromise."
"Our group agrees with the Commissioner and with the Lisbon meeting of the European Council, though not that of Nice, that further steps need to be taken to open the market in postal services."
"Competition in the postal sector, as it has done elsewhere, will ensure that we have a more effective and an affordable service for consumers."
"However, my group also takes the view that we as a Community and as Member States must naturally ensure that conditions are created for the provision of a universal service too."
"But, Mr Savary, the purpose of the universal service is to offer the postal services that people typically require and to offer them at affordable prices throughout the territory of the Member States."
"The purpose of the universal service is not to act as a citizens' advice bureau or to organise psychological counselling."
"The fact is that, in order to make a universal service possible, we are reserving a domain in which monopolies can operate."
"In other words, in this exceptional case we are deliberately excluding competition."
"But this exclusion must only apply to postal services and not to advisory services, social services or anything else."
"We cannot find any legal grounds for excluding competition from these other domains."
"So, if a Member State wants to have a nation-wide citizens' advice network, it should pay for it. When I buy a postage stamp, I should not be helping to finance a citizens' advice service in France or in any other countries."
"That would truly make a mockery of the universal service."
"Yes, we do want to guarantee a universal service, and, in order to do so, we must exclude competition from a certain area of the postal services."
"The great bone of contention in our committee and in the House as a whole is this: how large an area do we have to keep free of competition so that a decent universal postal service can be provided?"
"I believe the compromise ceiling of 150 grammes that we have proposed, along with the application of the other criteria, constitute suitable next steps."
"For this reason, a majority of my group will be supporting this compromise too."
"The situation on the ground, of course, varies widely."
"Let me give you an example."
"The Belgian Post Office cannot claim to serve a country of vast dimensions, nor can it claim to serve a remote country on the periphery of Europe."
"Yet its postal services are disastrous, even though it has a reserved right to provide them."
"This is why we are giving the green light for the next step."
"May I also point out, Commissioner - and this is the second of the motions we have tabled - that we should like to have a report by 31 December on this next step that we are about to take, so that Parliament and the Council can jointly decide on further steps towards more open markets, and I also hope that you will be able to present a clear evaluation report in the year 2003, on the basis of which we can then initiate the next moves."
"Madam President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur Mr Ferber and the members of the committee for their hard work on this particular dossier."
"It has not been an easy dossier to follow and it has not been rushed or done wrongly."
"It is excellent."
"The previous directive of 1997 called for: ""a gradual and controlled liberalisation""."
"What the Commission came up with during this year was neither gradual nor controlled."
"What it came up with was, in the words of Neil Armstrong, the famous American astronaut: ""one giant leap for mankind"" in that they moved from 350 grammes to 50 grammes in one fell swoop."
"Therefore, whilst that may be welcomed in certain parts of this House, it would have had a devastating effect on postal services throughout the European Union."
"This morning we need to examine what those proposals would have meant."
"We also need to make the point made by Mr Jarzembowski: so many studies have been conducted by this Commission, yet we have never seen them."
"A commissioner came before the committee and said that they would be put on the Internet - we never saw them!"
"Yet we are expected to go along the lines that the Commission wanted without ever seeing those so-called studies."
"The reason why we never saw those studies was because the social effects mentioned in them - the effects on postal services - were simply not to the liking of the Commission."
"A reduction of the universal service - the very core of the postal service sector - to 50 grammes would seriously put at risk the ability of the national postal operators to deliver a universal service at an affordable tariff to people, irrespective of where they live."
"That is a crucial point."
"I am not saying that people who live in cities should get a better service than people in rural areas."
"I am not going to give the old Florus Wijsenbeek argument: well, why should we be delivering letters up there - people should get on the Internet."
"That is why he is no longer with us."
"In other words, what the Commission is proposing, supported by some in this House, will in my own country lead to a reduction in service levels, in particular in rural areas."
"You can forget the daily guaranteed delivery and collection service."
"You can forget a single tariff: zonal pricing will be introduced."
"In other words, people in rural areas will pay more."
"There will be job losses."
"I am sorry, Mr Ferber, I am concerned about job losses and the effect they will have."
"It will also lead to the closure of rural sub-post offices, because they rely on postal services for their very survival."
"I also want to stress the human element."
"Some people have said that we have liberalised telecoms and it was not a great problem."
"But telecoms are about machines, this is about people meeting the service face to face, not meeting the service the other side of a telephone or computer screen."
"We often pontificate here about being the representatives of the citizens of Europe."
"Well, if my mail bag is anything to go by, the citizens of Europe do not want to see their postal services decimated."
"I remind my Conservative MEP colleagues of the mess they got into in the UK when they tried to privatise the British post office."
"I fought against that and, having won that battle, I am not going to give that up to see the battle reopened via the back door of Europe."
"Today we have a report before us that is an excellent response to the Commission's proposals."
"It is a response that is not only measured, but also guaranteed to improve our services for consumers, irrespective of where they live."
"Again, I stress that what we are talking about today is people and public service and not ideologies."
"It is about getting that public service delivered to them, irrespective of what is on the balance sheet."
"I would recommend our compromises because I believe we have ensured that postal services will be developed in the European Union and that those postal services will deliver to the people of Europe."
"If you go down the road of the Commission or some in this House, then you will decimate those postal services and we will be slated by the people for that action, and rightly so."
"Madam President, Mr Simpson, I can assure you both that it is certainly not my intention to decimate the postal services."
"Quite the reverse, in fact: I intend to make them more effective, and Mr Ferber' s report is not a sound proposal in my opinion."
"Some of my colleagues do not share my opinion on a number of scores, as will become evident in due course."
"I thought the Commission' s proposal was a sound one."
"It represents an important step towards an internal market, and is important for consumers and companies who use those postal services, but we closed the door on it."
"At this rate, we will need 100 years to bring about an open market for postal services in Europe."
"Mr Simpson, your predictions have, as far as I can tell, not materialised in Sweden, although that country operates an open-market system."
"The same holds true for the Netherlands, and when I talk face to face with other people from postal companies, they do not express these concerns either."
"I therefore assume that you are only voicing half-truths and saying what you like to hear."
"I have tabled an amendment. At the very least, that will give us an end date."
"I believe that my amendment is gradual and controlled."
"It is not as ambitious as I would have liked, but I feel it is a sound compromise."
"We are now facing a peculiar situation, really."
"Although we go along with the postal monopolies, I notice that the German postal services are floating their company on the stock exchange, the Mecca of capitalism, and advertising in the Belgian newspapers to sell their shares because they are a profitable company."
"And where do these profits originate from?"
"A monopoly."
"I have noticed that the Royal Mail has shares in a postal company in Sweden because over there, it can compete within an open market."
"But I ask you: would a Swede be able to compete in Britain?"
"No."
"This is the type of situation which we want to avoid."
"In this case, we are on the same side as big business."
"They have literally laid down the law."
"It is a hypocritical situation, if you ask me, because these companies now have a finger in all sorts of pies and are paving the way for the free market."
"They are doing this very actively."
"They are restructuring and are making people redundant, Mr Simpson, even though they are monopolies, and I believe we are protecting those interests."
"We have turned the safety net for post users into a hammock for those large postal companies where they can carry on doing what they are now getting away with."
"I object to this practice and will vote against it."
"Madam President, the legislative proposal before us concludes a high-quality parliamentary debate which testifies, if indeed it were necessary, to Parliament' s irreplaceable role in voicing the opinions of European citizens and giving expression to the diversity of experience from one region to another."
"If the voices of users and consumers, the postal workers and the unions are listened to, if attention is paid to the concerns of the public authorities and of local councillors and if account is taken of the opposition voiced by a number of governments to this development, then it might well be wondered where Commissioner Bolkestein' s proposal has come from, so unrealistic and unworkable does it appear to be."
"How was the Commission, which is supposed to represent the overall interests of Europe, able to propose a development so contrary to what is called for by the relevant players?"
"Is there a certain kind of ultra-liberal dogmatism that makes one particularly blind and deaf?"
"How has the Commission been able to avoid assessing the previous stage before proposing moving on to the next stage?"
"All it would seem to have drawn from the Lisbon conclusions is about how to pursue liberalisation by means of directives, while the emphatic reference to the role of services of general interest is at present reflected only in communications and statements."
"However, we know that guaranteeing equal high-quality access to everyone everywhere requires tariff equalisation to be maintained and a certain number of services to be kept for those providing a universal service."
"The right to innovation should also be guaranteed so as to take account of changing needs, the consequences of the development of the information society and the fight which may be required to ensure that no one is excluded from this society."
"I think it would be logical to reverse the burden of proof rather than always have to justify exceptions to the sacrosanct principle of the internal market."
"It would be more in keeping with citizens' expectations to restore the balance where public services are concerned by making any new extension to the commercial sphere conditional upon respect for the fundamental objective of the sustainable development of European society."
"Madam President, I hope that the broader membership of the European Parliament will accept the recommendations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism concerning the future administration of postal services within the European Union."
"The opening up of postal services to greater competition is one of the recommendations of the Transport Committee."
"However, we must recognise that unfettered competition in the area of postal services would result in a severe reduction in the quality of these services in rural and peripheral parts of the European Union."
"Therefore, it is recommended that universal postal providers within the Union will be able to deliver all postal items below 150 grammes in weight."
"This will have the effect of protecting the quality and continued regularity of postal service deliveries."
"Private operators will also be able to deliver letters at four times the price of a normal letter."
"We should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive."
"There has been absolute and total consultation between all interested parties in the field of postal services in Europe concerning the specific provisions of this directive; and I am satisfied that these proposals which have come through the Transport Committee of the European Parliament are realistic and pragmatic."
"They will ensure the economic viability of the rural post office network in my country and in other rural and peripheral parts of the European Union."
"Regular postal deliveries must be seen as an essential economic and social element in rural villages and towns."
"I would be very clear on one particular matter."
"If there is unfettered competition in providing postal services in Europe, then lucrative urban areas will be cherry-picked by private operators at the expense of the poorer and less profitable rural parts."
"We cannot, Madam President, Commissioner, and will not, tolerate such a situation."
"That is why I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the Transport Committee of this Parliament with regard to the future administration and workings of postal services in Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my satisfaction at the fact that this debate is being held today instead of during the January part-session, although this is the result of a minor tussle between the groups."
"In my opinion, we are benefiting from the fruit of a wise decision which will further the progress of this extremely important dossier."
"The Presidency undertook to deal with the issue and intended to do so before the end of its mandate."
"If we are able to make an effective contribution, then that will, in any case, be a step in the right direction."
"This is a dossier which warranted swift treatment."
"I say this in all sincerity, for we Italian radicals feel, on the contrary, that the Commission's proposal, put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein, makes complete sense and that it would bring about both gradual opening-up of the market to competition and, in any case, the establishing of fixed time frames for all operators."
"This proposal could not be considered to be as laissez-faire as some say it is."
"On the other hand, parts of the Ferber report would appear to weaken the proposal."
"In fact, it provides for minimal subsequent opening-up of the market and provides absolutely no certainty regarding future steps while, as far as the universal service is concerned, the Swedish example should reassure all those who feel that privatisation will mean the end of the postal services."
"This is and must not become the case."
"We must remember that the postal services and, in general, logistics must in the coming years be one of the fundamental bases for the development of the new economy and that, if we adopt defensive tactics to protect the status quo, defending the major interests of monopolies and unions, then thousands of jobs will be threatened."
"This would be in outright contrast with the goals the European institutions set themselves in Lisbon."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the internal market is said to have been established many years ago within the European Union. Despite this, protectionism is still very much alive."
"This is certainly the case within the postal sector."
"While electronic communication, such as e-mail, has enjoyed a real boom, former state monopolies are mainly turning inward."
"A gradual introduction of competition within the post is to be welcomed so as to acknowledge its social function."
"This is why the European Commission has not suggested liberalising all postal services as a second step in the process."
"According to Commissioner Bolkestein' s proposal, more than two thirds still remains in the hands of monopolies."
"But this is not enough for a dozen or so national postal companies."
"Backed by a massive lobby, they managed to persuade the majority of this House to adopt an even more conservative stance."
"It is exactly those groups which like to portray themselves as progressive who are putting the brakes on."
"When I then hear that the monopolists are opposed to this idea, it is like asking a turkey how it feels about Christmas dinner."
"The monopolists are combing the markets and buying up private companies with funds generated by the monopoly."
"Experience in Sweden and the Netherlands, among others, has taught us that the objections to a free postal market are unfounded."
"There are no remote addresses which are being excluded and employment will recover after the necessary efficiency operations."
"The worst decision which the European Parliament could make this week would be to abandon an end date for the second phase."
"If the step which the European Parliament now wants to take is far too small, let us then at least ensure that we pick up the thread in a couple of years' time."
"In a climate of honest competition, monopolists can show what they are made of."
"Madam President, I come from the most deregulated country as far as the postal service sector is concerned."
"At the same time, it is the country where the highest number of letters are delivered the day after they have been posted."
"Also, no other country in the European Union has such fast distribution of post from abroad."
"There is a connection between all of this."
"Even though the previously dominant national company in Sweden is still by far and away the largest, the growing competition currently from 50 other companies has meant that they have been forced to become considerably more efficient than they were before."
"It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union."
"Allow me briefly to say a few words regarding the quite obvious hypocrisy also found within this sector."
"The British Royal Mail and the French La Poste, to name but two, oppose any form of competition in Great Britain and France respectively."
"This does not prevent both companies from wanting to get in on the act and claim a share of the market in countries where deregulation has taken place."
"It would, of course, be reasonable for the Commission to examine the legality of companies who refuse other companies access to their markets and yet gladly claim a share of the market in countries where deregulation has taken place."
"Allow me to conclude by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, who has made several attempts at reaching a compromise."
"There should be no reflection on him, but there has been a lack of desire on the part of others."
"I do not consider the current draft to be a compromise."
"It would have been a compromise if an end-date for completion of the liberalisation had been set."
"If this date is set later than, for example, 2007, it will, in my opinion, be completely meaningless."
"By then, the market will have resolved this issue."
"There is therefore currently no reason to support such an amendment, and in that case I see no alternative than to vote against the report."
"Madam President, the Postal Services Directive of 1997 provided for a gradual and controlled opening of postal markets to private providers."
"The House certainly has no problems with that."
"At the same time, the directive provided for the preservation of a high-quality universal service, and that is the real crux of the matter."
"The point is that a universal service needs to be funded, and this has been said a few times already."
"The Commission stated at the time that it would present studies and data and figures on the implications of the funding requirement."
"We are still waiting for these."
"So there remains something of an unresolved question, namely what and how much it takes to establish and finance the sort of reserved domain that will guarantee us a good, solid universal service."
"It is therefore desirable that Parliament should not subscribe to the battering-ram strategy proposed by the Commission and should adhere to the strategy of controlled and gradual opening of the postal markets."
"And as for employment, my dear Markus, we see things differently."
"It goes without saying that the postal services are not a job-creation programme."
"But this Parliament and the European Union also have some responsibility for employment and for the social conditions in which the postal services operate."
"Whether the new providers create jobs and the number and quality of such jobs cannot be a matter of indifference to us, nor can the number and nature of the jobs that are to be preserved by the traditional providers of postal services."
"These things must also be our concern."
"Let me say this to Georg and Markus: when the postman calls once, or even twice, we are well aware that this is not the ultimate social service in Europe."
"But when grandma is happy because she has a friendly postman, which is also a factor in the quality of postal services, we should not begrudge her that pleasure but be happy with her."
"I should like to express my very sincere thanks to Markus Ferber, because he has shown himself very willing indeed to compromise so that we could put together a constructive proposal."
"This is it now - I think - and the Commission will take it from here with our wholehearted support."
"Provided it proposes a high-quality universal service as a dynamic blueprint for the future, the Commission will have our support, but not otherwise."
"Madam President, Council, Commissioner, I understand the desires expressed by some of my colleagues for an end-date and for moves towards greater liberalisation."
"I am not expressing an objection in principle to either of these but my concern, too, is with sustaining a good-quality, affordable and genuinely universal service provision."
"I speak in support of the 150-gramme limit for reasons of caution."
"In the UK, many areas are fortunate enough to enjoy a much higher level of universal service provision than the current directive requires, but aspects of our services are already under threat, particularly post offices in rural areas."
"These are particularly vital in my own constituency of Scotland."
"No one has yet succeeded in reassuring me about the effects of the Commission proposal in both these respects, which is why I am not only supporting the 150-gramme compromise but asking for a thorough review or reviews on the effects for universal service provision before any other proposal or proposals come forward."
"If, as has been reported, the EU is prepared to consider sport in a special way, should we not also consider postal services in a special way?"
"Sport is a business for some and leisure for many, but postal services, though they may be a business for many, are indeed a lifeline for us all."
"Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Green Group, I would like to talk about this dossier, and I would especially like to congratulate Mr Ferber and Mr Jarzembowski on the expert way in which they have walked the political tightrope and on the flexibility they have displayed in the process. I would also like to congratulate our co-rapporteur, Mr Simpson, on his perseverance."
"In the Dutch newspapers, Mr Bolkestein recently criticised the French for adopting a non-liberal attitude, or, at least, that is how the headline in one of the newspapers read."
"By the same token, I could criticise the Commissioner for not really applying the Dutch consultative model to this situation and for failing to anticipate the social implications which a liberalisation proposal such as this would have."
"After all, you may quote facts and possibly be right in terms of what Mr Sterckx had in mind, i.e. technological development, the way in which the sector is developing, the role of state companies, the way in which the Deutsche Post has now taken over DHL, etc., but this does not mean that you are right."
"I believe that being proved right is an important matter in this House."
"In my view, we are taking one step back instead of forward."
"Many have levelled the criticism, which I share wholeheartedly, that we did not have the impact studies at our disposal."
"Where it was possible to study the impact studies, it appeared that the social aspects in particular had been neglected in terms of social cohesion, employment, special services, etc."
"Similarly, consultation involving the social partners simply failed to meet the mark, and it is against this background that my group will most certainly support these proposals."
"In other words, the question is raised as to whether my group supports the deferment of liberalisation, which brings me onto another topic."
"In the capacity of rapporteur of the general interest services for our committee, there is no doubt that we will need to cast a critical eye over these developments."
"Madam President, Mr Ferber, you were absolutely correct when you defined the key criteria as affordable prices, high quality and universal availability. We agree with you there."
"But you did forget one other criterion."
"Our responsibility for our national economies also obliges us to maintain a high level of employment."
"Because we share these values, this Commission and this committee took the decision they did, and for that I actually ought to be grateful to the privatiser and liberaliser-in-chief, Mr Bolkestein."
"Anyone who is so ill-prepared to enter into negotiations, anyone who fails to present the requested report on the impact of the 1997 Directive, anyone who argues from an ideological platform - ""We shall achieve these very aims you have identified by liberalising, liberalising and liberalising again"" - need hardly wonder when he falls flat on his face!"
"Your original report, Mr Ferber, was very closely modelled on Mr Bolkestein's, and I must express my gratitude to you for the fact that you allowed reason to prevail in the end."
"I do believe that the compromise which is now on the table takes account of the aforementioned criteria, and I am delighted that our rejection of the general liberalisation of express services and cross-border services has now been set down in black and white."
"I am pleased that special services have not been redefined."
"I am gratified that there is no deadline for liberalisation, because the paramount aim from a national economic point of view must be to provide the population with proper postal services."
"I believe that a guaranteed universal service is the only way to achieve this aim in practice."
"I am not a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the market or of liberalisation, but the request that was made for a systematic, professional and painstaking analysis of all the implications of the directive has not been met, and that is why I am prepared to accept the present compromise proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the willingness to listen and the commitment which the rapporteur has shown in drawing up this report are to be appreciated and sincerely applauded. He states in the explanatory statement that he was forced to seek a compromise between hundreds of largely homogeneous amendments."
"In effect, we do not feel that there is any other fair way to settle an issue which is so complex and, at the same time, so paradoxical."
"The complexity is caused by the implications for 15 different national situations, although all with exactly the same problems - maintaining a high-quality universal service and at least keeping levels of employment stable - and the paradoxical nature of the matter is mirrored in the contrasting elements of the reform proposed by the Commission."
"I would mention by way of example the time frames of the reform proposal and its entry into force, the fact that we have no knowledge of the effects of the first directive and the attractive, though groundless, observations on the future of the reform, starting with employment and its quality, maintaining an adequate universal service and the impossibility in material terms of accomplishing reform without recourse to a compensation fund."
"Spain might be able to enlighten us on this matter, for it established the fund and has used it, and I would mention the uncertain legal bases of the fund, the virtual criteria used in its composition and the discretionary authorisation of its application."
"Moreover, the report does not mention the geomorphologic characteristics of the different countries and the resulting differences in the costs of the universal service even though the categories of users are the same."
"The rapporteur is right, therefore, when he states that the compromise reached is the only compromise possible."
"Otherwise, irregular dealings would have gone on which would have been anything but transparent and above-board, with pandering possibly leading to conjuring tricks involving the special services during the transition to the private market."
"With regard to this, it would be as well for the Commission to conduct an inquiry to ascertain whether a private postal monopoly is not being created in Europe in the face of the process of liberalisation of the public postal monopolies, and to indicate what, in its opinion, the maximum permissible concentrations should be."
"Madam President, today' s debate was intended to represent a small step forward in the liberalisation process of the postal services."
"I have yet to see an internal market topic which has caused so much misinformation, emotions and bitter reproaches to be exchanged."
"One of those reproaches concerns countries which are now professing liberalisation, but have not made any changes at home."
"According to my Spanish colleagues - and I would like to check this out with the Commissioner - Spain has transposed the 1997 Directive in its entirety, others have not done anything, and those who have not done anything would now like to take huge steps to make up the difference."
"Mr Bolkestein, the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties."
"Is this true, and if so, what steps have you taken?"
"Also, I would appreciate it if you could outline exactly to what extent the old directive has been transposed in the different countries."
"Spain' s attitude in this matter is proving to be absolutely crucial."
"The misinformation has been about people in favour of liberalisation."
"They are also supposed to be against the universal provision of services as a matter of course."
"This is simply not true."
"Quite the reverse in fact: the concept of universal services is ideally suited to solve problems encountered in rural areas and areas which are difficult to access, via agreements and, if need be, compensatory funding."
"However, I am firmly opposed to monopolists who do not tolerate anybody on their home patch but take the liberty of making their purchases on liberalised markets."
"Who distributes the post in Sweden?"
"Who can compete in Sweden on a free market?"
"The Royal Mail, which Mr Simpson takes such an indulgent attitude towards."
"He has tabled an amendment on the public/private relationship."
"But to be absolutely certain that nobody could take this amendment further, he only submitted a recital and not an article."
"Fortunately, there is a directive in place which prescribes transparency for public companies, and I can assure you that gross subsidies will be monitored at very close range."
"No more public money to spend within liberalised markets."
"Go and play on your own turf."
"I trust the Commissioner will promise that he, together with Commissioner Monti, will exercise extra vigilance."
"I would like to finish off with one last observation. I am extremely disappointed at Parliament' s conservatism."
"We are voting tomorrow, and I hope the amendments by Mr Atkins or Mr Sterckx will be adopted, otherwise I will have no choice but to vote against this report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we processed all aspects of Mr Ferber's report in committee and it has now been tabled before Parliament."
"I make no bones about the fact that, as a Greek, I had - and still have - acute cause for concern because some of the European Commission's proposals, if they are implemented, will hit the universal postal service in Greece very, very hard, not in the densely-populated areas, but in the remote mountain villages and on the small, remote islands."
"This, of course, does not only apply to Greece."
"In the end, the rapporteur accepted a number of views which, if they prevail, as we hope they will, do much to improve the situation."
"Crucial issues such as the 150-gramme limit rather than the derisory 50 grammes proposed by the Commission, a price four times the basic standard tariff, rather than the two and a half times proposed by the Commission and the express service are handled much more realistically in the report, as are cross-border postal services."
"On the last point in particular, I was most impressed by the European Commission's arguments, based as they are on the low average ratio between cross-border postal services and total mail volumes in each Member State."
"It is extremely unscientific to use the average as an indicator when there is such a wide spread between the figures used to calculate it."
"For example, in the present case, a country with a much lower than average ratio will obviously not have any problems, while a country with a much higher ratio will despair if it has to liberalise cross-border postal services as Mr Bolkestein proposes."
"In other words, it is like calculating the average income of the richest and the poorest person, which of course gives a perfectly satisfactory figure per se but can hardly be deemed to be socially acceptable to the poorest person."
"I should like to finish, having congratulated and thanked the rapporteur, by expressing the hope that Mercury, the winged messenger of the Gods, will continue to fly to the most remote inhabited points and that the knock on our door in the morning will herald either the milkman or the postman."
"Madam President, allow me to address Mr Simpson."
"I understand that Mr Simpson has been to Sweden and to Norrland, which is one of the 'worst' , but most splendid, sparsely-populated areas in the whole of Europe."
"You do not appear to have learnt anything, and you do not appear to have listened to the arguments that were put to you."
"I have many reports which you may read and in which you will find reasons why liberalisation is so important and such a good idea."
"The Royal Mail competes with other companies and delivers letters to me in Malm√∂ in Sweden."
"This, in my opinion Mr Simpson, is a good thing."
"In this way I get a better and cheaper service."
"The Commission's proposal is a good one, but it is not sufficiently liberal."
"The text of the report takes the wrong line."
"The postal service monopoly must be abolished."
"The interests of consumers are best served in a market with free competition."
"We know this."
"This, of course, also applies to the postal market."
"Why should other conditions prevail in this market?"
"The rapid technical development and the requirements placed on postal companies to adapt their activities quickly make an end-date for the abolition of the monopoly necessary - as early a date as possible."
"I personally think that 2007 is much too late."
"Madam President, the Swedish postal service was completely liberalised as early as 1993."
"At that time, I was a member of the Swedish Parliament and was involved in taking that decision."
"The Swedish Post still has 95 per cent of the market share in Sweden."
"In order for private postal deliverers to have a reasonable chance of establishing themselves in the market, it is therefore necessary for them to capture a large share of the market, i.e. for the market to be competitive."
"We in this House must give the postal market a chance."
"These are new times, Mr Simpson."
"I would like to say: ""Learn from Mr Blair."""
"In conclusion, I would like to say that the postal service in Sweden has not deteriorated, in some respects it has even improved."
"The costs are not higher than in other countries."
"If we do not do something about the postal service now, it will be even worse in a few years."
"Consumers will lose out, employees will lose out, Europe will lose competitive strength and growth."
"Good luck, Mr Bolkestein!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, what we have learned from the debate or, rather, the controversy created by Commissioner Bolkenstein in his quest to liberalise the postal services, undertaken in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in contravention of the rules defined by this directive is that, under cover of progressive and status-enhancing terms such as modernisation, liberalisation and keeping pace with rapid technological developments, we are slipping into a situation in which the social quality of countries is declining."
"What is being destroyed is the very spirit of local public service, universally appreciated and respected."
"Let us therefore regard this important phase of examining this directive as a manifestation of the agreement and the bond between Parliament and the citizens of Europe."
"We have been able to find a majority of MEPs to respond to the questions and challenges it raises, as well as the fundamental risks it poses for the images of our various countries, the identity of our public services and the cohesion of our societies."
"In this connection, I would thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as well as Mr Simpson for the result that has been achieved."
"I am all the more grateful due to the fact that my own group has distinguished itself in this counter-offensive."
"We had joined together in firmly denouncing these liberal excesses and their harmful effects on the territorial, economic and human fabric of our Member States."
"As a Frenchwoman, I am only glad that I have no part in the dismantling of that reassuring and life-affirming network of 17 000 post offices and sub-post offices, knitted together over 550 000 km2 of our territory and embodying public service for our citizens, in both suburban and rural areas."
"This debate on postal services is also a warning to the Commission."
"It will have taught them that impartial and objective studies prior to the issuing of directives ought to be the rule and that, because economic liberalisation does not in any way constitute progress if it is synonymous with social dehumanisation, the notion of general public service ought to be preserved."
"Account ought also to be taken of indicators to the contrary, such as the liberalisation of postal services in Sweden, and of subsidiary aspects such as the quality of post office jobs and the symbolic value of the post office."
"In the light of this, I entirely support the compromise proposed by Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson."
"Madam President, the public monopoly for postal services was introduced in the nineteenth century for a very good reason."
"The governments which brought this about were not Socialist, but Conservative or Liberal."
"They only made this decision after it transpired that private companies were unable to guarantee a swift, regular, steady, affordable and universally deployable service."
"The radical reform which the Commission proposed at the beginning of this year is threatening to turn the clock back by two hundred years."
"Why should we impose that model which is now being tested in the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland on the entire European Union as a permanent measure?"
"Apparently, the proposal is founded on an ideological principle, namely that companies should no longer be publicly owned."
"If this is the case, then not only banks, chemical companies and steel companies must be privatised, but also public utility companies such as the energy supply, public transport and the postal services."
"On the one hand, the proposal aims to create a great deal more space for competing private companies, without waiting for the promised evaluation of the effects previous liberalisation decisions have had."
"On the other hand, the proposal would mean that the position of a group of interested companies which benefit from the wholesale liberalisation of the postal company would be strengthened from 2007 onwards."
"The proposed liberalisation has sweeping implications for the services in rural areas, for employees of postal companies and for private users of the post."
"It ultimately means that there will be fewer post offices, the service will slow down and the post office will no longer be able to provide the social services functions. Nor let us not overlook the higher rates due to the fact that different service companies will operate alongside each other."
"This translates into longer hours and less job security for the staff."
"It is unlikely that the planned protection of the universal provision of services by means of a compensatory fund, as a result of which private profits are ploughed back into public services, will last."
"Fledgling companies could in future cite this restriction in their freedom as grounds for filing a complaint on account of improper government intrusion and distortion of competition."
"This is why it is positive that a majority of this House now refuses to take matters as far as Commissioner Bolkestein proposed at the beginning of this year."
"This has my support, but it would also be preferable if mail between 150 and 350 grammes remained in the hands of the existing postal companies."
"Madam President, the postal services in all of our Member States fulfil functions way beyond what is purely market activity."
"Postal services are of immense socio-economic importance and have always played a key role in social cohesion."
"The current proposals have been the subject of very emotional debate right across the Union, particularly in my own rural constituency, and rightly so."
"I represent the constituency of Connacht Ulster in the west and border counties of Ireland, which is predominantly rural and one of the most peripheral regions."
"The Commission's proposal to liberalise the postal services has been discussed intensively across the length and breadth of my constituency from Malin Head to Connemara and from the outskirts of Dublin to the islands."
"It was evident to me when the proposal first appeared that it would never be acceptable in the shape in which the Commission presented it."
"Parliament - which is the institution best placed to reflect the views of the citizens of Europe - made this clear to the Commission and the Commissioner even before he was appointed by us."
"In spite of this, the Commission chose to ignore the view expressed by the vast majority of Members of this House from various Member States and political groups."
"I sense a clear consensus amongst Members that this directive must address the very real concerns of citizens for the future of a viable post office network."
"It is regrettable that the Commission opted instead to bulldoze ahead with the ideological proposal that fails to pay attention to the views of the people."
"I want to commend the rapporteur on a very fine report: a report that reflects the views of the vast majority of the Members of this House and, indeed, of practically all citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those who have expressed genuine congratulations to Mr Ferber on his work rather than merely going through the motions."
"His task was made difficult by the complexity of the subject and further complicated by the limits of the Commission's proposal and the delays it suffered."
"These limits and delays also contributed to a debate in which the ends are often confused with the means."
"We all agree on the fact that we need a high quality service with the lowest possible tariffs for the consumer."
"It appears that we all agree - and this is my personal opinion - that the lever of competition and of a progressive, gradual liberalisation is also useful for this purpose, but that it is not the end: it is the means to the end."
"If we think that we can put liberalisation forward as the solution to all the problems, then we are wrong, also because it would be a mistake in this sector not to recognise the need, which exists and which cannot be denied, for a universal service and for the guarantee that running the services will also provide the necessary means to cover the additional costs of the universal service."
"The questions that we should therefore be asking are rather: how great a monopoly is necessary in order to guarantee the provision of these means?"
"We therefore need to have access to the studies and analyses, which differ from State to State and from country to country in order to guarantee the achievement of this objective."
"How can we make it possible for the services and industrial management, inside as well as outside the reserved area, to restore quality in order to reduce the reserved area necessary to guarantee those means?"
"This will mean removing the definition of special services which, paradoxically, would prevent the operator of the reserved area from upgrading its services."
"I hope that, in future, the Commission will present to us studies and more comprehensive proposals as alternatives to those which have thus far constrained and limited our debate."
"I will back unconditionally not the compromise, but Mr Ferber's recommendations, for I feel that they are the only recommendations possible under the current conditions."
"Madam President, we are holding a real parliamentary debate because the positions were initially differing."
"I must congratulate Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson on the excellent work they have carried out and which we are able to consider this morning."
"From the Spanish experience, which has been mentioned a few times, I believe that Parliament' s amendments improve on the Commission' s proposal because it introduces moderation - strict moderation - into the pace of opening up and liberalisation."
"We all agree on the need for this opening up and liberalisation, but the pace is important."
"One message went completely unnoticed at the Nice European Council, and I think it is also close to Parliament' s position, which is that services of general interest must be taken clearly into account and be clearly favoured."
"Madam President, the service we are considering faces fierce competition from the new information and communication technologies."
"That competition cannot be considered in current terms, because the use of those technologies is undergoing a dramatic increase and we therefore have to view the issue with a little perspective."
"This sector is already suffering from enormous competition from those new technologies."
"We have included the special services in the directive itself, and I believe that Parliament has given them the added value that they must have because, otherwise, the Commission' s proposal could become a back door through which the services of general interest could be attacked."
"Madam President, in dealing with this issue we are talking about economic and social cohesion."
"It is very important to understand that it is not only the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds that have the task of defending economic and social cohesion; it is all the Union' s policies, as laid down in Article 158 of the EC Treaty."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties of finding a compromise have already been mentioned during the course of this debate."
"It appears that the final solution is acceptable because it reconciles the need for competition with liberalisation and, most importantly, with the obligation for a universal service, and we know that there will be subsequent stages which will make it possible to assess the situation."
"I particularly welcomed the fact that the reference to postal services in rural areas was accepted in committee. It was no coincidence that I tabled an amendment which also mentions the problems of mountains and islands."
"I am making particular reference to mountainous areas, even though they do not always fall within the definition of rural regions, because, observing the development of the postal system in many European countries, the question of mountains is now one of the most difficult matters to resolve."
"If we were to analyse the data already available to us, we would probably discover that a great deal, hundreds, maybe thousands of post offices have been closed in mountainous areas."
"Clearly, over and above the evaluations of the economic quality of the system which always have to be carried out, the real risk is that the mountainous areas will become marginalised, and new solutions therefore have to be sought which make it possible to maintain an essential service such as the postal service, enhanced by other services."
"In my opinion, this will be one of the major issues affecting the development of the European mountainous areas in the coming years."
"Madam President, Arlette Laguiller and I reject any way in which private capital might be introduced into postal services."
"The effects of the first directive have not been made public, for the consequences are obvious: job losses and poorer working conditions, public services of varying quality throughout Europe, especially in rural areas and working class districts."
"A few large private groups will cherry-pick and divide up amongst themselves those profitable sectors of post office activity which the European Union is still preparing to offer them."
"Now, a self-styled 'soft' version of the Commission' s liberalising proposal is offered to us, particularly in connection with the price-weight threshold of 150 instead of 350 grammes."
"The gradual, controlled liberalisation presented by the French Presidency as a lesser evil is a hypocritical way of handing an essential public service over to a market which is neither controlled nor controllable, as has already been done in the case of France-T√©l√©com."
"When the left-wing coalition cites realism in an attempt to obtain a compromise solution with a right-wing party, it is a way of disguising its own capitulation to private interests."
"The representatives of 'Lutte Ouvri√®re' and the 'Ligue Communiste R√©volutionnaire' have not been elected in order to ensure that public services are quoted on the stock exchange and will be voting against this compromise."
"Madam President, firstly, please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because his work has been complicated and difficult and he has had to try to find a balance between dramatically differing proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival."
"But why has it been difficult?"
"Because it is based on a Commission proposal which I believe was rotten from the outset."
"And why was it rotten from the outset?"
"Commissioner, please allow me to say that you know perfectly well, because the studies that you have at your disposal show that, for example, in Spain 44% of the postal service is liberalised."
"And the proposal you are making in fact moves towards liberalisation."
"But whom does that liberalisation benefit?"
"It benefits those companies and those countries which so far have done absolutely nothing."
"Actually, they have done something. They have massively financed their public postal service companies and now, rationalised, financed, with enormous economic power, they intend to enter the rest of the European Union' s postal service markets."
"Therefore, those that have worked within the framework of the 1997 Directive are being penalised and those that have done the opposite are benefiting, and that is not a liberalised market or a process of homogenisation."
"That is not the construction of a cohesive and social Europe, as has been said previously."
"We have to seek equality of opportunity; we have to seek a legal framework and a liberalising framework, within which we all have fair and balanced opportunities."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise proposed by Mr Ferber is an extremely wise one and is inspired by the golden rule that the best is the enemy of the good."
"This compromise, to which Mr Simpson and other Members also contributed seminal work, succeeds in taking into account the fact that, for the entire European field but particularly for the users who live in rural, peripheral, sparsely populated or disadvantaged urban regions, the postal services represent a fundamental link, a fundamental means of connection."
"Moreover, the fact cannot be ignored that the sector employs almost two million people."
"It is therefore right to proceed along the road to modernisation and efficiency, and there is no doubt that the liberalisation process which is already underway can also bring these results."
"We want liberalisation but not blind liberalisation."
"The process must continue according to the time frames and procedures which are appropriate to the complexity of the problems and do not affect the area of services of general interest, which are an essential cornerstone of social and territorial cohesion."
"Therefore, my advice to you, Commissioner, is, to quote a well-known Manzionian phrase, 'Forward ... but carefully' ."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is as if we are debating the procession of Echternach today: two steps forward, one step back with the little progress we are making on one of the key political dossiers for completing the internal market, namely the liberalisation of the postal services."
"The Commission proposal provides for gradual further opening and will, in my opinion, surely lead to better services for the consumer at a more competitive price."
"As I understand it, this was the rapporteur' s initial view too, and his proposals were constructive."
"However, the compromise proposal which was submitted by the two large parties to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at the eleventh hour and brought about without the help of the Liberal Group, does not accommodate this view."
"I, with many others this morning, continue to be in favour of restricting the reserved area down to 50 grammes."
"This is more than enough to support the public tasks, such as adequate universal provision of services and a uniform rate."
"The line of the compromise that 150 grammes should be four times the basic rate is not only over the top, it is also harmful to further liberalisation."
"I fear that this will mean that the present monopolists can further strengthen their position on the back of the taxpayer and that the threshold for newcomers will be raised quite a bit."
"But my key objection must be the lack of decisiveness."
"This is evident from the compromise proposal from the two largest parties."
"If according to them, the time is still not ripe for further opening, surely we should be able to make the necessary preparations so that the market can be further opened up?"
"This means that an end date must be provided."
"The pressure is on."
"I welcome a review in 2003, but it must lead to the next step: complete liberalisation by 2007."
"The postal services are ready for it, so is the market, and the customer wants efficient, high-quality and affordable services."
"The Commission proposal accommodates these requirements, but the rapporteur' s compromise proposal does not, which is why I reject it."
"Madam President, I congratulate Mr Ferber on his report although we have some concerns that it does not go far enough."
"We believe in the need for liberalisation, competition and value for money."
"It is iniquitous that the Royal Mail in Britain is using taxpayers' money to intervene in continental liberalised markets whilst at the same time fighting to prevent that liberalisation in the United Kingdom."
"That is why I have re-tabled some of the amendments which we discussed in committee and which we will be voting for - especially in relation to the liberalisation of direct mail."
"That is essential for the development of the direct marketing industry."
"We have concerns, also, about the increase back to 150 grammes from the 50 grammes that we believe is necessary."
"We have, alongside this, an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation."
"If it can be done in rural Sweden then it can be done in rural Britain without any great difficulties."
"I do not take any lessons from the Labour Party about the rural areas."
"When I was the Minister for the Environment in Britain I was responsible for producing a rural White Paper, which dealt with some of the problems relating to rural post offices, so I do not take messages from the Labour Party, however nicely spoken by Mr Simpson."
"I am also glad to see that our continental Liberal friends are giving the lead to British Liberals."
"British Conservatives support Commissioner Bolkestein and we intend to consider, in the course of this debate - and subsequently as the debate proceeds and as the amendments are considered - whether we will vote against the further compromise, however much I respect and regard Mr Ferber's report as a compromise in the face of many difficulties."
"But, because we believe that Commissioner Bolkestein's original operation is much the best, we may well decide to vote against the further compromise in order to maintain those original proposals."
"It remains yet to be seen."
"We should consider it at the end of the debate."
"Mr President, first of all, we do not want to force Sweden to change its postal system, but please do not force us to follow its example."
"In Sweden the Post Office went from profit to loss."
"Swedish Post lost jobs."
"Sub-post offices closed down."
"Prices for posting a letter in Sweden are 30% higher than they are in the United Kingdom."
"And if I may now turn to the United Kingdom, privatisation of the Post Office in the UK was blocked because public opinion simply would not tolerate it."
"What I find outrageous is for the Commission to propose privatisation through the back door."
"But what is really inexcusable is for the British Conservatives to support the European Commission's plans to decimate our postal system in the United Kingdom."
"It will be a triple blow to Britain and a triple blow in particular to rural Britain: an end to the daily delivery and collection; an end to the uniform price - people in rural areas will pay more for their post; and third and finally, an end to our extensive and excellent network of rural sub-post offices."
"I appeal directly to the British Conservatives."
"Maybe do not listen to us, but listen to the Women's Institute in the United Kingdom, listen to the Council for the Protection of Rural England, listen even to the Countryside Alliance."
"All of them are backing Mr Simpson and opposing your party's views on this matter."
"I hope that you and your friends can join with Labour in standing up for rural Britain by opposing the European Commission's plans."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, who indeed had a difficult task."
"Commissioner Bolkestein's proposals were regrettably a bridge too far."
"I certainly recognise that there is nothing wrong with the concept of liberalisation per se and that it can bring benefits to consumers."
"However, it also brings certain obligations - particularly the need to guarantee universality of services."
"This would not have been the case with the original proposals."
"While they would have worked in highly urbanised countries, they spelt disaster for rural countries like Ireland."
"In exposing somewhere between 46 and 48% of the revenue of An Post to competition, it would have created serious doubts for the long-term viability of the Irish postal service as we know it."
"The cherry-picking that would have ensued would have jeopardised the ability of An Post to deliver daily and universally at reasonable cost."
"Furthermore, the ability of our national postal service to cross-subsidise our rural post office infrastructure would have been put in serious doubt."
"I therefore welcome the amended report that has emerged from the committee."
"It is indeed a balanced compromise and I hope that it will be accepted by the Council."
"Let me say this to An Post: if this happens, you will have been given a valuable breathing space."
"Use it to develop and invest in Ireland's rural post office system."
"There are many possibilities apart from the one-stop shop where all government services are available to the local community, such as e-commerce and the Internet."
"Do not take the short-sighted easy option of allowing the rural post office system to die."
"It is a decision that you will regret."
"Mr President, the European Commission' s proposal amending the 1997 Directive on opening up the Community' s postal services to competition was justified and expected."
"It was justified because it is in keeping with the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union which prioritise the establishment of the internal market through the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment."
"Justified too, since 1990, by the positions successively adopted by the European Councils devoted to this sector."
"Justified, finally, by the Lisbon European Council which, a few months ago, asked for this process to be speeded up."
"It was expected, too, because the Commission was behindhand in implementing the commitments specified in the 1997 Directive."
"However, the European Commission' s and Commissioner Bolkestein' s proposals have unleashed quite a commotion."
"These proposals were logical enough, however. What an outcry, though!"
"The compromise proposed in Mr Ferber' s report lags way behind the European Commission' s reasonable proposal, which is very modest - too modest, I fear - given the need for modernisation of the European economy."
"And when, this morning, I see the whole of the European left wing congratulating Mr Ferber, I remain very sceptical about this compromise."
"At this rate, it will be 60 years before the internal market has been completed in the area of postal services."
"What temerity, but, above all, what a delay!"
"I cannot therefore help but draw a parallel with the outcome of the recent Nice European Council."
"In the run-up to Nice, there were great proposals and noble ambitions."
"At the Nice Summit itself there were great speeches but, at the end of the day, little was achieved."
"In the same way, the great flights of rhetoric, here in this debate, on the need to build the new Europe do little to conceal the faint-heartedness and conservatism that exist."
"All we can now do is hope that, one day, we shall be able to move on from the present stasis and give real impetus to the European project by overcoming the various forms of self-aggrandising corporatism."
"Madam President, could I ask Mr Bolkestein to explain to Mr Watts the difference between privatisation and liberalisation?"
"Mrs Peijs, this is not a point of order and this is not the correct moment in the debate to make it."
"Commissioner Bolkestein has the floor."
"Mr President, the Commission realises from previous discussions the great importance of this subject for Parliament and I have carefully looked at the numerous amendments to the proposed directive."
"There are some amendments, in particular those which emphasise the importance of the universal service and of the rural post offices, which I can support."
"Universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and everything we do is designed to create a proper climate for its improvement."
"With regard to most amendments, however, I must say that very little is left of the original proposal, which the Commission presented in May."
"The Commission proposed a step-by-step approach, with a further stage of market opening of 20% overall to be taken in the year 2003."
"What I see in return is not only a rejection of this degree of market opening but also of the dynamic process of modernisation itself."
"What exactly do I see?"
"Firstly, no 50 grammes, which goes against the need to create actual competition."
"Secondly, no opening of outgoing cross-border mail although this is already a reality in ten Member States."
"Thirdly, no definition or special services contrary to the existing directives' objectives and also contrary to the case law of the Court of Justice."
"Fourthly, no opening of express mail, even though this is a new and separate market."
"Fifthly, no step in the year 2003, which is contrary to Article 7 of the current directive, and sixthly, no timetable for further reform, which goes against the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit and the needs of the operators themselves."
"This is not a positive way forward."
"In particular, whereas the Heads of State and Government at Lisbon called for an accelerated market opening, the amendments which I have just now described would result in the opposite, namely a decelerated market opening."
"The two years' delay in implementing the next step would not be consistent with the current directive."
"The debate about modernising the postal sector started in 1989 during a Telecom Council at Antibes."
"Look where we are now, more than ten years later."
"Only 3% of the letter market has been liberalised."
"Shifting the next step from 2003 to 2005 would be another delay that, I am afraid, is not acceptable to the Commission."
"The degree of market opening as now proposed by Parliament would reduce the 20% of the Commission proposals to only 6% from the start of the year 2005, without any prospect of completion of the internal market in the postal sector and that, I am afraid, does not comply with the conclusions of the European Council, nor would it meet the needs and expectations of postal clients, both business users and individual households."
"Nor would it meet the interests of the employees in the sector who want to look ahead."
"In short it would be too little, too late, and would bring to a sudden halt the much needed momentum for further change, gravely harming the incumbent adaptation and threatening long-term employment."
"In addition, stopping competition in outgoing cross-border mail would be a retrograde step, difficult to enforce by regulation and leading to complaints from competitors."
"Special services are another very important area where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged."
"Under the existing directive the principle is clear."
"New and distinct services are always outside the reservable area but there is no clear definition of special services in the current directive, and that opens the door to endless debate and market uncertainty."
"It would be unacceptable to allow continuing litigation to determine what happens here."
"We need clearer definitions or else we would fail in our duty as legislators to modernise the regulatory framework."
"I know that modernising the postal services sector is difficult and politically sensitive."
"The post office is close to people, to consumers and to employees alike."
"In this process of modernisation, fear should not be our guide but rather the challenge of improving the sector."
"If we do too little, too late, the postal sector as a whole will be in danger."
"It will be overtaken by technology and ignored by consumers who do not get service for their money."
"I am sure that many of you, and in particular the rapporteur, will agree more than politics perhaps allows you to say."
"I call upon all of you not to shy away from your responsibility as elected legislators to do what is required and to support a dynamic process of change."
"May I quote three actors in this field."
"Firstly, the chief executive of the UK post office, Mr John Roberts, has talked about competition leading to improvements in quality and efficiency and lower prices."
"Secondly, the President of La Poste, Mr Claude Bourmaud, recently explained how the coming decade will herald the most profound transformation ever for postal operators around the world."
"He said that between now and the end of the decade the opening to competition of virtually the whole postal market appears to be inevitable."
"Thirdly, French Senator, G√©rard Larcher, who is a well-known expert in the field of postal services, called upon all parties to look forward."
"In 1997 he said, and I quote: ""We should not deal with the problems of today by focusing on the notions of yesterday."
"Let us open the debate to solve the problems of La Poste in the framework of tomorrow."""
"All three of these people make important points."
"The postal service is increasingly having to compete in the wider communications market with modern technology developed by the Internet, mobile telephones and the integration of different means of communication."
"The traditional post offices with their rigid structure of employment and slow adaptation to market requirements will not be able to compete in those markets if they are held back by Parliament's amendments."
"Society demands a modern postal sector."
"May I point to the main European consumer organisations, such as the BEUC, which have welcomed the Commission's proposal."
"Many consumer organisations would want to move even faster than the Commission in opening the postal market because they expect greater competition to lead to higher service quality and lower prices, but the Commission has not proposed this fast-track liberalisation as preferred by consumer organisations."
"Our proposal strikes a careful balance, because universal service providers will need time to change the structures further, to become more flexible enterprises so they can adapt to new market conditions."
"Only the introduction of real competition in a controlled and progressive way, according to a fixed timetable, will assist them to do this."
"If the European legislator fails, those Member States progressing rapidly down the road indicated by the Lisbon Summit will be penalised, as their postal operators will be subject to competition from operators benefiting from an extended monopoly."
"Most of the amendments adopted by Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism would, if accepted, lead to a situation where hardly anything would change."
"This would mean that postal services would increasingly lose ground to other means of communication."
"It would be a very short-sighted approach."
"It would be a rearguard battle."
"The monopoly of postal services would cause them to ossify and lose volume which would lead to losses of jobs."
"I am aware of your concern about preserving the universal service and the postal network and I share this concern."
"I stand for cast-iron guarantees that universal service obligations will always be protected."
"Where we differ is the method to achieve this goal."
"Trying to preserve this status quo and maintaining the structures of the past is not the right way."
"The market requires flexibility and adaptability to the new communications environments."
"The Commission proposal responds to this requirement in a very reasonable and a gradual way."
"It recognises that under the existing directive there was already a shift in the balance between the reserved area and other means to ensure a high-quality and enduring universal service."
"These include licensing requirements, including universal service obligations for new entrants to the market, a compensation fund and setting tariffs at an appropriate level geared to costs."
"However, without competition, the situation would become unbalanced."
"In this spirit, I can accept those of your amendments which are non-contentious and others which rightly give emphasis to issues such as universal service as applied in Member States, redressing complaints, and the rural network."
"These concern Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 7, 24, 28, 29, 32, 39, 40 and 41."
"I can also accept the new amendments tabled yesterday, namely 46, first paragraph, 58 and 59, which clarify certain important points."
"Regarding Amendments Nos 60 and 61, I can agree with the principle of completing the internal market at a future date to be determined within a reasonable time frame."
"That is all in line with the Commission's proposal and the conclusions of Lisbon."
"However, it will not surprise Members of this Parliament that the Commission cannot accept the remaining proposed amendments."
"The reason is that they go against the grain of what the Commission has proposed - what is necessary to achieve the process of modernisation to the benefit of postal consumers and employees alike."
"We must maintain the momentum for change and achieve a solid first step, plus a timetable for further change."
"In conclusion, the European Union cannot afford to give uncertain signals in such an important area."
"That is why I cannot and will not be silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a failure to meet properly the challenges set to us all at Lisbon."
"If the European Union, of which the Members of this Parliament are the elected representatives, wants to have the most competitive, knowledge-based and dynamic economy in ten years time, it needs a modern postal sector."
"Therefore, I would call upon all the Members of this Parliament to support the European mission and I conclude by saying that the time to act is now."
"Mr President, I wish to reject these indiscriminate attacks against the majority of this House."
"We are trying hard to carry out modernisation and gradual liberalisation, and we do not deserve to be lectured here by you, Commissioner."
"You should at least thank us for taking our decision today, because this will enable you to find out in December whether the Council adheres to the line taken by the Lisbon European Council and decides in favour of your version of liberalisation, or ours."
"But to lecture us and then achieve nothing in the Council is a slightly hypocritical course of action, Commissioner."
"You really ought to listen to the majority of this House."
"Mr President, in reply to those last remarks, I wish to say three things: firstly, of course it is the privilege - in fact the duty - of Parliament to say what it feels."
"On the other hand, I have the feeling that the Commission will be failing in its job if it did not give just as honest an opinion as Parliament in reply."
"Secondly, this whole matter will be discussed at a Telecom Council next Friday."
"The Commission will put forward the same opinion and therefore the Council will act on the Commission's proposal as it sees fit."
"Thirdly and lastly, if Heads of State or Government decided in Lisbon that the European Union should be the most competitive place in the world in ten years' time, then we have to act upon that."
"If Members of this Parliament are of the opinion that whatever Heads of State or Government say is of no concern to them, that is not an attitude that I share."
"I take the conclusions expressed by the Heads of State or Government as being the guidelines for the Commission and I have spoken this morning in the spirit of those conclusions."
"I call upon Members of this Parliament to follow the Commission's proposal, because only that proposal leads to the aim of Lisbon, which is to have the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world in ten years' time."
"I notice that the postal services are helping us to warm up the House a little, and I am glad about that."
"Mr Simpson, do you wish to take the floor or do you wish to give up that right?"
"We would be grateful if you could give up that right, since we are running very late."
"Mr President, it is a waste of time: there are none so deaf as those who will not listen."
"Thank you very much, Mr Simpson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"Bananas COM"
"The next item is the debate on the second report (A5-0374/2000) by Mr Dary, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation 404/93/EEC on the common organisation of the market in the banana sector [COM(1999) 582 - C5-0528/2000 - 1999/0235(CNS)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, after so many debates on the banana problem, today we are a little closer to finding a satisfactory solution."
"I do not wish to get too excited, since we have been holding debates like this for eight years and we will hold more."
"Today, however, after the agreement reached in the Council, the Commission' s latest proposal is closer to the position often expressed by a majority in this Parliament over the years."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I am speaking, supports the Dary report, since it responds to the fundamental problems."
"It maintains the quota system which safeguards the sale of Community-produced bananas, it establishes a system of licences through the 'first come, first served' method, which conforms to the standard rules of world trade, and it provides for a non-automatic transfer to a tariff system which will require an assessment report on its possible impact."
"This proposal has already been accepted by Ecuador, the world' s leading banana producer and one of the parties which has complained to the World Trade Organisation."
"Commissioner, it is true that we still have certain reservations and differences."
"We in Parliament are asking for a transitional period of ten years whereas the Commission proposes six; we are asking for a tariff of ""a minimum of EUR 300"" whereas the Commission says ""a maximum of EUR 300"" ."
"These are differences, it is true, but now we are talking a similar language, which is radically different to the one we have used for years."
"Commissioner Fischler, I am glad that you have increased your flow of information."
"Mr Schwaiger said during the previous debate that you should have information which further supplements all the different points of view on the problem."
"You recently visited the Azores and you have recently been in the Canary Islands and you undoubtedly have a fuller view of the problem, which is still very complex."
"For example, we feel bound to express our concern about banana production in certain ACP countries, in the small producing countries of the Caribbean and in certain countries of Western Africa, which have traditionally been suppliers to the banana market and to whom we have commitments that we cannot ignore."
"Hurricane Mitch in Central America has unfortunately given us an example of what we find unacceptable."
"In certain countries - Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala - Mitch destroyed the banana plantations."
"Certain multinational companies, instead of contributing to the recovery of economic activity there, moved their business to other less affected areas and even to other countries, ignoring their obligations to thousands, or tens of thousands, of families and farmers who were on a wage of 10 dollars."
"This is not the model of development that we Europeans want to see."
"Some Members have expressed their concern about the negative consequences suffered by certain sectors, especially in the United Kingdom, as a result of the devious measures applied by the United States, which I believe do not conform to the GATT agreements."
"We believe that the best way to help these companies is to find a way to resolve the conflict as soon as possible."
"Therefore, we do not believe it is a good idea to postpone this debate, as certain people have suggested over recent weeks."
"We have achieved a complex and delicate balance on this issue."
"The Dary report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and also received the unanimous support of the committee on whose behalf I am speaking."
"I believe that the amendment tabled at the last minute by Mr Vatanen does nothing to help this issue, and I would ask him, if he is listening, to consider the possibility of withdrawing it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dary, who has given us such a full explanation of the reform, its history and development - which I am not going to repeat."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Fern√°ndez, who has made such good use of his time to make us consider the fact that we have a series of commitments to fulfil."
"The Dary report is a difficult and intricate piece of work which is worthy of praise, and has allowed us to unanimously approve a report on a truly complex issue."
"Commissioner, it is frankly no easy task to bring together the interests of consumers with those of producers, as well as respecting the European Union' s international commitments to the ACP countries and the Lom√© commitments signed in Cotonou, and also to combine efforts in favour of the outermost regions, while respecting the GATT rules for third countries and safeguarding diversity in European Union supply and production."
"The workings of the compromise that has been reached, which comes within the WTO rules, must be studied by the European Commission in a report which will have to be studied by Parliament within a reasonable time limit and, in accordance with the result of that report and the study made of it, the appropriate corrective measures will have to be proposed, as Mr Dary' s report suggests."
"We are not opposed to the 'tariff only' system, Commissioner, we only wish, given these sudden changes, to take the necessary precautions when it comes to making the leap from one system to another."
"I therefore ask the Members of this House to endorse this report in its entirety, as did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I am not going to say again that amendments such as the only one tabled by a certain Member do not help to achieve this."
"I, like the previous speaker, therefore ask that this amendment be withdrawn."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the Commission - because the Commission has made an effort to reach a consensus - and the rapporteur, Mr Dary, for his efforts to reconcile the differing positions."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the situation is clear."
"The committee is in favour of the Commission' s proposal of maintaining the quota system by means of what is known as the ""regatta"" or the 'first come, first served' system, although, of course, it is not in agreement with the proposals aimed at the automatic transfer of the current quota system to a 'tariff only' system."
"This conforms to the general philosophy adopted by this Parliament' s Agriculture Committee, which is that agriculture is not a normal industrial product and it is not therefore appropriate to apply generalised rules which are valid for industrial products."
"The recent 'mad cow' crisis, which is going to cost the European Community, its producers and consumers dearly, is an example of how agriculture cannot be reduced to the level of industrial production and marketing."
"In this regard, I would like to remind you that banana production is not alien to the Community."
"It is a form of production which takes place in a range of special Community regions, the outermost regions, which suffer a range of difficulties in competing in the markets and one of whose few products is precisely this one - the banana."
"As Mr Fern√°ndez Mart√≠n pointed out, Commissioner Fischler has recently been able to observe at first hand the state of the agricultural economy in these regions, which are so distant from the continental Community context."
"Therefore, the proposals in the Dary report, approved unanimously in the Agriculture Committee, refer to the need to take account of the structural problems of these outermost regions, which furthermore have a new legal basis in Article 299(2) of the European Community Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and which is currently awaiting the adoption of the relevant proposals by the Commission."
"The Socialist Group is therefore in favour of Mr Dary' s report and, of course, against Amendment No 36, presented by Mr Vatanen and other Members."
"Mr President, for perplexed observers such as myself, this issue is moving from the bizarre to the surreal."
"We seem to be faced with one series of proposals and counter-proposals after another, dealing with a transitional regime in which the Commission first proposes tariff rate quotas based on historical periods, reference periods, but then moves to a 'first-come, first-served' calculation."
"Meanwhile, the US first condemns historical reference periods but now advocates its own historical reference periods."
"It has become extremely difficult to follow."
"For that reason, amongst many others, I will not comment on the bulk of Mr Dary's report but will try and focus on one issue of principle."
"Whatever the transitional regime is - whether we go for a tariff rate quota and a licensing system which uses the so-called first-come-first-served system or the historical reference periods, whether it is before or after 1993 - we have to start accepting that this is a transitional regime which will at some point have to be replaced by a WTO-compatible 'tariff only' system."
"We cannot continue year in, year out to avoid our international obligations."
"The question is why?"
"Mr Dary suggested that if we were to move towards a 'tariff only' WTO system we would somehow be surrendering ourselves to chaotic commercial forces."
"The truth is quite the reverse."
"The WTO is a set of rules."
"It is actually an inhibition on chaos because it tries to institute rules which we all abide by."
"The European Union has an overwhelming strategic interest to ensure that those rules are reinforced and not weakened, because if we weaken the WTO or the rule of law, who will win?"
"It will be the big guys like the United States; it will be might is right; it will be brute commercial force that will win through."
"So I urge you, let us agree on what the transitional arrangement will be according to Mr Dary's report."
"But let us not turn our backs, as is suggested in Amendment No 11, on the idea that we must eventually move to a 'tariff only' system."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work."
"I am entirely in agreement with his aims."
"But unfortunately, Mr Dary, it is not in our power to insist on the fulfilment of our wishes."
"Strong forces are lined up against us."
"Not only do views differ between States within the European Union, which is reflected, as we all know, in the difficulties experienced by the Commission in its attempts to come up with a proposal on this matter; there is also the involvement of the World Trade Organisation."
"Powerful interests are at play, especially those of the Americans, who, although they are not banana-growers themselves, have invested American capital in the trading corporations."
"We are familiar with the issues, and our concern that the legitimate interests of the ACP countries, of the smaller banana-growers, will fall by the wayside is surely not unwarranted."
"We have tried to table amendments again as compromise motions."
"I hope that the Commission will now accept these amendments."
"Our main motive in tabling Amendment 35 is to ensure that the Commission reports to us on the impact of the proposed regime on the interests of the smaller banana-growers and on the ACP countries, so that, if there is to be a transition to a 'tariff only' system, we in Parliament shall have a basis on which to make a decision."
"One thing is certainly clear and has been confirmed by the Commission, namely that this will have to be dealt with again in Parliament."
"To that end, we shall need precise data."
"Perhaps by that time we shall have achieved codecision on matters of agricultural policy, because decisive moves were made at Nice in the direction of parliamentary codecision; we only have to ensure in the post-Nice discussions that these good intentions are put into practice."
"We shall most probably be in a more powerful position then, and this should be reflected in the banana report and in the objectives we lay down."
"Mr President, I think this is the first time that my surname has been pronounced in my mother tongue."
"Thank you very much."
"It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the issues to which all the institutions have paid the closest attention."
"It is also important to point out that this issue, to my mind, has brought into conflict the interests of a couple of companies, represented by the United States, and those of the European Union, which was trying to protect the commitments given to its own farmers, and to the ACP countries."
"Frankly, I believe that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did the best it could, or what was within its power to do, in order to reach an agreement with the Commission."
"We have accepted the use of the 'first come, first served' system, we have accepted a maximum reduction of the tariff preference of EUR 300 per tonne for the ACP countries, we have also tried to obtain guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises, and we have also asked the Commission for a report on the system' s impact."
"However, I believe that we can forecast negative effects on the smaller commercial operators and on producers in the ACP countries."
"I have serious doubts, although I do not like stereotypes, that an image of the European Union giving in to pressure from two multinationals, represented by the United States, will do no more than confirm preconceived ideas."
"It sometimes seems as though the Commission, in its proposals on deregulation in international trade and agricultural production, has gone even further than the Cairns Group."
"I agree with Mr Dary' s accurate words on this issue."
"In any event, we must recognise that the regulations and Treaties lay down obligations and that acts of deregulation that may benefit certain companies will cost the Union' s budget dearly."
"In this regard I would like to express, not my agreement, but my amazement, at Mrs Schreyer' s statements yesterday on the agricultural budgetary context and the issue of bananas."
"I would like to conclude by congratulating Mr Dary on his hard work, and the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the coordinators."
"My group will vote in favour of the report in the idea that if we drag this issue out we are going to make it very much worse."
"Mr President, this endless saga of the 'banana' conflict between the European Union and the dollar banana producing countries which is no mere anecdote but an object lesson in more ways than one, for 20% of the bananas consumed in the European Union are produced in the outermost regions of the Community, and these regions need this production for their development."
"A further 20% of these bananas are produced in ACP countries which also need this production for their development and with which we have entered into commitments which we ought to respect."
"Each group of countries has been able to develop its production because we were offering them a market which we ought not now to take away from them."
"We should continue to have no problem about giving these producers the means to live by purchasing what they produce as a priority."
"It is only afterwards, for the remaining 60%, that we can open our doors to external producers on a free-trade basis."
"That was the thinking behind the COM in the banana sector, and that is the thinking behind our rapporteur, Mr Dary' s, counter-proposal."
"The fact that the banana producers of the dollar zone are appealing to the dogma of what they call the 'intangible' free-trade doctrine in order to impose a 'tariff only' system upon us should not either impress or intimidate us."
"Let us therefore remain as firmly committed to the particular cultivation method we favour as the Americans are to their protectionist system where sugar, tobacco, peanuts or dairy products are concerned."
"We must hold fast, for if we give way today on the issue of bananas, why should we not give way tomorrow where the other common organisations of the market are concerned: on the CAP or European farm model advocating sustainable development?"
"We ought to stick to our guns; otherwise, we shall lose all control over our food chain."
"In line with the same principles, we shall have GMOs, hormone-treated meat and social dumping foisted upon us."
"We must hold fast, and it is, rather, for the WTO to move on and to abandon its defensive, 'tariff only' fortress which is only too reminiscent of a profit only fortress."
"The 'banana' issue is an important milestone on the path of this necessary development for which the European Union should be working with all its might."
"Mr President, may I first of all highlight Parliament' s effort in reaching a balanced solution to this complex web of interests that surrounds the COM in bananas."
"It is proof of this effort that we are, for the second time, discussing a report that puts forward excellent proposals to make support of banana production in the EU and the ACP countries compatible with the WTO rules."
"It is a pity that the Commission and the Council still insist on a solution that may seriously jeopardise this production, particularly after 2006."
"In this Parliament I represent Madeira, a region where bananas are the main agricultural product."
"The same is true for other regions of the European Union, such as the Canaries and the French Overseas Departments."
"All these territories constitute outermost regions."
"These regions are not only among the most disadvantaged but are also the only ones where bananas are produced in the European Union."
"This situation has to be taken into consideration in the definition of the new rules for the banana import regime."
"The European agricultural model, based on the multifunctionality of farming, must also serve to safeguard European Union banana production."
"Of the many different functions of farming in my region, the one that is becoming increasingly important is environmental protection."
"In other words, the end of bananas in Madeira would be at least as serious from the economic viewpoint (serious collapse of income for thousands of producers) as from the environmental viewpoint (destruction of the subtropical landscape and the rural world, increased erosion)."
"Mr President, without this important environmental side, Madeira would be totally unable to sustain its 'goose that lays the golden eggs' , which is tourism."
"Why, then, liberalise in 2006 when the quota system is perfectly compatible with WTO rules, as well as being the best guarantee that banana production in the Community and ACP countries can be maintained?"
"In spite of everything, I still hope that the Commission will take due account of Parliament' s opinion as set down in the report now being debated, which I fully support and which tomorrow we shall surely adopt."
"I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Dary, on the excellent job he has done."
"Mr President, the rapporteur deserves thanks and some sympathy for handling this difficult report."
"It is almost impossible to reconcile the conflicting commercial interests and the dispute with the WTO, but the rapporteur and the committee Chairman have worked hard to produce a report which provides the Commission and the Council with a more realistic negotiating brief."
"I hope that the Commission will respond positively to the amendments, not with the blanket negative view of the last debate, and will acknowledge that each amendment represents legitimate concerns."
"There are already indications that the Commission's first-come-first-served proposals are easing the negotiating process and that past trading volumes may yet be an element in the final outcome."
"The dispute with the WTO has resulted in retaliatory trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in Member States who are affected in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors."
"Our objective must be to achieve a revised banana regime that will be accepted at the WTO and reflect the EU commitment to the ACP and the most vulnerable suppliers in the Caribbean."
"Successive WTO rulings do not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers."
"The trick is how."
"The Commission must demonstrate that their needs will be addressed."
"It is not comfortable to accept the growth of trade liberalisation and a 'tariff only' system in the future, as the Commission has concluded, but it must be faced."
"The higher the tariff that can be negotiated, the less we will need other measures to help the ACP and the Caribbean."
"I believe that speeding up the negotiations gives the best guarantee of an acceptable tariff level, and for this reason, above all others, I call for full support for this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, while the issue of the liberalisation of the postal services has been important, the reform of the COM in bananas is no less important."
"I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dary, for the content of his report, since he is defending for the second time the maintenance of the quota system for banana imports into the European Union, thereby protecting Community production, and he rejects the automatic transfer to a 'tariff only' system, after a period of validity for the reformed COM which we believe should also be of ten years."
"I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his desire his reach a compromise solution with the Commission."
"I would also like to thank the chairmen of the political groups in this Parliament who have accepted the stubbornness and obstinacy of the Members from the outermost regions so that this proposal for reform of the banana sector may be debated today in this House, and the mandatory opinion may be issued and can thereby arrive in time for the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which will take place in the coming days and we can therefore enter 2001 with a new reform of the COM in bananas."
"I hope that this COM will reflect the aspirations of the World Trade Organisation after so many years of trade disputes, as well as those of the Community producers."
"I trust that, with the passing of time, the system of distribution known as the 'regatta' system, in other words, 'first come, first served' , may be accepted by the banana-producing countries."
"I believe that the solution indicated by the rapporteur, which was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and which is now being considered in Parliament, is the least unsatisfactory solution for all the parties involved in this trade war, which began in 1993 and which now seems to be finding a degree of consensus amongst all the players, whether they be producers, sellers or consumers of one of the most emblematic agricultural products of European society, bananas, which, in the case of the Canary Islands, are unique."
"The important thing is to gain time in this final straight and I propose that we vote in favour of Mr Dary' s report."
"Mr President, as we know, this COM in bananas is of particular importance to the ACP producer countries and some outermost regions, as is the case of Madeira, both in terms of production and employment and in terms of the environment, because of the maintenance of productive vegetation, a fundamental issue for regional development itself."
"Solving the current problem of the future of the common organisation of the market by means of an import regime based on a uniform tariff would entail a serious risk that banana prices would fall on the Community market, which would require an increase in compensatory aid given to producers in the outermost regions and entail a review of the Financial Perspective approved within Agenda 2000 for financing the common agricultural policy."
"It is therefore right that the Commission should continue not to insist on its proposals or banana production will disappear, with serious consequences on the social, economic and environmental fronts, as the rapporteur, Mr Dary, has pointed out."
"Hence, the transitional period should be about fifteen years, certainly not less than ten, and the compensatory aid should include guaranteed earnings for Community producers and a market for the produce of the outermost regions, and so aid should also be included for the bodies that market the bananas produced there."
"We shall vote for the proposals and this report in the hope that the Commission will review its position."
"Mr President, as previous speakers have said, the time has come to find a workable solution to this problem, as well as a solution which is WTO-compliant."
"Far too often in the past, the WTO has ruled against us."
"I represent industries in my Member State, the UK, which have fallen foul of US retaliatory action, where Mrs Barshefsky, the US trade secretary, has decided to impose 100% increases in import tariffs on Scottish companies."
"We have suffered losses in the cashmere industry."
"When these companies in my Member State, in my constituency, were confronted with 100% import tariffs by the US, at one point it could have led to the closure of the cashmere industry in the Borders of Scotland, with a potential loss of 4000 jobs."
"We have another small company, Arran Aromatics, which exports the majority of its products to America."
"It has also been hit with retaliatory action by the US."
"It employs 50 people on a remote West Coast Scottish island and yet they are suffering from retaliation from the banana war, about which they know little and with which they have no connection whatsoever. This is deeply unfair."
"A lot has been made in this debate of the apparent unanimity of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in supporting Mr Dary's report."
"I should say to you that there were many amendments put forward to Mr Dary's report in the Agriculture Committee which showed that there were deep divisions in that committee."
"We must not take that as evidence of unanimity in any way."
"If the colleagues from the southern Member States are going to continue to vote against WTO compliance then they must take the consequences and not the innocent companies in my Member State."
"Mr President, once again, the House is going to deliver its opinion on the banana issue, and I congratulate Michel Dary on his remarkable work."
"Today, at the end of negotiations which looked like some sort of mug' s game and having accepted compromises devoid of substance, the Commission has, however, remained inflexible."
"I hope that it will listen to our arguments today, for this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even if it were to amount to EUR 300, is in danger of proving completely useless in practice, for the ACP producers will be wiped out by the so-called 'first come, first served' system."
"This procedure is rightly termed a boat race since, as in such a race, it is the boat which makes all the difference."
"We already know which competitors will cross the line first: the multinationals with their high-performance equipment and refrigerated ships."
"Today, the United States and the majority of South American countries themselves reject this system."
"Why, then, does the Commission continue to defend such an unfair arrangement?"
"Why not consider returning to the 'historic references' system to which the United States and the South American countries are now giving their overwhelming support?"
"Otherwise, the ground rules could at least be modified in such a way as not to effectively exclude African producers."
"A two-round organisation, with the first round reserved for ACP producers when it comes to granting import licences for rating quota 'C' , would therefore enable a balance to be restored."
"Where this issue is concerned, our ACP partners do not need charity, Commissioner. They just need us to join forces in order to defend our interests together."
"Thank you, Mrs Carlotti."
"We will now adjourn the debate since we must proceed to the vote, which will take a while."
"The debate will therefore resume at 3.00 p.m."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour to inform you of the presence in the gallery of a delegation from the Korean Parliament."
"I would like to very warmly welcome this Korean delegation, which has come here to attend the sixth interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the Republic of Korea, which takes place in Strasbourg on 12 and 13 December."
"It consists of four members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, presided over by the Honourable Mr Jeymoon Chung."
"The European Parliament and the Korean Parliament entered into direct political dialogue years ago, and this dialogue has already yielded considerable results."
"We wish to strengthen our cooperation with the Republic of Korea and we now have an excellent opportunity to discuss the events that have recently taken place on the Korean Peninsular."
"We hope that their work in the European Parliament will be fruitful and that their stay in Strasbourg will be a happy one."
"VOTE"
"Mr President, we have not debated the issue of this special committee."
"As far as I am aware it has never been raised in Parliament."
"We are putting it to a vote without any discussion."
"I would be interested to know how it was established, where its foundations came from, what its costs are going to be, how it relates to the established committees - industry, public health and the others - and whether it is proper to vote on this without any public debate."
"Mr Purvis, the Rules are very clear."
"Under Rule 150, the Conference of Presidents takes a decision to establish such a committee."
"We do not debate the issue, we simply vote on the membership."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"

"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I confirm the position which Mr Bolkestein set out yesterday evening on behalf of the Commission."
"This would mean that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 14 and 18 and that it can also approve in principle the ideas contained in Amendments Nos 5, 13 and 12."
"The Commission takes the view, however, that this directive is not the right place for these ideas to be enshrined."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 17 and 20 in part but rejects most of the substance of these amendments."
"The Commission rejects all the other amendments."
"Amendment No 20:"
"Mr President, the original version of this amendment is the German version; the Spanish version is inaccurate."
"I merely wanted to point out, once again, that we are voting on the German version; the problem arises in the second part, where reference is made to the shareholders' meeting and the supervisory board."
"The Spanish version says ""or the administrative board""."

"Mr President, I have one correction to the amendment as it stands: the addition of the single word ""Croatian"" before the word ""citizens"" ."

"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Maaten report (A5-0348/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Maaten report approximating the provisions on the sale of tobacco products."
"It is a well-known fact that diseases caused by smoking tobacco reduce the number of pensioners because they reduce life-expectancy."
"I can therefore only support this directive which, although intended to regulate the internal market, also limits or seeks to limit the harm caused by cigarette smoke to the people of the European Union."
"I would also add that I support that part of the proposal which calls for harmful tobacco products not to be sold outside the European Union."
"It is true that in doing this we would be reducing our production for export, but it is also true that the European Union would be acquiring the reputation of selling healthy products, and that can only be a good thing."
". (EL) Unfortunately, although the Commission accepted many of the European Parliament's amendments, the Council did not."
"Parliament needs to reinstate and re-table most of the amendments on the size of the warning, the list of ingredients and the protection of consumers, especially the young."
"Of course, the European Parliament must avoid the extremes contained in certain amendments, which are not convincing, do not have a qualified majority and undermine the efficacy of its intervention as a whole."
"Of course, if we want to be consistent in our approach, we should put similar warnings on products which are equally harmful to consumers, such as animal fats."
"Finally, basic integrity requires that we immediately start putting warnings on cigarettes exported from the European Union - in the language of the importing country."
"I wish to support the decisive decision by the EP to vote for the introduction of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets, This is a huge breakthrough for public health as we now have labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the real cost of smoking."
"Existing health warnings are obscured by clever colour combinations, striking packaging and tucked behind careful displays."
"Most smokers neither know the full risks nor bear the full costs of their choice."
"- (FR) I have voted in favour of this directive."
"Every day, tobacco kills more people."
"Faced with this scourge, all Europeans should be clearly informed of the dangers of consuming this product, which is very harmful to human beings."
"In the various debates on this subject, I have steadfastly opposed those who defend the tobacco industry."
"The discussions have divided MEPs into two camps: on the one hand, there were those who hid behind the Treaties in order to justify the faint-hearted position they had adopted and, on the other hand, there were those who were concerned, above all, with people' s daily lives and health."
"I belong to this second camp."
"If the texts are to have the force of law, they should be worded in such a way as to reflect the daily concerns of all Europeans."
"Under cover of legal arguments, a number of MEPs have actually been defending the tobacco industry."
"What basis can there be for defending the interests of companies which destroy people' s lives on a daily basis?"
"No economic or legal argument can prevail over an argument on public health grounds."
"Unfortunately, this directive will not solve all the problems associated with tobacco consumption."
"However, it has the virtue of providing smokers with the information they need to make them fully aware of the risks they are running and of the threats they pose to those around them. It also does away with misleading designations such as 'light' and 'ultra-light' ."
"These public health proposals will therefore send a strong message to all citizens, especially the youngest Europeans."
"Finally, I am delighted at the ban on exports from the European Union of tobacco products banned in the Member States."
"It was unthinkable and scandalous to permit such exports."
"Might there be two categories of people as far as a number of MEPs are concerned: those that are to be protected and those that are to be endangered for economic reasons?"
"I hope that the Council will hear our message so as to end the deception and protect everyone' s health as best it can."
"When I voted against the ban on the advertising of tobacco products in 1998, my vote was misconstrued in letters to the editors of Luxembourg newspapers as a vote against the prevention of cancer."
"I tried to explain at the time that the EC Treaty provided no legal basis for such an advertising ban."
"The European Court of Justice has now confirmed that my position was correct."
"Members of Parliament cannot simply let their hearts rule their heads and adopt legislation for which there is no legal basis, however commendable their motives."
"In my long parliamentary career, which has now spanned 35 years, I have always adhered to this principle."
"I shall not change my approach and let myself be intimidated by the veritable threatening letters I have been receiving, which demand that I declare my voting intentions so that the writers of these letters can make my intentions public; this means, of course, that they can once again engage in misinformation and subject me to public vilification. These campaigns are waged by means of slogans, because those who conduct them are ignorant of the wide variety of considerations that a parliamentarian has to take into account when examining such a complex piece of legislation as a European directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products."
"I know that tobacco consumption is one of the most frequent causes of death and that public health must remain one of our main concerns, but we have to act within the bounds of our legal powers and in accordance with the principle of proportionality."
"The recommendation for second reading made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of the European Parliament does not meet these criteria."
"It not only contains the exaggerated demands of health freaks, which would result in the loss of thousands of jobs, especially women's jobs, to name but one adverse effect, without turning one single chain smoker into a non-smoker."
"But here too, as in the case of the directive banning tobacco advertising, the legal basis is wrong."
"An article relating to the internal market certainly cannot be used to justify an export ban."
"Acceptance of this recommendation for a second reading as it now stands would merely open the door to new litigation."
"The result would be uncertainty and delays and would only thwart the essentially good intention that underlies this legislative proposal from the European Commission."
"It is precisely because I do not want this to happen that I have decided to reject the common position, and a motion tabled by my group proposes that the House do likewise."
"The decision made will cost jobs in Northern Ireland."
"This is a wrong decision."
"I have no objection to supporting stricter legislation for the European Union, but to apply this to exports is unacceptable and the legal base for this decision is dubious."
"We have no right to dictate to others what they do in their countries outside the EU, nor is it wise to export jobs from the EU to third countries where they will simply produce and sell the products and take over our existing markets."
"I wish particularly to explain why I voted against the ban on export of tobacco products above a certain tar/nicotine level from the EU and supported amendments that sought to lift that ban."
"Above all, I am concerned by the very real risk to jobs of over 1 000 people employed at the BAT factory in Southampton."
"There are over 5 000 jobs also at risk related to that factory."
"For instance, hundreds of printers in Portsmouth who produce cigarette packaging."
"Over 95% of the output of the Southampton plant is exported."
"I fear either the company will relocate, or the markets they serve will be met by other suppliers outside the EU."
"So this move will not lead to healthier cigarettes being smoked - but simply to export jobs from Europe."
"This is a sad day for the workers in Southampton who must now hope the British government might try to block the move."
"I fear they will hope in vain."
"I believe smokers should be given full information but then be free to make their own choice."
"Additionally, insisting on imposing our standards outside Europe is an example of post-colonial imperialism."
"So I voted for freedom - jobs."
"I wholeheartedly support the common position on the proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the EU."
"We have fought a powerful tobacco lobby to lead the campaign for new cigarette health warnings to cover a third of the surface of cigarette packs."
"Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that."
"Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these, half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life."
"As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco, and 85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking."
"Madam President, I would welcome the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada."
"If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking, go ahead and print them on packs."
"It is preposterous that the tobacco lobby is seeking to destroy this legislation."
"I am fed up of tobacco giants such as Marlboro, Benson & Hedges and Rothmans trying to put a stop to these proposals."
"They have misled people for far too long."
"At present, warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging."
"This is our last-ditch attempt to put labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the true cost of smoking."
"Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice."
"The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as 'ultra-light' and 'low tar' ."
"People have been hooked on the idea that 'mild' and 'low tar' cigarettes are healthier."
"This is simply not true."
"Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes - smokers just draw harder to get the same kick."
"This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives."
"Trakatellis report (A5-0377/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Trakatellis report which, as we know, allocates EUR 79.1 million for 2001-2002, including EUR 8.5 million to health information, EUR 31.1 million to the plan of action on cancer, EUR 22.2 million to the prevention of AIDS, EUR 11.4 million to the prevention of drug dependence, EUR 4.4 million to health monitoring and EUR 1.3 million to the fight against pollution-related diseases."
"I consider all this to be positive although I would prefer - and I say so now on this occasion - much more to be spent on the prevention of diseases."
"Preventing diseases costs less and is better in terms of health than treating them once they have developed."
"It is important to avoid interruption and to proceed with the extension of the existing programmes in the field of public health that expire in the short term, given that their objectives are to complement national policies in protecting human health."
"In this report, the rapporteur supports the extension of the six programmes until 31 December 2002, although he rightly criticises the Commission' s legislative schedule, which lies at the root of this problem, since four were to expire at the end of this year and two at the end of 2001."
"Note that these are major programmes aimed at improvements in public health, the fight against cancer, AIDS prevention, the fight against drug dependence, health monitoring and pollution-related diseases."
"As mentioned in the report, however, it is essential that there should also be an annual extension of the financial appropriation and that the necessary measures should be taken to ensure a problem-free transition while the new programme is drawn up."
"Lehne report (A5-0368/2000)"
"Mr President, the Labour delegation of the European Parliament voted against Mr Lehne's amendments to the common position."
"As I said in the debate last night, they would be very damaging for EU company competitiveness."
"They introduce rigid structures and try to bring company law in by the back door, which will not achieve a single market in capital and will undermine investor confidence of our shareholders."
"Following ten years of negotiation, I regret that this Parliament has chosen by a narrow qualified majority vote to allow company boards the right to defensive measures to frustrate takeovers without getting approval from shareholders."
"However, I welcome the fact that the Commission cannot go along with the rapporteur's views on this and I hope that common sense will prevail in conciliation."
"I am pleased that we rejected the rapporteur's very messy approach on jurisdiction: this would have led to very much litigation and court cases and would have served nobody's interests, not least the interests of EU companies."
"With the passage of Amendment No 20, the EPLP has made it clear that while employee consultation is the objective of a framework directive on employment, we also believe that a spirit of cooperation is needed to consult workforces and their representatives when we have discussions on takeovers and mergers."
"Mr President, I voted for the directive on takeover bids."
"I would have preferred this piece of legislation to have been introduced by means of a regulation, which is more appropriate for any activity relating to citizens throughout the European Union."
"However, I would like to use this explanation of vote to point out that for a long time - and I hope that it will happen soon - I have been waiting for there to be a takeover bid - a TOB - for the national social welfare institutions."
"In my opinion, they should be privatised."
"They would be unlikely to show such losses as they do now under the management of the national States."
"I do not see why we cannot entrust the management of their own social welfare to the public as well."
"- (SV) The proposal to harmonise the rules of the Member States concerning company take-over bids was previously, in 1989, rejected as incompatible with the principle of subsidiarity."
"This is a judgment that I still regard as relevant and correct, which is why I have voted against the report in its entirety."
"From a purely objective point of view there are significant objections, for example to Amendment No 6, concerning Article 4.2."
"This proposes that only 30 per cent of the votes shall be sufficient to take control of a company."
"This number of votes in a company is too low."
"This view is shared by the Federation of Swedish Industries, which instead advocates 40 per cent of the votes."
"Zimmerling report (A5-0370/2000)"
"Mr President, this common position was again voted through with a narrow majority."
"The Commission and the rapporteur have failed to recognise that the art trade is a global business and would be better regulated by an international agreement."
"We now fear that the art market will go offshore."
"The Commission, again, has failed to commit itself to entering international negotiations to get an international deal on droit de suite, claiming that it feels it does not have a mandate in this area."
"It now does have a mandate with the voting through and the start of the conciliation procedure."
"The Commission has also failed spectacularly to give us any analysis of the economic impact of the directive before us."
"This leads us to conclude that it is not proven to be necessary to complete the single market."
"It cannot, therefore, be the objective of this Parliament to undermine the European art market and in conciliation I hope now that the Member States and Commission will be able to maintain the common position."
"The amendments that Mr Zimmerling has tabled will deal a death blow to the vitality to the European art market, with loss of jobs and, I fear, very few living artists benefiting from this resale right."
"Mr President, I support this directive on the resale right for works of art."
"Our world admires artists, luckily."
"Long may it last!"
"There must be more to this world than mere numbers and sterile computers: it must include artists - for as long as possible."
"In order to permit these artists to express themselves fully, it is certainly useful and important to make it possible for them to receive payment when their works are sold."
"However, Mr President, should we not also be thinking about their pensions?"
"I remember a deaf-mute artist who came to ask for my help many times in Italy in applying for a higher pension: his pension was effectively too low to live on and every now and again he was forced to sell one of his fine paintings, one of his works of art."
"Well, in my opinion, we should also do something - I would advocate in the near future - about artists' pensions."
"The resale right for the benefit of the author is an important mechanism for supporting artistic creation and artists."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%."
"However, the attempt to reconcile the resale right with the competitiveness of the European market in objets d'art has resulted, mainly on the part of the Council, in reduced protection for the artist from subsequent sales of his works."
"The European Union should move in the opposite direction and help to internationalise the resale right by putting this issue at the top of its agenda during negotiations with other countries with a flourishing art market, such as the USA, Switzerland etc."
"If the droit de suite is regarded as part of copyright and hence as an artist's prerogative, it makes no sense to grant artists a right which they do not want."
"In Austria, which is one of the three countries where there is no droit de suite, artists tend to agree that the droit de suite would have distinctly adverse effects, especially on young artists."
"Even many established artists, whom it would benefit, have voiced their opposition to its introduction for reasons of professional solidarity."
"Besides, it is more than questionable whether there is any identifiable need for harmonisation in this sensitive area."
"The introduction of the droit de suite, indeed, would lead to an erosion of the market in works of art with all its detrimental consequences; the small galleries, which have a special part to play in encouraging young artistic talent, would come under particular pressure."
"For these reasons, the Members representing the Freedom Alliance have decided not to endorse the report."
". (NL) I would like to thank Mr Zimmerling for his work on this complicated dossier."
"Although it was clear from his report that he got to the bottom of the issue, I as a Liberal fail to agree with him, because I believe that, where possible, legislation should be whittled down a minimum."
"In various Member States, it has transpired that resale right is superfluous and causes distortions on the internal market."
"Rendering this legislation compulsory would immediately and seriously harm Europe' s competitive position in terms of art compared to other markets, because resale right outside Europe is non-existent."
"This is why I am of the opinion that the international art market will move outside of Europe as a result of the directive."
"Finally, I believe that the present proposal does not offer any protection to young, fledgling artists in general, but only to a small group."
"By voting against this directive, my group would also like to give out a political signal that we should not waste our time laying down superfluous rules."
". (NL) I would like to thank Mr Zimmerling for the work he has done on this report."
"Although it is an attempt to protect artists, in fact, together with the Commission proposal as it is now before us, it has actually achieved the opposite effect."
"Of course, I realise that artists are entitled to remuneration for their creativity, but unlike books, in the case of visual arts, this right is actually bought at the initial sale."
"Furthermore, in countries such as the Netherlands, where resale right has not been applied so far, there are plenty of options for both the young and more established artists in the shape of a buoyant art trade, which also benefits the artists."
"Resale right as it is now proposed requires a massive amount of red tape, whilst the benefit for the individual young artist is minimal."
"Moreover, it is exceptionally difficult to check whether the art trade keeps to this resale right."
"This regulation, therefore, has a restricting rather than a stimulating effect."
"Also, both the young and the renowned artist will suffer if the international trade moves outside the European borders due to European over-regulation."
"I therefore have no choice but to vote against this directive."
"Oostlander report (A5-0363/2000)"
"Mr President, what can I say about the common strategy of the European Union on Russia?"
"I did, of course, vote in favour of this document, but in my heart I am concerned for the pensioners of Russia."
"I am concerned for their welfare not only because I have discovered that there is a Russian Pensioners' Party whose symbol is a heart, a red heart, while the symbol of the European People's Party, which I belong to, is a blue heart."
"There is another reason why I am concerned about the Russian pensioners, namely that I feel that the aid which we send to that heavily populated part of the former Soviet Union which is Russia should benefit the Russian pensioners and elderly people as well as others and be used to give them a higher standard of living than they had under the Communist dictatorship for so many years."
"- (FR) Apart from its seeking to make an impact by setting out good intentions regarding stability, the rule of law and the fight against corruption, the Oostlander report is in fact nothing more than a vote of confidence in Mr Putin."
"This document says little or nothing about the disastrous implications of returning to the law of the market: poverty on a massive scale for the majority of the population, whose standard of living has been reduced by two thirds since before 1991."
"If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of the past, how is it possible to have the slightest confidence in Mr Putin, the executioner of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias and the man who endeavours to eliminate all opposition in civil society (unions, political parties) in order to strengthen his personal power?"
"In this area, note should be taken of the rapporteur' s concern to help churches and religious organisations."
"However, there is absolute silence about the unions, now threatened by the reform of labour legislation and, in certain cases, by outright police repression."
"For these reasons, I have voted against this report."
"Baltas report (A5-0364/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the document regulating the Republic of Croatia's association with the European Union, which is a positive step."
"I am also concerned about the interests of the Croatian pensioners and that is why I am highlighting the lack of an intention in this document to extend regulation 1408 to workers who are Croatian citizens or in any case Croatian citizens who have worked both in Croatia and in the States of the European Union, for I feel that this should happen as soon as possible. This regulation lays down that people who have worked in both Croatia and the States of the European Union have the right to accrue national insurance contributions."
"These stabilisation agreements should all call for and bring about the extension of this regulation which benefits the pensions of those who have worked in these other States."
"- (FR) Although the changes in the political situation in Croatia can only be cause for rejoicing, the report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia is disappointing in view of the considerable amount that is at stake in this region."
"In general, the financial resources allocated to the stabilisation of this area are widely known to be insufficient."
"Moreover, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the CARDS programme and the European Investment Bank cannot constitute the main instruments for the European Union' s contribution to the economic and social development of Croatia."
"Indeed, the fact cannot be ignored that the criteria for structural adjustment which accompany aid policies and the conditions for drawing closer to the European Union continue, and will continue, to produce social and economic disasters with explosive social consequences and entail the risk, as can now be seen in Romania, of the imminent rise of a nationalistic and xenophobic extreme right throughout this region."
"We can, therefore, only condemn the fact that Fanjo Tudjman was not charged before his death, in the same way as Slobodan Milosevic, since the newly opened archives prove the extent to which the two men jointly planned the ethnic dismemberment of the region."
"For all these reasons, we abstained from voting."
"Maij-Weggen report (A5-0323/2000)"
"I also voted for the document on developing closer relations between Indonesia and the European Union."
"Of course, Indonesia does not really deserve this development of closer relations with the Union because its leaders have not exactly distinguished themselves in terms of great democracy or commendable actions, but we must think about the Indonesian citizens, and so I say roll on the development of closer relations and I welcome the provision of this aid."
"However, I would call for a European representative to be seconded to Indonesia, who could tell us whether the funds have been used to benefit the Indonesian people or not."
"We must create the tangible post of European ambassador to Indonesia."
"- (FR) If Parliament wants to offer real help to the Indonesian population, and, in particular, to the poorest social strata, it is not enough to send a few funds which will inevitably be misappropriated by the men in power."
"The European Parliament should at least adopt a firm stance against the scandalous fact that major Western companies, including a number with their head offices on European Union territory, are paying salaries more akin to derisory handouts. It does not even take the trouble to talk about the issue."
"Looting by Indonesia' s corrupt wheeler-dealer ruling class unquestionably has a major role to play in the poverty of the masses in Indonesia, just as the army and the militias play a key role in their oppression."
"However, the low salaries paid by the major companies which, moreover, often have recourse to child labour, either directly or through subcontractors, constitute another, equally serious and inhumane form of plunder."
"We have therefore abstained from voting on this text."
". (NL) Indonesia is a product of 350 years of Dutch colonialism."
"For the sake of foreign economic interests, different peoples were forced to coexist under one authority."
"Little changed during more than 30 years of the Suharto regime."
"Out of economic self-interest, Europe, the United States and Australia wanted to remain on a friendly footing with the Indonesian regime, so that their companies could benefit from the exploitation of natural resources and from the low cost of labour."
"A Dutch rapporteur is now starting her proposal by emphasising that the European Parliament should recognise the sovereignty and integrity of the Indonesian borders."
"The PRD, the left opposition party, which is in contact with my party, the Dutch Socialist Party, is taking a more balanced view."
"It, too, would prefer Indonesia to remain one country, but it denounces the state violence which is deployed time and again to this end against the peoples of Aceh, the Moluccas and Western Papua."
"Following the wave of democratisation, the power of the army, authoritarian rulers and large companies in Indonesia is once again on the increase."
"The murder of the Dutch journalist, Sander Thoenes, on East Timor, occupied by Indonesia at the time, remains unsolved."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen' s conclusions are too optimistic and too much geared towards serving economic interests."
"There is every reason to draw particular attention to the persecution, violence and terror to which Christians are being subjected in the Moluccas, particularly on the island of Ambo, by the criminal activists of the Jihad movement."
"Churches have been desecrated and burnt down, Christians have been forced to flee in droves and a large number of people have been killed."
"I have personally met the Catholic bishop Mondagi from Ambo, together with Protestant church leaders."
"The situation is alarming."
"The Indonesian government and the army have pledged to ensure the safety and to protect the lives of their citizens, irrespective of the religion they profess."
"Theato report (A5-0376/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report."
"And why is that?"
"The Pensioners' Party includes a separate section of pensioner criminals, expelled from the party, who have spent their lives stealing and breaking the law."
"I expelled them from the Pensioners' Party myself, but I do consult them every now and again and ask their advice."
"On the subject of this report, they said, ""If you want to prevent fraud, it would be a good idea for the European Union funds not to pass through the State public bodies but to go straight to the citizens, for I am sad to say that corruption is widespread among public employees."
"And if we add to the corruption of the European public employees the corruption of the employees of the national State bodies, then the result will be an increase in fraud."
"We have voted for the introduction of new instruments that will provide substantially better protection of the Community' s funds."
"We believe in the first instance that it is a good idea to supplement the OLAF scheme by setting up a unit under OLAF."
"This unit is to head investigations and ease prosecution proceedings in the national courts."
"The unit is only to be involved with criminality committed by EU employees."
"Such a prosecuting authority under OLAF is necessary because experience shows that far too often no prosecution follows from OLAF' s work."
"It is often not clear in which country a case is to be brought and difficult procedures for the exchange of evidence mean that the case often lapses under the statute of limitations or is dropped."
"Unfortunately inter-state cooperation is not sufficient."
"The inter-state anti-fraud conventions are not ratified."
"There are still five Member States that have not ratified the Convention for the protection of the EU' s financial interests of 1995, for example."
"In the longer term, one should therefore consider the introduction of a European Public Prosecutor, who would take care of the prosecution proceedings in connection with fraud involving EU funds in the Member States."
"At the moment, the Member States do not do enough to combat fraud involving EU funds."
"Moreover, 80% of cases of fraud are cross-border cases."
"Here prosecution is often problematic."
"There are major differences as regards the definition of illegal acts and penalties as well as with regard to procedure, rules on evidence and the authority of the prosecuting authority to carry out checks."
"It is to be feared that the problem will become worse with the removal of the borders that has given organised crime even greater freedom of movement."
"The fraudsters will seek out those countries that have the least protection."
"Consequently, we must establish the necessary instruments for more effective combating of fraud involving EU funds as soon as possible."
"Because of the high incidence of fraud in connection with Community resources, we in the Freedom Alliance have supported tighter controls since time immemorial."
"We therefore welcome the Theato report and have voted for the creation of the office of a European Public Prosecutor."
"Our position, however, is that national prosecuting powers must not be affected by the creation of the post of European Public Prosecutor."
"The creation of this new authority must not lead to any transfer of sovereignty in core areas."
"Within these limits, the European Public Prosecutor, acting as a coordinating authority, can make a valuable contribution to the suppression of fraud."
"- (FR) The Theato report on combating fraud reveals that the Central European Bank, no doubt the better to prove its celebrated independence, thought it inappropriate to subscribe to the Interinstitutional Agreement relating to OLAF."
"The report takes up a number of ideas contained in the European judges' Geneva Appeal, such as the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor."
"Unfortunately, it does not adopt the most important proposal, to make any financial transaction involving a tax haven illegal."
"Finally, as if all the better to emphasise the ridiculous dispossession of the representatives of universal suffrage, the report charges the President of the European Parliament with forwarding its proposals to an Intergovernmental Conference which will already be at an end when this vote is taken."
"Since nothing was decided in this area in Nice, we are doing what the report has already invited us to do and interpreting this lack of decision ""as laxity and indifference in relation to fraud in Europe"" ."
"In spite of its limitations, we shall vote in favour of this report as one way, admittedly too timid a way, of rebelling against the neo-liberal rationale according to which the taxation of profit is by definition an unwarranted deduction, in connection with which it is legitimate to commit fraud."
"The EPLP abstained on this report because it calls for the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor as advocated by the Corpus Juris expert group."
"A European Public Prosecutor established according to Corpus Juris would have wide-ranging powers to carry out investigations in Member States."
"Corpus Juris envisages the eventual creation of an independent European Prosecution Office with jurisdiction for offences against the EU's financial interests carried out both by members and officials of EU institutions and by third parties."
"It would establish the EU as a single legal area for the purpose of investigation, prosecution, trial and execution of sentences concerning this type of offence."
"The British Government is opposed to this proposal, which it considers is too broad in scope and presents too many problems in terms of different legal systems and traditions to be practical."
"The government's preference is to improve existing cooperation between Member States to tackle fraud and other serious crimes with a cross-border element."
"This would involve the ratification of the 1995 Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests by those Member States which have yet to ratify, and the mutual recognition of legal systems."
"Thank you, Mr Crowley, I understand it was a difficult situation."
"That concludes the vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.34 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Bananas COM (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the common organisation of the market in the banana sector."
"Mr Sturdy has the floor."
"Mr President, one of the problems with the banana issue, it seems to me, is that it has become rather emotive."
"I see my job as a Member of the European Parliament as not just to look after those banana producers within the European Union but all the people in Europe."
"I understand how people feel about changes to the system but, as I said, I want to look after everyone within the European Union as a whole."
"If, in that process, I can safeguard the interests of our ACP countries then that is all to the good, but I believe that it is important that we safeguard and look to the welfare of European citizens."
"We seem sometimes to have lost sight of this fact."
"I am not one to welcome the way in which the USA has implemented these draconian measures, but it is desperately important that we get a settlement."
"In my constituency I have industries that are being forced out of business."
"Jobs are being lost within the European Union because of 100% tariffs on products."
"I have received many letters about the fact that it is an emotive issue."
"It may well be to some of our southern Members even more emotive."
"Well, I just say to them, this is about real people."
"It is about real emotions and about real jobs."
"People are being forced out of business because of the Americans and therefore I say it is important that we accept the ruling of the WTO."
"Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this."
"As I said just now, I never accepted the way the Americans acted but it is too late now to deal with that."
"Therefore, I call upon this House to take a decision tomorrow and I support the proposals by Mr Vatenen, who is speaking later."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the benefit to those who voted us into office, we must also think of the benefit to the whole of the EU and even the world at large."
"The benefit to the whole and the individual will become one in the long run."
"The banana issue is a test, in a way, as to whether we want to continue with consultation, which will mean continued punishing customs tariffs for EU companies, which are the basis of our prosperity."
"Are we prepared to ignore the benefit to consumers, if we do not agree to import cheap and tasty bananas?"
"Are we also prepared to discriminate against the poor banana producers of Latin America, because these countries do not have such a strong commitment to a transitional period?"
"It is time we sought compromises and recognised that free trade and prosperity are not each other' s enemies, not even with regard to the issue of bananas."
"I am absolutely in favour of banana producers in ACP countries and our own producers being supported with taxpayers' money to make it possible to end activities that distort trade."
"The Commission' s proposal is based on the notion that a third tariff quota should be introduced where the tariff preference for ACP countries would be EUR 300 per tonne."
"In 2006 the tariff quota would be abandoned and the system based on normal tariffs would take over."
"The tariff system will be simpler to administer, clearer for the parties involved, and will lead to greater prosperity, according to economic theory."
"The transitional period, as outlined by the Commission, is sufficiently long to introduce an appropriate aid scheme."
"Mr Dary' s report shows due concern both for the banana producers in the Community and the ACP countries."
"For that reason, I would like to express my support, in something of a conciliatory manner, for most of the amendments."
"There are, however, some which cannot be supported under any circumstances."
"Amendments Nos 11 and 13 propose that the quota scheme should not be re-examined until ten years have passed and that there should be no commitment now to the tariff system proposed by the Commission and demanded by several of our trading partners."
"In their place I have tabled Amendment No 36, which requires the shift to the customs tariff system in 2006."
"At the same time, it stresses how important it is for the Commission to listen to the European Parliament and consider the interests of all parties at every stage."
"I therefore want to safeguard in particular the interests of our own farmers and those in the ACP countries."
"There must be a balance as a whole."
"I oppose Amendment No 27 as it would water down the transitional period system totally and, in practice, would deprive Latin America of its opportunity to sell bananas under the new quota 'C' ."
"Commissioner Lamy has made a morally responsible and courageous proposal regarding the exemption from duty in respect of products from less developed countries."
"The plan goes under the name 'EBA' - 'Everything but Arms' ."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not have occasion to change the name."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mr Dary for this, his second report, and for his committee's thorough examination of the Commission's proposal for the amendment of the common organisation of the market in bananas."
"My thanks also go to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his efforts in connection with the compromise amendments contained in the second report."
"The responses and remarks I intend to make today are certainly more favourable than in April, when, because of the talks that were taking place at that time with the governments of third countries, it was simply impossible to accept even a single point from the amendments."
"I should like to emphasise from the outset that the Commission fully sympathises with the principles that underlie many of the amendments, for example the proposals relating to the EU producers and the ACP supplier countries."
"I believe that the communication issued by the Commission in October addresses and dispels many of the fears you expressed."
"For example, for the third quota the Commission is now proposing a tariff preference of EUR 300 per tonne for the ACP supplier countries and a tariff of EUR 300 per tonne for third countries."
"I shall move on now to the individual amendments. Allow me to begin with those which the Commission is able to accept in whole or in part."
"In accordance with our new proposal for the ACP tariff preference, the Commission can accept Amendment No 29."
"It must remain possible, however, to lower the tariff if it turns out to have a prohibitive effect on non-ACP supplier countries."
"This is important, because we must ensure that the third quota cannot be regarded as being solely reserved for the ACP countries in practice."
"I can also accept Amendment No 28, if a corresponding clause is added about the possibility of reducing the tariff."
"As for the recital referring to the ACP preference, we agree with EUR 300 per tonne here too, but we consider the word 'maximum' to be unnecessary."
"For this reason we can only partially accept Amendment No 16."
"A second subject that has played a part in this debate is that of the reports."
"The Commission accepts the reinstatement of Article 32, calling for the presentation of a mid-term assessment by 31 December 2004."
"This relates to Amendment No 34."
"If the report had to be presented any earlier, it would quite simply be impossible to discern the relevant market trends."
"The Commission therefore regrets that it cannot accept the amendments calling for the annual submission of a formal report, by which I mean Amendments 14 and 35."
"However, the Commission can certainly give you this information annually in Parliament on the basis of the information available to us at the time."
"Unfortunately, the Commission cannot accept the other amendments, for the following reasons: the first group of amendments, comprising Nos 6, 7, 11, 15, 25 and 26, relates to the deletion of references to the 'tariff only' system in the operative articles and to the automatic switch to that system after a fixed transitional period, accompanied by a regime of tariff quotas."
"The fact is that the 'tariff only' system is an important factor which ensures that the Commission's proposal is well balanced and can serve as a basis for progress in the Council."
"However, I must also remind you that, come what may, the Council must declare its acceptance of the outcome of the negotiations on Article 28 and set a new tariff."
"So the automatic transition relates to the legal construct, but when and in which specific circumstances it is to take place must then be decided by the Council."
"The second point at issue, which is related to the first, concerns the administration of the tariff quotas."
"The amendments in question are Nos 17 and 18, No 27 and Nos 30 and 31."
"As you know, the Commission has spent a great deal of time trying to secure an agreement on the administration of the regime on the basis of historical reference quantities, but all its efforts have proved fruitless."
"That is why we have now proposed, in our October communication, that the quotas be administered by means of the so-called 'greyhound' system, which means that this procedure would henceforth be used for the administration of all three quotas."
"However, so that all supplier countries can have access, in principle, to all the quotas, the Commission services must, as I said before, have scope to lower the tariff preference within these quotas."
"Similarly, it would not be possible to grant the ACP supplier countries preferential treatment under quota 'C' , because that would not be a 'greyhound' system and would not conform to the rules of such procedure; moreover, it would not be WTO-compliant."
"The next issue, which also relates to the quotas, is the extension of the period of validity of the tariff-quotas regime."
"In the view of the Commission, the ten-year period to which Amendments Nos 11 and 13 refer would be too long."
"Besides, there is probably very little chance of our trading partners accepting such an extension."
"This brings me to the amendments that relate to additional support measures for EU producers and to compensatory aid."
"Among the proposed additional support measures are marketing aid (Amendment No 24), additional support from the structural funds (Amendment No 10) and a price review with adjustment of compensatory aid as required (Amendment No 23)."
"I should like to point out that the Commission's proposal is designed to be compatible with the findings of the WTO dispute-settlement panel, but these findings make no reference to intra-Community provisions."
"A formal review of the compensatory-aid mechanism is therefore unnecessary, because the current regime permits full compensation for the income effects of price fluctuations."
"These remarks relate to Amendments Nos 7, 10, 13 and 21 to 24."
"On Amendments Nos 19 and 32, concerning organically produced bananas, may I say once again that there are already horizontal measures in place to guarantee the equivalence of organic bananas from third countries with those produced in the Community."
"Moreover, the organic production of bananas also qualifies for support under the current agri-environmental measures."
"Marketing schemes for these bananas are also part of national and regional rural-development programmes."
"So all the instruments are in place; it is up to the Member States concerned to make good use of them."
"As for fair-trade bananas, to which Amendments No 20 and 33 refer, our position on these has not changed either, because fair-trade bananas would be covered by any horizontal measures that were adopted on the basis of our communication."
"It would therefore make little sense to make provision for measures relating specifically to fair-trade bananas in the common organisation of the market."
"The 'greyhound' system, incidentally, offers a better deal than the present regime to those who produce and sell fair-trade bananas."
"Let me also say that the representatives of fair trade in bananas have expressly welcomed the regime we have proposed."
"I should also like to add that financial support is likewise provided already for the development of the production of organically produced and fair-trade bananas in the ACP countries under the Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas."
"May I deal finally with Amendments Nos 1 to 5 as well as 12 and 36."
"In essence, these amendments only reiterate the main principles which are already enshrined in the original text of the basic Regulation 404/93 and in the new Commission proposal."
"We therefore believe that they are quite simply superfluous, and so, for reasons of form, we must reject these amendments."
"But, as I said, their substance is already enshrined in current legislation."
"The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for your constructive work on this proposal and to express its satisfaction at the constructive nature of the talks we have held on this extremely complex issue."
"This dossier has been on the table for some time now, because we have had to discuss it with all the interested parties."
"However, the Commission believes that the proposal presented in November 1999, supplemented by the communication of October 2000, offers the basis for a solution."
"We hope that the House is now in a position to deliver its opinion, as requested by the Council in October."
"That would be a very important step, because there is a real prospect of finding a genuine solution to this long-standing problem in the very near future."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 10.00 a.m."
"EU/US summit"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the EU/US summit."
"Commissioner Patten has the floor."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to update Parliament on preparations for the EU/US Summit in Washington next Monday."
"Good relations between the United States and the European Union are, of course, vital for world security and for global economic prosperity."
"The better the relationship, the safer the world and the better off our people."
"Today that relationship is in generally good shape."
"Europe and the United States work closely together in defence of the values we share."
"We work together, for example, for a liberal, dependable international trading regime under the WTO."
"We stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of democracy and freedom across the world."
"As in any relationship between friends it is natural that there are occasional disputes, but we should not get these out of proportion."
"On the whole, we have managed recent disputes competently, for example, on the trade side."
"It is important to remember that they represent just a fraction of the total trade that crosses the Atlantic."
"The EU/US Consultative Forum on Biotechnology is an example of how to deal with these issues constructively."
"It will be reporting to this summit on a broad range of biotech issues."
"This will be President Clinton's fifteenth and last EU/US Summit."
"It will give us an opportunity to look again at the new transatlantic agenda and to see how we might streamline procedures and focus future summits more precisely on the really big issues."
"We would like to focus the twice-yearly summits on strategic themes that may run across several summits."
"This is, I acknowledge, easier said than done, but we should try to resist the temptation - and I know that Secretary of State Albright shares this view - for these summits to get excessively entangled in the nitty-gritty of our daily political and economic relationships."
"The Commission is currently producing a draft communication on transatlantic relations which we expect to publish in the spring and we will look forward, for example, to the contribution made by those legislators who are part of our transatlantic relationship and Parliament will, I know, want to be involved in this initiative."
"We have made some progress in moving things in the direction I describe in recent summits and I hope we will be able to take this forward in Washington next week."
"We will, for example, be following up the discussion we launched at Cotonou on Africa and communicable diseases."
"There are some differences in our approach to these matters, but I hope that the summit will send a positive message about the need to pursue our efforts together notably in tackling sensitive questions such as access to affordable drugs including tiered pricing."
"We will cover outstanding trade disputes and aim to lay the foundations for WTO compatible solutions that are mutually acceptable and not unilateral."
"We expect there to be discussion on a future new WTO round as well as some discussion of the implications for that round of the wide array of new bilateral trade initiatives being debated in the American hemisphere."
"I am sure there will be discussion too of other areas where the United States and the European Union do not quite see eye-to-eye, for example, on the environment where we must make every effort to support work to salvage a deal on climate change."
"The summit will naturally touch on key areas where the European Union and the United States have worked and are working closely together in the service of peace, first, on the Balkans where we have had an increasingly close and successful relationship and where, partly thanks to our efforts, there have been so many important changes for the better over the last year."
"We shall, no doubt, review recent developments in the Middle East."
"The President and his administration have devoted enormous efforts to the pursuit of lasting peace in the Middle East."
"Today the dark shadow of violence hangs over the region, but the patient persistent efforts of the peacemakers must continue."
"The European Union has a role to play in the process and we are doing that."
"Plainly the consolidation of peace will be closely related to the development of our Mediterranean partnership."
"Finally, we will, I am sure, touch on the recent decisions at Nice on the European rapid reaction force."
"These are important decisions."
"They represent an attempt by Europe to make good some of the failures revealed in the Balkans in the 1990s and most recently during the Kosovo conflict."
"One of the main lessons was that the Europeans needed to shoulder more of the burden in promoting European security."
"We need to do so, not to decouple the United States from the defence of Europe, not because we believe there is any weakening of the US strategic commitment to Europe, but to answer those in Washington who sometimes call it into question: the voices that claim, with some justification, that Europe cannot continue to depend on the United States to bail it out of European conflicts unless it is prepared to do more to help itself."
"This then will be the last summit under this administration, the last such summit with President Clinton."
"Transatlantic relations will, I hope, grow ever stronger in the years to come, but Europe will miss President Clinton."
"He has been a good friend to this continent."
"He has laid the foundations for a serious and mature dialogue between us in the post-Cold-War world and he has worked tirelessly for a cause we all share, that of a Europe whole and free and increasingly prosperous."
"From Kosovo to Belfast, millions of European citizens have cause to be thankful for the contribution he has made and I know that the House will join with me in paying tribute to that contribution today."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here today to give us his statement for the meeting which is going to take place next Monday."
"He has rightly said that the transatlantic relationship is one which has expanded greatly in the last ten years - mostly, it is true, on the American side thanks to President Clinton; but I think that history will relate that there has also been a European contribution to this new relationship, which has been a fundamental key to the way in which it has worked, through the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and through the new Transatlantic Agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995."
"I think it would be very helpful, as the Commission prepares this new document on transatlantic relations, if we in Parliament could be given a document which analyses the progress which has been made so far in this relationship in looking at, for example, the success of the EU educational centres, success in terms of policy cooperation on such matters as AIDS, immigration, aid development issues and even on foreign policy questions such as work on transatlantic houses in Ukraine."
"Equally it would be very helpful to know, because we are financing these in the budget of the European Union, how the dialogues have been developing."
"The TABD, the Business Dialogue was very successful in its last meeting in Cincinatti, but we note that since then the Environment Dialogue has closed down in the last couple of weeks."
"Therefore, I think an analysis of what has happened would be very helpful."
"To conclude, what next?"
"I believe that where we in this House are, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, building up relationships, through the Legislators' Dialogue between the European Parliament and Congress, we would hope, in the longer term, to see that turn into a form of transatlantic assembly."
"Equally, we would like to see how the different dialogues of the business dialogue can be put into a broader partnership framework."
"I would ask the Commissioner, in the run-up to the release of this document in April, under a new US Administration, apparently, it was decided today, under a new US President, hopefully George W. Bush, to see how to deepen this partnership in the future, based on the new Treaty of Nice which extends the activities of the European Union so as to enable it to be a real partner with the United States in the decade ahead."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, I believe you have given us a good introduction and briefing on the issues and topics that we shall be discussing, and I believe the honourable Member, Mr Elles, was right to emphasise the need to establish precisely what we wish our transatlantic relationship to achieve in the year 2001 and beyond."
"The most important thing for us will be to consolidate, to examine very carefully the actual progress that has been made in the various programmes we have launched under the umbrella of the Transatlantic Agenda."
"These are the topics referred to by Mr Elles."
"But there is another area which is very important and which has come in for a great deal of criticism, namely the mutual-recognition agreements, which have given rise to very many problems on both sides of the Atlantic, especially the American side."
"I should be grateful if you would deal in detail with these agreements in the communication which is scheduled for the spring of next year and if, besides the analysis requested by the other side of the House, you would also make proposals as to how we can achieve new aims in future in all domains - in the various dialogues, in our cooperation in the fields of foreign policy and security policy and even in practical everyday areas such as the mutual-recognition agreements."
"That will be very, very important."
"Another area relates to the aforementioned EU educational centres, which I believe have been highly successful."
"Consolidation is important, but so, too, is the right perspective."
"I believe you touched on an important point there."
"Under the Clinton Administration, we have made great strides in the realm of political cooperation."
"However, we have also seen trade policy, and trade disputes in particular, playing an ever greater role as a determinant of general political relations and gaining absolutely unmerited prominence, in my opinion."
"It is essential that, at future summit meetings, you actually manage to focus attention on the major political issues and that matters such as the trade disputes which highlight differences between us are assigned to their proper place, that their importance is not exaggerated and that they are not allowed to become focal points of political discord between Europe and the United States."
"So it will be important to change tack here and write a real Transatlantic Agenda for the year 2001."
"I know that our Ambassador in Washington, Gunter Burghardt, has already spoken about this, and I should be delighted if his interesting proposals were actually incorporated into your communication."
"I wish you every success in this task."
"I also wish our Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, every success in his efforts to bring about the settlement of our trade disputes with the United States, and it would please me to see you present the communication at the earliest possible date."
"Mr President, there seem to be many issues which this summit should address on its agenda, and one that I would like to see there is follow-up to the disappointing breakdown of the climate change talks in The Hague and how to get the US to take its responsibilities more seriously."
"But the area that I want to focus on is world trade, the whole idea of a new trade round one year after Seattle."
"This would seem an opportune time to take stock."
"I think it is clear that before any new round is considered we need to address the perception of many developing countries that nothing has changed since Seattle in spite of the many promises that were made at the time."
"I know the Commission is now talking about reviving elements of its position for a new round, making it more flexible, and I look forward to knowing what that really means in practice."
"I also know and welcome the Everything but Arms Initiative and would urge the Commission to use the occasion of the summit to press the US again to join in with this initiative."
"But we need to go further in building confidence with poorer countries."
"Research from the development agency OXFAM has shown that when they have discussed what has changed since Seattle with the developing country delegations, the perceptions are that nothing has changed at all."
"Bangladesh, for example, says and I quote: ""Sufficient and sustained efforts have not been made by the developed countries to build our confidence in the WTO."""
"Lesotho has said: ""What has the WTO market liberalisation brought to Lesotho?"""
"There are very many quotes that I hear from developing country delegations, all of which are saying that nothing much has happened."
"I will conclude with the Dominican Republic, which says: ""The WTO was supposed to have been an impartial referee of common rules where countries could learn to play the game."
"It has not turned out that way."
"The rules are biased against the weak and nothing has changed since Seattle."""
"The forthcoming summit is the crucial opportunity to address those issues, to change the rules, and to make world trade work for the poor."
"Mr President, since I only have one minute, I shall confine myself to a single issue and say that the strengthening of relations between the European Union and the United States should not only concern economic and commercial issues."
"I would therefore ask you and the European Union representatives attending Monday' s Summit to tackle political issues and, more specifically, the issue of the death penalty at the same level."
"It is impossible to remain silent about this State crime, especially when it is committed by the most powerful nation on earth which too often attempts to impose its own order and values on the rest of the planet."
"That particular value, at any event, is one that we do not want."
"It is impossible to accept that the only solution to crime and violence is further crime and violence."
"It is therefore necessary to take action to prevent the irreversible fate that awaits those women and men who, like Mumia Abu-Jamal or Leonard Pelletier, have sometimes been on death row for years."
"Throughout the world, voices are being raised to demand a form of justice which is a genuine reflection of the values of human respect and of the basic rights and freedoms of the individual."
"On every continent, a petition demanding the abolition of the death penalty is being signed by hundreds of thousands of people."
"As Nicole Fontaine rightly reminded us this morning, preserving this most precious commodity called life means, in the end, obtaining a universal moratorium on the death penalty as a first step towards its abolition."
"I believe that advantage should be taken of the dialogue that exists between the European Union and the United States in order to finally achieve this objective."
"Mr President, I should like to take advantage of this debate on relations between Europe and the United States to make three observations and to make three recommendations on the basis of these."
"Firstly, we must not lose sight of the fact that Europe has been built in opposition to empires or, rather, between empires."
"The Soviet Union was a threatening empire and the United States of America was a protective empire, but one vis-√†-vis which we had every intention of affirming our identity."
"Secondly, even if the retreat of the Communist threat is a cause for rejoicing, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left us with a single superpower in the form of the United States of America."
"Now, it is a law of nature that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and there are symptoms of such corruption, for instance: a form of economic diplomacy which might be summed up in the words, 'what is ours is ours and what is yours is negotiable' , the claim of establishing a new world order, a pax Americana whose influence is far from that of always promoting peace, and the unacceptable development of unqualified interference in the internal affairs of other States."
"The conclusion must be drawn that the traditional friendship and real sympathy we have for the American people is to no avail here."
"The United States of America is our competitor."
"It has no problem defending its own interests."
"We ought, in turn, to defend ours."
"Three recommendations, therefore. We must question the usefulness of arrangements such as NATO which no longer fulfil their original objective of ensuring common security and which are compromising our freedom."
"We must defend our political autonomy and stop taking sides with the United States, whether it be in the UNO, with regard to Iraq or the Arab world in general, in Asia or in the Balkans, where our actions, Mr Patten, have had disastrous consequences, whatever you may say."
"Finally, we should have no problem defending our own economic interests, not only within the WTO but, above all, in areas which, from culture to agriculture, are coterminous with European civilisation and must not therefore be subject simply to the laws of the market or of international barter."
"That is what all Europeans should be saying if they are concerned to see the type of independent Europe which we have portrayed to our compatriots and for which, in reality, we are still waiting."
"Mr President, I shall be mercifully brief."
"Firstly, in response to Mr Elles, we should be delighted to provide, as a backdrop to the discussion on the communication we shall produce in the new year on the strengthening of the dialogue between Europe and the United States, an analysis of the progress that we have made so far since 1990."
"We should be delighted to incorporate in that analysis a review of the way that the various dialogues have been developing."
"That is a useful idea and we will certainly follow it up."
"Secondly, we will also pursue the very important point Mrs Mann made on mutual recognition agreements and we should take account of her wise observation that one must not get trade disputes out of proportion."
"I think I am right in saying that EU/US trade amounts to about EUR 1billion a day and the total worth of the sanctions applied by the United States against European goods represents about six hours' worth of trade."
"So, as the honourable Member said, we should not get these things out of proportion."
"I was interested by what Mrs Lucas said about world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that increasingly free trade works in the interests of the poor as well as the better off."
"I know that my colleague Commissioner Lamy will want to pursue his thoughts and the Commission's latest thoughts on how to revive the WTO round with the United States and also with this Parliament."
"I know he has a good and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees with an interest in these issues."
"I think Mrs Boudjenah, who spoke about the death penalty, was probably present in the Chamber a few weeks ago when we had an extremely interesting debate on the death penalty, which touched on the situation in the United States, among other countries."
"I believe I am right in recalling that there have been 81 executions in the United States this year."
"We have made, and will continue to make, individual and collective representations about the death penalty in the United States."
"I should like to assure the honourable Member of that."
"We take a very clear position on the death penalty around the world, and that relates to our friends in the United States as well as to others elsewhere who may not be quite so well-disposed."
"Mr Gollnisch and I perhaps look at the world through different spectacles."
"I am not greatly persuaded of the arguments about the devilish hegemonist in Washington."
"I do not agree with everything the United States does, but we in Europe have good cause to recall the contribution which the United States made during the second half of the last century to our freedom and prosperity."
"But the honourable Member is entirely right that there are issues like the environment, trade, landmines, extraterritoriality and legislation where we take a rather different position from the United States."
"We should take that position vigorously, without thinking that to do so will somehow undermine our relationship with our greatest friends and allies."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mr Gollnisch has requested the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I shall just take a moment, with your permission."
"I did not say at all, Mr Patten, that American hegemony was devilish. In fact, I said exactly the opposite."
"I said that it was in the natural order of things that absolute power corrupts absolutely."
"I am not therefore accusing the Americans as a people and as a great nation."
"However, I should like us to be more autonomous in our relations with them."
"Thank you very much, Mr Gollnisch."
"That concludes this item."
"VAT"
"Mr President, in this joint debate we are going to discuss three reports which relate to four Commission proposals, which means that I have an unusual number of roles to play."
"I am rapporteur for two of them, I am shadow rapporteur for Mrs Torres Marques' s report and I am tabling amendments to the report on aviation fuel, because I do not agree with some of the ideas which were approved in committee."
"The second peculiarity, as you will have the opportunity to discover, is that I am in an unusual position within my own group."
"My military career was neither long nor distinguished, but I did learn that the role of the artillery was to bombard the infantry, if possible, the enemy infantry."
"I fear that I am currently trapped in my group' s own crossfire."
"I will start by discussing the first of the reports, which relates to VAT on e-commerce."
"The proposal which the Commission has referred to Parliament has, in my opinion, a priority objective: to remedy the discriminatory situation currently suffered by European e-commerce companies in comparison to companies from third countries."
"E-commerce refers to the provision of services delivered by Internet and radio and TV services provided by subscription or 'pay per view' ."
"I am stressing this because some of the amendments intend to establish a zero rate of VAT for services which, in my opinion, are not of an essential or social nature."
"The Commission also has other secondary objectives, in accordance with the traditional thinking of ministries of finance: to achieve this objective - that of ending this discrimination - by simplifying the tax, making it considerably more effective in terms of the recovery and reduction of the administrative costs relating to the collection of taxes, to achieve the objectives of efficiency and fairness and to achieve, finally, the modernisation of the tax system."
"These objectives, the main one and the secondary ones, will be the touchstone by which the concrete proposals submitted by the Commission must be judged."
"However, Mr President, I said that the first of these criteria by which we must judge this proposal is the need to end the discrimination suffered by European companies in comparison with third countries."
"This discrimination comes about because Article 9 of the sixth directive establishes the presumption that the place where the service is provided is the address where the service provider is officially established."
"In other words, at the moment European companies are subject to VAT when they provide electronic services, whether that be inside or outside the Union."
"On the other hand, companies established outside the Union never pay VAT, whether they are providing services to European clients or to clients in other parts of the world, thereby harming our competitiveness in external markets."
"To sum up and to put it very simply, the services provided by European companies currently suffer a tax burden which is not suffered by third country companies who provide services within the Union."
"Therefore, current European legislation encourages European e-commerce companies to establish themselves outside the Community."
"Some of the arguments which we will hear in the course of this afternoon will say that burdening outside companies which provide services within the Union would put a brake on the growth of e-commerce, but precisely the opposite is true, since maintaining this state of affairs harms the growth of the European e-commerce industry."
"We all agree on this, both on this side and on the other side of the Atlantic."
"We are so much in agreement that, at the Ottawa Conference in 1998, three conclusions were reached which I consider to be important: firstly, national taxes on consumption must be applied to consumption which takes place within national territory."
"Secondly, the provision of digital products constitutes a provision of services rather than a delivery of goods."
"Thirdly, we must turn to simple formulae for recovering taxes and, specifically, the reversal of the taxable person."
"In accordance with this objective, and with this international legal framework agreed by everybody in Ottawa, the Commission proposes the amendment of the sixth directive to lay down that digital services should be established in the place where the receiver is established rather than the provider."
"Consequently, services provided by European companies to non-European companies would always be exempt from the tax, which would revive our international competitiveness."
"Secondly, services provided by European companies to European customers would be subject to tax, as is normal."
"And thirdly, services provided by non-European companies to European companies would also be subject to tax, which establishes equality of conditions, in other words, fair play, on an international level."
"The problem does not stem transactions between companies, but occurs when the receiver of the service is a private individual, and here the Commission is doing the only thing it can do: oblige non-EU companies to register in a country of the European Union so that from there, with a Community passport, it can provide services to the whole of the Union, while having to pay the same tax as the European companies."
"In my view, this solution resolves the problem of eliminating previous discrimination and achieves the objective of simplification."
"A company only has to register in one country of the Union."
"It does not have to register in fifteen, it does not have to understand fifteen different sets of legislation and does not have to struggle with fifteen administrations."
"However, it does not resolve the problem of fairness."
"We know that a solution such as this - establishment in one country with the opportunity to provide services to the whole of the Union - could lead to an avalanche towards those countries with the lowest taxes."
"The French Presidency therefore proposed that non-EU companies providing services in the Union should have to register in all fifteen countries, which contradicts the objective of simplification."
"What does the Commission propose?"
"The Commission proposes, respecting the objective of simplification, a single place of establishment, but that the tax recovered by the Treasury of that country should be redistributed amongst the other countries of the Union, in accordance with the relative consumption."
"That is exactly the formula which will enable the introduction of VAT at source, it is exactly the formula which we have decided for cross-border returns of VAT and it is exactly the formula Ecofin has approved, in accordance with the Feira conclusions, in the case of withholding taxes."
"Is this Commission communication complete?"
"It is not."
"There are certain problems which I have highlighted in the explanatory statement, such as ensuring that a company which can provide services from outside the Union is registered."
"How can we guarantee that there is no discrimination between similar products?"
"Digital service, the consultation of or access to a book or a magazine, would be taxed at the normal rate if this were done via the Internet, whereas it would be subject to a lower rate when it is supplied physically."
"How can we resolve the problems of identifying the client?"
"The responses contained in the Commission' s proposal seems to me to be adequate, and in any event, Mr President, these difficulties are clearly not exclusive to the taxation of digital services."
"VAT is a tax that was intended to cover the movement of goods and does not suit the provision of services, especially a phenomenon as new as Internet services."
"The second of the reports I am going to refer to deals with the problem of hydrocarbons, and the issue is very simple."
"The 1992 Directive established a mandatory exemption for fuels used in international aviation and, at the same time, established a review of the exemption in order to take account of environmental costs."
"The legal difficulties for this revision are found in the 1944 Chicago Convention, an international obligation, which exempts on-board fuel supplied to aircraft from tax, and the bilateral agreements."
"Faced with this situation, the Commission ordered a study, which is the one we are investigating here, on what can be done."
"The first conclusion is that little can be done until the international framework is modified."
"The second conclusion reached by the Commission is that it would be desirable to have a tax on national flights and on intra-Community flights, subject to modification of the bilateral agreements, which is something I do not agree with."
"Thirdly, and this I do agree with, the need - within the international framework of the ICAO - to make all the progress necessary to establish a tax which is world-wide, and therefore not discriminatory, on Community transport."
"Mr President, having abused your patience, I impatiently await the criticisms and comments of the other Members, both from my group and from others."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and Parliament have in recent years made great efforts to achieve harmonisation in the levying of VAT within the European Union."
"This is, in fact, an important tool in the building of the internal market and also a substantial source of revenue in the Community budget."
"Thus, in 1992, an agreement was reached, at the time considered a minimum harmonisation, by which the standard rate for VAT could not be less than 15% and the Member States would have the power to apply one or more reduced rates of not less than 5%, with, however, derogations provided for in this case."
"But this first stage should have lasted only until the end of 1996, when the definitive system was to come in."
"The proposals submitted in the meantime only led to the floor of the standard rate of VAT being fixed at 15% - although the Commission had also proposed a ceiling of 25%, which was not accepted - and to the system being extended until the end of 2000."
"Now that we have come to the end of this year, the Commission proposes we should follow two paths in this field: the first is dealt with in my colleague, Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil' s report on the coordination of VAT administrative systems; the second is dealt with in this report, and seeks to put off any decision on the subject of VAT rate harmonisation until 2006."
"While I agree with the proposals for coordinating the administrative systems for levying VAT, I do not agree, and neither does the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with the proposal to postpone the harmonisation process for five years."
"Has the Commission given up advancing this dossier for the whole length of its mandate?"
"Does the Commission not consider, as we do, that the existence of the euro as the forthcoming single currency in twelve European Union states will lead to price transparency that will show up the distortion introduced into the internal market by the existence of such disparities among the rates applied in the various countries of the Union?"
"Does this Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Frederik Bolkestein, consider this to be a case of tax competition that he wishes to maintain or even encourage through his report?"
"This is not our view, and we have therefore voted to bring this deadline forward to the end of 2003 so that, once the euro has been in practical usage for two years, new solutions can be put forward."
"Additionally, in keeping with the positions adopted in this Parliament, I propose that the references to the need for voting in the Council on this subject to be unanimous should be removed."
"If the Treaties continue to require this, so be it. But, as I see it, nothing forces the Commission and Parliament to lay down now that, at the end of 2005, the Council vote on this subject has to be unanimous."
"Such a proposal is not in line with the principles put forward either by the Commission or by Parliament for the IGC that has just finished."
"There is even less justification for deciding now that it must be so until the end of 2005, when we know that there will be another review of the Treaties in the meantime."
"Therefore, we also propose removing this requirement for unanimity."
"In conclusion, let us say that we do not like to see the Commission giving up completely on VAT harmonisation at the beginning of its mandate, and Parliament, understanding the need to extend the validity of the legislation in force, being left waiting for the Commission, in the middle of its mandate and with the euro already in circulation, to present us with a new, full and thorough proposal on this matter."
"Mr President, the first point the committee would like to make is that current arrangements disadvantage EU providers of these services: software, data processing, and computer services, web hosting, web design and information."
"We would like to add educational services to that."
"They disadvantage people inside the EU because they currently pay VAT for the supply of these services whereas those outside the European Union do not."
"This is why we believe that this directive needs to come into force with some urgency, particularly those of us who believe that there will be a rapid rise in e-commerce."
"The Industry Committee adopted a number of proposals by thirty-nine votes to three."
"We asked for registration in a single Member State."
"We called for the European Commission to monitor to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to report back to the Council and to Parliament."
"We asked them to report, in the meantime, on a number of aspects: ensuring equal treatment of companies, looking at the choice of location, harmonising of international regulations and the possibility of establishing a clearing system, as was suggested by the rapporteur."
"Another point we made, that was not made elsewhere, was that, as many may recall, Al Capone was gaoled not as a gangster but for tax evasion."
"We see an unfortunate boom in aspects of e-commerce, in the growth of pornography, paedophilia and race-hate material."
"The Industry Committee believes that registration for VAT will enable us to subject the companies concerned to the rigours of EU law on these matters."
"This in itself may make the directive worthwhile."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee I would like to address the same report as Mr Ford has addressed."
"On the face of it this proposal would seem to be about taxation of non-EU businesses, but, of course, what it should be about is how we encourage and nurture Europe's e-economy, which is a very fragile flower."
