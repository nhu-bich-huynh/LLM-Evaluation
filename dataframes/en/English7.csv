"How do you see the astonishing upheaval in the balance within the organisation that uses this kind of approach to the situation?"
"Finally, can you tell us what - if anything - the European Union is getting from the United States, as, according to statements by Mr Lamy, the negotiations undertaken with the Chinese have been based on what the Americans had already obtained, with increased benefit for the Europeans."
"Commissioner, the quality of Mr Lamy' s work is not, of course, the issue here but, in spite of my repeated requests to see a proper assessment of the WTO carried out, these negotiations are going ahead without such an assessment having been made."
"I must say that it looks like we would not be able to undertake any action that might give the impression that doubts exist as to the benefits of liberalising world trade."
"I regret the fact that there was such little consultation with the Union' s Member States and the European Parliament which are, in the main, supporters not of the fine cause that is the World Trade Organisation, of which we too are part, but of that of the frantic development of global free-trade, to the detriment of our people' s essential interests."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Commissioner Lamy on securing such improved terms and a deal with China."
"After such a long history of negotiations clearly all that was needed was the question from our committee to push the matter to a conclusion."
"Recently I was visiting Taiwan where people clearly hope that the accession of China to the WTO will lead to improved cross-strait relations, and we must welcome that."
"I would have referred to Commissioner Patten knowing well the difficulties of dealing and negotiating with China, but he has already mentioned that."
"The prospect of a change in the duty on spirits from 65% to 10% will be a most welcome one in certain parts of the whisky-producing areas of the UK."
"I look forward to sharing that news with them in liberal and liquid fashion."
"On a larger scale the position achieved in access to, and faster opening up of, the telecoms market is also good news."
"China has such huge potential in this market for growth, and European operators have a great opportunity as world leaders looking for new markets."
"I welcome this step in the further integration of China into the world economy but we must recall the emphasis that we, in the European Union, place upon other values in addition to trade."
"In that context I would like to call, on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues, for European Parliament participation in the half-yearly dialogue on human rights."
"If this Parliament were part of that dialogue we might exert additional pressure for improvement in that field."
"I hope the Commissioner will listen carefully to that suggestion."
"Mr President, while international big business is busy popping champagne corks in celebration of the agreement on China's proposed accession to the WTO, China's small-scale farmers are already quaking in their shoes."
"They know that accession to the WTO will be a very mixed blessing for China and that for them, as small farmers, it could spell ruin."
"So I beg to differ with Commissioner Patten."
"There are many people in China for whom this agreement does not spell good news."
"Powerful international agri-business knows that too."
"That is why US grain companies like Cargill cannot believe their luck."
"They have just been handed the biggest market in the world and can expect US farm exports to increase by USD 2 billion over the next five years as Chinese tariff cuts begin to take effect."
"No wonder they are already gloating over bigger, better and more consistent markets."
"But while Cargill is so delighted that its profits will rise while Chinese self-sufficiency in agricultural goods falls, the picture is a good deal less optimistic for the people of China themselves."
"It has been estimated that increased competition from cheap agricultural imports could mean that about 400 million rural Chinese will no longer be needed on farms by 2005."
"It is almost impossible to conceive of such a huge figure or to think about the social dislocation and misery that will cause."
"The Commission is offering technical support to the Chinese in order to help them with the enormous economic restructuring which accession to the WTO will bring."
"What I would like to see is an equal concern to help with the almost inconceivable social restructuring which will inevitably follow in its wake with - I repeat - 400 million rural farmers out of a job."
"Mr Lamy has been quoted as saying that the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China yielded 96% of what the EU was demanding."
"Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations?"
"Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, the volume of world trade has soared in recent decades."
"Despite the giant leaps forward, many problems remain unresolved and questions left open with regard to world trade."
"One of the biggest and politically most difficult of these has been China' s accession to the WTO, and this same problem will again be associated with the implementation of the agreement in practice."
"As this is a matter of the world' s second largest economy and eleventh largest exporting country joining the most important institutional system for world trade, the importance of the issue cannot be emphasised too heavily."
"I agree with Mr Clegg as regards the impression one gets that the Commission and the Council have perhaps been rather too keen in this matter to refer to the Treaty of Amsterdam and hide behind formal requirements."
"I am, however, very satisfied that the Commission is in agreement with us that talks with China concerning its membership of the WTO are a matter that Parliament cannot pass over and that we will have this issue heard in this Chamber."
"The fact that the talks on accession will not lead to changing the legal framework does not lessen the importance of the issue."
"For that reason, an informal dialogue free from the exact wording of the basic agreement, which the Commissioner mentioned in his speech, is more crucial than ever before."
"It is in the interests of the European Union as a whole to support China in the reform of its economy, administration and legal system."
"It is sensible to implement the technical assistance package from the EU and the United States in a context of collaboration; this is necessary to guarantee the speedy and single-minded implementation of the reforms."
"Of the reforms in the public sector, that concerning state-owned companies is vital for continued economic growth in China."
"In this connection I will make my sole comment regarding content: the percentage of ownership by foreign companies was not fixed at the level the EU was aiming at."
"That was a very bad mistake."
"Another important political question is how the economic life of the country is to be reformed, as that is closely linked with the fate of China' s socialist system as a whole."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, on a point of order, when I inquired this morning about the time of this debate I was told it would start shortly after 3 o'clock."
"When I came for this debate at 3 o'clock I was told it would be taking place later, towards 5 o'clock."
"Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today."
"I wish to put forward a proposal that might relieve pressure on the end of today's agenda, namely, the debate previewed for the late payments directive - the report of the conciliation procedure with the Council."
"This is an issue which is now entirely without contention."
"Everybody supports this matter."
"The rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and the chairman of the committee would all support a suggestion that this be turned into a vote without debate."
"That would end pressure on the agenda right at the end of this evening."
"Possibly we could have a vote on it now."
"Mr Chichester, I do not feel in a position to make a decision, not even with recourse to the Rules of Procedure or the advice of officials."
"I am only going to chair an hour and a half of Questions to the Council and then, when the sitting begins, the person holding the Presidency - who will be informed of your intelligent proposal - will make the relevant decision."
"But we take very good note of this proposal."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0487/2000). We will examine questions to the Council."
"Question No 1 by (H-0434/00):"
"Subject: Increase in Community budgetary resources Much time has been devoted so far at the Intergovernmental Conference to issues such as the need to revise the decision-taking procedure in the Council of Ministers and the number of Commissioners."
"How does the Council view the prospect of a substantive increase in Community budgetary resources, what could be the 'ceiling' of such an increase and how realistic is such an objective under present conditions?"
"Mr President, the size of the Community budget is a general issue which has been addressed periodically, particularly within the wider debate on the future financing of the European Union prior to the negotiations on the EU financial frameworks."
"However, the current context is not favourable to increasing the budget, as was demonstrated in the Agenda 2000 negotiations, and this is not the right moment to reopen this debate."
"Within the Interinstitutional Agreement reached on 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improving the budgetary procedure, of which the financial perspectives are an integral part, you will remember that amounts were established which represent an annual maximum limit on expenditure for the European Parliament, Council and Commission. These three institutions undertook to respect these limits."
"The Council currently considers that there is no need to revise the financial perspectives."
"With regard to expenditure arising from enlargement, the aforementioned Agreement specifies that, in the event of enlargement of the EU to include new Member States during the period covered by the financial perspectives, the European Parliament and the Council, deliberating on a Commission proposal, will jointly adopt financial perspectives taking into account the need for expenditure arising from this enlargement."
"However, this alteration of the financial perspectives must respect the maximum limits contained in the guidelines on the financial perspectives for an enlarged Union with 21 Member States, as indicated in Annex II to the Interinstitutional Agreement. This clearly depends on the results of the accession negotiations."
"I should like to thank the Minister for answering the question which I tabled, but I think that he has not answered the specific issue which I raised, which is this: in the year in which I have been an MEP, I have noticed that, although the number of EU programmes and initiatives is multiplying continuously, implying new, additional spending, no additional resources are being budgeted for them."
"On the contrary, resources budgeted for other commitments are usually cut back; this happened, for example, in order to find money for Kosovo and for developing the Balkans, for the earthquakes and for other issues which have arisen."
"I just wonder why we are not making an effort to take payment appropriations up to the legal ceiling of 1.27% of the GDP of the European Union, so that other programmes do not have to be sacrificed, and why the European Union is taking on more and more and, at the same time, limiting payments of approved appropriations, which account for a mere 1.10% of GDP."
"Also, can the Council reassure the people in the poor countries of the European Union that enlargement will not result in budgetary cutbacks..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I understand the Member' s concern and realise that this is shared by several sectors in the EU."
"The truth is that the changes which have been made to the funding allocation plan, particularly in the last year, have not affected the Union' s compliance with its undertakings in these areas. These changes have also been made based on appropriations that remain unspent in certain areas."
"However, if the situation worsens to the extent that some of the commitments made by the European Union cannot be kept in accordance with the financial perspectives, then this mid-term revision may clearly occur, as specified in the financial perspectives and for the first time by qualified majority voting."
"In this way, some of the expenditure arising from enlargement, if this takes place in the meantime, may be covered."
"However, given that we are currently in the first year of implementing the financial perspectives, there is no reason at the moment to justify any reassessment of the commitment made in Berlin."
"The Committee on Budgets and the European Parliament agreed in the end in Agenda 2000 to reduce the 1.27% proportion of GDP by 2006."
"The citizens of Europe want a thrifty administration and the purpose of the concept of real stabilisation is to achieve a further net improvement in the quality of the work of the Council and the Commission."
"It should enable us to work even more efficiently in the future in the European Union."
"Do you believe that the concept of real stabilisation can be continued after 2006?"
"I am very happy to answer the honourable Member' s question."
"I was involved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and I clearly recall the concept of real stabilisation which was proposed. In practice this meant reducing the amounts established."
"In our opinion the European Union will sooner or later have to make a choice. It must opt either for a structure with a solid set of policies and a corresponding budget at the same level or simply for a kind of savings fund."
"If we were to regard the Community budget as a kind of savings fund and were to act increasingly through subsidiarity in terms of financing, the future of the EU' s policies would very probably be in doubt, particularly from 2006."
"This is my personal view."
"As the author is not present, Question No 2 lapses."
"Question No 3 by (H-0446/00):"
"Subject: Plans for a common position of the EU at the Ospar Convention What plans are being negotiated in the Troika for the presentation of a common position by the EU at the meeting being held this month in Copenhagen of the OSPAR Convention on the control of radioactive and toxic pollutants in the marine environment?"
"Mr President, negotiations within the OSPAR commission on issues coming under the Community competence are conducted, as you know, by the Commission in consultation with a committee of representatives of the Member States."
"If, at the end of these negotiations, the parties to the OSPAR Convention were to adopt a decision which, in the Commission' s opinion, should be incorporated within Community law, the Commission would be responsible for preparing a proposal for a decision by the Council on the adoption by the Community of this OSPAR decision."
"The Council would analyse this proposal with due care."
"The position mentioned by the Member has not been presented to date to the Council and we cannot, therefore, comment on this matter."
"I know that the Portuguese presidency is very familiar with this issue. As you know, the OSPAR commission met in Sintra two years ago and some progress was made on pollution of the marine environment."
"My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions."
"I know France is part of the troika and will be taking up the presidency in July."
"France pushed quite hard and was part of the agreement on lowering radioactive emissions, but a recent Greenpeace study shows that there are quite strong emissions of radioactivity from Cap La Hague."
"Is the Council aware of this study?"
"Would it like more information about this study?"
"Will it bring it to the attention of the French presidency?"
"On the one hand they claim to be controlling radioactive pollution to the marine environment, but on the other hand we have proof that there is radioactive pollution, so there is some contradiction there."
"The Council needs to get its act together."
"I take the point about the Commission's proposals and I look forward to discussing this further with the Commission when we have a result from Copenhagen."
"Neither Ireland nor Denmark have so far sent the Council any proposals on radioactive waste."
"Given that the Council as such is not a member of the OSPAR commission, only the European Commission can adopt a legislative measure in this respect."
"Therefore, any information which may be received in this respect by the Council will be welcome."
"Question No 4 by (H-0449/00):"
"Subject: Indication of religion on identity cards The independent data protection authority in Greece has raised the issue of the religion of Greek citizens being recorded on their identity cards, saying it affects people' s private lives and can lead to discrimination against certain individuals."
"In view of Article 13 of the Treaty, can the Council say whether both the compulsory indication of religion currently applicable and the possible removal of this obligation, to be replaced by a voluntary indication, are compatible with the legal and political 'acquis' of the European Union?"
"In which Member States is religion one of the items recorded on citizens' identity cards?"
"Mr President, the Council has never been asked to discuss the issue raised by the honourable Member."
"In principle this does not come under the Community competence but is the exclusive competence of the national authorities and in particular, as stated by the Member in his own question, of the Greek High Authority for Data Protection."
"As I said, no proposal has been presented to the Council on this issue."
"If the conduct of the Greek authorities led to any infringement of Community legislation, the Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, would clearly not hesitate to take the necessary steps to bring any action before the Court of Justice in respect of this infringement."
"However, this does not come under the Council' s competence but is rather the responsibility of the Commission. It is up to the latter to determine whether or not the reference to religion on Greek identity cards complies with the principle of non-discrimination on religious grounds."
"However, from a preliminary analysis of this issue, we feel that the mere reference to religion does not in essence constitute any violation of the legal and political acquis of the European Union, if this reference is only for information or even statistical purposes and if it is not accompanied by any specific measures discriminating against those practising a particular religion."
"In any case we are talking about actions by free and democratic countries. In order to challenge a measure of this type, a specific legal framework for complaints exists at national level."
"Clearly, the Community bodies can be appealed to following action before these national bodies."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"Yesterday I tabled the same question to the European Commission."
"I received its reply today."
"However, there is some confusion in the matter which, as far as Greece is concerned, is an extremely important matter."
"I thank the President-in-Office, although I noticed that he contradicted himself in his reply."
"On the one hand he says that it is not a Community matter, it is a matter for the Member State."
"On the other hand, however, he raises the question of compliance with the law."
"The President-in-Office obviously has in mind the reply which the Commission gave on precisely this issue, which says that a reference to religion infringes Directive 46/95 on personal data."
"Does the President-in-Office agree with this reply, if that is what he has in mind?"
"Or does he not have it in mind, which would demonstrate a huge lack of coordination between the Council and the Commission on a very important issue?"
"Mr Alavanos, there is no contradiction in this respect and the problem is very simple."
"As this issue is not covered by a Community provision, it is solely a question of Greek national policy and is subject to Greek law."
"Clearly, this situation will only change if a Community provision is transposed into Greek law and therefore itself becomes a Greek law."
"The problem lies in determining whether or not, at this stage of the process, this reference constitutes an infringement of Community law."
"Only the Commission would have the authority to act in this respect."
"As it has not acted so far, this means that this is not currently a Community issue."
"Therefore, at this stage, this issue does not have a Community dimension."
"If this situation changes, the Commission will then be able to take the appropriate decisions, particularly in conjunction with the Court of Justice."
"Mr President, I must intervene, although I had no intention of doing so, because Greece is labouring under the misapprehension that, if they are to become Europeans, Greeks must stop stating their religion on their identity cards, as they have done for the past seventy years."
"The President-in-Office' s reply is correct."
"There are no plans to intervene, it is a matter for national law and that is what Greece has been practising up to now."
"The principle introduced for personal data resulted in a decision whereby the reference to a person' s religion was an infringement of personal data."
"However, I know for a fact that the Community directive on this issue states that, if the person in question agrees to a reference to their religion, then it is not prohibited to include such personal data."
"And that is precisely what our party and the Greek church want: a voluntary reference."
"Whoever wants to, can state their religion, and whoever does not want to, need not do so."
"I would like to remind you that this Question Time is for questions to the Council."
"It can in no way be used to explain the positions of governments or the sensibilities of certain countries."
"Question No 5 by (H-0450/00):"
"Subject: Turkey disputes the sovereign rights of Greek islands in the Aegean Prompted by the NATO exercise 'Dynamic Mix' , Turkey has put the spotlight back on its long-standing dispute concerning the established regime of Greek sovereignty over islets and island rocks in the Aegean."
"In addition, it has made accusations concerning development and environmental activities by Greece in the areas in question, many of which are funded by relevant European Union programmes."
"To be specific, in its representations to the Greek Government on Wednesday, 10 May 2000 Turkey referred to 'military and other activities by Greece on geographical formations of disputed sovereignty in the Aegean' ."
"Could the Council say whether it agrees with this challenge by Turkey to Greece' s sovereign rights and whether this position accords with the spirit of the agreement which was achieved, following Greek concessions, at Helsinki, and also with Turkey' s current status as an applicant country?"
"Mr President, the Council does not have any information, rumours aside, on any representations made by Turkey to the Greek Government on 10 May 2000."
"As the honourable Member mentioned, the Helsinki European Council recognised Turkey as an applicant country."
"At this same European Council, the applicant countries were also urged to make every effort to resolve all existing border disputes and other similar issues."
"Unresolved disputes must be brought before the International Court of Justice within a reasonable period of time or at the latest by 2004."
"The Council will then re-examine the situation."
"With regard to relations between Greece and Turkey, which form the basis of this whole issue, the Council can only welcome an improvement in these relations. It is hoped that this positive process will continue so that the issues relating to the Aegean are successfully resolved in accordance with international law."
"It should be recalled in this respect, as this is also extremely positive, that Turkish troops participated in the NATO exercise which took place in part on Greek territory."
"Turkish troops have never before participated in exercises on Greek territory."
"The Council notes that the Greek Defence Minister described the cooperation between Greece and the Turkish armed forces as excellent and added that the exercises were carried out with full respect for all the sovereign rights of Greece."
"I must also note that, in terms of bilateral relations, the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey, while at the NATO Summit in Florence, presented a proposal to include a range of good-neighbourly measures on the agenda for negotiations between Greece and Turkey. The aim of these measures will be to consolidate the climate of security and harmonisation between these two countries."
"We must all cooperate, in all bodies and in all areas in which these issues are raised, to ensure that tensions are not heightened in any way and to eliminate the ghosts of the past in this respect."
"Minister, I too am personally in favour of closer relations between Greece and Turkey, but subject to certain specific conditions."
"And I must say in this respect that I am truly surprised by what you said at the beginning, to the effect that the Greek government has not even informed the Council of Turkey' s challenge of Greece' s sovereign rights."
"Obviously it sees it as an unnecessary luxury."
"It feels that Turkey can proceed unimpeded on its path towards the European Union, violating Greek sovereignty all the while."
"But that is a matter for the Greek government."
"I should like to ask you, the diplomatic language of your reply notwithstanding, whether or not you consider that Turkey should make moves in order to meet the requirements of the Helsinki resolutions and what you think these moves might be."
"Mr Hatzidakis, in my opinion Helsinki represented a moment of great balance in terms of the concerns of those involved, namely Greece, Turkey and also Cyprus as a third party."
"The decision taken to recognise Turkey as an applicant country was made in view of this overall balance."
"However, certain conditions were indicated in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, particularly with reference to the resolution under international law of the conflicts involving the Aegean."
"A timetable was also set for this which is indissociably linked to Turkey' s ambitions for its accession to the European Union."
"We must all bear in mind that we should be trying, in this specific area, not to aggravate the bilateral tensions which may arise here or there, where these clearly do not involve fundamental principles of identity and the basic interests of the country. We must realise instead that it is essential to reduce these tensions."
"At the moment signs are apparent on both the Greek and Turkish sides, with effects evident also on the Cypriot side. We should allow these countries some time before we start systematically highlighting the small incidents which may ultimately stop us from seeing the bigger picture which, after all, is much more important than these small incidents."
"It would be politically more responsible at this time to try and reduce the tensions. We must therefore particularly support the efforts which the authorities of the two countries have been making, especially through their respective Foreign Ministers, in order to prevent certain incidents from being exploited, for the sake of the overall situation which is itself of considerable significance and whose resolution may be vital to ensure the balance of the geographical area concerned."
"Mr President-in-Office, I should like to be a little more specific."
"For Greece, as far as Turkey is concerned, there is only one issue which needs to be settled and that is the boundaries of the continental shelf in the Aegean."
"Turkey has disputed a number of issues in the Aegean at one time or another."
"And one of these issues is the status of the grey zones or island rocks in the Aegean."
"My question is quite specific."
"Do you consider, given the spirit of the Helsinki resolutions, which call on Turkey to settle its border and similar disputes with its neighbours by 2004, that the status of the island rocks or grey zones in the Aegean counts as a border dispute?"
"What is the Council' s opinion; is this what it is calling on Turkey to do?"
"To settle as a border dispute the status of the Aegean, where Greece does not acknowledge that there is an issue?"
"Mr Theonas, these issues are part of the dispute between Greece and Turkey. So far these two countries have adopted a totally antagonistic attitude towards these issues, as there are points which Turkey wants to discuss under international law but which Greece considers do not fall within this context."
"Conversations and negotiations are now occurring in this respect and bilateral contacts are being made, accompanied by confidence-building measures."
"We should allow some time for this process to develop before becoming involved in any potential conflicts."
"We know that these differences of opinion exist and that up to now these have formed the essence of what seems to be a conflict about the Aegean which could basically, under international law, be viewed in linear terms."
"We know that this is not the case and that we all have different ideas about the same subject. This is also true of Greece and Turkey but there is now a negotiating framework for this."
"We must bide our time and ensure that this negotiating framework can operate, particularly bearing in mind the currently positive Greek-Turkish relations."
"Question No 6 by (H-0451/00):"
"Subject: Political intervention in Georgia's problems Georgia, the newly independent state, is encountering serious difficulties in consolidating democracy and raising its citizens' standards of living."
"Its attempts are being hindered by the problem of the breakaway of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and the wave of refugees mainly taken in by Abkhazia."
"In its resolutions, Parliament has condemned this situation and has asked the Commission and the Council to support the Council of Europe' s initiative to set up confidence-building measures in the area."
"Does the Council have any strategy for this sensitive region?"
"Does it intend to operate a policy designed to safeguard peace and security in the region?"
"Mr President, the Council is clearly concerned about the internal conflicts in Georgia which still need to be resolved. It is also concerned about the difficulties which are being experienced in terms of consolidating democracy and improving the standard of living of the people of that country."
"We are therefore giving political and economic support within the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 July 1999."
"During the EU Summit with the three Heads of State and Government of the Caucasus in June of last year, an important declaration was approved which sets out the bases for relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus."
"This same resolution indicated the importance of developing regional cooperation, establishing friendly relations between the countries and sustainably developing their economies."
"Moreover, the European Union indicated that it was ready to use its support instruments in order to create a suitable environment for resolving conflicts in the Caucasus. In this respect, the Cooperation Council between the European Union and Georgia, which was held on 12 October, decided that the cooperation in 2000 should particularly revolve around intensified efforts to find a solution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"I must remind you that the European Union is the largest donor of aid to rehabilitation projects in South Ossetia and is ready to support measures aimed at creating a climate of confidence, particularly by rebuilding the north-south infrastructures which connect Russia to Georgia."
"Moreover, the EU has also been giving assistance to almost 300 000 displaced persons within Georgia who were forced to abandon their homes due to the conflict."
"The EU is encouraging the resolution of this conflict so that these people can return to their homes as quickly as possible and is ready to offer additional assistance in this event."
"The Council supports all the efforts made by the competent international bodies, particularly the OSCE in South Ossetia and the UN in Abkhazia, with the aim of contributing to acceptable solutions which can return the political and economic relations to normal and ensure the return of the refugees under safe conditions."
"The war in neighbouring Chechnya represents an additional threat to Georgia."
"The Council fears that this conflict may spread to Georgia and welcomes the extension of the OSCE' s monitoring mission along the respective borders."
"At the request of President Shevardnadze, the European Union is now studying possible ways of helping to reinforce and ensure the efficacy of this monitoring mission."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for the information which you have given me."
"It became clear during my recent visit to Georgia and from what was said by representatives of the Georgian Church during the recent meeting between the Patriarchate and the European People' s Party that, in the eyes of the people of Georgia, European policy is ineffectual because, apart from humanitarian aid, it has not helped to solve any of the problems."
"The problem of refugees, which include many Georgian citizens of Greek descent, has not been solved."
"And I should like to ask you what additional measures you feel need to be taken and extended, as you have just said?"
"And one more question: do you believe that the conflict to which you referred is part of Russian policy in this region?"
"Also, has the Council taken account of this possibility in its policy in the region?"
"Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, with regard to the measures which the European Union can adopt in this area, I can only point to the plan mentioned and the set of initiatives which the EU has introduced on the ground."
"You should remember that we have a limited capacity for intervention in certain areas and that, as was said today in other respects, the difficulties in the EU' s external action framework and the financing of this framework limit the EU' s capacity to be present in all conflict situations."
"However, given the strategic importance of the area, the European Union has been doing whatever it considers possible in this respect."
"I agree that other measures may be possible but there is not currently a framework of financing which would allow us to go further, particularly in terms of acting to reinforce the infrastructures."
"As for the situation in Russia, regardless of political opinion and what may be underlying the Russian position, there are currently no practical signs which point to an objective intention by Russia to destabilise these countries."
"Effects are being felt, as I said, from the war in Chechnya and are likely to be felt in the future by neighbouring countries but I cannot infer from this that there is necessarily an intention on the part of the Russian authorities to spread any kind of instability in neighbouring areas."
"Question No 7 by (H-0454/00):"
"Subject: Human rights: Egypt Further to the European Parliament resolution of 20 January 2000 on the violence in Upper Egypt, what steps has the Council taken to ensure that the Coptic Christian community in Egypt is fairly and justly treated and, specifically following recent events, that those arrested at El-Kosheh were offered a fair trial and, indeed, that the arrests were made with no element of religious discrimination?"
"The Council has on several occasions discussed the fundamentalist violence and assassinations carried out against the Coptic community in Upper Egypt. We are continuing to closely monitor this situation."
"In the meantime a series of positive events has occurred, in particular the release of the secretary-general of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights and the implementation of the law on non-governmental organisations which it is hoped may bring about greater freedom of expression."
"At every opportunity and at various levels, the European Union has reminded Egypt of its concern about the human rights situation and about the need for Egypt to respect fundamental freedoms, particularly given its status as a member of the EU-Mediterranean partnership."
"The negotiations on the Association Agreement with Egypt were concluded last year and it is envisaged that this will shortly be signed."
"Once in force, this Agreement will turn the political dialogue between the European Union and Egypt into an institutional matter, especially in the area of human rights, which will naturally enable greater intervention and more scope for political pressure in respect of anything which may be regarded as non-compliance by Egypt with its obligations under this Agreement."
"Article 2 of the draft Agreement specifies that the relations between the parties, like the provisions of the Agreement, are based on respect for democratic principles and the fundamental human rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will naturally form the backdrop to the bilateral relations and political dialogue which are integral to this Agreement."
"In this context, we will of course continue to remind Egypt, as we have done prior to the establishment of this legally binding framework, of its responsibilities and, in particular, of the need to respect human rights and to preserve fundamental freedoms."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I would say this question was prompted by the very large number of letters I receive from constituents about this particular issue."
"It is perhaps the issue I have received more letters about in the last year than any other."
"It strikes me from what he said that it is very strange that after several of the Coptic Christians had been attacked and disturbed by the others, that it was only Coptic Christians who were arrested."
"The President-in-Office said in his reply that the Council will remind the Egyptians of their responsibilities and wait until they have signed the association agreement and can bring an institutionalised political dialogue to bear."
"But why does he not use the signing of this agreement as a basis on which to force the Egyptians to come to a more equable, reasonable and non-discriminatory approach to their Coptic Christian citizens?"
"Mr Purvis, as I have already said, we have not waited for the signing of the Agreement to indicate to the Egyptian authorities, when appropriate, our disapproval of any kind of conduct which does not respect fundamental rights."
"This issue has been addressed in the bilateral political dialogue and has naturally been raised within the normal framework of relations between the European Union and third countries."
"In this particular case we believe that the Agreement has its own negotiating context and it would not be right, after the Agreement has been approved by the European Union and agreed by the Council, to make its final signing dependent on the resolution of an issue, however important this may be, which is only one part of the whole picture."
"On this particular issue and regardless of whether we strictly agree with your reading of the situation that the Coptic community is being subjected to specific measures, our information indicates that, even if the Coptic Christians are being affected the most by these repressive measures, this does not point to an attitude of particular retaliation against the Coptic community."
"There is an ongoing conflict between traders and certain local communities which has affected the Coptic community but which does not necessarily indicate a specific intention by the Egyptian authorities on this issue."
"However, the European Union will continue to carefully monitor this problem and will certainly raise this issue with the Egyptian authorities regardless of whether the Agreement has been signed."
"Mr President, I was in Egypt at exactly the time when these events took place."
"I saw that the situation was serious, but that, as you said, the Egyptian authorities were making a huge effort."
"Nonetheless, I should like to ask whether we perhaps need systematic monitoring of the situation of minorities throughout the Mediterranean, i.e. for the Barcelona process, especially the situation of the Christian minorities living in the Mediterranean, some of whom are in a far worse situation in other countries than in Egypt."
"I can only agree with the honourable Member when he says that there are situations in other countries in the southern Mediterranean which seem more serious than this issue."
"It is practically impossible for the European Union to constantly monitor all situations in all the countries with which we have a relationship within the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"Within the Common Foreign and Security Policy and particularly bearing in mind the assessment being made, especially in the framework of our political dialogue within the association agreements, we continue trying to highlight our concern about the gravity of various situations. We cannot expect the European Union to operate as a kind of international human rights monitor."
"There are other specific institutions to do this work. However, we will ensure that the due consequences are felt in our bilateral political relations with regard to any negative development in these respects."
"I also agree that there are much worse situations in other countries within the Barcelona process, some of which perhaps do not occur to us when we are speaking, which must also be duly assessed."
"However, the European Union cannot be expected to do the work of the international institutions in this area."
"Question No 8 by (H-0457/00):"
"Subject: Significance of Euro-11 Will the Council say on what issues Euro-11 has, since coming into existence, taken decisions that have been of political significance to the European Union and its Member States?"
"Mr President, Euro 11 must be one of the biggest mysteries within the Community institutions because this question comes up on a regular basis."
"The third phase of economic and monetary union saw the beginning of informal meetings of the Euro Council or Euro 11 as it also known. This brings together the finance ministers of the countries in the euro zone."
"These meetings are held monthly and before the formal meetings of Ecofin which involve all fifteen Member States."
"Euro 11 meetings essentially address issues relating to the specific responsibilities which the eleven countries share in matters involving the single currency."
"Whenever the issues go beyond this scope, the meetings are extended to all the Member States as is laid down."
"In all cases where decisions must be taken, Ecofin takes these in accordance with the procedures established in the Treaty."
"This was the guidance given by the Luxembourg European Council of 12 and 13 December 1997."
"Any other mystery for which the operation of Euro 11 may be criticised can only stem from a failure to understand this reality and the information which is actually in the public domain. The issues discussed by Euro 11 and transferred subsequently to Ecofin, which is attended by all the other countries which have not adopted the euro, are widely known, even in the press."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Presidency for its answer to my question."
"The fact is that, in those countries which are to decide whether or not to join the common currency, such as Sweden and Denmark, there are discussions taking place about the significance of Euro-11."
"I think it is important that the Presidency should again state that Euro-11 has no formal right of decision-making whatsoever."
"The question, however, is that of whether any individual questions in the informal Euro-11 discussions can be pointed to which have subsequently led to formal decisions in ECOFIN."
"I wonder if the Council of Ministers can provide examples of any such concrete questions from the discussion in Euro-11 which have led to a new policy' s having been created."
"The honourable Member' s question raises an interesting point."
"As Euro 11 and the institutionalisation of the third phase of economic and monetary union require a form of closer cooperation which is pre-established in the Treaty, the question is whether an acquis will be created in Euro 11 which must be transposed to the full Union."
"There are currently no elements of policy coordination between the countries in Euro 11 which naturally affect or should affect their behaviour in Ecofin."
"However, it makes perfect sense that countries which are part of an effective policy model and which are involved in implementing policies involving, for example, the single currency framework can separately define and coordinate a position. However, this can only be ratified in Ecofin."
"This point is important for understanding that perhaps in the future, when different policy integration models exist, we will see more elements and more ways of working of this kind."
"This may be the future and we will see whether the Feira European Council integrates closer cooperation into the Intergovernmental Conference."
"If so, we will very probably see several models emerge."
"How can we avoid this?"
"For a country such as the honourable Member' s perhaps the problem will be solved by being part of the Euro Council."
"However, until this decision is taken by the authorities in his country, the Euro Council will consist exclusively of the eleven countries which have actually adopted the euro."
"I understand the answer of the President-in-Office of the Council in the following terms: that there are no instances of negotiations in the Euro 11 having, as it were, pre-empted the formal negotiations and decisions in the competent council, which is ECOFIN; that no acquis has been created; and that what takes place, rather, is an exchange of opinions on the problems encountered by the 11 countries which participate in the euro."
"I think I heard the President-in-Office of the Council say something along the lines that there were agendas for these informal meetings and that these agendas were to be publicly available."
"I have never seen any such agenda, and I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to state clearly to what extent agendas are available in advance of the meetings."
"The reason why both Swedish and Danish MEPs are raising these questions is that we have obtained the impression that the Euro 11 is an influential body. However, I understand from the answer of the President-in-Office of the Council that formal authority and the power to make decisions of a legal and political nature still lie with ECOFIN."
"We must be clear on this, Mr Krarup."
"Issues relating to the single currency are addressed jointly but solely by the eleven members of Euro 11."
"If Euro 11 wants to address any other type of issue which does not concern the single currency, this decision is shared with the other Member States which are not part of Euro 11."
"It is as simple as that."
"What cannot be avoided is that the coordination of the policies of the Euro 11 countries, particularly on the single currency, and the effect that these policies have on the overall context of the EU' s economic and financial policy do not appear to be linked to the EU' s own coordination."
"It is natural that there is prior coordination between these countries and it is natural that this coordination ends up having some influence on the final decision taken in Ecofin."
"This happens at contact group level and in the relations between various countries in various contexts."
"I know of several cases in which government sectors of EU countries meeting at Council level have talked separately and coordinated their positions so that these appear linked in the institutional contexts of the Union."
"You will say that this is not part of the normal procedure."
"That is true in that case but in the case of Euro 11 this is institutionalised in the Treaty and it is this which is specified."
"There should be no doubt on this."
"Mr President-in-Office, from what you have just said, is there therefore an understanding or an expectation in E-11 that after they have had an informal discussion about the euro in Euro-11, they will all vote the same way when they go to Ecofin, even if they disagreed originally?"
"Is there a procedural expectation that all eleven will vote the same way in the formal decision-making in Ecofin?"
"Mr Newton Dunn, all I can say is that the ministers are responsible for their own positions. Therefore, if at the Euro 11 meeting they have different opinions but the discussion leads them to a joint conclusion I do not see why this same position should not be taken in Ecofin."
"I do not see any disadvantage in the existence of various levels of coordination, particularly when these are institutionalised in the Treaty itself."
"Question No 9 by (H-0458/00):"
"Subject: Trying to discover, through clouds of secrecy, what the Council has decided In previous answers to me, the Portuguese Presidency has insisted that everything decided by the Council is open to the public."
"I have expressed continuing deep scepticism about the Council's claims."
"As a test case, will the Council inform me precisely where in the Council's published documents I could have discovered that Belgian fishermen had been persuaded to stop fishing in the Irish Sea by Britain's Fisheries Minister secretly giving them 190 tonnes of the British North Sea plaice quota and ten tonnes of the British sole quota in the English Channel?"
"I discovered this from a newspaper, but where could I have found it legitimately through the Council's officially allegedly open documentation?"
"The Member' s question begins by noting that the Portuguese Presidency has insisted that everything decided by the Council is open to the public. Yet this assertion by the Council causes the honourable Member some confusion."
"On the specific case mentioned, what is happening is as follows. The fact that Belgian fishermen will not be fishing in the Irish Sea does not stem from any Council decision as the regulation approved by Council provides for fishing quotas to be granted to Belgium in these waters."
"It actually stems from each Member State' s right to exchange with other Member States the fishing quotas allocated to them. In accordance with the basic regulation of the common fisheries policy, the Member States, having notified the Commission, may exchange all or part of their fishing quotas."
"The same article establishes that Member States shall annually inform the Commission of the criteria which they adopt internally for distributing their fishing quotas."
"Therefore, the quotas available to Member States are established and allocated by a Council decision, with each Member State being responsible for distributing these among the national fleet or, if appropriate, for exchanging part of these quotas with another Member State. In this case the latter only needs to inform the Commission to ensure the effective control and management of fish stocks."
"We therefore cannot find any Council document which refers to the exchange of notes between Belgium and the United Kingdom given that, under Community legislation, it is Member States which are responsible for deciding this by mutual agreement and given that this does not require approval by the Council."
"However, with regard to the overall distribution of quotas, the honourable Member must be aware that this is published in the Official Journal, in the minutes of the Council of Ministers' meetings and also in the annexed declarations."
"We do not feel that there has been any breakdown in the transparency for which the Council is responsible."
"Up in the gallery, listening to you and me, are visitors."
"Everything is open here in Parliament."
"They can hear what we are discussing and agree or disagree."
"But the Council of Ministers meets in secret."
"Maybe you can slide out of this example and say it is a Member State talking to the Commission and they send them a letter."
"Nevertheless these matters are done in secret."
"If we - you and I - want the public to understand and agree with the decisions we take, surely you agree with me that it must be done in public?"
"I do not agree, Mr Newton Dunn. No government in the world takes its management decisions in public."
"We can discuss the issue of whether or not legislative decisions should be taken in public."
"This is something which we have been discussing in the Intergovernmental Conference. However, we have not yet reached a definitive conclusion and until then the Council rules are what they are."
"I do not feel that this is a negative practice on the part of the Council as we are actually working in line with the provisions of the Treaty."
"Question No 10 by (H-0460/00):"
"Subject: Tibet and the World Bank Is the Council aware of the World Bank's 'China Western Poverty Project' proposal to move tens of thousands of non-Tibetan farmers into Amdo, thereby breaching international law concerning population transfers to occupied territories?"
"Is it also aware that this project has been condemned by the German and United States Governments but supported by the British Government?"
"Will the Council press the World Bank to abandon the scheme and the British Government to withdraw its support?"
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"The Council has not examined the issue raised in the Member' s question."
"The Member States are responsible for assessing the specific projects to be financed by the World Bank."
"With regard to projects for Tibet financed by the European Union through its cooperation programme, the EU' s position is that these projects must benefit native Tibetans."
"Can I say firstly that I was astonished by the Minister's response to my honourable friend on the subject of human rights in Egypt."
"If Europe does not stand for human rights then I do not know what it does stand for."
"I would like to test him, if I may, on Tibet because Tibet has now been illegally occupied by China for many years."
"Does the Minister agree that no matter how many years before Tibet regains its freedom, no European state should recognise the illegal actions by the Chinese Government in Tibet and that the transfer of tens of thousands of non-Tibetan people into Amdo is illegal under international law?"
"The World Bank has now recognised this and I understand is abandoning its so-called Western Poverty Project proposal."
"The British Government has not yet withdrawn its support and all I ask the President-in-Office to do is to remind all Member State governments on the Council - including Britain - that they must not endorse or be seen to endorse illegal acts and abuses of human rights and national rights against the people and the nation of Tibet."
"Mr Bowis, I note your concerns and we will certainly convey these to the Member States."
"However, I must say that the European Union has not ignored the issue of Tibet."
"For example, troikas of heads of mission have been sent on fact-finding missions to Tibet. This issue is also regularly raised in the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and China."
"The last round which took place in Lisbon on 25 February was preceded by a démarche with the Chinese authorities which included the problem of human rights in Tibet."
"The European Union is not hiding from the issue of human rights in Tibet. However, as the Member must be aware, the European Union has not in recent years taken a clear position on the basic issue."
"No definitive decision has been made within the European Union on tackling the basic issue and this is a point which must be raised openly."
"The European Union has a lot more than just the ability to send investigative parties, have discussions, make recommendations and so forth. In the case of Egypt, as has already been said, we have the European-Mediterranean programmes and association agreements."
"In the case of China we have very many major trading arrangements and, potentially, their accession to the WTO."
"Could we not use our power, our muscle, in order to achieve our human rights objectives and not just go on talking and talking without seeing any results?"
"I can only repeat what I said about the fact that, within the European Union, no official joint position has been adopted on the Tibet issue, regardless of the human rights issue."
"On this issue of human rights in particular, the reactions and attitudes of the EU must be proportional to the importance of the issue."
"Although this is certainly an important issue in terms of discussing China' s accession to the World Trade Organisation, for example, it cannot be used to block negotiations of this significance."
"We must find a measure which is appropriate for the reactions and the various situations."
"Question No 11 by (H-0462/00):"
"Subject: Effective action against death boats in the Straits of Gibraltar The policy on containing immigration and strengthening barriers along the Straits of Gibraltar is based on a seriously flawed approach and has attracted public criticism from the Andalusian government and the Ombudsman."
"Does the Council not believe that, if this project is to bear fruit, an agreement needs to be concluded with Morocco to combat the mafias operating in this area and introduce effective surveillance measures such as observation vessels, in order to prevent people from dying in the attempt to cross the Straits and ensure that the planned investments in the north of Morocco are in fact carried out?"
"The Member' s question refers to the Council' s actions, firstly with regard to the checks carried out by Member States at external sea borders and secondly the measures which may be taken in the country of origin in order to prevent illegal migration and combat the activities of traffickers."
"Measures to reinforce the effectiveness of the checks carried out by Member States at their external air and sea borders have been implemented, particularly within the Schengen area, and are now being integrated into the Community acquis following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Although these measures are carried out by Member States, the Council controls their actual application through its competent bodies."
"By way of example, based on a decision of the Schengen Executive Committee of 18 December 1998 on the coordinated use of consultants in respect of documents, measures are being introduced which are intended to combat illegal migration by air and sea in cooperation with various African countries."
"Moreover, a 1999 decision of the Schengen Executive Committee approved a mutual aid project for the exchange of officials to give assistance and advice in carrying out security and control tasks at external borders."
"In addition to the Schengen acquis, practical measures of the same type are also being taken on behalf of the European Union. These are generally based on the Community acquis and particularly on the common position of 25 October 1996 which established the assistance and information missions carried out away from the border."
"Such measures are coordinated within the competent bodies of the Council but do not for the time being cover any African countries."
"In terms of addressing the deep-rooted reasons for people wanting to escape and emigrate from certain African countries, we can refer to the action plan for Morocco approved in the Council in October 1999."
"This action plan is one of a set of five, each containing an exhaustive and coherent approach focused on the existing situation in a country of origin or transit of asylum-seekers which is regarded as being important."
"For each country selected, the action plan presents a balanced combination of options which the European Union offers in terms of foreign affairs, development and humanitarian and economic assistance."
"In the action plan for Morocco, which specifically covers the situation referred to by the honourable Member, this country is regarded as a country of origin and transit for economic migration to the European countries."
"The measures recommended in this action plan include using existing channels and improving information-gathering, distributing correct information on immigration, creating strategies for combating illegal trafficking and promoting measures intended to apply the readmission agreements."
"Also recommended is the promotion of direct foreign investment and vocational training, in which small companies are also involved, and assistance for the voluntary return and reintegration of Moroccans who live in EU countries."
"In signing the action plans established by the High Level Group, the Tampere European Council of 15 October 1999 recognised that the European Union still lacks an overall approach to the immigration phenomenon which covers the political, human rights and development issues in countries and regions of origin and transit. This is an important point."
"To achieve this objective, poverty must be combated and living conditions and employment opportunities must be improved, conflicts must be prevented and democratic states consolidated."
"This requires greater coherence in the internal and external policies of the Union which are the responsibility of both the EU and the Member States."
"Partnership with third countries also constitutes a key element in the success of this policy."
"The EU is aware that, in order to implement the action plan for Morocco, partnership and cooperation with the Moroccan authorities will be needed."
"In this context, in June of last year, a mission to Morocco took place before the action plan was finalised in order to establish a dialogue with the Moroccan authorities."
"Another mission of this type is now planned for the end of this month, specifically intended for holding discussions with the Moroccan intermediaries."
"As I have said, the EU' s policy covers development and humanitarian and economic assistance for Morocco."
"The consolidation of the action plan for Morocco is clearly a long-term strategy but it is through the dialogue now under way in this context and on the Association Council that progress will be made."
"I would like to believe from this long answer, which I did not fully understand, that the Council has a well-intentioned attitude to this very serious problem."
"Given such an inconsistent state of affairs as the European Union giving more resources and being more effective, for example, in the control of meshed drift nets, in the control of fishing, than in the field of the rafts used for illegal immigration, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if it would not in his judgement be appropriate for us to have a periodic assessment of the situation in the Straits of Gibraltar and a report on the tiny advances made in this area."
"I believe that you have been very explicit, that you have answered in many words, but these words disguise a low level of effectiveness."
"The European Union, together with Morocco, and employing control measures for ships in the Straits, would thereby prevent these losses of human lives which now number more than a thousand, and which are our responsibility."
"The Monitoring Centre for immigration is nothing more than a story in the press."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are you not in favour of a periodic assessment?"
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, firstly I must say that I agree with you."
"This is indeed a very serious situation involving regular and even daily human tragedy which must be addressed."
"The Spanish authorities have been in contact on this issue with the Moroccan authorities and the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, had a meeting just recently with his Moroccan counterpart about this problem."
"Development measures are being introduced in the northern area of Morocco, which are starting to improve this situation and the economic conditions that have led to these migratory flows."
"As for the possibility of us periodically carrying out a quantitative assessment of these incidents, I believe that the Spanish authorities may be able to provide the necessary information in this respect."
"This information is in fact widely available within Spain as it is distributed by the Spanish authorities."
"What I want to try and explain to you - and this is why my original explanation was so long - is that the measures taken by the European Union in this respect or which are intended to have an effect in this respect are long-term measures which obviously cannot provide an immediate response to a given situation. They are measures which are intended to work at the root of this situation by creating the conditions to keep the Moroccan people in their own country."
"They are development measures which are within the spirit of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"I realise that your immediate reaction may be that the practical effect of this type of long-term measure is limited."
"I did say that these measures would involve many small steps."
"We must all realise that the European Union has a set of policies which it aims to implement and that these policies involve strategic choices."
"These choices cannot be systematically prejudiced by overly general actions leading to worse humanitarian effects than may have occurred anyway."
"We must realise that, in their bilateral relations with Morocco, the Spanish authorities are currently responsible for solving part of the problem."
"The European Union is generally involved in a series of projects, in the context of its relations with the southern Mediterranean countries, which include projects for development, population settlement and guarantees of improved economic conditions."
"We cannot turn the European Union into a kind of technical instrument for the practical resolution of specific situations."
"Question No 12 by (H-0466/00):"
"Subject: Decision concerning deployment of EU military personnel The decision to strengthen EU emergency forces for crisis management has raised the question of the legal basis for the deployment of EU military personnel."
"According to the Swedish government's interpretation of the decision taken at Cologne in 1999, a relevant UN Security Council resolution has to have been adopted."
"Will the Council therefore state where and when a formal Council decision was taken to the effect that military personnel from the European Union may be deployed only after a UN Security Council resolution has been adopted?"
"The headline goal specifies a capacity of 50 000 to 60 000 personnel. This decision reaffirmed that the European Union' s crisis management actions will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the objectives of the OSCE' s Charter for European Security."
"The Helsinki declaration, which was approved by the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen, expressly states that the European Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security."
"The need to respect the principles of the UN Charter and the Charter for European Security is clearly recognised, so much so that the report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next Monday stresses the fact that, in the area of crisis management and conflict prevention, the European Union must establish close cooperation with the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"Yet a UN Security Council resolution is not needed to generally legitimise the EU' s action."
"However, the EU undertakes politically and at the highest level to respect the primary responsibility of the Security Council. Therefore, for a given operation, the Union undertakes to respect this responsibility and the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council on a case-by-case basis."
"However, you should note that some of the Petersberg tasks may be carried out without the authorisation or approval of the UN Security Council."
"In fact the Petersberg tasks include, and I quote, 'humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making' ."
"Therefore, only in the latter, for which the use of military force is required, is the existence of a UN Security Council resolution considered necessary."
"It is clear that the implementation of actions, particularly humanitarian ones, does not require legitimisation by the UN Security Council. This does not mean, however, that the principles of the UN Charter do not have to be respected when carrying out this type of task."
"Thank you for your answer, but I am afraid that it still does not provide proper clarification."
"On the one hand, it is said that deployment is to take place in accordance with the UN or OSCE Charters; on the other hand, the Council' s representative says that no decision needs to be taken in the Security Council."
"The Swedish Foreign Minister has stated that the expression 'in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter' is to be interpreted as 'following a decision in the UN' s Security Council' ."
"She also said, in the course of last year' s conference in Cologne, that, if other countries wanted to align themselves with the UN, Sweden would have the option of using its veto."
"I should first of all like to know whether the Swedish Government has informed its colleagues in the Council as to whether it is planned to use the veto in the event of an EU action, that is to say an EU military action, being taken in the absence of a decision in the UN' s Security Council."
"Moreover, I should like to hear a still clearer statement. Can or cannot EU military personnel be deployed without a clear decision in the UN' s Security Council or in the OSCE?"
"It ought to be easy to answer yes or no to that question."
"Mr Gahrton, the Petersberg tasks have several dimensions."
"Some are purely humanitarian, for example rescue tasks."
"Do you really think that we need to have a UN Security Council resolution in order to carry out a rescue task in a serious humanitarian situation?"
"I also clearly said that any situation which may involve the use of military force, namely peace-making, naturally requires recourse and subordination to the Security Council."
"As for the other tasks, we only have to comply with the obligations accepted by the European Union in the context of the UN, particularly bearing in mind that some EU countries are members of the UN Security Council."
"Therefore, the spirit of the UN Charter will naturally be followed in the type of activity which the European Union may carry out within those Petersberg tasks which do not involve the use of military force."
"I am still not quite clear about your answer and would just like to ask whether you think that governments in neutral countries are being somewhat economical with the truth?"
"Mr Gahrton said that his government stated that it is only after a UN Security Council resolution has been adopted."
"But from what you have said, that is not the case."
"It appears that governments in neutral countries have a tendency to mislead citizens."
"Is that the case?"
"Mrs McKenna, the agreement reached in Helsinki allowing these new military structures to be established was a carefully considered agreement which was prepared under the Finnish Presidency. As you know, Finland is a country which has very legitimate national concerns in this respect and which clearly will have taken these aspects into account."
"What we are currently trying to create within the European Union, and will eventually create, is a capacity for specific intervention which, in those areas not requiring the use of military force, will not need a mandate from the UN Security Council. In other areas a resolution will of course be necessary."
"We expressly accept the need for this Security Council resolution where military forces are to be used in a given context."
"The traditionally neutral countries, particularly the EU Member States which are not members of NATO, have managed to safeguard all their concerns in achieving this balance because this issue is clearly very delicate for these countries."
"They are not deceiving their people nor are they being economical with the truth. They are saying exactly what their commitment is."
"Clearly, their right of final veto over any decision is always guaranteed by the decision-making mechanism itself. Therefore, they can decide on a case-by-case basis as they see fit."
"This is the fundamental rule of the European Union for any situation requiring the participation of military forces."
"Mr President, there were approximately one hundred military conflicts in the Nineties, the majority of which were civil wars."
"I want to ask whether, in connection with the scenarios that have been gone through, a consensus has emerged that it will not be possible to deal authoritatively with certain types of conflict under the existing Treaty."
"In other words, is it agreed that certain military conflicts come within Nato' s or some other organisation' s sphere of authority but definitely not under the EU' s?"
"I will only say that this military capability, this intervention capacity of the European Union and this extension of its area of activity are all specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam which entered into force in May last year. It is only since then that these issues have been raised."
"Question No 13 by (H-0471/00):"
"Subject: Arms supplies to Mexico The forthcoming export of P-90 revolvers to Mexico is further proof that Belgium is not very particular about human rights."
"Following the insurrection in Chiapas there is evidence of increasingly serious violations of human rights in Mexico, with torture, arbitrary arrests and 'disappearances' etc."
"The European code of conduct on arms exports, adopted on 8 June 1998, prohibits exports of arms to countries where there is a risk of the arms being used in an internal conflict."
"Does the Council feel that these supplies of arms to Mexico are in conformity with the European code of conduct?"
"If so, is there not a case for tightening up the code of conduct?"
"If not, what will be the Council's response to the Member State involved, Belgium?"
"As you know, the European Union' s position on arms exports is set out in the code of conduct approved in June 1998."
"Respect for human rights is one of the code' s main conditions which must be met in order for authorisation to be granted."
"Although decisions are taken individually by each Member State, the latter must take full account of the provisions of the code of conduct. This is therefore a matter of political good faith."
"The Council does not receive any information on the reasons why Member States grant or refuse export licences and therefore cannot assess the grounds on which these decisions are based."
"However, particularly since the establishment of the code of conduct, the exchange of information on arms exports has begun to occur within the European Union. This exchange is the subject of an annual report and will clearly help to identify common ways of tackling the problems."
"We must realise, however, that this issue is still subject to subsidiarity in that the decisions are taken by each Member State, even though the code of conduct forms the backdrop and reference for these decisions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to hide my amazement at your reply."
"It is, of course, the case that with this conduct of conduct, we only have a very weak tool at our disposal to combat inadmissible arms exports."
"I would like to ask you if there has ever been consultation within the Council to tighten up this code of conduct or to make it more easily enforceable?"
"I fear that the same fate that has befallen our foreign and security policy as a whole, and which has been discussed so many times, will also befall this code of conduct."
"At the end of the day, we rely on goodwill and, if that is not there, we might as well forget it."
"Mrs Maes, I almost totally agree with what you have just said. However, the current code of conduct was the only one possible."
"I can say this as I attended and participated in the negotiations on this code. The reality is that the code clearly gives no guarantees with regard to monitoring how the Member States interpret their responsibilities."
"Quite frankly, there has not been until this moment, within the European Union, a consensus on or even a majority inclination towards reconsidering this issue."
"The code of conduct was regarded at the time as a very important qualitative step forward in terms of the disparate practices of the Member States which existed at that time."
"The aim was to tie the various Member States to a basic set of principles and to the observance of certain standards, while still leaving them completely free in this matter."
"This is what is happening today. I realise that the code of conduct is very weak, it particularly does not have a binding nature and cannot go any further than a political sanction."
"Therefore, publicising this type of situation - and I am not just referring to the situation raised in the question - particularly where this is taken up by the media, will put healthy pressure on the Council. In this way the European Union will one day be able to guarantee that the practices of its countries and those involving certain types of lucrative activity will be in harmony with the principles which the EU claims to defend."
"This is the big test that the European Union and its Member States will have to face in the future."
"Question No 14 by (H-0474/00):"
"Subject: Restoring normal relations with Austria In view of the response given earlier in the year by the Council to the recent political developments in Austria and of the need to promote the best overall interests of the European Community, will the Council now state if it is prepared to restore normal relations with Austria at every level?"
"I would have been surprised if there had not been a question on this issue which is why I am glad that it has finally come up."
"The Council of Ministers of the European Union does not have to express an opinion on a decision taken by 14 Member States in the context of their bilateral relations with Austria."
"This is not a matter for the Council."
"It would be different if, by not complying with any aspect of the Treaty on European Union, Austria were found to have infringed the principles of Article 6, for example, and therefore had to be punished or the application of the provisions of Article 7 had to be justified."
"As this is not the case, what is happening now in the relations between the 14 Member States and Austria is a bilateral issue which is not the responsibility of the Council."
"Thank you for agreeing to take the question."
"I am certainly taken aback by the President-in-Office's response."
"The fact is that the sanctions were imposed by the Council."
"I cannot see how the Council can now wash its hands of at least discussing the possibility of lifting those sanctions."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he is aware that recent public opinion polls in Austria indicate that over 80% of Austrian citizens want to see the sanctions lifted."
"How then can the Council continue to ignore the democratic decision of the Austrian people?"
"Does the President-in-Office not agree that failure to lift the sanctions now is undermining the democratic foundations on which this Union was established?"
"I would ask him to give this House this evening an assurance that he will use his undoubted influence to have the matter discussed at the summit in your country next week."
"Certainly, what is happening does not reflect the European aspiration to unity."
"I am extremely disappointed that the Council, in this way, would want to wash its hands of what is a very serious matter."
"Mr Hyland, the Council is composed of fifteen countries. I am not aware that Austria has participated in any debate or vote in Council in which any type of measure has been adopted against it."
"No EU body has adopted any measure against Austria."
"During the term of the Portuguese Presidency, there has been no working body of the European Union in which Austria has not had, like this Parliament, the option of full and active participation with regard to the whole of the EU' s operation."
"The bilateral decisions, not sanctions, which were taken by the 14 Member States in respect of Austria are political acts which one country is entitled to adopt in respect of another."
"Every country has every right, with regard to the development of the political situation in another country, to adopt an attitude and to draw the due consequences from this."
"The consequences in this matter are that Austrian candidates are not being supported in international organisations, Austrian ambassadors are not being received at a level above director-general and there is a freeze on political visits."
"These are the famous 'sanctions' ."
"If any country has interpreted this attitude more extensively then this is a matter for each country. These 'sanctions' are therefore bilateral as each country is doing what it wishes in this respect and the responsibility is collective."
"The responsibility for the position taken by the 14 Member States was freely assumed by these countries."
"Any of these countries is free to disengage itself from these measures and we have to ask ourselves why up to now none of the 14 countries has done this. This issue is therefore not a matter for the Council."
"The Austrian authorities have had the opportunity to raise this issue within the European Union."
"It was in fact raised by the Austrian Foreign Minister during the informal meeting of foreign ministers. It was raised the day before yesterday by the Austrian Foreign Minister in Luxembourg and Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel will very probably take the opportunity afforded by his presence in Santa Maria da Feira to raise this issue."
"However, this decision is not a Community decision but a bilateral one, whether you like it or not."
"I wanted to ask the President-in-Office to clarify something."
"You are saying that the Council is not getting involved in these bilateral measures because, strictly speaking, it is not a Council decision."
"So has there not been any consultation within the Council at any time?"
"It is nonetheless being mooted that the sanctions will be brought up again in Feira."
"You are saying that Austria might raise the issue again, but that is not possible in a Council meeting."
"It will thus need to be raised again in separate meetings of a bilateral nature."
"Do you yourself not think that this is a little peculiar?"
"It does not seem peculiar to me for the following reason."
"As I said at the start, in terms of strict compliance with its Community obligations as specified by the Treaty on European Union, Austria has not behaved in any way which may lead to action in the specific context of Article 7."
"This is clear and no one can dispute this just as no one can dispute that the Austrian elections were free and that the Austrian people are free to choose the government they want."
"What can also not be disputed is that the other governments are free to be unhappy about the Austrian Government if they consider that this government contains a party which does not respect a set of basic principles which these governments have collectively undertaken to respect and which Austria has also undertaken to respect."
"What I must say to Mrs Maes is that we are all Austrians in that we all have citizenship rights which must be respected in Austria."
"We are therefore not indifferent to a political development which may lead to the presence, in the executive bodies of a Member State government and therefore a friendly government which shares with us and which has decided to share with us a basic set of principles, of a party which clearly conducted an electoral campaign based on other principles."
"With regard to the issue of using the Community bodies to raise this issue, we are a free Union in that each Member State has the right to raise this issue formally or informally in the specific context of the Union."
"As this is not an EU matter, this issue was never placed on the agenda and this will not occur under the Portuguese Presidency in any formal Council body."
"The representatives of the Austrian Government are clearly totally free to raise this issue and will have every opportunity to debate this if the Member States want to do so."
"At the Lisbon European Council, the 14 Member States decided to entrust the Portuguese Prime Minister with giving a collective response. At the informal meeting in the Azores there was a debate and several Member States expressed their opinions on the situation."
"I am not sure what will happen in Feira but clearly Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel is totally free to express his opinions and to see the reaction of the other Member States to his words and arguments."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office, finally, if he and his Council recognise the outcome of democratic elections within this Union?"
"Secondly, does he believe that the Portuguese presidency acted in haste as a result of a series of telephone calls throughout Europe when that decision was taken?"
"Would it not have been wiser to summon a meeting of the heads of state for an important decision like this which - remember - will have consequences long after our time here in the European Parliament?"
"I would like to hear the views of the Portuguese presidency, and maybe other presidencies, when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the Union."
"This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity."
"To use a slang word it is a 'cop-out' to say that it is not a matter for the Council."
"Someone must take an initiative to resolve this serious problem."
"It has given stature to an individual who does not deserve that stature."
"In fact it has strengthened his position, not weakened it."
"I will start with the last part of the honourable Member' s question by saying that we were not the ones who gave stature to someone who does not deserve this. It was Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel who did this by agreeing to an alliance with the party of Mr Haider."
"With regard to the result of the Austrian elections, I clearly said that we fully respect the result of these elections."
"Austria is a free country and one where the elections are held in a totally legal manner and with full transparency."
"The problem is that the result of this free election, as has happened in the past in other countries, brought a certain party to power."
"You should realise that there is actually something strange in the Austrian internal situation."
"The party which received the most votes was the Social Democratic Party which did not want to form a government. The party with the second highest number of votes was the FPO which was not invited to form a government."
"It is rather strange, in terms of usual constitutional arrangements, that in a European country the second-placed party was not invited to form a government but the third-placed party was instead."
"Therefore, this is not a case of business as usual. It actually involves a kind of reassessment given the potential capacity of Mr Haider to become the leader of an Austrian government."
"We do not dispute the Austrian elections and we do not dispute the right of the Austrian people to choose the government they want."
"However, no one can force us to enter into relations with a government containing a party which has so far not renounced what it said in its electoral campaign nor the gravity of what it said."
"It is a shame that this is not being clearly emphasised. The gravity of what was said by Mr Haider and by the FPO in the elections is something which should make us all think, bearing in mind the future of Europe."
"We should think about the racist and xenophobic statements which have been systematically made by this party. Curiously, it did not distance itself from these during its last conference, and instead reaffirmed all its pride in its past statements when it had a specific opportunity to rectify the current situation."
"Nothing leads us to believe that there has been any positive change which may justify a new attitude of the European Union and, in particular, which may create the opportunity for any type of discussion on this matter within the European Union."
"We do not feel that this issue is a matter for the European Union but is rather for the other 14 governments to decide."
"So far - and we will have to wait and see what happens next - these governments have maintained a position of recognising that this situation is serious and that it requires a change, but not necessarily by the 14 governments. There is in fact an almost media-wide presumption that the change in attitude at this time should come from the 14 countries."
"Why?"
"What has changed in the Austrian situation which could lead us to change our attitude?"
"Only time?"
"We consider that it is the Austrians and the Austrian Government which must change if they want us to adopt a different attitude."
"That is the essence of the matter."
"Why systematically place the onus on the 14 countries?"
"Why must the 14 Member States change?"
"What has happened in Austria to justify this change?"
"Clearly this does not necessarily mean that we will not consider other ways in the future of assessing the development of this situation and in fact this is what will happen in the coming days."
"Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa."
"I would like to thank you for your continual presence, your unselfishness, the intelligence with which you have replied to us, as well as your patience, and we would like to wish you much success in your personal role as Minister and also to the Portuguese Presidency."
"May this success match that of the Portuguese football team at the beginning of Euro 2000."
"May you achieve much for Europe!"
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 15 to 28 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)."
"Change to the agenda"
"On the recommendation of the Presidency and in accordance with Rule 111 of our Rules of Procedure I propose an amendment of the agenda for this current part-session."
"By letter of 8 June 2000, the Council requested from Parliament its opinion of the proposed Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro 2000/137(CNS) and a proposed Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 which lays down various provisions on the introduction of the euro 2000/134(CNS) before the European Council in Feira on 19 June 2000."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs has decided to apply the simplified procedure in accordance with Rule 158 of the Rules of Procedure to both texts."
"I therefore propose that they be included in accordance with the procedure without debate."
"Is there any objection to the proposal?"
"If not, the agenda is thereby amended and the deadline for the presentation of amendments is 10.00 a.m. on Thursday 15 June 2000 and the vote will take place on Friday 16 June 2000."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Reconstruction of Central America"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0133/2000) by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a Community Action Plan for the reconstruction of Central America [COM(1999) 201 - C5-0111/1999 - 1999/2114(COS)]"
". (ES) Mr President, in 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) resulting in 20,000 victims and losses of more than EUR 5 billion (10% of the GDP of those countries which are already burdened by eternal foreign debt)."
"It destroyed crops, homes and infrastructures of every type, thereby jeopardising the future of its peoples."
"Europe' s response was immediate and significant, through the Stockholm Conference, and it was consolidated, following the European Parliament' s proposal, in the Commission' s initiative which we are currently debating."
"I would like to highlight four issues."
"The first relates to our assumption of responsibility in the event of these catastrophes."
"The connection between our economic activity and the increase in pollution, with the greenhouse effect and the onset of climate changes makes it advisable for us to immediately ratify the Kyoto protocols on the reduction of the gases which cause this effect."
"Furthermore, our model of unequal development leads to poverty and indebtedness in these countries."
"It is a contradiction to preach the reconstruction of Central America taking account of respect for the environment, according to a model of sustainable development, while we continue to maintain the same economic relations with those countries."
"The second issue involves the global objective of our assistance."
"The Commission' s proposal is sensible insofar as it centres its attention on two fields: health and education."
"However, it should be more ambitious, so that it may coordinate and integrate all the different initiatives in those countries."
"This requires a substantial increase in our staff, a measure which this House supports."
"This action will allow for synergy between the different forms of aid and will guarantee that the effort made will not be limited merely to reconstruction - since, in that event, things would continue in the same way - but will offer an opportunity for regional integration, harmonious and sustainable development, creating wealth and general well-being, and for the consolidation of democracy in these countries which have just thankfully left behind years of violence and confrontation."
"In this respect, two facts worry us."
"The threat of hostility between Nicaragua and Honduras as a result of border disputes would cast doubt upon the good sense of our aid, and we therefore think that both of those countries should be subject to the decisions of the International Court of Justice."
"The other is the recent re-emergence in Guatemala of political kidnappings, such as that of the university professor Mayra Angelina Gutiérrez, political killings, such as that of the Community leader, José Amancio Mendoza, or threats against journalists (the case of Gerardi or the Nobel Prize winner, Rigoberta Menchú) which are of concern."
"Aid for reconstruction must be accompanied by firm and accountable commitments to safeguarding human rights on the part of the Guatemalan Government."
"The third question concerns the way in which we are going to carry out aid and regional coordination and integration."
"It is essential that we incorporate the most dynamic and responsible sections of society, the indigenous peoples, as well as the full and broad participation of women, the social organisations which display efficiency and solidarity and, lastly, that there is no partisan use of aid nor fraud in its management."
"That is why we need to carry out internal and external audits of the application of our aid."
"Increasing our effectiveness as the European Union also means that we must participate officially in the Stockholm monitoring group."
"The fourth and last point is currently the most important: the amount of aid."
"Although it is considerable, we believe that the amount indicated by the Commission, EUR 250 million, is insufficient given the magnitude of the disaster and the slow rate of the area' s recovery."
"The European Parliament therefore requests a significant increase."
"We are concerned by the items appearing today in the press indicating that the Commission intends to reduce all European Union aid, including that destined for Latin America, because of its commitments in Kosovo."
"We believe that we cannot behave in such an absurd way, since for Latin America this aid offers hope of escaping underdevelopment and freeing itself from the heavy yoke which originates from the North."
"The European Parliament has already stated that it would not commit itself to any action which would mean cuts in the aid to other parts of the world."
"We therefore insist that this is a crucial and key point."
"If we behave in this way, we will ensure that other actions, both with the European Investment Bank and with other financial bodies, are significant and would aid the immediate execution of the programmes approved. All of this should be accompanied by the presentation of periodic reports to the European Parliament on the evolution and assessment of the results obtained."
"Finally, I would like to acknowledge the warm and excellent cooperation of all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and its staff, as well as the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some regions in the world are struck by the hand of fate several times in quick succession."
"In the 1980s, the European Union made a major commitment to Central America in the San José process, in order to help establish peace and democracy in this region."
"This process was a success."
"And then, just a few years ago, these countries were again hard hit, this time by a terrible hurricane, and they are still suffering the consequences."
"Thank goodness that Europe is again taking action, offering assistance and helping to reconstruct Central America."
"We need to publicise the fact that the European Union is funding at least 62% of public development aid in Central America."
"This entitles the European Union to play a political role in Central America, which is not just the preserve of its large neighbours;"
"Europe too can make a contribution here to peace, democracy and reconstruction."
"We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal."
"The Committee on Budgets supports the idea of earmarking EUR 250 million for this region for the period from 1999 to 2004."
"It is also a good idea to make this aid conditional upon a commitment by the countries to work together."
"That was the model used in Europe after the Second World War, when the duty to work together, cooperate and overcome borders were the sine qua non for Marshall Plan funds."
"Our contribution to reconstruction aid will likewise be conditional upon a commitment to peaceful coexistence and cooperation."
"I also expressly agree with the rapporteur: we should not allow the reconstruction of Kosovo to be funded, as it were, from the budget for Central America."
"If the reconstruction of Kosovo is a European task decided by the Council, then it must also provide the necessary funds, which is why we are voting today on a sum of money as a direction marker, a direction marker which was decided before the conflict in Kosovo."
"The Commission report predates the Kosovo conflict and we have made no changes to it."
"We stand by the sum proposed for Central America."
"I think that is the most important signal we can send out today."
"Mr President, our committee undoubtedly agrees with Mr Marset Campos' s report."
"However, I should like to draw the House' s attention to a number of points which, as far as we are concerned, are right at the top of the international aid priority list."
"International aid must, without fail, be well coordinated."
"The Commission, for its part, must set up suitable structures on the ground."
"However, it must also cooperate as efficiently as possible with the international organisations which have been working there for several years already."
"The same applies when it comes to involving the people affected, especially the indigenous population."
"We must work with these people on the ground during both planning and implementation, that is essential as far as we are concerned."
"Not only does it save costs, it increases efficiency and, more importantly, prevents fraud."
"We know that in El Salvador, for example, the erstwhile Calderón government diverted aid of EUR 1 million in order to win votes in the right-wing camp."
"If we really want to help the countries devastated by the hurricane, then of course we need to do more than just implement a few aid projects on the ground."
"We all know that full well."
"It is therefore essential that we remit foreign debts and build up regional and, above all, sustainable structures in both the ecological and the economic sense of the word."
"The Union must also guarantee these countries access to the markets for their products, which must be assessed from both an ecological and a social point of view, because there is little point in giving out aid, on the one hand, and excluding these countries from our markets, on the other."
"I take the same view as the previous speakers, that it is unacceptable for the Council to argue that money now needs to be diverted from Latin America to Kosovo."
"Robbing Peter to pay Paul can hardly be called a policy; on the contrary."
"The Council keeps heaping more and more tasks on to the Commission and the European Parliament; it also needs to ensure that they can be funded by entering the relevant amounts in the budget."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Marset, has said - and we support his words and his report - Hurricane Mitch has been the worst natural disaster in the history of Central America."
"The human losses number more than 10 000 deaths; almost another 10 000 have disappeared and more than 2 million people have been affected; the material damage amounts to more than EUR 5 billion which is equivalent to 10% of the GDP of Central America."
"A significant part of the economic and social infrastructure has been destroyed and there has been a great reduction in the region' s capacity for production and export in the short and medium term."
"The countries most affected, Honduras and Nicaragua, are the poorest in the region."
"The destructive effect of Mitch was exacerbated by deforestation and the lack of an adequate system of flood control, which demonstrated once again that environmental degradation affects the poorest most and highlights the intrinsic link between poverty and environmental deterioration."
"As the Commission has said, the consequences of Mitch will considerably reduce the results of the efforts towards economic recovery and investment made there during the last decade by the European Union."
"In April 1999, the Commission approved a special action plan, provided with EUR 250 million, which this Parliament fully supports in the terms in which it was approved."
"With regard to the model for implementing this programme, the Committee on Development and Cooperation supports option 1 proposed by the Commission."
"Only in the event that it is not possible to carry out option 1 as a result of a lack of sufficient human resources, could option 2 be considered valid, by means of the contracting of highly qualified European experts."
"As draftsman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I must not end without asking, once again, for the cancellation of the foreign debt of the Central American countries, an initiative which must be dealt with by the European Union as a whole and in a coordinated fashion and not only by certain Member States acting on individual and particular initiatives."
"Lastly, I believe it is also necessary to ask, within the strategic reconstruction plan, for the proposal of measures aimed at increasing credits from the European Investment Bank in that region."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, on the excellent report which he has presented to us."
"This report has inevitably been influenced by the tragic consequences of Hurricane Mitch."
"The European Parliament - and I believe we should remember this - reacted immediately by calling an extraordinary meeting on 4 November 1998 which was attended by the Commissioners then responsible."
"In its resolution of 19 November, the European Parliament expressed the terms in which the European Union would respond to the situation created by Hurricane Mitch."
"This response had to be formulated with the greatest diligence and speed through the approval of a strategic plan for the region within the shortest possible time limit."
"I remember the date: November 18-19 1998."
"We must say that this request by the European Parliament, at least with regard to diligence and speed, has not been attended to, and this is a cause for regret."
"The lack of human resources, while it may be an excuse from an administrative point of view, cannot and must not be a pretext for the establishment of political priorities, especially in the case of basic needs of countries which have suffered disasters on a massive scale."
"To transfer this responsibility to the budgetary authority is not correct."
"The Commission must at all times ensure the appropriate allocation of resources in accordance with the priorities agreed."
"Commissioner, this morning, in the debate on the common security and defence policy, I had the opportunity to tell your colleague, Mr Patten, that I have never had, do not have and will never have any hesitation in decisively supporting the Commission with a view to clarifying and broadening the scope of its competencies. On the contrary."
"However, as other Members have said during this debate and as I had the opportunity to say also to Mr Patten during the budgetary debate, it is difficult for me to understand why the Commission has no difficulty in managing the EUR 800 million which it proposes in the preliminary draft 2001 budget for the Balkans but that, nevertheless, it has difficulties managing EUR 250 million which have been set aside in the plan for reconstruction in Central America, which are not envisaged for one year, but for four years."
"In any event, Commissioner, the countries of Central America have not carried out a policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing."
"They have included, unlike other geographical areas in their agreements with the European Union, a democratic clause which provides an essential element on which the whole relationship is based."
"The countries of Central America have taken on very painful processes of structural adjustment which have meant great sacrifices for their societies."
"They have done their duties with regard to the multilateral institutions and have fully complied with what the European Union expected of them."
"Mr President, European civil society has already shown how sensitive it is to the tragedy suffered by the peoples of Central America."
"It is now time for our institutions, in the face of a disaster of this type, to be a match for our civil society and for the circumstances."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, for his excellent motion for a resolution and also for the great clarity of vision with which he has interpreted the spirit of this resolution, which must not be limited to solidarity but shift the focus onto much more tangible political initiatives."
"I do not wish to trawl through the figures recording the consequences of the hurricane again. I would simply stress the fact that the social and environmental damage concerns us far more than the economic damage caused, and it is that which is affecting this region."
"And since misfortune is never fair, particularly when meting out its after-effects, it is the poorer bands of society which, as always, have been worst affected."
"I would like to start by describing a paradox: the region hit by the hurricane, which is often hit by hurricanes as violent as this one, also includes Florida."
"Yet although Florida suffers the same weather conditions as Central America, it reports infinitely less serious damage."
"This is my point: we must start from here and consider the environmental and social vulnerability of Central America if we are to realise that the emergency relief culture and policy will not suffice, and this must be the focus of European Union aid."
"This resolution has the advantage of going beyond emergencies."
"The Community action plan is a chance to combine the reconstruction process with an element of change - change which these countries genuinely need - and to invest in a new economic and social development process based on the priorities of health, education and high quality services, which, in these countries, are directly responsible for the quality of life, and, above all, the quality of their democracy."
"The resolution explains in great detail that all this is possible provided that two conditions are upheld and satisfied."
"First of all, we must activate the monitoring and inspection measures, in order to avoid wastage, unlawful activity and fraud."
"To this end, the resolution calls for the European Union to have sole responsibility for planning, execution and monitoring of the aid."
"We are calling upon the Commission to take up its responsibility, and we consider it vital that it does so if we are to provide effective aid."
"However, the second condition is much more important: we need to increase the Commission' s financial and human resources."
"The funds appropriated are not sufficient and the staffing is certainly inadequate."
"In an area which has been greatly affected by political violence, the provision of aid - which is intended not only to provide emergency relief but to facilitate the restoration of democratic order as well - specifies and assumes a quality of preparation and a level of human resources which is quite different from that which has hitherto been envisaged."
"We consider that greater and more effective use should be made of the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which represent not only extremely experienced and extremely reliable resources in the countries concerned, but, above all, tangible resources which enable us to make our intervention more dynamic and more effective."
"In other words, Mr President, Members of the Commission and the Council, I feel that it is time for the European Union to stop just declaring its solidarity and secure genuine, substantial fairness."
"This plan must do more than just provide immediate alleviation of the effects of the hurricane: it must also bring about redistribution of the country' s resources and restore the country' s opportunities."
"The resolution adopted by the European Parliament in November 1998 was also a step in this direction in that it referred to the cancellation of the foreign debt of the countries in the region, which amounted to USD 17 billion."
"I would like to conclude by reiterating the invitation to the Commission and the Council contained in the resolution to support the total and immediate cancellation of the foreign debt."
"Mr President, there is little to add at this point in the debate, especially after the excellent report by Mr Marset, which I agree with completely."
"However, I would like to stress certain things that he has said."
"It is very important to speak of behaving cooperatively - we have spoken about behaving sensibly - by focussing especially on education and health programmes, as the report itself says, and he has also spoken about coordination and the need for staff."
"For those of us who were in Kosovo just a few days ago, we must specifically highlight something which has been said by many of the visitors in the delegation. That is, that, unlike other interventions, the main feature of the one carried out in Kosovo is that it was directed in an integrated and perfectly coordinated fashion, which increases the efficiency of our action."
"On the other hand, as Mr Salafranca has pointed out very clearly, I also absolutely share his disagreement not only with the budgetary restrictions, but also with the difficult fact that obstacles are placed in the way of countries such as those in Central America in whose agreements certain clauses have been included, while we do not act in this way in other regions."
"For those of us whose leitmotif for political action is solidarity, we also require efficiency, the sustainability of programmes and the creation of policies in the places where we take action, which will help these treasured societies of Latin America to reach higher levels of development and social justice."
"I will end, Mr President, with the following quote: ""We must be rebels, but we must also be competent"" ."
"To interpret this in another context: let us show solidarity, but, in doing so, be efficient."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the awful disaster caused by Hurricane Mitch sets three main challenges for European policy."
"First: we must help with reconstruction in these countries."
"The Commission document provides a good basis for this, although some of what is written in it has yet to be implemented in practice."
"I think it is particularly important to use the know-how of European organisations and organisations in Member States for reconstruction and to involve non-governmental organisations and local experts."
"I do not think that calling for more new posts in the European Commission every time a new challenge arises is always the right response."
"Perhaps Commission staff could be reassigned."
"Secondly: we must give these ill-fated countries greater access to European markets than we have done in the past."
"It is paradoxical that Nicaragua and Honduras, which were two of the least developed countries even before Hurricane Mitch, fail to qualify for the same treatment as many, many others, such as the ACP countries, which we treat well, and rightly so."
"I cannot see why Nicaragua and Honduras still fail to qualify for the same treatment."
"I do not want to quote the perennial example of bananas - the report does that."
"I support this passage and also what Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has said."
"I would like to quote the example of sugar."
"In the case of sugar, which is an important product for Nicaragua, Nicaragua has no access of any importance to European markets."
"It might help if we were to facilitate its access to the European markets."
"The third challenge is that we need to fight the causes of these disasters."
"I am well aware that we cannot simply say that the increase in greenhouse gases caused Hurricane Mitch."
"However, there are many scientists who assume that it probably did. We just cannot say for certain."
"But all the scientific committees agree that the number of disasters such as this will increase significantly if we industrialised counties continue to pump out the greenhouse gases at the same rate."
"They will of course affect all of us, but they will always affect poor people most, which is why we must at last take more decisive action here."
"Mr President, I should like to follow on from Mr Liese' s closing comment on climate change, to which Mr Marset Campos also referred."
"It is perhaps not by chance that we have suffered tremendous devastation in Central America, Venezuela and Mozambique, not to mention in Europe, and it is likely to increase."
"It seems reasonable to suppose that it is not increasing by chance and that it really is the result of man-made climatic changes."
"I would therefore like to see a link established between how we view these disasters and energy policy."
"There really is a link and I should like to draw your attention to it."
"I only wish there were not."
"The second point I would like to make is that aid should be used to integrate Central America."
"This has been a perennial cause for concern to the European Parliament and we have called for it on many occasions."
"In the final analysis, of course, this is up to the people of Central America."
"But perhaps the shock triggered by Hurricane Mitch gives us an excuse to overcome the hostilities and difficulties between the individual countries."
"In any case, the people would be grateful and, for the rest, our aid would be worthless without any progress with integration."
"The third point I should like to make concerns the implementation of this aid."
"I do not envy the Commission this task because I know full well that, in a few years' time, a report on the alleged or rightly criticised misuse of funds will land in our lap and I should like to point out that the cost of controlling these funds often exceeds the gain."
"I hope that we shall be giving the Commission a certain amount of room for manoeuvre in the use of these funds because the speed at which programmes are implemented is often much more important than accounts in black and white down to the last penny."
"I know that this is a comment which a parliamentarian should not make nowadays, but I make it nonetheless because I am right."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the hurricane in October 1998 went beyond Central America."
"It is now June 2000. In other words, we too are an unwieldy apparatus and perhaps we too need to consider how we can speed up the process."
"Even if we pass a resolution today, we are still a long way from building up the country; on the contrary, it will take many years, perhaps a generation."
"I consider that to be far too long."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking, on behalf of the Commission, the European Parliament for the quality of this report and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, on his report on the Commission communication on the Action Plan for the Reconstruction of Central America."
"I am also grateful for the support and confidence that Parliament has given the Commission on the implementation of this important Community Action Plan."
"The EUR 250m regional programme for the reconstruction of Central America, spread over four years, will contribute to the reconstruction and the transformation of the four countries most devastated by Hurricane Mitch - Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala."
"The programme is based on the principle of sustainable development, as has been underlined by several speakers."
"It provides for assistance in education, vocational training, public health and social housing."
"The primary beneficiaries will be those who live in extremely disadvantaged rural areas where the consequences of the disaster are most acute."
"Attention will be paid in particular to the indigenous peoples and to reducing vulnerability to this kind of catastrophe in the future."
"The Commission is aware that the success of such an ambitious and complex programme also depends on the degree of coordination among the various actors present."
"A coordination group is being set up between the Commission and the Member States."
"Another important element will be the Stockholm Follow-up Group."
"Until now the Commission has always been involved in an informal way in the activities carried out by this group."
"In order to ensure maximum transparency, the Commission will submit an annual report on the progress of the RPRCA to the Member States and Parliament."
"A first report of the activities carried out by the Commission has been distributed among the parliamentary Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Following the initial emergency and other post-Mitch aid, we are now actively preparing the implementation of this reconstruction programme."
"The mobilisation of the statutory personnel necessary for decentralised management and implementation of the programme certainly delayed the rapid launch of the programme, as has been emphasised by several speakers."
"These problems have now been overcome."
"The first official will arrive in Managua on 17 July and the remaining officials in the following weeks."
"No further delays are expected at this point."
"The Commission is taking all necessary steps so that the programme can be in place and operational within the following three months."
"I quite understand the arguments Mr Salafranca raised about human resources."
"As you know, it is not a question specific to this debate."
"However, you should bear in mind that for the Kosovo programme we set up a specific agency."
"In the case of this programme we had to deal with the staff who were available, due to the constraints of human resources."
"Let me stress - and I share the view of Mr Salafranca and others - that the amount of time it has taken to get this aid to the region is wholly unacceptable."
"We cited it as an example in our recent proposals for the overall reform of our external assistance programmes."
"It is just another reason why the Commission, and Commissioner Patten in particular, is so determined that we should drive forward those reforms so that we stop letting others and ourselves down in this way."
"Since the issue has been raised by several speakers, I should like to take this opportunity to guarantee that the financing of Kosovo will not be to the detriment of money allocated to Latin America, and definitely not to this specific programme."
"Additional measures have been adopted by the Commission in the framework of the Community Action Plan."
"These include the European Community contribution to the HIPC debt initiative, and approval of an improved General System of Preferences Scheme for Central America and Council Regulation of 21 December 1998 applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences has been extended to 31 December 2001."
"In addition, the Commission is taking part in the HIPC debt initiative, contributing some EUR 50m to both Honduras and Nicaragua."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"Asylum procedures"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0123/2000) by Mr Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission Working Document: Towards common standards on asylum procedures [(SEC(1999) 271 - C5-0157/1999 - 1999/2148(COS)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Amsterdam has at last paved the way for joint action in the area of asylum law and refugee and immigration policy."
"In my view, this was long overdue, because the decision to move from a purely economic community to political union was taken a long time ago."
"That the Treaty of Amsterdam moved in this direction was therefore all the more important."
"Unfortunately, when it happened, Parliament was only granted the right to be consulted on moves in the relevant legal areas, which is why I expressly state here that I trust that the Commission will continue to ensure that Parliament remains fully involved, despite the fact that it only has a right of consultation."
"Having said which, one thing must be made clear: given that, officially, we only have the right to be consulted, we shall only have any effective influence on the Commission and on how the relevant legal provisions develop if we, as a Parliament, agree on common principles and waive the need for full implementation of individual political goals."
"I think that we have chosen a good approach to this issue over recent months during our discussions of the Commission' s working paper."
"I know from my own group, I must add, that, because of how the report is drafted, the view of hardly anyone here in the House is wholly represented."
"That is precisely what happens when you make compromises and try to find a consensus."
"You are satisfied on many points, but not always 100%."
"Allow me to highlight the main points which I think are important for future asylum procedures."
"First: we must summon up the courage to separate the three main groups, i.e. asylum, on the one hand, and the temporary admission of refugees from crisis regions and immigration policy, on the other."
"Secondly: we must ensure that qualification procedures are shortened and simplified, without sacrificing sufficiently high standards of careful examination."
"Thirdly: our aim must be to allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum just once within the European Union."
"However, this means ensuring the same procedural law applies everywhere and is applied uniformly."
"This means training officials in charge of processing applications to a high standard."
"These officials must have access to cross-border information."
"And we must also ensure that asylum seekers are treated in exactly the same way, wherever they make their application."
"This includes welfare, accommodation etc. We need to guarantee that, in theory, you will face the same procedure everywhere, irrespective of whether you make your application in Spain, Germany or England."
"If we can guarantee that, then inversely, it is only logical to rule that just one application is allowed."
"Fourthly: I think that the Member States of the EU should be required to draw up a uniform, binding list of countries subject to a visa requirement and safe third countries and countries of origin."
"I know that some people are critical of this."
"But, in my view, it is the only way to ensure that officials take decisions on the basis of the same criteria and to create legal certainty for applicants in the Member States."
"One important point which I should like to address, and which we have made clear several times in the report, is that the burden must be divided between the Member States."
"How exactly this burden will be divided obviously still needs to be discussed."
"But one thing is clear: the door on which the majority of asylum seekers or refugees knocks cannot be left to chance."
"One country alone should not have to bear the burden."
"I know that asylum law is a difficult and politically sensitive issue but I think that we have made a start in the discussions in committee over recent months."
"We have discussed extremely constructively and fairly with each other."
"This discussion has encouraged me and I am convinced that Parliament is now in a position to give its joint support to the continuing legislative process and, possibly, to discuss other difficult issues, such as an immigration law, constructively."
"Mr President, allow me to start by thanking Mr Schmitt, not just for his report, but also for the excellent cooperation and for what he has just said to us."
"He speaks from the heart."
"Common principles were indeed seen as more important than individual political objectives."
"I should also like briefly to thank my committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs, for the confidence which it placed in a neo-parliamentarian, someone who has just climbed on board, in entrusting me with this sensitive issue."
"The right to asylum is enshrined in various treaties but, because of different definitions and interpretations by national courts, the law is applied to differing degrees."
"This obviously contradicts the principles and objectives of the EC Treaty, Title 4 of which refers to asylum policy as an important means of establishing an area of peace, security and justice."
"Establishing a uniform asylum law and harmonised implementing provisions is therefore a Community objective."
"The document presented by the Commission starts by explaining that legally binding instruments need to be adopted for the asylum procedure."
"Eight specific points are dealt with: Communitisation of the Dublin system, EURODAC, minimum standards for admission, minimum standards for recognising refugees, minimum standards for granting or withdrawing refugee status, complementary, subsidiary protection, temporary protection for displaced persons and, last but not least, a division of the burden."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has also achieved a consensus which pleases me greatly; here too individual political objectives had to be put aside and we drafted a good opinion which was useful for Mr Schmitt' s report."
"I think that we shall have a highly constructive vote in favour of our common ideal tomorrow."
"I wish us all the courage and strength to push forward on the final point which you addressed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight two positive things."
"The first is the working document presented by the Commission, which was the starting point for the report."
"It is a sound basis for instituting a debate which should culminate at some point in a legal act setting out common standards for an asylum procedure."
"The second is the report, which I particularly wish to highlight, because the rapporteur really has succeeded in finding a broad consensus right across the political divide on a very delicate matter."
"That is no easy task and we have all experienced quite the opposite here, which is why this is an excellent piece of work."
"I should like to pick up on three points which I think are particularly important and which I would ask the Commission to take into consideration."
"The first is the question of how to divide the burden and has already been addressed."
"We must not concentrate on just one aspect; we need to remain receptive to a distribution in terms of people."
"If you look at refugee movements, you will see that they always affect the same countries."
"Austria, for example, where I come from, is always near the top of the list when it comes to admitting temporary refugees or asylum seekers."
"It is on a par with Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands."
"Others have a much lighter burden to bear and greater solidarity between the Member States is needed here."
"I should like to highlight the question of shortening and simplifying the qualification procedures without - and that is the crux of the matter - compromising careful examination."
"It is an important point, because asylum seekers are entitled to a fast decision and a fast answer on their future status."
"The third point is that which gives legal certainty and which, when implemented, helps to ensure that identical decisions are taken in all Member States."
"It is the point which requires us to keep up-to-date lists of safe third countries and countries of origin."
"It will help enormously if we manage to draw up these lists."
"It attracted a broad consensus but I fear that this consensus will not perhaps hold up if all the amendments proposed by the Greens are included."
"They want much that is positive, but they want a lot that is total, as Mrs Merkel once remarked."
"If, for example, they want to implement the total extension of the definition of refugee or total access for asylum seekers to the job market or work to reverse the burden of proof, then the consensus achieved with their vote in committee will be jeopardised."
"I call on them to consider withdrawing these proposed amendments so that the broad consensus can be maintained."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Pirker has addressed an important aspect of the debate now behind us, namely the fact that this was the first time we have held a debate over several months in a political field in which, for as long as I have been here in Parliament, we have only ever become entrenched, which was marked by a willingness all round to compromise and, more importantly, by the ability all round to compromise."
"So let me say straight away that you, Mr Schmitt, have carried out what I see as an exemplary piece of work."
"We always extend our ritual thanks to the rapporteur but, in this case, I should like to do so in a special way, by saying that you have astounded all of us sitting on the left side of this House."
"The Secretary-General of the Berlin CDU, an important regional branch of the Christian-Democrat Union in Germany, has quite clearly stated in the report submitted here, and which bears his name, that he is in favour of maintaining the individual' s right to asylum as a fundamental right. As a German Social Democrat, all I can say is well done!"
"Your party leadership in Berlin - I mean the federal, not the local leadership - maintains exactly the opposite, namely that an immigration law is needed and that the individual right to claim protection is therefore no longer needed."
"Assert yourself in your party."
"I guarantee that you will have the support of the German Social Democrats, if no-one else."
"It is clear from what Mr Pirker has said that you have obviously been engaged in real missionary work in your group; but good works deserve to be praised."
"What we have achieved - and Mr Pirker has indicated that he is ready to vote in favour - is a report which addresses the standards which need to be applied to the asylum procedure so that comparable conditions and requirements for applying for and claiming asylum can be created uniformly throughout the European Union."
"When we speak of standards, we mean formal processes, procedural processes and we must do our best, in doing so, to guard against loading them with ideological connotations or questions of principle of a long-term, political nature."
"That is one of the reasons why we are telling our fellow members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we reject all their proposed amendments except one."
"This one amendment deals with remand pending deportation, which we too feel is an instrument worth examining."
"I am not judging that."
"We shall reject your proposed amendments because we need to learn in this Parliament, as legislators, that we should and must deal in the legislative process with the subject matter which needs to inform the law."
"But here we are talking about the procedural, not the substantive right to asylum."
"That is something else entirely."
"The Greens' proposed amendments contain a discussion of the content, not the form of asylum law."
"As you will certainly have noticed, we in the Socialist group have not filed any more proposed amendments to plenary; nor do we need to because the Schmitt report as voted by the committee corresponds in a very large measure to what we, as Socialists, have in mind: the fundamental vested right guaranteeing everyone who wishes to use it access to the procedure."
"It is important to us to have a guarantee of legal support in the procedure in a form which ensures above all - and we consider this to be tremendous progress - that those involved in the procedure are dealt with in a language which they can understand, i.e. that they are given the support they need to understand the procedure, that they can claim legal counsel in every case, that they can appeal to the court against the initial administrative decision and, as the most decisive point for us - I would remind my German fellow members of the debate within Germany - that this appeal has a suspensive effect."
"That is a huge step forward for us."
"It also means - and we went into this in considerable detail in our contribution to the debate in committee - that, where the applicant has temporary leave to stay during the appeal procedure, this procedure cannot take years; on the contrary, there must be a fast-track procedure, because the public and the applicant both have a right to swift completion of the procedure."
"All in all, Mr Schmitt has submitted a report which we in the group of the Party of European Socialists can support and I am fairly certain that this report will get what it deserves, i.e. a large majority."
"Mr President, fellow members. A word on a personal note: Today is the last sitting in which I shall act as coordinator of the group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I shall soon be devoting myself to different tasks in my group."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to thank all my fellow members, Mr Wiebenga, Mr Pirker, Mr Ceyhun and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, with whom I have worked so closely in this capacity over recent years, for always cooperating with me so fairly and trustingly."
"Mr President, we from the Liberal group will deeply miss Mr Schulz' s pure and crystal-clear democratic input in this area of policy."
"It is unfortunate, but we wish you all the best in your new job."
"This was the fun part of what I wanted to say."
"What shape is the European asylum policy in?"
"That is hard to say, as there is not really a European asylum policy to speak of."
"We in this Parliament, the delegates as well as their predecessors, have for years been pushing in the right direction."
"So far, the European Commission, that is to say the present Commissioner' s predecessor, failed to come up with the goods but, prior to the Treaty of Amsterdam, had little say in the matter anyway."
"The previous European Commission may have had the will, but did not have any power."
"The bottleneck, as we quite often noticed, was located within the Council of Ministers."
"Most governments showed willing too, but they were subject to the rule of unanimity."
"Then there was the Tampere Summit."
"Dozens of proposals were submitted there, also in this area of policy."
"Things were looking up, according to many journalists."
"They had, however, overlooked the fact that the crippling policy of decision-making on the basis of unanimity still applied."
"It is unlikely that a scoreboard will be able to unlock this paralysis within policy."
"All it will do is make it clear to the outside world which body and country are responsible for the paralysis within policy."
"What needs to happen now?"
"All sorts of things need to happen."
"As far as we, the Liberal group, are concerned, both the European Commission' s working document and Mr Schmitt' s report, which we are discussing today, are a useful leg-up to the next phase and, in our opinion, and I would echo the opinions of previous speakers, Mr Schmitt has adopted a level-headed approach in his report."
"We will be voting in favour of the tenor of the report and we are backing it."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam made one thing clear: there is no way of getting past a common asylum and immigration policy."
"The initiatives of the European Union on reuniting families, the anti-discrimination package, temporary protection for war refugees and, at long last, the attempt to harmonise asylum law make this very clear."
"Now, with the Schmitt report - for which, by the way, I thank you in my capacity as coordinator of the Greens - we have the first clear stand by the European Parliament, even if a number of sensible proposed amendments - our proposals, which are also recommended by the UNHCR - have been rejected."
"Mr Pirker, I do not see a problem with this - you can reject them again tomorrow."
"One way or another, we shall be voting in favour of Mr Schmitt' s report."
"These are the usual parliamentary rules of play and with them we can all live happily under one roof - that is my assumption."
"Tempus fugit!"
"We must implement the Treaty of Amsterdam by the end of 2004."
"There are difficulties at hand though."
"The national states are often not prepared as yet to support European rules."
"But this should not divert us from our purpose."
"Mr Schmitt' s report goes in the right direction and calls on the Commission to take specific steps by proposing legislation."
"I hope that we will be able to persuade the Member States of the merits of our approach."
"Mr President, the Schmitt report draws Parliament' s attention to the extremely topical issue of defining clear, common standards governing the right to asylum. This is necessary not only for legal and administrative reasons but also and especially in order to uphold the dignity of asylum seekers."
"Clear, well-defined rules governing the matter are also necessary in order to avoid the right to asylum being confused with the problem of immigration."
"I used the word 'problem' intentionally, for the very reason that the absence of an adequate immigration policy has meant that our citizens often perceive all forms of immigration as a problem, a burden and even a hazard, instead of as a social and economic resource and a source of cultural enrichment."
"In Italy, for example, unregulated or, even worse, illegal immigration is related to organised crime."
"In this confusion where illegal activity is ever increasing there are no rules and no certainties. In particular, the human rights of neither European citizens nor immigrants are genuinely being upheld."
"It is therefore urgent for us to define an immigration policy, and therefore also a reception policy and a migration flow control policy, a policy which takes into practical account the genuine existence of social phenomena and which refuses to be conditioned by ideologies."
"This is the framework within which the right to asylum must take its place: it is a sacrosanct right which every self-respecting civil society must uphold."
"This paper from the Commission paves the way for a drastic extension to the opportunities for implementing binding EU legislation."
"It is a leap forward in the development of the Union, and that is what is behind my wishing to remind you of a simple fact, namely that the root cause of the asylum problem is social breakdown in countries in the vicinity of the EU."
"East, and especially south, of the EU' s borders, an increasing majority of people live in a sea of social destitution and political oppression, and it is that which triggers the asylum problem."
"The EU is the region' s superpower - economically, politically and militarily."
"Political breakdown in neighbouring countries in the Balkans and in North Africa is the EU' s responsibility."
"It is not just a question of passivity and sins of omission."
"It is a question of the EU and the Member States having, by virtue of economic hegemony, political dominance and military power, contributed actively to the forms of social breakdown that turn our fellow human beings into refugees."
"Do the EU' s institutions and Member States now want to change these basic conditions?"
"No, for these are the EU' s very rationale."
"Is the main message of the Commission' s working document and of the report we have before us that there is a willingness to do something about the core problem?"
"No."
"Nor are Christian love of neighbour and human solicitude, or even just general decency, the pivotal factors."
"This document is another building block - and an important one - in that Fortress Europe we are constructing with all the means at our disposal to keep our wretched neighbours out in the cold."
"It is not a question of our being obliged to guarantee legal rights to our fellow human beings."
"Rather, we ought to be exercising justice in the sense of sharing the burden fairly, with the rich countries giving in accordance with their abilities."
"We should not regard refugees as interested parties. Moreover, the flow of refugees is limited."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would firstly like to acknowledge Mr Schulz."
"I would like to say to you, Mr Schulz, from the bottom of my heart, something which I would like somebody one day to say about me: you have been a good adversary, that is to say, a hard adversary, always frank, forceful, often discomforting and there is no doubt that we will miss you."
"Mr President, allow me now to come to the point and say that this seems to me to be an important Commission document because it genuinely launches a debate which many previous documents pointed to, in particular the Tampere conclusions, but the content of which needed to be clarified."
"There is, without doubt, a great need to clarify the existing differences between the asylum procedure, reception conditions, the interpretation of the definition of a refugee, the links between that asylum procedure and the 'Dublin mechanism' procedures and other forms of protection and, in this respect, this document perfectly focuses the debate."
"I am not going to mention all of the points highlighted by the other speakers, but I would like to insist on two points in particular."
"Firstly, I believe that the Commission correctly relates the issues concerning asylum procedures, the object of a future directive, to the Dublin Convention procedure and the notion of a safe third country."
"I must say in this regard that I have put forward an amendment which is against the system of lists."
"It is problem of method."
"Fiji was a secure country until a few days ago, and overnight it ceased to be one."
"If we employ a system of closed lists, difficulties will arise in terms of keeping the lists up to date, which would cause enormous harm."
"The other amendment which I have signed concerns the distribution of burdens."
"We are all aware that the principle of solidarity requires a distribution of the consequences stemming from the current asymmetry in requests for asylum."
"Firstly, we must say that if we achieve harmonised asylum procedures, the level of requests will also tend to become more homogenised."
"Secondly, I would like to say that this report has one virtue which I would like to highlight amongst others - although I have been critical on some points - and that is that it very much insists on legal certainty, on judicial safeguards, on the asylum seeker' s right to defence and, in particular, on everything contained in point 4 and, of course, on everything relating to legal assistance, with the possibility of making contact with NGOs and the UNHCR."
"Evidently, this fits in very badly with the measures on distribution by quotas which have an image which is closely connected to deportation."
"Therefore, Mr President, I hope that certain groups, and in particular the PPE Group, will reconsider this amendment, which takes up the amendment of the Group of the Greens precisely."
"In other words, it is not an amendment of a conservative or any other origin, nor of any particular geographical origin."
"It takes up an amendment of the Group of the Greens which was not approved in committee and I believe it should receive the support of the House."
"Mr President, now we have heard words of praise, we Greens, but we have also been attacked slightly."
"Perhaps you are right to attack us, Mr Pirker, when we think slightly beyond what is planned here in this document."
"For example, with regard to access to the labour market. However, a fellow member in your group, if I remember correctly, our new Home Secretary, expressed a similar thought once."
"We are also concerned here about the independence of asylum seekers and about social realities."
"Mr Schulz has reproached us Greens on the same count."
"As I said, perhaps you are right, but if we are talking about the individual right to asylum, then this also implies that there must be an individual examination in special cases."
"That also forms part of the legal framework."
"We cannot just evince an interest in what happens within the EU and consider that we have nothing more to do with what becomes of an applicant outside the EU."
"It is no longer our sovereign territory, which is why this one proposed amendment is highly important and significant, precisely in order to ensure that there is no risk of persecution in the land of origin for rejected asylum seekers present on EU sovereign territory and that asylum seekers enjoy effective protection against refoulement in the third country to which they are deported."
"That is the responsibility which we simply wish to accept in engaging in this debate, a debate which - and here you are right - needs further discussion and needs to be examined in much, much greater detail."
"We have made a start, a good start and must progress hand in hand."
"I shall be pleased if we progress by so much as a millimetre."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his excellent report and on his suggestions for rationalising the Commission' s proposals."
"The disappearance of internal borders and the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice require us to make an effort to harmonise our asylum and immigration policies and to reinforce checks at external borders."
"As has already been said, if we are to address this problem seriously we must establish a clear distinction between the entry of asylum-seekers, within the meaning of the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees, the entry of migrants for economic or other reasons and the temporary reception of refugees from regions in crisis. These are all different situations which must be treated differently."
"The applications for asylum are not distributed evenly, as Mr Pirker pointed out. There is clearly a disproportion in the number of asylum applications being recorded in each Member State."
"This disproportion is bad for the European Union as a whole because it creates inequalities between Member States."
"The procedures for granting legal refugee status and the conditions for assessing applications must therefore be harmonised so that these are equivalent in terms of the level of protection of asylum-seekers. A cost-sharing policy must also be established."
"Solidarity must be for all."
"It is essential that common rules are adopted on the reception of asylum-seekers, on the requirements to be met in order to obtain refugee status and on the process of granting or refusing this status. In particular these rules must prevent asylum applications being made simultaneously in several Member States."
"Mr President, today marks the beginning of the second year of our mandate as Members of the European Parliament."
"I hope that the next four years will be better and more fruitful for all of us."
"I would, however, say that we have started our second year of parliamentary activity on an upbeat by discussing and - tomorrow, I believe - adopting this major initiative on the definition of common standards on asylum procedures."
"There is nothing more European than this, and I therefore welcome Mr Schmitt' s report. I support the report and agree with every word it contains."
"A pensioner who, as a member of the Pensioners' Party, always comes to see me off at Bergamo airport when I come to Strasbourg, said to me: ""Yes, I agree."
"It is right for refugees and those who have been persecuted who have to flee from their own land to be granted asylum, but I live on ITL 700 000 a month which is a day and a half of your travel allowance."
"Who is going to help me?"
"I would be willing to help and even accommodate asylum seekers."""
"And I replied, ""Do not worry. You will see that the Commission will also use those who do not have work who are admitted into our country to help elderly people who are not self-sufficient and who need help."""
"In addition to this, I would argue that it is right for the burden of providing asylum to be divided, at last, between all 15 Member States of the European Union."
"I hope that the Commission will bring this about, starting with the events in Kosovo, so that the States which bore the brunt of providing asylum for Kosovars will be reimbursed by all the other States."
"Mr President, having seen over the years very difficult discussions in Parliament relating to this subject, it is indeed a pleasure for me this evening to see such widespread support for this report."
"The sense of consensus is to be welcomed."
"It is a good working document and we have a good basis to start working, so I congratulate the Commission as well."
"I feel slightly uncomfortable, given that Ireland is the home of the Dublin Convention and has only very recently begun to receive an appreciable number of refugees and asylum seekers, that unfortunately, the Dublin Convention is not working terribly well."
"About 85% of the people arriving in Ireland have not been stopped at the original port of call or processed in the country in which they originally arrived in the Community."
"While I can fully appreciate and have great sympathy with the concerns of colleagues calling for burden-sharing, there is a fairly large amount of informal burden-sharing going on anyway."
"Reception countries are happily turning a blind eye to the people passing through their countries on the way to third countries."
"Having said that, I believe very strongly that we need to harmonise legal procedures so that we can offer a safe haven to those many people seeking refuge in the Community and also so as to have a humane and caring reception procedure that is uniform throughout the Community."
"Because of the work I have been doing in this particular area I am very concerned about the criminal activities of some asylum seekers who are exploiting members of their own communities, through trafficking in women and young people."
"Cooperation between police forces, where there is widespread information on prostitution amongst young girls in the Member States, has unfortunately to be an intrinsic part of our asylum policy."
"What is clear, particularly in my own country at the moment, is that we must challenge the alarming rise in racism and xenophobia within our communities."
"It is a deeply disturbing phenomenon in my own country."
"We need clear implementation of good, humane laws and we will all benefit from them."
"I thank Parliament for the support that has been expressed for this communication."
"I especially congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Schmitt and Mrs Echerer, for their excellent reports."
"I would ask you to convey my good wishes to Mr Schulz, who is no longer here."
"I am sure he will come back to this debate, if not for functional duties, out of enthusiasm."
"The Commission has now received reactions on this working document from several Member States, from numerous NGOs, and with the report of Parliament, will be in a position to fulfil one of the commitments of the scoreboard, which is to present a directive on minimum standards for asylum procedures."
"It is my intention to present this proposal for a directive in the autumn of 2000."
"I should like to remind the House that the Commission proposed to the Tampere European Council to adopt a single European asylum system."
"But the decision of the European Council in Tampere was to endorse an approach based on minimum common standards."
"So the directive is, in my opinion, the most relevant instrument to address these minimum standards for asylum procedures which will have to reflect the cornerstones of the policy of the European Union with regard to asylum as was underscored by the European Council in Tampere: an absolute respect for the right to seek asylum, a full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and maintaining the principle of non-refoulement."
"The Commission welcomes the approach the European Parliament has taken in many parts of the motion for a resolution."
"The Commission endorses the recital calling for asylum policy to be conducted on as factual a basis as possible."
"We fully agree with Parliament that common standards of asylum procedures should not be based solely on the premise that administrative and judicial activities have to be expedited but should likewise be informed by the need to preserve the dignity of asylum seekers."
"We have to recognise that finding a balanced solution between simplifying the procedures on the one hand and guaranteeing legal certainty and respect for the rights of asylum seekers on the other hand is not an easy task."
"But we are determined to come up with a solution that can be considered with a broad consensus as a balanced solution."
"The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that entry of asylum seekers, migration for economic or other reasons and temporary admittance of displaced persons and refugees in the event of a mass influx must be treated as entirely separate matters."
"The resolution calls for temporary protection within three years."
"On 24 May 2000 the Commission adopted a directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of effort between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof."
"We have already sent such a proposal for consultation with the European Parliament."
"I should like to say that this proposal on temporary protection addresses explicitly the question raised by several speakers on burden-sharing as we have adopted an approach on burden-sharing on the proposal we have already submitted to the Council for a European fund for refugees."
"So I should like to stress that this proposal cannot be seen as separate from the other proposals that are already on the table and that they take into account the sensitive question of solidarity among Member States."
"I should like to remind the House that with regard to asylum, the scoreboard that has been submitted reflects the conclusions at the Tampere Summit where a two-stage approach was adopted by the Heads of State and Government."
"The first step consists of harmonising standards relating to asylum and protection, and the second step is the introduction of a common asylum procedure as such."
"To achieve the first step, the Commission will not only come up with a proposal for a directive on common standards for fair and efficient asylum procedures, which we are now discussing, but will also bring forward, inter alia and as soon as possible, proposals on the determination of the state responsible for the examination of an application and on common minimum conditions for reception of asylum seekers."
"I should like to remind the House that, as I have already said, we have already put forward for consultation by Member States a working document that aims to replace the Dublin Convention by a Community regulation, having in mind the concrete experience and the vulnerabilities and deficiencies that have arisen in the application of the Dublin Convention."
"With regard to the second step, the Tampere conclusions invited the Commission to come forward with a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those who are granted asylum valid throughout the Union."
"It is my intention that by the end of the year 2000 this communication will be brought forward."
"The Commission notes - as has been emphasised by several speakers - that the European Parliament has taken a general position on rationalising Community law on asylum matters in this resolution."
"The Commission will not only study the resolution very carefully in order to prepare its proposal for a directive on common standards on asylum procedures - that I reiterate will be presented in the autumn of this year - but will also reflect on them whilst preparing the communication it will put forward by the end of this year on a common asylum procedure in the long term."
"I sincerely feel encouraged by the fact that this communication has such broad support in the House."
"With such commitment, both from the Commission and Parliament, I sincerely hope we will succeed."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Crime victims in the EU"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0126/2000) by Mrs Sörensen, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on crime victims in the European Union - Reflections on standards and actions [COM(1999) 349 - C5-0119/1999 - 1999/2122(COS)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this communication, the Commission has certainly demonstrated its willingness to make a tangible contribution towards improving the position of crime victims."
"It points out that within an area of freedom, justice and security within the European Union, citizens must be entitled to effective legal protection."
"The Commission would also like to launch a discussion on the treatment of victims and would like to see measures taken to improve their plight."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs feels that a number of the proposed measures are too dependent on the goodwill of individual Member States and it calls for rules at a European level."
"Why is this so necessary?"
"There are countless examples known to us of how victims have been treated in recent years: child abductions, in which case the parents and relatives are also the victims, victims of terrorist attacks, victims of organised crime, break-ins, robberies and the like, stalking, not to mention intimidation."
"But victims must not suffer twice: firstly from a crime and secondly from the system."
"There is a need for clarity concerning the rights of victims and for transparency concerning their status."
"The measures proposed in the Commission communication appear to be geared exclusively towards victims from one Member State in another Member State, or third country victims legally resident in one Member State in another Member State."
"However, the package of measures should also take account of Member State victims in third countries and third country citizens illegally resident in a Member State."
"The status of a victim should not have any effect on his rights or on the possibility of acquiring such rights."
"In the context of the enlargement of the European Union, particular attention should be paid to the treatment of victims from the candidate countries."
"Since they are concerned with both civil and criminal procedures, the Treaties provide the European Union with instruments for increasing the protection of crime victims on its territory."
"It is regrettable, however, that the unanimity rule currently applies."
"The scoreboard submitted by the Commission for reviewing progress in implementing the area of liberty, security and justice should be modified in such a way as to guarantee and speed up the legislative follow-up to the present directive."
"It is disturbing, however, that the measures concerned with aid to crime victims are not intended to come into effect until 2004 in this scoreboard."
"We cannot let victims wait for that long."
"By providing measures in 2001, victims will at long last be able to look forward to fair treatment."
"After all, treating victims with understanding and dignity also plays a preventive role."
"The proper treatment of victims will help destigmatise them and enhance their emblematic role."
"When granting aid to victims, it is important not only to provide financial and legal assistance, but also to take measures first of all in the field of anonymity, privacy and safety of the victims, as well as in connection with the religious and cultural aspects, and to provide medical, psychological and social assistance. In addition, it is important to recognise the family of the victim as fellow victims and as witnesses, and to recognise the right to be assisted by an interpreter and to be questioned in the mother tongue."
"A special system should also be set up for the legal, psychological and physical protection of victims of domestic violence, stalking and genital mutilation."
"In particular, additional measures are required for minors."
"For this purpose, specially equipped rooms need to be provided where the questioning of minors can be registered on video, so that they are not obliged to be confronted more than once with a traumatic experience."
"It must immediately be possible to provide the victim with material, medical, psychological and social assistance which is free of charge at the time of being offered."
"Victims should also be informed of the availability of the various forms of assistance."
"It is extremely important that, depending on the nature of the crime, specialist assistance is provided."
"In this context, it is important to do away with a number of prejudices: some forms of crime are regarded more seriously in some countries than in others."
"There is also evidence of a discriminatory response to victims reporting crime."
"Member States should be obliged to set up special police units for crime victims."
"I would also draw attention to the importance of a legal basis for, and harmonisation of, the measures for protecting victims."
"The study carried out under the Grotius programme by An Wergens provides the requisite basic information."
"The useful experience available in respect of existing measures in certain Member States can play an important role in harmonising measures or drawing up a common package of measures."
"An initiative of this kind is a first step towards crime prevention."
"But given the fact that organised, cross-border crime is on the increase, the initiative should culminate in a common prevention programme on a European and international scale."
"Finally, pending the introduction of a harmonised instrument for cross-border protection of victims, the Member States themselves and the candidate countries, in conjunction with NGOs, will need to enhance the protection of victims."
"It is also important to assess safety aspects in urban development and spatial planning in order to prevent crimes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentleman who have been so patient."
"Talking about strengthening the position of crime victims is like relating a story with a happy ending."
"From the beginning, we met palpable resistance from many quarters, but now most people agree that this is something important and commendable."
"This applies to all the European institutions."
"We need to focus upon the victims' perspective and upon strengthening their rights in the Union."
"People who make use of their freedom of movement should not have to be exposed to crime."
"If they do in fact become crime victims, they should at least not have to suffer twice and end up in a worse situation than citizens of the country concerned who are themselves crime victims. This applies irrespective of what the particular crime might be."
"The position of crime victims ought therefore to be strengthened on a number of levels."
"One can hardly talk about strengthening the position of crime victims without also talking about crime prevention measures."
"In November 1997, Parliament took the initiative and requested an action plan regarding preventive measures."
"An action plan of this kind was adopted by the Council in December 1998."
"These questions were highlighted again in Tampere in the autumn of 1999."
"We have embarked upon a new process."
"The best way of helping crime victims is, in fact, to ensure that no crimes are committed, but that cannot always be done in practice."
"The best way of preventing crime is to disseminate information."
"To be able to devise an effective crime prevention strategy, we need in fact to know what we are talking about."
"For example, there are still no definitions of the concepts of crime victim and organised crime."
"In addition to introducing crime prevention measures, the position of crime victims must be strengthened in more concrete terms once crimes have actually been committed."
"It is partly a question of making people more aware."
"Crime victims ought also to know to what rights and possible forms of aid they are in fact entitled."
"Most Member States have services which provide crime victims with some form of first aid."
"Travellers may, sometimes more than the local population, require various forms of specific aid."
"This may take the form of special measures including help with language and translations, as well as psychological help."
"The police, social services and non-governmental organisations of various kinds will, of course, be involved in providing these forms of aid."
"European cooperation has, in actual fact, already been devised and is in the process of development."
"In particular, the European Forum for Victim Services has developed sound guidelines relating to the position of crime victims."
"The Commission' s proposal involves introducing minimum standards for receiving crime victims with a view to being able to provide them with information and support where necessary."
"This is excellent."
"The police will play an important role because they are the point of first contact, and special training is often required in this connection."
"It is difficult for foreign crime victims to follow the legal proceedings at a distance, which is why special measures are also required to guarantee the legal position of foreign crime victims."
"Discussion of this issue began in the Commission during the last session under Commissioner Gradin of Sweden."
"The issue will be taken up again under the Swedish Presidency."
"In actual fact, this is, in a way, a story with a happy ending because there is quite a lot of agreement as to the objectives."
"Thinking European is often the same as moving Europe forward."
"In this case, we have common interests across party divides and national frontiers."
"There ought, therefore, to be good opportunities to think European."
"I therefore welcome the Commission' s communication and I want quite especially, of course, to thank Mrs Sörensen for her work on this report - a report we fully support."
"We shall then wish to urge the Commission to come back with directives."
"We hope for concrete action in the future."
"The necessary conditions are broadly present."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when these issues are addressed, the public authorities are usually more concerned about the aspects of dissuasion and security, crime prevention, approval of penal frameworks and action by police forces and the legal apparatus."
"However, it is also essential that we consider the people most affected by crime: its victims."
"Whoever they are, we cannot allow them to become a double victim, firstly of the crime and then of the system."
"Adequate protection must be guaranteed for crime victims within our Union and it is essential that equal treatment for these victims is also guaranteed, whether in court or before the authorities. Active means of support must also be developed."
"The personal dignity of the victim must be respected and their safety, privacy and family must be protected given that this Union which we are gradually building is based on respect for rights and freedoms, guarantees of safety for people and their property and effective legal protection. In other words, this is a Union based on the values which characterise contemporary democracies."
"We therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative which is clearly compatible with the effort to create an area of freedom, security and justice. It is essential that there are minimum rules on the protection of crime victims which ensure, throughout the European Union, an adequate level of legal assistance in cross-border proceedings."
"This is particularly important on issues such as access to justice, protection and effective application of the rights of victims in proceedings or their right to participate, receive the necessary aid, obtain and provide information, understand and be understood and so on. Victims must also have the right to compensation for damages, including court costs."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"It is an important area and she has rightly drawn attention to it."
"It refers to the new powers of the Community over the last few years: rights of asylum, immigration and general cooperation in civil matters."
"It is therefore crucial that we use these powers to improve the position of victims of crime."
"At the time of the crime, especially personal, physical or violent crime, many victims, if not all, will be vulnerable, distressed, upset, probably angry, and desperately in need of support."
"As the rapporteur has said, they do not need to become victims again."
"Nor do they need to feel that they are being branded almost as criminals themselves."
"We need to ensure - and this report goes a long way towards it - that the procedures do not negate the situation or make it worse, but rather, that they support and assist the victims."
"The rapporteur has said that we also need to make certain that safeguards are in place so that there is no intrusion into the privacy of victims."
"We must in particular draw attention to intrusion or possible intrusion by the press."
"I am particularly pleased that this report includes support in the language or dialect of the victim of crime because sometimes that is an area that is overlooked."
"Likewise the necessity for training of police officers and others in authority."
"Ethnic minorities, very often women, children - those who sometimes find the system difficult - will be the ones who are most at risk in this sort of situation."
"Those who perhaps are in fear of authority are especially vulnerable."
"The PSE Group is pleased to support this report and to congratulate the rapporteur."
"However, there will be no surprise that we will reject those amendments that have been put down in the name of certain members of the TDI Group."
"Those amendments do not improve the report; rather they are a crude attempt to add the biased, distorted and racist sentiment of the signatories concerned."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her work."
"I congratulate the Commission on bringing this forward, and I wish it every success in the future."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I should like to welcome this report and to thank Mrs Sörensen for her excellent work in drawing up such an important document."
"I welcome the underlying Commission communication, but I would say, on behalf of my Group, that we regret that this communication was not much stronger."
"It is quite clear that the Treaties provide the Union with the instruments that are necessary to strengthen protection of the victims of crime."
"I think, for example, of some of the conclusions of the Wergens report, and we would have expected more from the Commission than proposals for greater dialogue and the exchange of best practice."
"We need clear measures to help victims with access to assistance, justice and compensation."
"However, it must be said that if we feel the Commission could do more, the biggest problem is by far the Member States."
"It seems to us incredible that seven Member States have still not ratified the 1983 Convention on compensation for victims of violent crime and that standards of justice are still so low in so many Member States."
"Let me give just one brief example from my own constituency."
"Mr Pike, a lorry driver in my constituency, was recently assaulted by his employer in the Netherlands."
"Mr Pike is not a wealthy man and the cost of legal redress is high."
"He does not have access to legal aid in Britain because he has to employ a lawyer in the Netherlands to help him."
"He does not have access to legal aid in the Netherlands."
"He is unable to secure any compensation or, indeed, any justice for the injuries he has suffered."
"Unless we are able as a Union to help in relatively clear and simple situations like this, our citizens will not have confidence in the single market and will not feel part of the European Union."
"I hope that we can take up some of the ideas put forward in this report to improve their situation."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Patsy Sörensen, for the care and accuracy of her report."
"On the other hand, I would like to focus my attention on the presentation of various amendments to the draft text which include people affected by terrorism as the victims of crime in the EU."
"I completely agree with this, as well as the fact that certain groups use violence to try to impose their ideals."
"What I believe, Mr President, is that when we speak of imposing ideals, and of victims, we should not only refer to terrorist organisations, of which there are too many and which must cease to exist in a democracy such as the one we want for Europe."
"In this respect, we must also reject and condemn the impositions and violence sometimes exercised by bodies and apparatus of the states, as in the case of GAL and other previous cases in Spain."
"Democratic justice must apply to all without exception, and moral reparations and material, medical, psychological and social aid etc. must reach all the victims of terrorism without exception, including, of course, the victims of the above-mentioned state-sponsored groups."
"Only in this way, acting fairly, will we achieve a Europe which lives in peace and prosperity, which is the founding aim of our Community and I believe that this is still our greatest aspiration."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her valuable work."
"The Commission has tackled a very important issue in its communiqué."
"The question of more effective help for the victims of crime will not be solved merely by improved legislation."
"We can only make permanent improvements through combined, broad-based dialogue on the part of NGOs and the national authorities."
"Compared to the authorities, NGOs often, in practice, have more flexible and versatile approaches to problem solving."
"For example, Internet-based info-banks and service telephones provided through voluntary work could be developed in parallel with the services provided by the authorities."
"The rigid nature of the courts and especially the high costs involved often prevent victims of crime from discovering their rights."
"The situation is in untenable conflict with EU principles of the rule of law."
"People have to enjoy true justice without having to pay for it."
"The minimum level of legal protection in the Member States of the EU must not be allowed to slip to that which exists in the United States."
"The EU and its Member States must also ensure that the victims of crime do not have to suffer twice over for the wrong done them."
"In particular, when it comes to organised crime, many victims forsake the opportunity to go to trial as a result of pressures or for fear of vengeance."
"EU Member States must develop more effective cooperation among the authorities in post-trial situations, for example, in the areas of plaintiff and witness protection programmes."
"The added value of Europol in this process must also be investigated carefully."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission communication on victims of crime in the European Union, since it studies the process of creating common policies, as well as greater cooperation between the Member States at a time when we are all aware, including this Parliament of course, of the need for this type of communitisation."
"Bearing in mind the enormous number of citizens of the European Union who suffer as a result of crime and, in particular, terrorism, I welcome this report which we are debating today since it contains certain points which, in my view, are particularly noteworthy."
"One is the sensitivity it shows by specifically highlighting the fact that there are certain social groups - women, children, immigrants, homosexuals - who are more vulnerable than the rest of the population, as well as the fact that there are also certain sectors who, ignoring the most basic democratic principles, prefer to use violence to impose their objectives."
"We must start by achieving a common definition of the concept of the victim to include families and dependants, since they also suffer the consequences of crime."
"On the other hand, I also fully share the opinion that everybody resident in the Union should be clearly included, so that they may be subject to all the different measures that we are debating today, regardless of their status."
"Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the adoption of the proposed measures is to be postponed until 2004, since I believe that they must be adopted as soon as possible."
"From another point of view and bearing in mind the ever increasing importance and influence of the media in our society, special attention should be paid to the way in which the media deal with the reality of these people, which is not always respectful of individual rights, above all when we are talking about minors, whether they be victims or delinquents."
"With regard to these people it is also necessary to apply certain measures so that they can rebuild their lives correctly, not only from an economic point of view, but also through psychological, legal, medical and social assistance."
"To sum up, they should be guaranteed full protection and, for that purpose, I am convinced that it is absolutely essential to cooperate with the NGOs and associations in the sector in every Member State."
"I must finally stress my deep concern about the need to pay due attention to the victims of terrorism, since these are people who suffer from a very serious and specific form of crime which, unfortunately, does not only take place in my country, Spain, and which threatens democratic coexistence and freedom."
"Mr President, as the Commission says in the introduction to its communication, we cannot seriously speak of a citizens' Europe without dealing with the rights of victims."
"I would like to express my agreement with what has been said by other speakers about the hope that the Commission will be more ambitious than it has been in this communication."
"I also urge it be ambitious."
"Please allow me, Mr President, to focus on the problem of the victims of terrorism."
"I must begin by expressing my regret at the fact that a certain Member who spoke previously gave the impression that he reluctantly accepted the importance of the victims of terrorism, and then straight away focussed on other issues."
"However, I would like to highlight the importance of this report and Mrs Sörensen' s cooperation."
"This is a balanced report which has been sensitive to the victims of terrorism, because if there are three groups of victims which must receive our special attention, they are, as the Treaty says, victims of trafficking in human beings, victims of crime against children and victims of terrorism."
"I must therefore congratulate Mrs Sörensen, since she has hit the nail on the head by stressing that certain groups need specific attention."
"We must not forget that complete attention must involve psychological attention."
"This complete attention must also involve the consideration of family relatives as also being victims."
"This is especially true in the case of terrorism."
"Therefore, Mr President, I believe that this is a step which we hope will encourage the Commission to implement, with the Treaty of Amsterdam in their hands, more ambitious measures in this area. This, as the Commission says very clearly, is an obligation for all of us if we want to be able to speak proudly of a citizens' Europe."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I should just like to say, if you do not mind, that I could be tempted to take bets on what language you use to address Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12 noon."
"Late payment in commercial transactions"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0154/2000) by Mr Murphy, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions (C5-0225/2000 - 1998/0099(COD))"
"Mr President, unfortunately Mr Murphy cannot be here with us this evening and I therefore have the honour of representing him here today."
"However, I am at a disadvantage."
"I was not involved in the work of the conciliation committee, although I have studied the documents."
"So please forgive me if I am not quite as well informed as the members who helped in the conciliation procedure."
"I should like to thank those members because, even as someone who was not involved, I can say that this is an important directive."
"It is important to SMEs, it is important to the public sector, it is probably a far more important instrument for promoting employment than many of the resolutions passed here in this House."
"I can still remember the earlier debates: late payments are a breach of contract and this directive stipulates that the purchaser must pay the vendor the full sum owed within 30 days of receipt of the goods."
"Otherwise, he must pay a penalty in the form of interest etc. Discussions with the Council gave rise to a whole series of problems which we have now managed to settle, several sittings later."
"One of the main problems was the question of retention of title, whereby the vendor retains ownership of the goods pending full payment."
"It was also agreed that freedom of contract cannot be invoked in order to limit the effects of the so-called anti-abuse clause. We have agreed on a clear regulation here which ensures that the debtor cannot procure additional liquidity or additional advantages at the creditor' s expense."
"In addition - and this was an important point - the principle of equal treatment between the public and private sectors has been acknowledged."
"As far as interest is concerned, we have compromised between the 6% proposed by Council and the 8% proposed by Parliament, agreeing in the conciliation procedure on 7%."
"All in all, it is a reasonable result and, I repeat, it is a result which will mainly help SMEs in the Union."
"I personally was most surprised to read that late payments were one of the main reasons for bankruptcies in Europe."
"Apparently some 450,000 jobs are lost in the EU every year as a result."
"We often spend a great deal of money on very few jobs."
"Here we are achieving the desired effect cost-free, as it were, and I think that Parliament should make it clear to the outside world that it has done job security a huge service."
"Allow me to close with one more comment regarding the Commission."
"Late payments are a breach of contract even when it is the Commission which is late paying."
"This does not figure in the directive but, in my experience as an MEP, we often hear complaints when we visit SMEs and large companies alike, that the Commission is often far too late honouring the payment commitments which it has entered into in research promotion or other areas."
"I hope that the Commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive and make its own payments on time, because here too, I repeat, this is breach of contract."
"My warmest thanks once again to everyone involved and I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow."
"Mr President, about four or five years ago, former Commissioner Christos Papoutsis told me at a meeting that he was considering some sort of attempt to regulate late payments."
"I smiled and told him that I wished such a thing were possible, because it would be a relief to millions of SMEs, but that I thought it would be extremely difficult."
"I am pleased that we now have before us a directive making that wish come true."
"We have heard and we know what it costs SMEs, what it costs the European economy, what it costs workers when certain companies, which can and do throw their financial and purchasing weight around, or public sectors which can and do throw their weight around, acquire extra liquidity free of charge, at no cost to them, but at the expense, mainly, of SMEs."
"Approximately half a million workers lost their jobs and one in four companies went bust because bigger and stronger companies got away with not paying them on time."
"Today marks the beginning of a new era, an era which will, of course, dawn in two years' time, once this directive, which gives SMEs different prospects for a different future, has been transposed into national legislation."
"It gives them reason to believe that they too have the power to trade in a fair competitive environment, an environment which has been missing all these years, an environment which the SMEs of the European Union have been trying in vain to achieve."
"Have you any idea how soul-destroying it is when a small businessman, with limited access to bank loans, is expected to subsidise companies with a far bigger cash flow or the huge public sector of a country?"
"It is a bitter pill to swallow."
"What I can say is that the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council were a most pleasant experience."
"Of course, I can say now that it was a pleasant experience because the outcome has been extremely positive for Parliament."
"And it would be no exaggeration to say that Parliament was the institution of the European Union which understood exactly where the interests of European society and European business lie, which is why we used all our arguments and exerted all our pressure to persuade the Council that all the European Parliament' s proposed amendments went in the right direction."
"And, of course, I must thank the SMEs and Parliament and the Executive Commission, which also helped to achieve this result, and it is a good result."
"Finally, I should like to close by saying that every SME in the European Union and millions of workers in small- and medium-sized commercial, handicraft and professional companies in the European Union will look towards us tomorrow, towards the plenary of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in the belief that a new day has dawned for them."
"Mr President, I have already received many reactions from within the SME world to the text that we will be adopting tomorrow and, partly on behalf of all these SMEs, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work."
"I hope that Mr Linkohr will pass on these congratulations to Mr Murphy."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for its cooperation, which has been as constructive as ever."
"We should be proud of the common text which we will be adopting tomorrow and which we were able to adopt in the Conciliation Committee."
"It is regulating what should be regulated."
"Nothing more, nothing less."
"It is also regulating matters to the extent that they need to be regulated at European level. Again, nothing more, nothing less."
"And it is regulating matters in a legally well-organised way."
"We can defend it perfectly from all angles, both with regard to transactions between traders and transactions between traders and the government."
"Mr President, as early as in 1993 - at the very outset of the internal market - we, together with Parliament, asked the Commission to submit a proposal to regulate late payments."
"Initially, the Commission' s reaction was low-key, in the form of a recommendation. It subsequently took a tougher line with a proposal for binding rules."
"It took all of us two years to make the political choices and to formulate them in a technically correct manner."
"We have now provided the framework; all that is left now is the transposition."
"The Member States have been given two years to do this in."
"Let us hope, together with the thousands of SMEs in whose interest it is for the Member States to respect the transposition period, that our Member States act more swiftly."
"In fact, let us encourage them to do so."
"As far as I am concerned, a European Cup should go to the Member State which manages to finish its homework first."
"I have another question for the Commission."
"I should like to have known whether it plans to formulate proposals on conditions for setting up debt-collecting agencies, which is one of the issues which we discussed for a long time in the course of the preliminary work but which we left out of this directive for a good reason."
"My question is whether the Commission is planning to make proposals in this respect at a later stage and, if so, when?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this directive is, without doubt, the most important directive for the small and family-run businesses of Europe."
"A good day' s work deserves a good day' s pay."
"But some have had to wait for it longer than others."
"The stronger the partner, the more power he has to make a business wait."
"Here, for the first time, we have a regulation which ensures that the company' s liquidity is secured once the service has been provided, and within a foreseeable period of time."
"I am delighted that we are debating today in the small circle, because you can see that this directive is totally uncontested and that the European Parliament stands fully behind this directive."
"We know that some 450,000 jobs are lost every year as the result of late payments."
"When we talk about job security and job creation, then we have a very important and crucial directive here which helps us to secure 450,000 jobs a year in Europe."
"That deserves the headlines in the press but, as you know, the fight for jobs is already taken for granted."
"I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is making such an important contribution to this."
"This initiative was intensively promoted to start with by Marianne Thyssen, Mr Folias and Mr Murphy and we are proud of such an excellent result in the House. Payment within 30 days, precautions to ensure that payments are actually made and that the company receives the money within 90 days."
"It is a sensational result."
"Congratulations!"
"I am proud to be a member of this Parliament."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating everyone who has been involved in the creation of this directive and especially those who have done the hard work of negotiating during the conciliation procedure, which I know has been hard, although I personally have not followed it - I followed the two readings, but not this third reading."
"As the esteemed Member, Mrs Thyssen, has said, this directive deals with what it can and must deal with, no more and no less."
"I believe that this is a magnificent definition."
"The Commission' s initial proposal was much more ambitious, but since we are moving in that pioneer territory of the internal market - that territory which involves elements which are still the competence of the Member States such as procedural rules and civil law, ownership reservations, or Article 5 of the procedure for the recovery of non-contested debt etc...- the Commission' s proposal was not in accordance with the Treaty, since we lacked a legal basis."
"The present proposal is less complete, if you like, but no less effective."
"I believe that it will have significant repercussions, which have been listed by previous speakers."
"Above all, I am going to highlight one more, and that is that it opens up the road to seriously dealing with the need to fully enter into this pioneer territory."
"This is because, today, there are still genuine obstacles to the perfection of the internal market, genuine obstacles to the four freedoms laid down in the Treaty, precisely because we do not have a clear legal basis."
"Now, with the Treaty of Amsterdam, we may have a clearer legal basis, but we must make a great effort to establish effective coordination and harmonisation in all of these areas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely does a directive have such wide-reaching social implications as the one we are discussing today."
"It will affect millions of small businesses and millions of individuals who carry on economic activities, even though this may not as yet be apparent."
"In my opinion, the forecast, as it was established at the end of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, is precise and essentially correct."
"A balance has been found which will certainly influence the relations between buyers and sellers significantly."
"It is a measure which facilitates the market, not one which places restrictions on it, although it does lay down rules - for rules are sometimes essential in order to maintain the free market - and it is therefore a positive preventive action which essentially protects the weakest: both those who are weakest financially and those who are weakest socially."
"There are some areas of Europe - including certain areas of Italy, for example - where a very successful company has a substantial, decisive, unambiguous influence on the market, which almost amounts to a monopoly."
"Clearly, this company influences not only prices but also time frames, including settlement periods."
"This is sometimes negative for those who need to work and are forced to have recourse to this company."
"The issue is that of equal conditions for public and private industry, which I see as a positive thing and which will affect, or, rather, will be a positive development for public accounts."
"In fact, you will be aware that public companies settle within a certain period, and this time limit means that it will no longer be possible for private companies who deal with the public sector to impose large, excessive burdens on public companies."
"Consequently, public expenditure will also be reduced."
"Mr President, in one way it is a good thing that the public in the 15 European states does not take too much notice of what we are doing, especially on evenings such as this where you, Mr President, the Commissioner, seven members and roughly the same number of officials must stand by our posts."
"This is an issue which is seemingly unimportant but which in fact affects several million companies - I myself am a small businessman - and tens of millions of consumers."
"There is a proverb in Italian: Non e mai troppo tarde - it is never too late!"
"But it is too late for many small and medium-sized enterprises, family businesses and young entrepreneurs."
"And many companies will not survive the delay before what we will hopefully decide by a large majority tomorrow is actually transposed into law."
"Unfortunately they will no longer be able to take a positive view, as entrepreneurs, of this positive step in the right direction."
"It will help SMEs, bring greater legal certainty and improve property rights; in the final analysis it is an employment programme, providing help for young enterprises and family businesses but also protection for the consumer."
"I think that this aspect cannot be stressed enough."
"All that is left is for me to thank all those involved, who have striven over the years to achieve this result. I hope that the intended beneficiaries will indeed be able to reap the benefits of it as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, the Commission should like to take this opportunity in this debate to congratulate the European Parliament and particularly its rapporteur, Mr Murphy, on the very positive result achieved in the Conciliation Committee. The tough negotiations, as good negotiations always are, have made the adoption of this directive possible."
"I am convinced, and several speakers have underlined this, that this is a particularly important directive for European businesses as it affects all commercial transactions between these businesses and between authorities, in both the public and private sector. In saying this I believe I have responded to a comment made by Mr Linkohr."
"We hope and we are convinced that the directive will have a positive impact on the daily commercial transactions of all businesses, whether these are large multinationals or small and medium-sized undertakings."
"However, it is only right to point out that this type of directive is essentially intended for small and medium-sized undertakings because, given the operating rules of the market, it is these which will gain the most positive benefits from the effectiveness of the directive on late payments."
"I am convinced that we have therefore adopted a legal framework which is simultaneously serious, rigorous and effective."
"The Commission will do everything in its power not only to guarantee the appropriate transposition of this directive into national law during the next two years but also to reassess the late payment situation in the future in view of the actual application of the directive."
"I must conclude by again congratulating Mr Murphy and this House on the decision to be taken."
"Mr President, I had asked the Commission whether it intended to submit a proposal on conditions for the setting up, and mutual recognition of, debt-collecting agencies in Europe."
"I appreciate that this does not fall within the remit of the Commissioner and that he is unable to provide me with an answer right now."
"But I would like to receive a reply in due course, because this issue has been the subject of many a discussion in previous meetings."
"Mr President, given the Cartesian evidence that this is not an issue falling within my area of responsibility, I can only say to the Member that I have noted her question and that, as usual, the Commission will certainly give her a direct answer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)"
"Madam President, the Austrian political scientist and professor, Anton Pelinka, has been prosecuted following a comment he made about Mr Haider."
"Mr Pelinka was member of the committee of the European Observatory for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna."
"According to treaty obligations, he should be receiving support from the Austrian Government, but despite repeated requests, he has received inadequate support in terms of infrastructure."
"In a press release, Mr Schüssel stated that, in the light of these experiences, the treaty stipulations are pitched far too high."
"Mr Pelinka resigned because he felt unsupported by the government and was replaced by a member of one of the parties in government."
"I know that the President has always been very committed to the issue of combating racism and xenophobia."
"I was there when she gave her speech in Vienna to mark the opening of the Observatory."
"We are also responsible for the functioning of the European institutions."
"I would like to ask you whether you are prepared to write a letter or contact the Austrian Government to express your concern about the restriction of the freedom of expression and to point out the obligations which the government has in this respect and which it cannot escape unilaterally."
"Thank you, Mrs Buitenweg."
"We are investigating the matter you have just told us about very carefully."
"Madam President, yesterday, the European Parliament decided by democratic majority no longer to convene in Strasbourg on Fridays."
"You subsequently issued a press release in which you expressed your regret about this."
"You have, of course, every right to do so."
"Everyone has their own personal and political responsibility."
"It is, however, somewhat confusing if the President of the European Parliament expresses regret regarding one of Parliament' s democratic decisions and if she does so on Parliament' s official letter-headed paper, with a reference to the services of Parliament."
"I would ask you not to cause any confusion when you have to carry out your personal responsibilities vis-à-vis your electorate - which is something we all understand - and to do so on your own letter-headed paper."
"Mrs Van der Laan, you will agree that even when entrusted with the office of President of the European Parliament, we remain free politicians."
"I was speaking personally."
"I said that, personally, I regretted that vote, I understood the practical reasons which led to it and, with the Conference of Presidents, I would consider the best way of dealing with that vote, in the interests of this House."
"I do not think I abused my position."
"Madam President, I would like to make you aware of something very inconvenient which happened to me which, in my opinion, undermines the dignity of the Members of this Parliament."
"On Tuesday afternoon, I went to Poland to take part in an international conference."
"At the Görlitz border post, as can happen, the German police expressed doubts as to my identity."
"In order to convince the police and improve the situation I produced my European Parliament pass."
"At this point, the German police thought that the document was a fake and detained me for eight hours until, after intense discussion, the necessary clarification had been obtained."
"I had to spend eight hours under surveillance in a room and I was not allowed to use a telephone."
"It was only after the intervention of the Polish authorities, who, moreover, recognised the validity of the document - and this bodes well for enlargement - that I was allowed to continue my journey."
"I will submit a more detailed description of the incident shortly, but, for the time being, I would be very grateful if you could make the German authorities aware of the problem."
"Border police need to be aware of the existence and function of this document."
"Mr Mauro, what happened to you is totally unacceptable."
"Please let me have a note as soon as possible so that I can take it up with the authorities concerned."
"It is all the more unacceptable because it is clearly stated on that document, that passport, that it must be recognised by the authorities of European Union countries."
"It really is absolutely unacceptable."
"We will try to put an end to it."
"Madam President, the trouble with this pass is that nobody knows about it!"
"We make virtually no use of it at all."
"That is why I think you should remind the authorities once again that this pass is valid within the EU."
"Yesterday, Mrs Karamanou said that she wanted to travel to America on it, which is of course impossible."
"It clearly states in the pass that it is only valid within the European Union."
"But to prevent this sort of thing reoccurring, perhaps the German authorities, and also of the authorities in other countries, should be made aware of its validity."
"Mrs Pack is quite right."
"If we want to prevent such incidents recurring, a teaching initiative in fact needs to be taken, so that everyone knows exactly what it is all about."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I would not want Members of this House to think that I do not have a sense of humour."
"I did refer yesterday to the man or woman dressed as a cigarette packet standing outside this Chamber."
"But I was making a serious point and maybe yesterday it was taken rather too lightheartedly."
"I have a letter from you, Madam President, dated 6 April, in which it was agreed by the College of Quaestors that the area around the Chambers in Brussels and Strasbourg should be regarded as a neutral zone in which demonstrations, exhibitions or similar activities intended to influence Members would not be tolerated."
"You went on to say that you would investigate ways of ensuring that there would be no recurrence."
"I hope that you and the College of Quaestors will take this seriously because it is an encroachment on the right of Members to come to this House and vote freely on issues that their electors have sent them here to debate."
"The jobs of one thousand people in my constituency are now at risk as a result of the decisions that were taken here yesterday."
"Mr Perry, I can assure you that the Quaestors and I will take this very seriously and will take action to prevent a recurrence."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"European Council of 19/20 June 2000"
"The next item is the joint debate on the:"
"Council and Commission Statements - Preparation of the European Council (Santa Maria da Feira, 19-20 June 2000), including the situation in the Middle East"
"oral question (B5-0492/2000) to the Council, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Feira European Council"
"oral question (B5-0493/2000) to the Commission, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Feira European Council."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity."
"This is the third time I have appeared before you in the six months of our Presidency and once again this allows the Council to have a direct dialogue with this House."
"The Portuguese Presidency has always tried to maintain a frank, open and constructive relationship with the European Parliament, both with the plenary and its committees."
"It is in this spirit that I will present our preview of the Feira European Council."
"I will firstly refer to the timetable as it is fixed at the moment. On the morning of the 19th there will be the usual meeting with the President of the European Parliament."
"This will be followed by a session with the Chair of the Convention, Roman Herzog, who is responsible for drawing up the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This will not be a deliberative meeting as the Charter is still being drawn up according to the chosen methodology."
"Instead this will be an exchange of information. This seems necessary at this point so that Mr Herzog can inform the Heads of State and Government about the progress of the Convention' s work in drawing up the Charter and also so that he can ensure that the various Heads of State and Government are up to speed on this issue."
"Clearly this cannot and will not be a deliberative meeting, but simply an exchange of information."
"Immediately after there will be a working session involving the finance ministers. This will address the issues of the follow-up to the Lisbon Special European Council and economic and financial affairs."
"Lunch will be devoted to the Intergovernmental Conference and, in particular, closer cooperation."
"The Council will have to indicate whether or not the latter issue is to be added to the agenda of the IGC."
"The afternoon session will be devoted to the issues of enlargement of the Union, the common European security and defence policy and external relations."
"I would point out that the Presidency invited the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, to join us at this point so that we can also consider the issue of Africa-Europe relations and regional political issues."
"We are delighted that President Mbeki has accepted our invitation, particularly given the importance of South Africa in regional terms and for the European Union and its Member States."
"The next day, the 20th, will be devoted as usual to reviewing the draft presidency conclusions."
"The Council will provide an opportunity to assess the progress achieved during the term of the presidency in areas which we regard as particularly important."
"In doing this, we will try to show the ways in which European integration can continue to be developed, thus enabling to the greatest extent possible the resolution of the many issues which await us in the coming months on the European agenda."
"As there is not enough time now to describe in depth the items to be considered at Feira, I will instead identify some of the issues which we regard as a priority and which deserve our attention."
"The Intergovernmental Conference will come to the European Council through the presentation of a report by the Presidency."
"This report is ready now. It was formally delivered yesterday to the President of the European Parliament and will today be made available on the Internet in all languages for general consultation."
"As you know, this Parliament has followed the work of the Intergovernmental Conference with great interest and cooperation. I must point out that the participation of this House represents a step forward in qualitative terms with regard to all previous intergovernmental conferences on the reform of the institutions and treaties."
"The Presidency' s report basically consists of two parts."
"The first assesses the progress made by the IGC to date and describes the trends emerging from the discussions. The second part contains a series of proposals, lists and tables illustrating the options which the IGC will have in the next six months."
"Using the mandate conferred on us during the Helsinki European Council and after sounding out the Member States, we will be recommending that the issue of closer cooperation is included on the agenda of the IGC."
"I am convinced that based on the work carried out, we will be in a position, with the leadership of the French Presidency, to conclude the IGC before the end of this year as planned."
"As for the development of the common European security and defence policy, again based on the report which we will present to the European Council, I believe that significant progress has been made."
"I would highlight the formation and entry into force of the new political and military bodies and civilian crisis management bodies for the first time in the history of the European Union and also the approval of the rules governing relations between the EU and NATO and between the EU and third countries. The decision taken on the location of all these bodies, in terms of buildings and installations, should also be stressed."
"We have tried to take advantage of our simultaneous presidencies of the European Union and the WEU which has resulted in a clarification of the WEU' s role and the use of its capacities and acquis by the European Union."
"We are now entering a vital phase of this project and we must therefore prepare for the Capability Commitment Conference which will take place in November of this year. Its aim is to create and commit assets and capabilities which will allow us, as planned, to achieve the headline goal."
"Yesterday, in the General Affairs Council, these documents were voted on and approved."
"With regard to enlargement, this presidency launched the negotiations with the Helsinki Group. As we reported yesterday at ministerial level, several chapters have already been concluded, even with this Helsinki Group which is the most recent group."
"We have also made decisive progress with the previous group, the Luxembourg Group, as all the chapters, with the obvious exception of the 'Institutions' chapter, were already open with this group."
"Feira European Council will indicate a renewed commitment not to slacken the negotiating pace, given the agreed principles, and to continue with enlargement as the main historic challenge of the European Union."
"To this end I must stress that we inherited 16 chapters from the Luxembourg group. We have closed 10 and opened 6."
"With the Helsinki group, we have opened 10 chapters and closed 8. We have also recognised full applicant status for Turkey, approved the framework regulation and accession partnership, and also a unique financial framework, and we have held the first Association Council with a view to adequately preparing for assessment."
"As for the state of enlargement negotiations, given that yesterday and the day before we held 12 consecutive Intergovernmental Accession Conferences with the 12 applicants, the following negotiating chapters are now closed: 16 with Cyprus, 13 with Estonia and the Czech Republic, 12 with Slovenia, 11 with Hungary and Poland, 7 with Malta, 6 with Slovakia, 5 with Romania, Latvia and Lithuania and 4 with Bulgaria."
"This is interesting not only in terms of the rate of development of these dossiers but also as an indication of the way in which the applicant countries are reacting to the negotiating process. This is very important."
"During yesterday' s Intergovernmental Conferences, the future Presidency also announced its working timetables in this respect so that this historic challenge can very clearly be met, based on the agreed principles, and so that there is no frustration among the applicants with regard to our intentions."
"Another item for the Feira European Council will be the follow-up to the Lisbon Special European Council. In this respect documents will be presented on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States, the eEurope 2002 Action Plan, or the Information Society for All, the progress in applying the Financial Services Action Plan and also the approval of the European Charter for Small Enterprises."
"Clearly, the whole area of social policy and employment continues to be a subject for analysis by the Heads of State and Government."
"On economic and financial affairs, I must highlight the formalisation of Greece' s entry into the euro. Greece will now join the other 11 Member States which have already moved into the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"A report will be presented on the progress made on the tax issue."
"As you know, an intense series of contacts is occurring in this area. The Portuguese Finance Minister has established this information network and there will be a meeting of Ecofin on 18 and 19 June, separate from the European Council, at which it is hoped that positive work can be achieved to find a much sought-after solution to this issue and the credibility of Europe as a financial market."
"Briefly on external relations, it must be emphasised that the Portuguese Presidency has been significant for having managed to administer the new institutions created by the Treaty of Amsterdam which has only just entered into force."
"I must thank the High Representative and Secretary-General, Xavier Solana, and also the Commissioner with responsibility in this area, Christopher Patten, for their open, careful and dedicated cooperation."
"The potential of this new model of external representation of the Union is considerable and it is fair to say that the next few months will demonstrate this."
"A very important step forward at Feira would be the adoption of the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean."
"This strategy will allow not only the whole chapter on the traditional area of the Barcelona process to be harmonised but will also allow an open methodology to be defined which will ensure, at the due time, the transition to a situation of peace, with the Middle East also being fully incorporated within this strategy. I must also highlight the report by the Secretary-General of the Council and by the Commission on the Western Balkans."
"This is an area in which our joint commitment is producing encouraging results. The approval of the Action Plan for the Northern Dimension and the report on applying the Common Strategy for Russia should also be emphasised."
"We therefore have a series of important items on our external policy agenda."
"I have tried in this presentation to give you a fairly comprehensive preview of the Feira European Council. I am, of course, prepared to continue this exchange of ideas through any questions or comments which you might have."
"This is because we have a variety of objectives which are both fundamental and decisive in the context of the European priorities. These objectives include institutional reform, enlargement, the extraction of appropriate conclusions from the Lisbon Special European Council, now with a more rigorous and considered action plan, and also, of course, the various external policy issues which are of concern to us."
"We will have the opportunity at the Feira European Council to take some important decisions in the economic and financial area and to approve a series of discussions on external security and defence policy, involving both the military and civilian components. These discussions will be very significant not so much for the future of the European Union but more for the present as this is an area where progress has been made, is starting to be visible and will surely be significant not only within Europe but also internationally."
"Madam President, thank you giving me this opportunity to speak on the oral questions tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The presidency has already drawn up and submitted the report on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We hope that, when it presents this report at the Feira Council, it will take into account the questions tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and, of course, the opinions which will be expressed this morning by the representatives of the political groups."
"The main point raised by the questions of the Committee of which I am Chairman is that we should not just restrict ourselves to recording the agreements and disagreements expressed around the Intergovernmental Conference table, but familiarise ourselves with the extent of the challenges and risks facing the Conference."
"The future of the development of Europe and the validity and sustainability of the institutions of the Union is at stake, with the now sure and fast-approaching prospect of enlargement to include a further 12 countries, and our relations with the citizens and their approval and support are also at risk."
"In our questions, we referred to Mr Fischer' s speech."
"His speech and others which preceded or followed it - and, of the most recent, I would cite Wolfgang Schäuble' s extremely dramatic speech - should have contributed to impressing upon everybody the current responsibility of the institutions and, in particular, the governments of the 15 Member States to bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a conclusion."
"Clearly, all the questions regarding the future of the Union cannot be resolved here, of that we are aware, but in Nice we must create the institutional conditions necessary for a new stage in the life of the Union."
"In the oral question to the Commission, we requested clarification regarding its undertaking to reorganise the Treaties and provide a fresh perspective on the problems of governance, points on which the Commission had already made its opinion clear."
"In our oral question to the Council, we requested clarification of the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its incorporation into the Treaties."
"In conclusion, I would add that it is important to include the topic of closer cooperation on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference - and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency in this area - but, in our opinion, the agenda cannot be extended to include this subject alone without serious consideration of all the other points put forward by Parliament in the resolution of 13 April."
"This is cause for serious concern, particularly for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and we are also very concerned by the serious difficulties encountered during these four months by the Portuguese Presidency in its endeavour to define satisfactory solutions for the three issues left unresolved after Amsterdam, particularly the issue of qualified majority voting."
"We await the responses with confidence."
"Madam President, after the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Gama, and having listened to Mr Napolitano, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, who had questions for the Commission in particular, I, in turn, would like to share with you the Commission' s thoughts on the eve of this important European Council in Feira, but first I must present President Prodi' s apologies. I am speaking on his behalf."
"The importance of the Feira Summit has been rightly highlighted at this delicate stage in the process of European integration and I want to start by saying that the Commission expects this European Council to provide the political impetus for adapting the Union before the great enlargement."
"This Council has important decisions to take in several areas, which I would like to review with you, if I may, in particular to ensure follow-up to the Special European Council of Lisbon."
"I would like to mention three of the priorities the Commission is seeking to highlight at the European Council."
"Both Mr Napolitano and Mr Gama mentioned the first: genuine institutional reform right now."
"Next, of course, is the foreign policy we need to develop and, finally, the third priority is a real European security and defence policy."
"The Commission is committed to effective and rapid follow-up to the Lisbon European Council - that is the least that might be expected of it."
"So the first priority is genuine institutional reform right now, driven forward by the Portuguese Presidency."
"There is now a dynamic to the IGC negotiations and the group of representatives led by Francesco Seixas da Costa has worked well."
"I would also like to testify here, if I may, Madam President - because I participate conscientiously in the work of the group - to the very active part taken in that work, under your authority, by your two representatives, Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with the Presidency report now available, the Feira European Council should give us a snapshot of the progress accomplished so far and I hope that snapshot will be 'proactive' - as we can expect after listening to Mr Gama."
"I am especially thinking of the progress on what I consider the most important item in the negotiations: the extension of qualified majority voting and, consequently, the extension of codecision."
"Of all the issues not dealt with in Amsterdam, for lack of courage or political will at the time, this is undoubtedly the key point, and it is indeed the only thing that can prevent and reduce the real risk of deadlock in the enlarged Union' s decision-making process."
"The Feira Council should also put 'enhanced cooperations' on the agenda of the Conference, as the Commission and Parliament have been taking turns to advocate, so that it is easier to use these 'enhanced cooperations' in the future. And yes, I did indeed say 'these cooperations' , not reinforced cooperation."
"That is a crucial point for us as well."
"In addition to those comments, and in answer to Mr Napolitano' s questions, I would like to say this. Ladies and gentlemen, you need have no doubt that the Commission definitely intends to keep on working towards what must be our ambition for this Conference: success in Nice, not just reaching a conclusion in Nice, because succeeding and concluding are two different things."
"In the debate now in progress about the future and purpose of the European Union, the essential first stage is definitely putting the Union into working order now to make the enlargement a success."
"And I want to reaffirm my conviction that this reform of the institutions is certainly not, in our view, a pretext for delaying enlargement. It is the condition for making it a success."
"So that reform is also the obligatory route for all future evolution in the construction of Europe."
"This first stage, this first step, must be respected, in the knowledge that there will be others."
"From amongst the issues we, like you, are committed to, I would like to mention the reform of the Treaties. Although this is not - or not yet - on the agenda, it is something we are working on."
"The draft basic treaty, presented at our request by the Institute of Florence does, I think, demonstrate the legal feasibility of this exercise."
"The Commission will express its opinion on this study on 5 July, and adopt a communication on the reform of the Treaties."
"Personally, I think more time will definitely be needed than is available before the Nice deadline to deal with this issue seriously and in depth."
"But as you yourself have said, Madam President, we must at least make a start on it, at the latest in Nice."
"We think it will be useful to start discussing it now and finding a method of making progress in that direction."
"The European Council could express an opinion on undertaking this exercise immediately after Nice, possibly linking it to another difficult issue we still think ought to be dealt with in Nice, though we are not sure that it will be: incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties."
"Mr Napolitano mentioned the report on governance announced by President Prodi."
"That is a second point."
"Before the end of this month, the Commission will specify the issues it wishes to look at with a view to improving the way decentralisation of responsibility within the Union is organised, strengthening coherence between its policies and achieving greater and fairer citizen participation."
"To be frank it is too early to tell you about the precise contents of this white paper, but quite clearly its drafting, between now and summer 2001, will take account of all proposals and views about the long term aims of European construction and their implications for organising European policy."
"As I speak to you today, I am also hoping this white paper on governance will contribute to the exercise I was talking about a few minutes ago: a reform of the Treaties, that simplifies and clarifies them, producing in, I hope, the not too distant future a text or basic treaty that is easy to read, incorporating rights, values, institutions, the principles of our common policies, and finally clarifying the powers and objectives of the Union."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights Mr Gama mentioned is a political challenge for all of us."
"The Commission hopes the work of the convention drafting this Charter will be completed before the end of the year."
"Your representatives, to whom I pay tribute, and my colleague, Antonio Vitorino, attach great importance to it."
"The Charter should create added value, without affecting the acquis in the Treaty, by codifying in a single text all the fundamental rights upheld by the Union and adding the fundamental economic and social rights which form a part of that acquis, plus some new limited rights."
"Of course, the precise form and status of the Charter, and the relationship between the new text and the rights guaranteed by Member States and the Council of Europe, will continue to be discussed and I cannot anticipate the conclusions, at least, not before the Biarritz Summit."
"The convention chairman, Mr Herzog, will take stock of the convention' s work at the Feira European Council and we hope the debate that follows can provide fresh impetus to this crucial process for the Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the Commission' s second great priority: the development of foreign policy and a genuine European security and defence policy."
"The political dimension of the European Union is also involved."
"First I want to talk about the enlargement."
"As the Council President mentioned, following Helsinki, negotiations are now in progress with all the candidate countries."
"During the Portuguese Presidency the negotiations with the Luxembourg Group entered their final chapters."
"In Feira, the European Council will be noting the progress achieved as set out in a Presidency report, and encouraging all the candidates to pursue their efforts to prepare themselves for accession with determination."
"We too have to prepare, by reforming the institutions, and there is a long way to go."
"That said, from now on, we who are already in the Union must set out to explain the coming great enlargement better and give the citizens of our countries better information about it."
"We should debate the advantages and the changes involved in it with them."
"That is what the initiative taken with you by Günther Verheugen is about, and we attach great importance to this public debate he will be taking part in, because we are aware of a feeling of disquiet among citizens in all our countries, a need to understand, and a growing sensitivity to the issue of enlargement."
"It is better to prevent any damage that might be caused by lack of explanation or debate rather than have to repair it."
"In the area of European security and defence policy, the Commission is happy with the decisions taken since the Helsinki European Council."
"The temporary bodies are in place within the Council and the development of the overall capacity target is making encouraging progress."
"The defence ministers have been involved in that work and at Feira the European Council will be presented with a progress report measuring, as you said, Minister, what has been accomplished under the Portuguese Presidency, and it will draw up guidelines for the work ahead."
"The Commission is contributing actively to these developments, in particular as regards civilian crisis management."
"On this point, Chris Patten recently submitted a proposal for a regulation to the Council, to create a rapid reaction force."
"The Commission has also undertaken an in-depth review of its own organisation and procedures in the area of foreign policy, in order to adapt them to these new challenges."
"I would like to stress that the Commission' s work is complementary to all the developments in European security and defence policy."
"Coherence is absolutely essential and the institutions must work together on this."
"Under foreign policy, the European Council will in particular be debating the situation in the Western Balkans and the implementation of the common strategy towards Russia."
"The Council should also adopt the common strategy for the Mediterranean region."
"For the Western Balkans, the Commission will continue to work with the Member States and with the Secretary General, Javier Solana, to achieve a rapprochement, a real rapprochement, between the countries concerned and the European Union, through a stabilisation and association process."
"On Russia, the Feira Council will finalise the Union' s common strategy towards that country just a few months after the inauguration of President Putin' s new government and his declaration of intent to introduce economic and political reforms."
"Ladies and gentlemen, despite certain positive economic and political signals, the situation in Chechnya continues to call for prudence and vigilance at this stage."
"As regards the Middle East, let me mention two major events which have changed the face of politics there in the last few weeks, so that, although the situation in the region is currently delicate, there are grounds for hope."
"First, the European Commission, along with the entire international community, was delighted at the Israeli Government' s decision of 24 May to withdraw from South Lebanon, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426."
"We should pay tribute to the Prime Minister of the State of Israel, Ehud Barak, for having taken this difficult decision after 22 years of occupation."
"In the immediate future, it is essential that all the parties concerned refrain from any act of violence, either inside or outside Lebanon, and cooperate with the United Nations forces."
"As for the Union, it will assist the reconstruction of South Lebanon as soon as conditions allow."
"The Commission has already sent a mission to evaluate reconstruction needs in situ."
"Likewise, following the death of President Harez el Assad, the Union must also encourage a smooth political transition process in Syria, as well as continuing economic reform and modernisation in that country through a strengthening of the rule of law, through a strengthening of human rights and through political pluralism."
"Talks between Syria and Israel will be able to find fresh impetus in this new political context and could lead to a just and durable peace agreement."
"Finally, the Feira European Council' s agenda will include the common Mediterranean strategy, which many of you, quite rightly, value highly."
"Not only will it contribute to strengthening the Barcelona process with a view to the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Summit in Marseilles, it will also help consolidate the European Union' s contribution to the peace process."
"Finally, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk about the effective and rapid follow-up to the Lisbon European Council, which the Commission is very committed to, just as it is committed to the proper preparation of this Council."
"At Lisbon, we set ourselves a very ambitious objective, complete with targets and a timetable: to promote the transformation of the European economy and European society over the next ten years."
"Since then, the European economy has shown continuous improvement."
"That is reflected in falling unemployment rates everywhere, even though there are still too many pockets of poverty within the Member States."
"In this improved context, the Commission, the Council and Parliament must act together to make the Lisbon objectives a reality, not contenting ourselves with words and hopes, but putting them into practice."
"Progress has already been made."
"Together with the Council, we have presented a draft action plan to make the eEurope initiative a reality as from 2002."
"Feira should approve this plan and I want to underline two key factors in the programme presented by Erkki Liikanen: first the reform of the regulatory environment for communications and electronic commerce, then, access for all citizens, especially young people, to the resources and qualifications needed in the communication and information age."
"In particular, implementation of the eLearning initiative recently proposed by my colleague Viviane Reding will help achieve this."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, its President and all the commissioners, are naturally determined to deliver what the Council and this House expects of them and to do so within the deadlines."
"We have presented proposals on government contracts, postal services and enterprise policy."
"We will shortly be presenting guidelines relating to the new European Social Agenda, to deal with the problems of social exclusion, which I mentioned earlier and which persist."
"We have also contributed to the development of the Charter for small firms, which Mr Gama mentioned and which will be adopted at Feira."
"The high level working group on social protection is preparing its interim report on the modernisation and improvement of social protection."
"I also want to stress the major role played by this House in all these issues."
"We are particularly pleased that the new regulatory framework for electronic commerce has been rapidly adopted and we hope - we feel sure - that the same fruitful collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be maintained throughout the legislative process so that progress can be made as rapidly as possible on each of the areas of interest defined in Lisbon."
"We trust the Feira European Council will acknowledge all the progress made."
"But the European Council must also provide fresh impetus for intensifying these efforts, particularly in the areas where short term action is still necessary to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"I am thinking of reducing Internet costs, implementing the action plan for financial services, creating a European research area and the 'single sky' , and, finally, greater efforts to raise employment levels, fight exclusion and prepare the new Social Agenda."
"All this requires a commitment from all the operators involved and the political impetus to introduce the necessary measures, but in our turn we must convert this political will, ladies and gentlemen, when the time comes, into priority expenditure, both by the Union and by the Member States."
"There again, perhaps Feira can point us in that direction."
"Just before I end, ladies and gentlemen, let me very briefly mention three important economic and financial points."
"First, the one Pedro Solbes will report on: the main economic policy guidelines and the coordination that goes with them, essential for a better balance between the two pillars of economic and monetary union."
"We are persuaded that the guidelines thus defined are, with the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes, essential for proper progress towards the Lisbon objectives."
"Then, Greece has made a marvellous effort to achieve convergence, and we are in a position to extend the euro zone to that country, as the Commission has proposed."
"We will be presenting recommendations to that effect to the Heads of State and Government at Feira and trust they will be followed."
"Finally, the fiscal package."
"As you know, the Council has not reached agreement, but discussions continue."
"On 18 June there will be a special Ecofin Council, and we hope it will open the way to an agreement, provided all the parties demonstrate goodwill and a desire to reach a conclusion."
"The various speeches have reflected the abundance of important issues, even though we need to concentrate our political attention and energy on the three essential points I have raised: reform of the institutions, foreign policy and the CFSP, and the follow-up to Lisbon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a European Council is a result achieved by a presidency."
"I want to say, on behalf of the Commission, how very active the Portuguese Presidency really has been."
"But a European Council is also the result of the effort made by each institution."
"So I feel sure that the effort everyone has made will result in the Feira European Council making progress possible on all these fundamental issues, responding better to the challenges of the Union as a whole, responding better to the expectations of the citizens of our fifteen countries, but also to the expectations I mentioned just now, those of the citizens of the twelve countries of Central, Eastern, Baltic and Mediterranean Europe who are soon going to join us."
"Thank you, Mr Barnier."
"Mr Klaus Hänsch has asked to move a procedural motion."
"Madam President, I have a very small question for the Commissioner about the expression he came up with, which I found quite remarkable and highly amusing. I refer to the 'proactive snapshot' ."
"Is this by any chance the Commission' s special contribution to the development of the new technologies?"
"One could say that, certainly, Madam President, but I would not want to tie the idea down to too technological a definition."
"You realise, of course, that the expression implied, first, thanks to the Portuguese Presidency, which has worked well and allowed us to do some spade work and clear some ground."
"That had to be done, and it was likewise necessary for the report it has just drafted - in addition to being an objective and lucid snapshot of the strengths and weaknesses of the negotiations - to propose going further, without shutting any doors."
"It has done so, in particular, on a point Mr Gama mentioned, the fourth Amsterdam 'leftover' , and I hope the 'enhanced cooperations' will allow us to move on."
"We hope all the Heads of State and Government, as well as the Portuguese Presidency, will take that snapshot as a model to set a 'proactive' seal on the remaining six months, so as to succeed - and I do mean succeed - in reforming the institutions at Nice."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, next week' s summit in Feira could be an important summit if the work it is to do is carried out properly."
"Europe will not fall from the sky like a ripe fruit - it has to be shaped by working on it day in, day out."
"The procedures to be agreed in Feira for the future of the European Union represent a significant step along this path."
"I therefore hope that this will be a meaningful working summit."
"We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, have two fundamental objectives as this new millennium commences."
"Firstly, the Intergovernmental Conference must be concluded in Nice this winter, but not just for the sake of completing it, but rather in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome."
"That is the first challenge."
"Secondly, we witnessed major changes in Europe in 1989-90, not to mention before and since then."
"The peoples of Central Europe are anxious to join our Community of values."
"To achieve this, we and those countries need to fulfil our respective obligations."
"Mr President-in-Office, I ask you to give a signal in Feira so that the impetus of the accession process is not lost."
"We must not create the impression that these Central European peoples are not welcome in our Community of values."
"I would like to call on you personally to do everything in your power to make sure that we send a signal to the peoples of Central Europe that they are welcome to join us!"
"You have talked about extending the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would like to offer you my emphatic support - be flexible!"
"Do not just make a list of what needs to be added, but find a formula which allows additional topics to be included over the coming months."
"Commissioner Barnier has talked about majority voting."
"This is the key point - using majority voting in the EU Council of Ministers as a matter of course, and at the same time extending the codecision procedure."
"I am all in favour of introducing enhanced cooperation into the Treaty, but I must warn you, Mr President-in-Office, against introducing enhanced cooperation into the Treaty if this is ultimately just a token gesture and if we are not successful as far as majority voting is concerned."
"We need both majority voting and enhanced cooperation!"
"We firmly support your presidency' s desire to rationalise the Treaty, as will be apparent from the political groups' motion for a resolution, so that the structure of the Treaty is revised."
"Commissioner Barnier talked about a basic treaty."
"It may not be possible to achieve all this in this six-month period, but we should adopt this approach of creating a basic treaty and a general treaty."
"We must have more respect for the principles of subsidiarity."
"My group is also in favour of our trying to clarify the respective roles of the European Union, the Member States and the regions."
"We can only maintain or even regain agreement to the process of European unification at various levels if people actually know what each level is responsible for doing!"
"That is why it is key for us to establish our priorities here and to make a start on demarcating the various competences."
"The Commissioner also spoke about the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I support the endeavours to create a strong Europe, indeed we have always supported them, but in the framework of the Western Alliance, and not separately from our American friends, but complementing them and as partners with equal rights."
"I would like to add one more thought."
"I should have mentioned it just now, but I forgot."
"Why do we need a flexible approach to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"Yesterday we spoke in this Chamber about a European Party Statute. You were not able to be present, and I do not intend that as a reproach."
"If we want to supplement Article 191 of the Treaty, and the Commission is to present a proposal to the IGC to that effect, then it must be possible to deal with this at the IGC and ultimately to supplement the Treaty if we are to make progress on the subject of European political parties."
"I would like to make one more observation, without any desire to be controversial, but quite calmly and objectively, and yet with a sense of great personal dismay."
"This is about paragraph 8 of the political groups' motion for a resolution."
"We are calling on the Council presidency to assess relations between the 14 Member States and Austria, and we are also calling on the presidency to work out a procedure in conjunction with all the parties involved in the European Union with a view to finding an acceptable solution."
"Mr President-in-Office, everyone will probably see this differently, but this issue is casting a shadow over the European Union."
"We know that in Denmark, support for the euro in the run-up to the referendum in September is rapidly waning because of the Austrian issue, as in Denmark, this is viewed as interference in the internal affairs of the smaller states."
"I would like to address this comment to you personally, and I say this not because I wish to be controversial, but because I am firmly convinced that if we do not solve this issue it will lead to major problems."
"I therefore urge you to make this your business."
"And I also entreat you to take the position of the European Parliament into consideration at the IGC."
"We have faith in the Commission, but our faith in the presidency, in the Council, could be greater."
"But we nevertheless hope you will succeed."
"If you succeed, it will be a success for all of us, for the entire continent of Europe!"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is no cliché to say that, on the eve of the European Council in Feira, this is a decisive moment for the European Union."
"The proof of this is the fact that in recent months there have been an increasing number of declarations, beginning with Heads of State such as President Campi of Italy, President Rau of Germany, prominent European politicians such as Helmut Schmidt, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Delors and more recently, with great success, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Fischer, all of whom have related the debate on the Intergovernmental Conference with a debate which is of importance to all of us, that is, 'where is Europe heading?' ."
"I think that this is healthy given that we are on the threshold of the greatest and most ambitious enlargement the European Union has ever known."
"This debate reflects the political will of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and also Parliament as a whole, who wish to achieve an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Since we have been talking about photographic technology, to use a cinematic analogy, I would say that we need to be involved in the writing of the script, we need a good ending, and we MEPs must not be cast as extras, but as lead actors."
"With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, it is important that President Herzog appears before the European Council in Feira."
"I would like to point out that, when we talk about the community of values, - and there have been recent opportunities to do so, such as the formation of the new Austrian Government - we must demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be clearly included in the Treaty in order to fulfil the purpose of Articles 6 and 7 of that Treaty."
"Furthermore, although the Treaty of the European Union recognises European citizenship, until now, economic and social, individual and collective rights have not been developed."
"It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights."
"It is therefore absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be incorporated into the Treaty."
"In this process, the status of political parties is a means for them also to be protagonists on the European stage."
"With regard to the convention, I would add one more element, and that is that, in the drawing up of the Charter, the convention is turning out to be a more transparent, democratic and open formula than the classic procedure of the Intergovernmental Conferences."
"It is a formula for the future and I believe we should take it very seriously."
"In this regard, I will add two decisive points."
"One is, for Parliament, that decisions made by qualified majority should be accompanied by the codecision procedure, and the second point is that we must favour integration over closer cooperation, because what we are actually doing is integrating."
"In the economic field, what we need is greater coordination of economic, social and employment policies."
"We must implement the conclusions of the European Council in Lisbon, which are positive and have achieved a broad consensus in this Parliament as well, but this requires that we increase our capacity for economic government."
"If we wish to create employment, if we wish to defend and fulfil the social agenda at a time when the European train is beginning to move faster and needs more steam, the last thing we need is for our work to be hindered by a strictly monetarist management with no economic counterbalance."
"That is an absolutely decisive point for the coming months."
"Lastly, Madam President, I would like to make a very brief comment: the report on the progress made with regard to enlargement has been important because it indicates how the problems are being overcome and how we have to maintain this will with the countries with whom we are negotiating."
"After the political change which has taken place, the Commission should intensify the negotiation of the association agreement with Croatia."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Middle East."
"I have just returned from a visit to Syria and Lebanon and I welcome the fact that the President of the Commission is there at the moment."
"I agree that the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon is very important and we must support Barak, but we should also intensify our partnership with Syria and Lebanon."
"We must have an active policy in order to contribute towards resolving the dramatic problem of the Palestinian refugees, and we can actively offer ideas and resources in order to ensure that the Middle East peace process will make decisive progress, which would also lead to a greater opening up and intensification of the Euro-Mediterranean process."
"All of these elements are on the agenda and I hope that the European Council in Feira will make progress."
"Madam President, I should like, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, to begin by recording our thanks to the Portuguese presidency and our appreciation of its willingness to engage constantly with this Parliament, with its committees and with its groups."
"We deeply appreciate that."
"It has helped us to develop and evolve a considerable appreciation of the enormous work which this presidency has put into the task."
"I wish also to record our view that, subject to consolidating the path set out at Lisbon, at Feira and subsequent Council meetings, European summits and various Council meetings and in this House, we believe that Lisbon marks a major change, a milestone, in terms of the evolution of socio-economic policy reform in Europe."
"It will stand the test of time as a testament to the work of this presidency."
"You have remarked, Mr President-in-Office, that enlargement is the historic challenge."
"We in my group very much believe that."
"We believe that one of the measures of the consciousness of the depth of that historic challenge will be found in the reformist appetite of the states in the IGC."
"I say on behalf of my group - and this is not the responsibility of a hard-working Portuguese presidency, but a failure of a collective will - that we regret the failure to date to make more progress on some of the basic issues."
"I cite qualified majority voting as an example."
"I would insist, as other speakers have, on this Parliament's view that we also need to link changes in voting procedure to changes in legislative procedure."
"The codecision question is not simply a question of giving more power to this House."
"It is the question of recognising, as we step towards improving the efficiency of the institutions, especially decision-making in the Council, that it needs checks and balances, to add not just efficiency but also representative democracy."
"It is an appeal, therefore, for the quality of European democracy and not simply an appeal for the interests of Members of this House."
"We are prepared to engage in the debate on closer cooperation and welcome the way it has been put to us by a number of important political personalities outside this House."
"But there are some caveats: we hope that speculation on long-term reform will not be the enemy of necessary radical reform in the immediate period ahead."
"We believe that the Monnet method has served the Union rather well."
"We would certainly wish to reflect on any attempt to radically change it."
"We believe it is important not to signal to existing Member States or to candidate states that any of us would contemplate a Europe of first- and second-class citizens in terms of statehood and membership."
"I should like to briefly mention the question of Austria."
"My group would appreciate it if the Council at Feira would try to make an evaluation of the quality of relations between the Fourteen and Austria."
"It is important that as Fifteen we find the accommodating political climate to make the necessary progress in the months ahead."
"We are not prescriptive in the manner of achieving this."
"I add one footnote, but an important point of principle."
"President Klestil came to this House and I had the opportunity to talk with him briefly during his visit."
"I asked him to send to me a copy of the list that is available of persons and agencies in civil society in Austria who have become isolated from various educational, social or cultural events in Europe."
"That is intolerable."
"Regardless of intergovernmental diplomacy, it is intolerable that we should isolate the common citizens of a state."
"Lest this should get out of hand, my appeal would be for a calm assessment of the matter, to make an evaluation and find a way forward."
"If there is any way that we in Parliament and my group can assist, we are ready to try to do so."
"Madam President, a paradoxical situation awaits state leaders at Santa Maria da Feira, as we could say that there the notion of the logistics of inter-state action is being irreversibly left behind in the development of the Union."
"In our opinion, this is very welcome."
"We warmly welcome the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we would like it to be vibrant in terms of its content, and to become a legally binding part of the Treaties and a vehicle for a constitutional process in which the people are a central factor."
"I also believe that the way in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being produced is radically new, and this could also be a way to amend agreements in the future to make them genuinely constitutional."
"In our opinion, public opinion is at its lowest ebb now when it comes to the formation of military institutions for the European Union."
"I would like, on behalf of my Group, to complain that barely any public debate is entered into in these matters, and that changes happen so fast that sometimes it feels as if not even all our governments can fully influence this process."
"Relations between the European Union and NATO are converging so quickly that the non-aligned countries are in a very precarious situation, although they want to make a full contribution to the promotion of national security."
"I would like to say that the Mediterranean strategy is a very important one."
"I was recently in New York at a conference on women' s issues."
"I appeal to the Commission and the Council that you make a serious bid to include the issues of women' s rights and human rights in the Mediterranean strategy."
"I also warmly welcome the concrete action programme concerning the northern dimension."
"It may at last help to make a serious attempt to resolve the immense socio-economic problem that exists, for example, in north-west Russia."
"In that process we have to remember the issue of nuclear safety, which is a problem that affects us all."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a year ago, almost to the day, the European elections were marked by massive abstentions, confirming that there is a crisis of confidence amongst citizens as regards the European institutions."
"When you were preparing for the Portuguese Presidency, Mr President-in-Office, I presume you were determined to send a strong message to the public."
"It was undoubtedly in that spirit that you decided to make the Lisbon European Council a special employment summit."
"And you effectively relaunched the idea of full employment, emphasised the importance of lifelong training, and stressed the considerable challenge represented by the information revolution."
"But without specific job creation targets, verifiable timetable commitments, clear choices about finance and tangible progress on the right of the social operators to be involved, all public opinion will remember about that summit will be the Blair-Aznar trademark."
"Besides, Commissioner Bolkestein, to take one example, has not hesitated to refer to what he called the ambition set at Lisbon to require postal services to be opened up to competition, even if it means a head-on clash with the unions, many Members of Parliament and several Member States."
"Under such circumstances, what is left of the social message you were hoping to send to the citizens of Europe?"
"I do not say that as an accusation against the Portuguese Presidency."
"I think it is up to all the Member States to take up the challenge."
"And what has happened to that other big idea intended to regain people' s confidence, the affirmation of a policy department for European business, faced with the influence of mega-firms and markets?"
"There was a fascinating sight for all to see at the European Business Summit in Brussels last weekend, attended by the flower of European employers present and even the Microsoft management."
"And as we know, the Commission did not content itself with sending eleven commissioners to it, which is unprecedented, apparently the Commission President also came out with some original principles there, to the effect that the law is the law, but in times of change excessively precise regulations should be avoided."
"What does the political authority, the Council, think of this laissez-faire philosophy?"
"If voices are raised in Feira, as I hope they will be, to distance themselves from the whole engulfing tide of liberalism and advocate real social and democratic reform, then please, Mr President, open the windows and doors of your summit wide, let that dissent be heard in full transparency and clarity and let a real comparison of options, which is so lacking today, begin everywhere in the full light of day."
"I think that is the best favour Europe can be done today."
"Madam President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Feira European Council represents a fresh opportunity for this House to express its opinion on the various political issues forming the EU agenda."
"I wish to highlight four of these, not all of which were referred to by Mr Gama."
"Firstly, on Austria, clearly we do not harbour any sympathies for political extremism but we must condemn the ill-timed reaction of 14 Member States to the formation of a democratically elected government before this had even had the chance to start governing."
"This decision did not respect the sovereign choice of the Austrian people and has also been ineffective."
"The fight against racism and xenophobia must be conducted intelligently and forcefully, not with inflammatory measures which in the end simply produce the totally unwanted effect of promoting what they are trying to fight, in addition to spreading anti-European feeling."
"The Portuguese Presidency was willing to take on the role of spokesperson for the Member States last February, wrongly in our opinion, despite the issue always having been a bilateral issue, as was clearly agreed between the 14 Member States."
"Although this Presidency is not formally required to solve the problem, each of the governments should be required to assume its responsibilities."
"In this way we would find out who wants to continue isolating Austria and who, recognising the error, wants to re-establish normal relations with this country, thus avoiding the 'misunderstandings' mentioned by the Secretary of State, Mr Seixas da Costa, between the Member States."
"The second issue is the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The distinctive act of the Portuguese Presidency should be to recognise and defend political equality between the Member States as a corollary to maintaining the balance between the large and small countries and between these and the European Union itself."
"The participation of national parliaments in the institutional reform and in the conduct of European affairs should therefore be encouraged. In this way the people of each country can become involved more democratically and more directly in the process of building their Europe and in defining the Community decision-making methods."
"With regard to closer cooperation, it must be emphasised that the principle of flexibility on which this is based and which we support should not prevent the guarantee that no Member State can be excluded from participating in this cooperation, except on its own initiative."
"On the issues left unresolved by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the rule of one commissioner for each Member State should be enshrined, bearing in mind that the Commission has the monopoly on legislative initiative. It should be pointed out that codecision now involves a dual weighting of votes, one in the Council and the other in the European Parliament."
"Instead of the intended generalisation of qualified majority voting, the retention of the unanimity rule must be defended in order to preserve the factors of political balance between the Member States regardless of their population or economic weight. These factors have been the key to the success of the cooperative, peaceful and developed Europe which we have come to know in the last fifty years."
"The third issue is the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Its content is not in question."
"The point is that the European Union does not need a Charter of Fundamental Rights and this is for the simplest reason of all."
"The European Union does not have any significant problems with fundamental rights."
"As we have said before, if there is no problem, the Charter is not a solution and if it is not the solution, then the Charter is a problem."
"We hope that the Feira summit can come to the obvious conclusion. There are no differences of opinion about the definition or application of fundamental rights in the European Union which cannot be solved by the various Member States in their constitutions and in the Human Rights Convention to which all countries, and the European Union, both before and after enlargement, are bound."
"The fourth and final issue is enlargement."
"Despite the progress announced here today, we feel that more than ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall the European Union should be showing a more consistent political will in terms of welcoming into the European fold the people of Central and Eastern Europe who legitimately aspire to share a common future with us. This would prevent them from feeling any disappointment or even frustration."
"This will should be shown through three essential aspects: firstly the defence of the major European causes of peace, freedom and economic and social development which must underlie the negotiations with the applicant countries; secondly the promotion of the merit of each country as the only condition to be imposed on accession, and thirdly the maintenance of the economic and social cohesion of the current 15 Member States."
"Austria, the Intergovernmental Conference, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and enlargement are four issues requiring four different responses."
"This is what we expect from the meeting at Feira of the Heads of State and Government on the Portuguese Presidency."
"Mr President, President Gama, Commissioner Barnier, in Feira, France will take over from Portugal to complete the IGC, the impossible reform of taxation on savings, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, defence policy, and sanctions against Austria."
"Portugal has had a difficult presidency, with the collapse of the euro, and the collapse of the new economy, and, in Lisbon, had to deal with many problems like unemployment, the loss of Macao, the arrival of imitation port from South Africa, and even the arrival of the great criminal Rezala in your country, Mr President."
"But you finished up well, 3-2 against England, which, after all, is the most important thing for the people."
"Perhaps we should launch a plan for a transatlantic football cup in Feira."
"It is perhaps our only chance of beating the United States."
"Mr Bayrou and Mr Cohn-Bendit might have a problem deciding which team to play for, but in the end there could be a juicy transfer contract."
"The broadcasting rights could be paid to Kosovo, Iraq or the victims of the construction of Europe."
"Then Europe could be some use for once."
"In official speeches, everyone welcomes enlargement of the EU from 15 to 30 Member States, but that objective is receding ever further, and more and more obstacles are being placed in the path of the unification of Europe' s nation States."
"The Feira Summit will give the green light particularly to close cooperation between the most developed and the most federally minded nations."
"They will create a State within the State and make decisions on behalf of everyone else."
"The pattern is familiar from holding companies where a small majority runs a company which, in turn, runs another company."
"In the EU, there is a Franco-German axis which will set the pace for a core EU which, in turn, will make decisions in the EU as a whole, as well as dictating legislation to the candidate States and, moreover, adopting legislation right under the noses of all the other nations of Europe."
"Human rights, the arts, transport and foreign and security policy could also become areas for which European bodies such as the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe are responsible."
"The common market could also, of course, be opened up to all European countries."
"Nations such as the Baltic and Baltic Sea countries and the countries around the Mediterranean could also join together in different regional groups."
"It ought to be possible for countries to remain outside those aspects of European cooperation they are better off without, as long as they do not in that way arrogate particular economic advantages to themselves."
"It ought also to be possible for some countries to enter into especially close cooperation but, if this is to happen within the EU' s institutions, everyone must be asked."
"Otherwise, cooperation must take place elsewhere."
"My group rejects majority decision-making on enhanced cooperation."
"We are in favour of greater flexibility, but we have no use for a self-appointed avant garde to take the decisions on our behalf."
"I also think that the sanctions against Austria ought to be lifted."
"Mr President, dismayed as I am about the continuing prejudgement of Austria by 14 Member States, I would like to stress that the Santa Maria da Feira Summit will be vital for the further development of the European Union."
"For one thing, it will determine whether the Portuguese Presidency will go down in history as the presidency which upheld the wrongful decision on the part of those 14 Member States against Austria, or, instead, as the presidency which found a way out of this unfortunate period of disregard for European solidarity and lack of respect for the democratic processes within Member States."
"Through the measures they have taken, the Heads of State and Government of the Fourteen have really burdened themselves with an enormous responsibility in relation both to Austria and to the Union as a whole."
"Over a year ago, it looked as if the disastrously low turnout in the European elections would at least have the helpful effect of initiating a fundamental debate about the structure of the European Union."
"Since then, things have largely returned to the normal routine."
"If anything, European awareness has receded even further into the distance because of the arbitrary action taken by the Fourteen against Austria."
"Feira should therefore give us an opportunity to bring the EU closer to the public, either by giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal force, or, which would be even more meaningful, by then stating its intention to include a list of competences in the treaties."
"Instead, perhaps as a token gesture, and as a result of the difficulty of solving the core problems, it appears that the topic of ""enhanced cooperation"" is being given a higher profile. This is despite the feeling already prevailing in the last parliamentary term, and still prevalent in this Chamber now, that this could lead to a two-speed or even multi-speed Europe, so that ""enhanced cooperation"" will sound the death-knell of the classic European Union."
"In many respects, the Union is facing a parting of the ways, and the Feira Summit has a vital role to play here."
"The programme we have heard today does not give us cause for any great hope."
"Mr President, the forthcoming European Council in Feira will mark the end of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union."
"As a Portuguese national and a European, no one more than I hopes that this summit will achieve positive results which can take Europe forward and show the merit of the rotating presidency, whatever the demographic and economic weight of each country."
"This is the very spirit of the European Union and it is only with this spirit that Europe will remain united."
"There cannot be first or second rate countries or people. Everyone is equal in the Union, in both their rights and duties."
"Therefore, as a Portuguese national and a European, I am looking very expectantly to the Feira European Council to ensure that this summit is not just an obligation in the calendar or a transition point."
"I have two specific hopes, which are also requirements, obligations and duties, for the assessment to be made of the Portuguese Presidency."
"Firstly, we hope that the Feira European Council can definitively end the Austrian question otherwise this issue will remain a cloud over the Portuguese Presidency."
"We do not understand why the President-in-Office has allowed confusion to arise between his institutional position as President of the European Union and his role as spokesperson for the bilateral decisions of 14 Member States against one."
"If there is one person responsible for this issue it is the President of the European Union who must now correct his error."
"He must rectify what could have been avoided."
"The Portuguese Presidency assumed a special responsibility in this issue and we hope that it will solve the problem at the Feira European Council so that this does not become a sore point within the European Union."
"The longer it takes to resolve this issue, the more difficult it will become to resolve."
"Secondly, we hope that the Feira European Council can produce a plan, an idea or a project for Europe for the next Intergovernmental Conference. We also hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be seen to have made a significant mark in this respect."
"A report or document is not enough."
"It does not take ministers to produce reports and documents summarising positions. This only needs officials to attend the meetings."
"We know that the work of the IGC will be drawn to a close by the French Presidency at the end of this year but it would surely be justified for ideas and projects to already exist which had the mark of the current Presidency."
"The idea that everything will be decided at the last minute seems too much a justification of a fait accompli policy and must be rejected immediately."
"This is even more worrying when everything is being discussed in public, without it being apparent whether these discussions are forms of pressure or academic debate."
"We therefore hope that the Feira European Council will produce not just a statement of positions but also a plan, a project or an idea on the changes to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we listened carefully to the speech which Mr Gama gave at the beginning of this debate. To a certain extent, this set out the points of the triangle which has formed and which continues to form the shape of the action and work of the Portuguese Presidency."
"The third relates to external policy and the common European security and defence policy. On this third point we had the opportunity yesterday to debate the proposals with the Presidency and in particular the issues which will be on the agenda at Feira."
"However, I cannot resist expressing our delight not only at the concrete steps taken in this area in terms of defence and security but also at the political visibility which this Presidency has had in cooperation with the Secretary-General of the Council and the Commission. It has achieved this by contributing to the resolution of regional conflicts and particularly by ensuring that there is not just one regional conflict mediator available in the world, namely the United States of America, but that Europe can also assume what is one of its main historic vocations and one of the decisive factors in the European project."
"The second point of the triangle is social and economic cohesion."
"We frequently take fundamental issues for granted, such as full employment, modernisation of our economic fabric, the need to create a European research area to generate creativity and the need for this creativity to be at the service of businesses, particularly new businesses in the new economy."
"These points are too important to be glossed over and taken lightly."
"The contribution made in this respect, with a new method of coordination and a new strategy, by the Lisbon Special European Council cannot be a priority for just one presidency but must be continued."
"We are therefore reassured when we hear those who will mainly be responsible for the future French Presidency choosing the social agenda as one of the main priorities of their political action."
"We must stress the need for the creation of more jobs to be a priority and an objective of the European Union."
"With regard to the issues of racism and xenophobia, we must fight these at the roots and prevent them from gaining ground and being used in speeches of the extreme right which we all reject but which it seems that some only reject in speeches but not in practice."
"My last point concerns the compliments already made, of which there cannot be too many given the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This Parliament contributed positively and constructively, as Commissioner Barnier witnessed, so that the work of the IGC could be started in February."
"We all knew that this IGC would be reduced in size and even minimalist. With the exception of closer cooperation, this IGC did not perhaps need to be given eleven months to be decided."
"The problem with the IGC, given the leftovers from Amsterdam, is not just in terms of the debate but also the decision."
"We demand and insist that the Feira European Council produces an extended agenda which will ensure that the European project does not mobilise just those who, like us, are committed to the institutional issues but can mobilise the real citizens of Europe who should be involved in the construction of a European project."
"In this respect, the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty is an example and especially an objective which must be pursued."
"Mr President, the drafting of the Charter has now reached a critical phase."
"We have drafted 60 clauses and provoked 1000 amendments."
"Frankly the Convention is staggering and may stall completely should the Feira Council fail to bring a fresh stimulus."
"We have so far tried to reach a consensus across the body."
"This is now proving an improbable task."
"We require a far more formal decision-making procedure of a parliamentary type."
"This means voting, and voting by a qualified majority, as would be normal for the procedures within any modern European State."
"Some representatives of the European Council cannot stand the prospect of being forced to vote and they disapprove of the nature of the Convention itself. This prejudice must be suppressed by the Feira Council if the project is to succeed."
"Mr President, the issues to be addressed at the forthcoming Feira Summit are predictable and have already been mentioned. However, the results which will be obtained from this summit are of doubtful and limited scope, or at least some of them are, as the respective debate has gone beyond the institutions and this presidency and all eyes are now turned to Nice."
"Even so, there is every reason for concern. The enlargement process is advancing and forms a specific argument for institutional change but its effects are being ignored and the measures needed in the various policies and in the budget are being swept under the carpet."
"As the debate advances within the IGC, this is taking an unacceptable shape."
"In the name of efficiency, attempts are being made to impose the new model of internal power and a markedly federalist option. Due to the illusory danger of the small and medium-sized countries blocking decisions, the idea of giving the large countries a real and exclusive right of veto is gaining ground."
"In the meantime, the essential need to involve the people in these debates is being forgotten, particularly those people who are most disadvantaged and distant from the decision-making centres."
"In addition, closer cooperation is being gambled on heavily but it is being forgotten that this would require the establishment of a multi-speed Europe which would inevitably have a hard core and an unacceptable political directorate."
"In terms of security and defence, with the fallacious argument of autonomy constantly being used and based on an effective concept of a politico-military block, dangerous routes are being taken towards the militarisation and reinforcement of the European power of NATO when this should be the time to definitively dismantle these blocks, to disarm and to cooperate in achieving lasting peace."
"Strangely, this Presidency, which has allowed itself to be overtaken by events, has ended up by accepting all these concepts and, even worse, has actually applauded some of their mentors, even in the knowledge that the acceptance of their proposals and discussion methods would, taken literally, lead to the inevitable closure of the IGC itself."
"The Presidency is insisting on the controversial Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it wants as a badge of achievement, but has forgotten the social issues."
"Finally, this Conference is at least producing a positive result on Timor given that something clearly needs to be done to rebuild this territory and re-establish its independence."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union will only be able to play its historic role if it decides to be more than the sum of its Member States."
"As representatives of the European peoples without their own state, we want the European Union to be a community of citizens, on the one hand, and correspond to the reality of peoples and regions and their political entities, on the other."
"This reality is not sufficiently recognised in the texts before us, if at all."
"Some Member States are struggling just as hard with granting autonomy to these various cultural and political entities as with relinquishing competences to create a federal Europe."
"In fact, this would mean a democratic U-turn which they do not seem to be prepared to make."
"This is once again evident from the way in which the IGC is going and from the expectations which are being expressed for Feira."
"In our opinion, the institutional reforms which it is hoped Feira will bring are sound but insufficient in our eyes."
"We fear, for example, that the refusal to develop a true federal authority will result in a common foreign and security policy which cannot really function properly."
"The establishment of a rapid reaction military force, therefore, threatens to become an expensive alibi which could only lead to the rapid militarisation of conflicts."
"This would fit in perfectly with the new arms spiral which can be set in motion under the guise of the American rocket programme and with the backing of NATO and non-NATO countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency has certainly had a difficult task this semester, for it had to set in motion an Intergovernmental Conference which will finish during the term of the next Presidency and, therefore, there was every possibility that governments would be uncooperative and play for time so that the next Presidency would reap the benefits of the work carried out."
"Certainly, we expected more from this first stage of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I feel that the Portuguese Presidency has done everything in its power and that all thanks are due to it for the part it has played and for organising the Lisbon Summit last March."
"In any case, the Summit opened major avenues with regard to the new economy and in relation to the need to boost the European economy which is being held back by dirigisme and is still oppressed by statalism which is sending unemployment up to double the rates of other economies such as the United States."
"From the point of view of the institutions, the current impasse is certainly extremely serious."
"Today, the European Parliament is going to call strongly upon the Portuguese Presidency to uphold the need for integration, for political will, or the European Union crisis will become a general crisis, as Minister Joschka Fischer quite rightly pointed out yesterday."
"The warning signs are starting to become apparent in the paralysis which has affected us in recent months."
"Therefore: yes, we must extend the agenda of the Feira Council, and yes, we must make changes to the Conference' s tasks, otherwise we will not achieve our objective of enlargement and we will not reach any of the objectives which the French Presidency will be expecting to achieve in Nice."
"It has almost always been necessary in this House to recall the sound common sense to be found in the Norwegian fell-walkers handbook: 'In the event of a discrepancy between the map and the terrain, it is recommended that you be guided by the terrain' ."
"The institutions of the European Union, and this House in particular, have still not grasped this very elementary insight."
"The Union train thunders off, taking no account of the terrain."
"The terrain is the people in the countries of Europe who have long since got off this Union train."
"We have no confidence in the Union project."
"We disassociate ourselves from the ideological agenda, which the motion for a resolution calls ambitious and which involves a disastrous undermining of democracy in the Member States."
"Deeper integration, the Treaty which is to become a constitution, the extension to the military, etc. But it does not pay to ignore the lie of the land."
"On 28 September of this year, the Danish people, who have the privilege of being able to vote in referenda, will send out a decisive signal when we vote against joining the euro."
"This 'no' vote will, first of all, mean that our friends and brethren in Sweden and Great Britain will also vote against and, secondly, it will send out a crucial signal to the summits in Feira and Nice to the effect that one ought to be guided by the terrain, which is more important than the ideological map."
"Mr President, in Lisbon, a common horizon was set, establishing structural reforms for the modernisation of our economy, in order to increase growth and employment."
"However, our Union goes beyond the field of the economy."
"It is based on fundamental principles, listed in Article 6 of the Treaty, which many of us have seen called into question in one particular Member State."
"All we democrats should be delighted to see the Union immediately reacting to any apparent threat to the values on which our co-existence is based."
"In the PPE we have analysed - in my humble opinion, objectively and competently - the political situation in Austria and we have agreed, within our political family, on a system of conditions and of monitoring which we pray will make a positive contribution to the resolution of this crisis."
"These have been lively months internationally."
"I will now focus purely on the Middle East."
"Israel, Syria and the Lebanon are living through intense time in terms of national politics, as has been said this morning in this House."
"I believe that these circumstances offer a new opportunity for definitive peace in the region."
"Therefore, we have to demand of our Heads of Government and of the European Commission that they take the responsibility which the circumstances demand of the European Union, by increasing our joint political presence, of course, but also in the economic field, concluding the associations agreements once and for all, and implementing the Barcelona agreements more quickly."
"I hope that these events will remind us of our moral, historical, political and economic commitments to our Mediterranean neighbours, which must not be passed over in favour of other geographical areas."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I think the first thing we should do in this debate is thank the Portuguese Presidency for the way it is preparing to manage the debates at the Feira European Council, dealing with the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Looking at the links between the various presidencies, that was an essential point, and the idea that 'enhanced cooperations' will henceforth be included on the agenda for that conference seems absolutely crucial to us."
"We also think it is important to mention that the conference agenda is a full one, and we are expecting a positive result from it - a result which allows the European Union to operate in its present state."
"Some major issues have appeared on the scene since the conference was launched."
"They are essential, but they must not disrupt the conference agenda."
"We will debate those issues whatever happens."
"But these are two parallel exercises."
"Nothing should distract us from our real task at the Intergovernmental Conference, otherwise the Union will no longer be able to take decisions."
"To be able to take decisions, we need significant progress on qualified majority voting. Enhanced cooperation cannot constitute an alternative."
"It is not a case of one or the other, we need both."
"The inclusion of enhanced cooperation on our Intergovernmental Conference agenda will force us to prolong the period of reflection."
"How are we going to organise democratic control of these 'enhanced cooperations' ?"
"I also hope the Intergovernmental Conference agenda will be flexible enough for us to be in a position to add an item or two, here or there, depending on the progress of the work."
"I am thinking, of course, about the status of political parties."
"I am also thinking about the reform of Article 7."
"Mr President-in-Office, as you engage in this important debate in Feira, let me tell you how concerned we are about the drafting of the Charter."
"Our fellow citizens have high expectations of the content likely to emerge from the work of the convention."
"In the current state of affairs, I see great division in the interpretation of the mandate given to the members of the convention by the Cologne European Council."
"The debate initiated by President Herzog' s speech must clearly highlight the European Council' s commitment to the indivisibility of rights and the convention' s task of drafting a Charter rich in content, which respects the full Cologne mandate, civil and political rights, but also economic and social rights."
"Many of my colleagues say the Charter must be incorporated into the Treaty."
"Yes, but what use will it be to incorporate a Charter if the content is disappointing?"
"First we must work on the content."
"That is our main task."
"But for that it seems to me we also need the debate at the Feira European Council to give us a political signal."
"Mr President, I would, first of all, like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for their work, also because I have just heard Mr Vedrine, the future President-in-Office, say that he considers that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be binding and should not be included in the Treaties."
"In my opinion, this is a very difficult subject, and one over which we will lament the passing of the Portuguese Presidency, for, at least on this point, it maintained a position which, if not crystal clear, was at least less negative."
"The Feira Council will be a major Council if it is ambitious enough."
"The Presidency has just announced that closer cooperation will be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"However, there are many different ways of defining closer cooperation and, in our opinion, certain criteria must be respected."
"The first is total observance of the acquis communautaire; the second is the abolition of the right of veto for every Member State; the third is full respect of the roles of Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Justice in the decision-making procedures with regard to the initial introduction and implementation of closer cooperation."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights should have been included in the subjects for debate, Minister."
"Let us hope that external pressure which will, I hope, increase, will be sufficient to bring it to your attention."
"This Charter will only be a success if it has binding legal status - its content must, of course, be sound, but it must also have legal status - or it will serve absolutely no purpose - and if it includes other new rights such as the right to a safe environment and a number of fundamental social rights such as the right to belong to a trade union and the right to strike."
"Thank you again, Portuguese Presidency."
"We urge you to be present, active and vigilant in the matters which are important to you: some of them are very important to us too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to call on the Portuguese Presidency to do anything, because that is not necessary, as they have worked to ensure effective cooperation. However, I would like to encourage you to do certain things in Feira."
"By way of preparation for the decisions to be taken in December, it should once again be made clear in Feira that the enlargement process needs to be tailored to each individual country, so as to bring those countries which are best prepared into the European Union at an earlier stage."
"With regard to institutional issues, it should be made clear at the summit that enhanced cooperation cannot be used as an excuse for failing to introduce proper extension of qualified majority voting."
"As far as we are concerned, the extension of qualified majority voting will be a yardstick for the success of the Nice Summit, and it is linked with Parliament' s involvement through codecision."
"We need to achieve efficiency and legitimacy, that is very important."
"Furthermore, we urge you to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference such that it can be concluded in Nice but also so that certain important areas can be included."
"An attempt must be made to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding."
"It needs to be made clear that we need a voice in economic and monetary policy and democratic control of economic and monetary policy."
"Progress should at least be made with streamlining the treaties and demarcating competences."
"At this point I would particularly like to mention the common foreign and security policy, which follows on from the implementation of the conclusions of the Helsinki and Cologne Summits, and has made good progress under the Portuguese Presidency."
"We wish to encourage you to prepare the way so that we take the right decisions over the next six months."
"Mr President, I would also like to draw the attention of the Portuguese Presidency to the fact that the aim of Article 8 of our resolution is, from within the European Parliament, to make a positive contribution to resolving the running conflict with Austria."
"Needless to say, we are addressing you personally in your role of Portuguese Presidency."
"We want at all costs to avoid this becoming an EU-wide issue or its becoming a formal item on the agenda."
"But we hope that you, in a creative manner and on an informal basis, will manage to find ways to talk about this at Feira."
"My group chairman has made reference to the situation in Denmark, namely the euro referendum."
"Let us also look at the possible consequences if your efforts were not to lead to solutions."
"In my opinion, we will need to establish in time within the European Union that Feira has been a historic opportunity to solve this issue."
"I am therefore urging you to also assess the actions of the Austrian Government and to look for creative solutions in order to break the deadlock."
"Mr President, many have already pointed to the need for enlargement and the fear that has swept countries in Central and Eastern Europe that, with regard to the IGC, too little progress is being made and that, along with this, the chance for rapid enlargement will pass."
"I would advise you to let the political will prevail in Feira too in order to let the enlargement go ahead."
"Finally, Mr President, good governance is all well and good in theory, but let us also look at what is happening in practice."
"If the Kosovo agency in Thessaloniki is still caught up in so much red-tape that funding cannot be made available, then this is extremely serious."
"I would also call on the Portuguese Presidency to find a solution to this."
"Mr President, the forthcoming summit at Santa Maria de Feira has been preceded by an almost unprecedented number of pronouncements by key governmental figures."
"German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, described the federation model which could be realised in approximately thirty-five years' time, if such a thing is desired, but not the first steps that have to be taken in its construction."
"Tony Blair, whose government repeatedly prevents the taxation package from getting through, and José Maria Aznar, whose government blocks the notion of a European limited company, together declared that they approve of the economic structures of the European Union."
"Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder announced that their countries are prepared for deeper integration as a core group, failing, however, to illustrate its nature or extent."
"I wish to present my message clearly and to a purpose."
"It is: let us attend first - and also -to the basic and important matters."
"From the point of view of the citizens of the Union the most important issue at the meeting in Feira, too, will be economic growth and employment in the EU area."
"That will best be dealt with by removing the remaining barriers to the real Internal Market and attending to the implementation of the Lisbon decisions, with state decisions and investment in infrastructure according to the Swedish model, without simply leaving everything to market forces and sighing with relief."
"We may well ask whether the new spectrum network auctions, worth hundreds of billions of euros, arranged by the states, are promoting a consumer-friendly future for networking."
"In the remote regions of the Union we are still wondering, after the Volvo-Scania episode, whether the Internal Market even exists, or is it so, in terms of competition legality, that only companies in the midst of the market may take advantage of the economics of corporate growth, and the sparsely populated remote regions are the markets for these privileged few."
"The candidate countries, on the other hand, must want to know what sort of Union they are joining in the ten or twenty year term."
"The big visions, on the one hand, and the Austrian boycott, on the other, cannot be creating a climate of any great confidence in these countries."
"Mr President, I believe that the quantity and quality of the speakers on the Charter of Fundamental Rights illustrates the importance this House attaches to it."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would urge you to see to it that the hearing you are to hold on the 19th with the President of the Convention, Mr Herzog, should not be a mere formality."
"It is not simply a question of listening to the President of the Convention, but also of listening to the actual problems which are being faced by the Convention at the moment, of asking what the final objective of the Charter is and of knowing how it is going to proceed."
"I believe that it would be of great help to the Convention if, in its conclusions, the European Council could make a statement on the future of the Charter, because it appears at the moment that its formulation has demonstrated that the Charter is of interest to the people."
"The participation of the NGOs, the participation of ordinary people, clearly show that Europeans are interested in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The institutional questions of the Intergovernmental Conference are enormously important, but they do not reach the people."
"I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights does reach the people."
"The Charter must be the soul of the European Union and, therefore, at a time when we are discussing enlargement, I believe that the European Council - which has promoted the creation of the Charter - must send a clear political message: the Charter is going to be a very important element of the European Union."
"Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I pray that in the Feira conclusions, which we will all read with enormous interest, the Charter will receive the boost that it deserves, so that the Convention will be able to complete its work properly."
"In that way we will fulfil the mandate of Salvador de Madariaga, for whom Europe would become a reality only when it is a reality in the minds of the citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this was an important debate which has acted as a real stimulus for the Feira European Council."
"I congratulate the quality of the interventions of which the Presidency will take due note as it should."
"This European Council, as has been said, will have a very full agenda with the Intergovernmental Conference, the approval to include closer cooperation and other items."
"We must be aware that the whole Conference is set out according to the decisions taken in Amsterdam."
"This is not the definitive Intergovernmental Conference on the big reform of Europe."
"It is a Conference which has a specific mandate of technical refinement, particularly in terms of the decision-making systems, in order to allow enlargement."
"We also cannot allow third countries to believe that an excessive extension of the Conference is deliberately intended to guarantee an excessive delay in enlargement."
"The enlargement of the EU will be broadly consolidated at the European Council."
"This meeting will include a fairly positive progress report, a fundamental step forward for the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the application of the Information Technologies Programme for Europe, the adoption of the Action Plan for the Northern Dimension and the approval of the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean following the first two Association Councils with Palestine and Israel."
"It will also cover the definition of the external action programme in the area of justice and internal affairs, the White Paper on food safety, the European Charter for Small Enterprises, some important resolutions on economic and financial affairs, the entry of Greece into the euro and, as we would also want, a happy resolution of the problem of income taxes."
"It is a full agenda but one which shows how the European Union is advancing on all fronts."
"The EU has not been paralysed."
"On the contrary, it is advancing on both its internal fronts and also in external relations, which is extremely important."
"The issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been raised here. I must stress that the European Union has adopted a methodology for drawing up this Charter which involves a convention."
"The Convention will have to complete its work and decide on many aspects which have not yet been decided. These include determining whether the Charter is just a document setting out principles or whether it is to be incorporated in the Treaties, whether or not the Charter will be one of the primary examples of closer cooperation, how this will be applied to the citizens, whether just to native Europeans or to other residents in EU countries, or to foreigners or even illegal immigrants - this is a problem which has not yet been decided - how it will be linked to the European Convention on Human Rights and how it will be linked to the national courts and to the existing or remodelled European courts."
"All these points are extremely important."
"I understand the appeal made in this House but must point out that this is not a direct responsibility of this European Council."
"In order to take this issue forward, we have decided to invite the Chair of the Convention, Mr Herzog, to contribute to this high-level exchange of views which, I am sure, will stimulate the Convention' s work of drawing up the Charter."
"I must also say something on the Austria issue."
"As you know, this is a bilateral issue between 14 countries, which are also Member States, and one country which is a Member State too."
"However, this is not an EU issue or one for the EU bodies."
"No decision has been taken by any EU body although, naturally, we are all Member States."
"The Portuguese Presidency has always taken the precaution of making this distinction clear, that this was not an EU issue."
"On one hand this was to protect the normal operation of the European Union and the achievement of the EU agenda and on the other so as not to create any obstacle for Austria with regard to its full participation in the life of the EU and its bodies."
"Whenever any failure to abide by this principle has been pointed out to us, the Presidency has informed the bodies or institutions concerned to stop them acting in this way."
"This has been a constant concern."
"The Portuguese Prime Minister and I have been in contact with the other thirteen countries and with Austria and we are still doing this."
"I have asked the Members of this Parliament who raised the issue to be aware that it is very difficult to adopt a balanced approach to this problem if an immediate solution is demanded."
"I realise that the attitude adopted will have to include an element of phasing and that it is very difficult for a solution to this issue to be based on a diktat. A development may occur based on the maintenance of constant political attacks on people, political personalities and governments or even based on threats about stopping the operation and decisions of the European Union."
"In order to produce a window of opportunity in this issue, the political rhetoric that has surrounded it must be curbed, toned down or put on hold for the time being."
"Naturally, measures which were adopted in a diplomatic context through the consensus of the 14 Member States will only be able to change also through consensus between these 14 countries."
"The conditions for this consensus need to be created and we believe that, in this respect, Austria is creating conditions in order to solve this problem."
"Conditions also need to be created so that the 14 Member States can establish a new consensus."
"This must be borne in mind."
"I would call for your moderation and I very much respect the correct way, as Members of this Parliament, that you have raised this problem in this session and have considered it but it is also necessary to create the conditions so that there can be a window of opportunity."
"The following concept must be taken into account. The Feira European Council is an EU body and no window of opportunity can be opened at this meeting because we have to deal with the agenda and the areas of action of the EU."
"However, we can deal with this issue in a bilateral context before the European Council - and this is partly what we are trying to do - or after the European Council. But please do not expect the Feira European Council to deal with an item which is not on the agenda and which, if placed solely on the shoulders of the European Council, will end up prejudicing the arguments to which this problem has very rightly given rise here."
"To conclude, the assessment of our Presidency will be made here next week by the Portuguese Prime Minister."
"For my part I must also thank France and stress the way in which we have cooperated over the transition between presidencies. I especially thank the European Parliament, which has stimulated us in its role as a real parliamentary institution, throughout our Presidency, for all its cooperation on the European agenda and for the dynamic, lively, creative and constructive way in which, during these six months, it has carried out its duties as the parliamentary body of the Union."
"Thank you, Minister."
"I wish you and your government a successful conclusion to the Portuguese Presidency."
"Mr President, I should just like to thank the President-in-Office for the care and attention, as a politician, that he has shown in listening to the debate and the concerns that have been raised."
"Mr Cox, I think that, with your words, you are indeed voicing the feelings of many."
"I now give the floor to Mr Barnier, on behalf of the European Commission, for another brief intervention."
"Mr President, having listened very carefully to all the speakers, I would like to add a few words despite the very full agenda. Thank you for the quality and frankness of your speeches."
"Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo, I hereby confirm the commitment I made to you yesterday on behalf of the Commission on the status of European political parties."
"The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities."
"It will take the initiative."
"And, with the support of your President, it is planning to use the next trialogue to identify the ideal approach, in agreement with the three institutions, but in the meantime we are getting the initiative ready."
"I would like to say a word on Croatia to Mr Barón Crespo."
"You are right to highlight the strategic nature of the country, formerly part of Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, the Commission is currently preparing for negotiations which should open before the end of the year for an association and stabilisation agreement with Croatia."
"In July we will have already drawn up the directives for undertaking these negotiations."
"Similarly, we have already begun to negotiate an agreement with Macedonia and we are thinking about negotiating another with Albania."
"Thirdly, I cannot accept the suggestion from Mr Wurtz that the Commission is somehow being swept away by some kind of liberal tide."
"Mr President, the Commission is doing its duty and shouldering its responsibilities."
"This is particularly true when it is faithful to the guidelines and decisions of a European Council."
"That is what we are doing after Lisbon."
"But we are also doing so, Mr President, by remaining faithful to the letter and the spirit of the Treaties, and especially to one article in the Treaty which I have good reason to remember, the article guaranteeing the specific nature of public service missions."
"These are the two requirements we are working to, and which we have worked to in particular in drafting the directive on postal services you alluded to, where I think a good balance has been achieved."
"It is more surprising that you criticised some commissioners for holding a dialogue with employers."
"It seems to me that we need to have such a dialogue with employers, and with trade unionists too, and non-governmental organisations, if we are to do our work properly."
"Mr Wurtz, you know very well that Brussels is not the only place, and I smile when I say this, where politicians of right or left meet employers."
"Finally, I share the opinion expressed by Mr Cox and Mrs Berès on the deadlines that need to be respected in the great European debate."
"I am grateful to a number of major operators in the construction of Europe - Mr Fischer recently, and before him, Mr Delors and others - for opening up the debate."
"The worst things for the construction of Europe we are so committed to, ladies and gentlemen, are silence and secrecy, and in negotiating this reform with others, I have feared that silence."
"Mr Fischer and others have provided oxygen, a horizon."
"We need that oxygen, we need that horizon for the great European debate. But please, let us respect all the stages and work through them one by one."
"The first deadline to be met, as you said, Mr President, is the reform deadline so that we are in a good position to undertake enlargement and also so that other reforms can follow."
"So let us keep to those deadlines and dedicate ourselves, in the few months that lie ahead, to success in the negotiations."
"I am not just saying complete them."
"I am talking about success."
"Success in Nice."
"And, as far as I am concerned, the quality of reform is more important than the timetable."
"Concluding successfully is more than simply concluding."
"With the Portuguese Presidency coming to an end and the French Presidency about to begin, we must now put all our energies into achieving real reform at Nice to make enlargement possible, as well as other reforms later, if need be."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Mr President, I failed to catch the President's eye this morning."
"We should not allow this plenary session to pass without paying some attention to the fact that the Nobel laureate and Sakharov Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, is still denied her freedom."
"It is exactly ten years since she and the National League for Democracy won that election which the dictators proceeded to completely ignore."
"There has been a whole decade of dictatorship in that country."
"Next Monday, Aung San Suu Kyi will be 55 years old."
"It is a very poignant birthday for her."
"In March, her husband died of cancer."
"He asked for permission to visit her to say goodbye to his dear wife."
"The military junta in Burma refused permission for him to see her."
"These military dictators remain terrified of a small and gentle woman who has no malice, no uniforms or tanks to protect her."
"She and the people of Burma will not give up."
"What I am asking today is for the European Parliament to do what she asks."
"She says: ""Please use your liberty to support ours""."
"I ask the President of this Parliament to write to the military junta in Burma to say: stop the human rights abuses, return to democracy and give freedom to Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Mrs Kinnock, I thank you for your words."
"I think that you have spoken on behalf of many."
"We feel great solidarity with this Sakharov Prize winner and I will pass on your request to the President of this Parliament."
"I now give the floor to Mr Lechner on a point of order."
"Mr President, in connection with yesterday' s vote in this House, I simply wanted to draw honourable Members' attention to a press release I have just seen, according to which the Irish Attorney General, Nial Fennelly, has just called on the European Court of Justice to declare the directive banning tobacco advertising approved by a majority of this House null and void because of its inadequate legal basis."
"I am saying this because my amendment and my request that the procedure and the vote should be deferred by a further four weeks were not accepted yesterday."
"I think that it would have been better if the majority in this House had paid greater attention to the legal basis and had checked it more carefully, and if it had paid more attention to the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on that matter."
"I would recommend that the Commission withdraw its proposal, even if it does not relate to exactly the same thing."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will not re-open the debate on this."
"We discussed and concluded this matter yesterday."
"Mr President, I can imagine that a number of MEPs who were against this directive at the time are now satisfied with it."
"I think that congratulations are in order for Mr Lechner. It is fortunate that the directive which we voted on yesterday is so different in nature that we really do not need to expect a similar kind of judgement from the Advocate-General or from the Court."
"Yesterday' s directive is based on three existing directives, two of which have already been before the Court."
"I am therefore completely satisfied with the vote as it was held yesterday."
"Good, we have taken note of this."
"Vote"
"If I am taking the floor, it is because there are two serious errors in the Danish translation of point 8 concerning Austria."
"The words of the English text, which I understand to be the basic text, are: ""asked the Council presidency""."
"In the Danish text, the words ""Council presidency"" have been translated by the word ""Rådet"", and there is no mention of the presidency."
"This is a serious political and translation error."
"But, in addition, there is another error, namely that the following words have been included in the English text: ""with all the parties in the EU concerned"", and those words are quite simply not included in the Danish text."
"I would urge that a correct Danish translation of the text be obtained, for I find it a very serious matter that, in point 8 concerning Austria, these two mistakes have been made which, from a political point of view, completely alter the sense."
"I have consulted the services involved."
"They will take note of this and will make the necessary corrections."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0505/2000) by Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the provision of a common European security and defence policy, with a view to the European Council of Feira"
"With regard to paragraph 38:"
"Mr President, there is a small translation problem in paragraph 38."
"Reference is made to a 'European interparliamentary body on security and defence' ."
"The word 'organe' has been correctly used in the French version."
"Initially I had proposed the term 'forum' , but discussions in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy produced a compromise and we agreed o use an equivalent of the French 'organe' instead."
"In the English version the word should be 'body' , and, probably, 'Gremium' in the German."
"My knowledge of the other languages is insufficient."
"But I wanted to highlight that point so that the various language versions can be corrected."
"Many thanks, Mrs Lalumière, we will take care of this."
"We will make every effort in order to make sure that this is done."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"on the outcome of the Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations entitled ""Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century"" of 5-9 June 2000"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"I now give the floor to Mrs McCarthy on a procedural motion."
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I object to Mr Lechner's attempt to mislead this House on an interim court ruling that has come out of the European Court of Justice on the ban on tobacco advertising, not on health warnings, which is what we voted on yesterday."
"Mr Lechner should be aware that the judgement is interim and that we will not have a final judgement until the autumn."
"Furthermore, the Legal Affairs Committee ignored the advice of Parliament's legal services that the legal base for this directive was correct."
"I can understand Mr Lechner's frustration as he and some of the members of his group worked closely with industry to try and frustrate this resolution, but we cannot have the politics of the press release overturning decisions of this House."
"Thank you, Mrs McCarthy."
"I have taken due note of this."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Murphy Report (A5-0154/2000)"
"Mr President, congratulations to Parliament for adopting this directive which compels firms which are overdue in settling their debts to add on 7% interest."
"I voted for the motion and the result is successful, but I would like to know how much longer we will have to wait before Parliament votes for interest and compensation to be paid in cases where governments delay pension payments?"
"There are delays in pension payments in all 15 of the Member States."
"And why should citizens who receive late payment from public bodies not also receive compensation of 7%?"
"I voted for the motion in the hope that this further step will be taken as well."
"Mr President, at second reading I voted against both the reduction in the payment period from 30 to 21 days, and against the proposed interest level of 8%."
"I am still convinced that an interest rate at the 6% level originally proposed by the Council would suit business better."
"I cannot say that I am entirely in agreement with the compromise reached in the Conciliation Committee, but in view of the importance of this directive for cross-border trade and the operation of the single market, I finally voted for the version now before us."
"First I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and my colleagues who participated in the conciliation meetings and had to battle hard with a Council of Ministers more than a little reluctant to progress legislation on late payment, which is an absolute scandal considering the economic problems oppressing SMEs."
"It has to be recognised that late payment is the chief cause of the cases of insolvency threatening the survival of many firms, making them bankrupt, which translates into job losses."
"The national regulations aimed at managing this problem differ considerably from one Member State to another."
"Hence the interest in adopting legislation aimed at harmonising the provisions relating to late payment, due dates and the legal rate of interest at European level as soon as possible."
"A legal framework needs to be established to discourage late payment and give creditors the right to fair compensation in case of late payment."
"That is the purpose of the directive we are debating today."
"The negotiations on this text were difficult."
"A common position was finally adopted on 29 May last."
"The European Parliament emerged from those long negotiations victorious on several crucial points."
"The differences of opinion between Parliament and Council focussed around the difference in treatment between the public and private sectors, which have finally been placed on an equal footing."
"As regards retention of title, Parliament fought to have this provision included in the text of the directive."
"Thus, the Member States must ensure that the seller retains title in the goods until full settlement, while complying with the applicable national provisions."
"As regards the anti-abuse clause, the European Parliament refused to give precedence to freedom of contract to the detriment of the creditor."
"The directive therefore provides that, when an agreement mainly serves the purpose of procuring the debtor additional liquidity at the expense of the creditor or where the main contractor imposes on his suppliers and sub-contractors terms of payment which are not justified on the grounds of the terms granted to himself, such provisions may be considered to be factors constituting abuse."
"As to compensation, apart from the cases where the debtor is not responsible for the delay, the creditor is entitled as a result of this agreement to claim reasonable compensation from the debtor for all recovery costs incurred."
"This compensation may include the creditor' s borrowing costs or bank overdraft, administrative recovery costs paid for by the creditor company, recovery costs of debt recovery organisations and recovery costs arising from legal action."
"On interest, Parliament and the Council reached agreement on a rate of 7% above Central European Bank rate, making a total of 10.5% at the present time."
"The European Parliament wanted to reduce the period after which interest is due for late payment to 21 days from the date of receipt of the invoice rather than 30 days as envisaged by the Council."
"In the end the period of 30 days was maintained, but with the proviso that it may give rise to action for compensation if it constitutes a manifest abuse against the creditor."
"To conclude, the result of the conciliation was satisfying as a number of the European Parliament' s wishes are incorporated."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this text."
"- Although I am aware that what I do here is of no interest to other Members of this institution, my real audience is my own constituents."
"It is to them that I wish to explain my actions."
"Accordingly, I have to state for the record - for reasons I am not allowed space to expound on - that I do not believe this directive can or will address the real problems of businesses."
"Mainly, however, I am against this directive because it brings to the fore the foreign nature of the system in which the UK is embroiled."
"The central fact is that it was first presented to this assembly on 17 September 1998."
"That was before the last European elections."
"In other words, we have a new Parliament installed by a new electorate."
"But despite that, the directive goes on."
"This shows the change of Parliament was cosmetic - a charade."
"All the electorate has been allowed to do is shuffle the deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic."
"Meanwhile, the project continues to sink into the bureaucratic bog."
"I hope I am here to see it finally disappear but, in the meantime, I have voted against this measure."
"- I congratulate my Labour colleague, Simon Murphy, on his recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on tackling late payments in commercial transactions."
"This demonstrates yet again Labour's commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across Europe."
"Late payment often suffocates many credible businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies."
"Consequently, many are tragically forced into receivership, through no fault of their own."
"This measure, however, will help allow small businesses to fight back."
"Creditors will be entitled to charge a statutory interest rate of 7% on their debts, encouraging debtors to pay early."
"Furthermore, if debts are not repaid, creditors will also be able to claim compensation form debtors for recovery costs."
"By introducing greater certainty in business transactions across Europe, small companies will gain confidence in trading, not just across Britain, but right across the European Single Market."
"Membership of the Single Market the largest trading bloc in the world, is crucial for jobs in the North West."
"Nearly 40% of small and medium sized enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States."
"As a part of the EU Single Market, they have access to over 370m potential customers - over 6 times more than in Britain alone."
"In a few years' time, following the enlargement of the European Union, they will have access to a potential 500m customers - as big as the American and Japanese markets put together."
"The Labour Government is determined to make the Single Market work for British business."
"By giving UK businesses the confidence to reach into these markets, this measure will contribute to this aim and will increase trade, growth and employment across both the North West and all of Britain."
"Maaten Report (A5-0160/2000)"
"Mr President, congratulations to Parliament for also voting in favour of keeping derogations regarding the importing of alcoholic products and the continued application of excise duty payments."
"I voted against this measure."
"I often imagine that when the Ministers for Finance see one of us, a citizen - many of which are pensioners - drinking wine, whisky, vodka or any sort of alcohol, they say ""Goody goody! More duty."
"This will be good for the balance sheet"" ."
"But is it right that the tax systems of our States should benefit every single time we drink a glass of wine?"
"I do not think so!"
"I therefore voted against the motion."
"- (SV) We have voted against approving the Commission' s and the Swedish Government' s agreement gradually to abolish the derogations concerning the rules governing imports of alcohol and tobacco into Sweden."
"The Swedish Government has caved in to the supremacy of EU bureaucracy and abandoned its previous position to the effect that questions relating to excise duties are to be decided unanimously by the Council."
"Its action is also a breach of the pledge which the yes side issued before the Swedish referendum."
"This pledge meant that the powerful temperance movement did not campaign against Swedish membership of the EU, which was probably the decisive factor in Sweden' s becoming a member of the EU."
"We would nonetheless welcome much of what is contained in the Maaten report, which admits clearly and unambiguously that alcohol policy is a health-related issue and not, as the Commission sees it, solely a question of the internal market and of agricultural policy."
"In our view, the conclusions of the Maaten report are nonetheless contrary to the very spirit of the arguments which permeate the report."
"- (SV) Ever since it joined the EU, Sweden has been allowed to have different quotas for imports into Sweden of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products by individuals for their private use."
"As Minister for Agriculture, I was involved in negotiating this derogation from Article 26 of Directive 92/12/EEC prior to Sweden' s entry in 1994, and this derogation has already been extended once."
"I can make no other assessment than that, for Sweden, this was a fixed-term derogation which would one day come to an end in favour of current Community directives."
"Through its actions, the Swedish Government has helped obscure this fact in the course of the debate of recent years."
"This has also meant that, in spite of knowing the implications of the derogation, it has avoided taking those measures required for the purpose of adjusting both its domestic market and those tools which Sweden has used as part of its alcohol policy."
"Following its informal promise to the Commission to approve the proposal, the Swedish Government must now appreciate the need to adjust its alcohol policy and find other methods of controlling alcohol consumption in the country and of limiting alcohol-related harm."
"It is time the Government realised this."
"In view of the outcome of the accession negotiations and the Social Democratic Government' s handling of the issue, I see no reason for doing anything other than vote in favour of the report."
"- (SV) Since Sweden' s entry into the EU, the Swedish Christian Democrats have worked to make the Swedish derogation in Council Directive 92/12/EEC, relating to the import of alcohol, permanent."
"We believe that this is a prerequisite of being able to continue to pursue the successful alcohol policy which, in Sweden, has led to a lower level of harm caused by alcohol than in other EU countries and so to a good standard of public health."
"Now that the Commission is rejecting Sweden' s argument and placing the emphasis upon the operation of the internal market, we fear that alcohol policy will sustain great damage in Sweden."
"There is also a lack of consistency when, on the one hand, exports of Swedish snuff to other EU countries are banned for health reasons and, on the other hand, appeal is made to the free market, and health aspects are set aside on the issue of imports of alcohol."
"We think it very unfortunate that the Swedish Social Democratic Government has chosen not to pursue this issue more vigorously."
"An assessment of the derogation by the courts against the background of Sweden' s argument on public health grounds would have been an option which is not now being made use of."
"Because we consider that both the Swedish Government and the European Commission have acted incorrectly on this issue, we choose to signal our rejection of their approach by abstaining in the vote on the extension to Sweden' s derogation from the Council Directive."
"Meeting of the European Council in Feira (RC B5-0522/2000)"
"Mr President, I would like to make it known, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we have abstained in the vote on the final resolution, despite the fact that we clearly support the resolution on the issues which are within the competence of the European Council in Feira, that is to say, the Intergovernmental Conference and the economic and social agenda."
"With regard to the case of Austria, we understand that, firstly, the European Parliament' s resolution, which was voted for at the time, is still in force, since no new events have occurred; because it is not a Community issue as such, but has been raised by the fourteen Member States; because, furthermore, my Group supported President Klestil' s appearance and we took good note of his positive proposals, which are in fact related to issues which come within the competence of the Commission - which is not present - such as the application of Article 7 and the strengthening of our community of values."
"We believe that this inclusion has not been appropriate in terms of improving the process, it is untimely, and furthermore, we believe that the best way to create new circumstances is not for one party, as Mr Galeote himself has said today, to set conditions and also demand guarantees from a party which belongs to the same group and is in the Austrian Government."
"Their content has not even been considered. Furthermore, it is not acceptable that we have to endure a campaign of provocation, threats and insults not only by members of the Austrian Government, but also by the political forces which support it."
"This is not the best way to improve our relations."
"For that reason - because we believe that we have to continue working for the European Union and we do not believe that the best approach is to take shortcuts with regard to such a serious issue - for that reason, we have abstained."
"Mr President, there seems to be a trial of strength going on behind the scenes, during preparations for next week' s Feira European Council, between those who want to extend the Intergovernmental Conference agenda and those who want to cut it."
"That split conceals another: the first group includes the supporters of a great federalist leap forward and realists who are beginning to wonder if a totally integrated Europe - economically and politically - really amounts to the correct solution faced with enlargement and the democratic deficit."
"It gives me some satisfaction to say that the second category looks like winning, which suits us fine."
"The only point that needs to be added is acceptable to us, as it is about increasing the possibility of so-called 'enhanced cooperation' ."
"We prefer to call it 'differentiated cooperation' , to make it clear that this does not mean driving Europe up a one way street to federalism but instead leaving Member States free to explore, applying variable geometry, the cooperation they consider most in line with their vision of the future and their interests."
"Anyway, whatever the term used - 'enhanced' or 'differentiated' cooperation, the main thing in our view is to take the first step and open discussions, breaking the now totally deadlock of the European system."
"I would add that we think the new differentiated cooperation should be applicable to security policy so that it can be developed on a voluntary basis and in respect for national sovereignty."
"Finally, if the Feira Council is going to deal with the Charter of Fundamental Rights we want it kept off the IGC agenda so that it can take the form of a statement not incorporated into the Treaty."
"As I have already had occasion to say in this House and in the forum responsible for drawing up the Charter, it would certainly be useful to proclaim our common values - if it is done well - but we must not deprive our peoples of the freedom to define the rights of their own citizens themselves."
"Mr President, I am sorry you are forced to stay here for a while - I know you are hungry. But - and I am speaking to you as a Vice-President - it just goes to show the extent to which this period of explanations of vote attracts Members' attention and how appropriate it would be, in the restructuring you are currently looking at, to examine whether explanations of vote on major issues should not take place - as used to happen - before the vote and not at a time when everyone gets bored because all we can do is stay here listening to each other."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals in this explanation of vote to justify our vote in favour, stressing that, in spite of everything, this resolution contains important points, including the need for dialogue, the need to get past the stage of pseudo-sanctions against Austria - which has not been constructive - and make sure the Minutes state that the vote also includes an important request we formulated last April and which we now reiterate: review of the seat of the institutions."
"Parliament has spoken very clearly."
"Yesterday we gave a practical demonstration of our position by abolishing the Friday sittings."
"I think it is high time account was taken in the Treaty reforms of our determination to insist finally on a status that makes us masters of our own procedure, and masters of our own decisions as to the seat and meeting place of our institution."
"That is what we said and that is why we voted in favour of it."
"Mr Dell' Alba, with regard to the first part of your intervention, we are indeed in the throes of internal reform of this House."
"The debate has started and your opinion on the explanations of vote will also certainly be of value in due course."
"Thank you for your reaction."
"Mr President, I noted that Amendment No 11 included the proposition that the Community should take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed actions cannot be adequately achieved by the Member States or - and I emphasis this - their constituent states with legislative powers that have been conferred on them by national constitutional law."
"I thought that part of the amendment was very valuable although there were other aspects of it which I could not support."
"I regret that the topic of subsidiarity is substantially missing from the Feira resolution."
"On that account I did not vote for it."
"Mr President, we in the Swedish delegation of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats are working for a rapid enlargement of the Union and do not wish to delay the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The intention in the resolution is that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be incorporated into the Treaty in the course of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Charter is required for the purpose of providing the Union' s present and future citizens with constitutional guarantees."
"There are left-wing forces which wish to introduce social objectives into the Treaty. Our view is that it may damage the Union to introduce economic and social rights which it would be difficult for the courts to guarantee and which would affect the national tax burden."
"Mr President, I am speaking briefly to justify my abstention."
"I am naturally in agreement with the main points in the text voted on, covering the institutions, the follow-up to the Lisbon European Council and aspects of fiscal policy and certainly food safety problems."
"But, given the circumstances, I could not vote in favour of paragraph 8 on Austria."
"I think the President-in-Office of the Council clarified matters greatly as to the method followed by the Fourteen, specifically asking Parliament not to consider voting to allow the contacts currently taking place between the foreign affairs ministers to achieve a result."
"I am astonished at this and I agree with what Mr Dell' Alba said, about the low regard in which Parliament holds the concept of parliamentary debate, because if it had been possible for the groups to discuss the matter and adopt a position - and there reform was important - after the speech by the President of the Council, I am certain that the vote would not have been the one we have recorded."
"That is why I felt I had to abstain."
"As we vote on the joint resolution on the Feira Summit, I want to pay great tribute to the importance of the work of the Portuguese Presidency, its readiness to listen, its dynamism and its approachability."
"Although, unfortunately, not everything I had hoped for appears in the joint resolution - in particular, the need for a framework directive on public services - I find many of the proposals acceptable, and on all those points it is undoubtedly one of the best resolutions we have dealt with in the current political composition of the European Parliament."
"Unfortunately, the right wing has introduced a paragraph concerning Austria into this resolution."
"I find that quite unacceptable at a time when 'warning lights are flashing' and there is evidence to show that the alliance with the Austrian extreme right is beginning to gain a lot of ground."
"It is now more than ever essential to fight fascists, neo-fascists and their accomplices."
"The very future of Europe is at stake."
"And that is why, whatever the quality of a text devoted to Feira, and the work and conclusions of the Portuguese Presidency, there can be no question for me of validating, even marginally, even implicitly, a shameful alliance with implications which could prove tragic for Europe."
"Hence my militant abstention on this text!"
"Shame on the sorcerer' s apprentices!"
"Now, 60 years after the Nazi invasion of 1940 and 55 years after the end of a horrible European and world conflict, how can some people, for base electioneering purposes, have 'such short memories' ?"
"- (NL) The Belgian Socialist MEPs have abstained from the vote on the resolution concerning the preparation of the Feira Summit."
"The adoption of an appeal to the Heads of Government to review their attitude towards the Austrian Government has left the doors wide open to the extreme right wing in this government being trivialised."
"This is unacceptable to us."
"The Belgian MEPs of the PSE Group regret that, for these reasons, they were unable to assent to this otherwise sound resolution."
"- In general the Liberals support the motion, but we would have preferred a shorter and sharper text that focused exclusively on the politics of the European Council, and had clearer messages for the heads of government."
"The ELDR Group has requested split votes on various items within the Joint Motion for a Resolution, as follows: in paragraph 7 we seek to delete the second half of the sentence in order to reinforce the imperative of enlargement; in paragraph 9 we seek to remove the last clause because we know that the Lebanese government is indeed trying to reassert control over all its territory, but is prevented from doing so by forces beyond its control; in paragraph 14 we seek to delete the reference to Nato on the grounds that all EU member states are directly concerned with this issue; in paragraph 19 we seek to delete the reference to the Observatory of Industrial Change; and in paragraph 24 we seek to focus the text on the political message needed for Feira."
"- This resolution contains many points that I fully support on the IGC, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other aspects of Community policy."
"However, I find myself unable to support it because of the inclusion of paragraph 8 on Austria."
"I was proud of the EU when it imposed sanctions on Austria when the new coalition formed because of the views and actions of the Freedom Party: a party whose policies have xenophobia running through them like Blackpool through rock; a leader who has praised Hitler and the Waffen SS, refused to condemn terrorist bombings against Roma and congratulates Nazi war veterans for keeping to their principles."
"Since then little has changed."
"Freedom Party ministers continue to echo Nazi party slogans and rhetoric of the Thirties and Forties."
"It is too soon now to allow Austria fully back into the European fold."
"It will send the wrong message to the Freedom Party and their fellow travellers elsewhere in Europe."
"In memory of the victims of yesterday I will vote ""no"" to their collaboration with the criminals of tomorrow."
". (EL) Workers cannot and must not be under any illusions here."
"Greece' s accession to the third phase of EMU, which is to be decided at the European Council in Feira, will only reinforce anti-labour and anti-grass roots policies, despite the Greek Government' s attempt to portray it as a triumph for our country."
"As everyone knows, Greek workers and the entire Greek population have already paid a very high price for Greece' s full accession to EMU and, following the Feira decisions, they will continue to pay the cost of ""sustainability"" , i.e. staying in EMU, while large corporations and monopolies continue to step up their level of exploitation and increase their profits."
"The Feira Council is being called upon to promote the interests of big business even more resolutely and to promote the speedy militarization of the European Union by creating a European army whose main mission will be to intervene militarily in third countries and lend support to capitalist forces within the Member States of the EU itself, at the expense of the grass roots movement."
"This summit will strengthen measures to safeguard the ""internal security"" of capitalism by steering and crushing the grassroots movement when the EU Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the EU."
"The new revision of the Treaties being promoted at the Intergovernmental Conference will be the main item on the agenda at the Feira Summit."
"The aim is to legislate for the basic interests of monopolies, thereby making conditions even worse for workers, for the weaker sections of society and for the less ""powerful"" countries."
"Abolishing the veto, extending qualified majority voting in decision making and, more importantly, instituting ""enhanced cooperation"" and ""flexibility"" will all serve precisely these monopolistic interests under the guise of ""efficiency"" , thus giving powerful countries a fast track for exploiting both countries and people."
"Further dismantling of the social rights of workers, starting with the right to social security, is on the agenda of the Feira Summit."
"The report by the ""group of wise men"" and the decisions which will be taken will aim, on the pretext of combating unemployment, to sacrifice the rights paid for by workers with blood, sweat and tears on the alter of increased profits for the monopolies and ""competition"" , budgetary discipline and support for the euro."
"Workers will not fail to respond to these developments; they will oppose the interests of the monopolies and they will defend their own rights."
"As always, the Communist Party of Greece will be standing firmly by their side."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted neither for nor against the joint resolution concerning preparations for the European Council in Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000."
"We have done this because the opinion sends out some important political signals concerning the follow-up to the Lisbon Summit in March, namely about employment, the economy and combating social exclusion with the aid of the open coordination method, as well as about work on preventing unfair tax competition and efforts to secure safe food products."
"However, the resolution also contains a long section about the current Intergovernmental Conference and, in this connection, we should like to repeat that our vote in favour of the overall resolution does not alter our basic view that extending the agenda and turning the Treaty into a constitution, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporated into it with binding legal effect, will not enhance the possibility of achieving a satisfactory result in Nice in December, something which is absolutely crucial if the enlargement is to be able to go ahead once the countries concerned are ready."
"We have not, therefore, been able to vote for these sections, viewed in isolation."
"In paragraph 8 on Austria of the resolution approved on the Feira European Council, this House has ended up adopting a very hypocritical position which is in total contradiction of all the positions which it has previously taken on this issue."
"In my opinion, it is not a question of being against the principle of returning relations with Austria to normal."
"It is a question of the right opportunity and time for this political change to occur."
"A resolution on the European Council should specify that it is up to the latter to take this political change in hand by taking advantage of its meeting in Feira."
"However, this is not what the text does."
"On the contrary, it asks the Portuguese Presidency to do this."
"Clearly, at this point four days before the European Council, it is now the responsibility of this summit, as a whole and as the highest body of the Union, to take advantage of this historic opportunity to update the EU' s policy on Austria."
"Giving this task to the Portuguese Presidency is an attempt to place all the responsibility for what may happen on the shoulders of one country which cannot, at the wrong time and on its own, solve a problem which concerns us all."
"This is not to mention the reasons for this approval which are difficult to understand given the basic policy."
"After all, what has changed in Austria?"
"Has the government fallen?"
"Fortunately this small part of the text does not invalidate the rest of its content which I regard as positive."
"Unfortunately it was clearly much more to serve the petty interests of the Portuguese component of the PPE that this group adopted this position than due to the belief in and usefulness of this particular vote."
"- The EPLP voted for the resolution on the Santa Maria de Feira European Council on 19 and 20 June 2000 but does not support paragraph 19."
"The UK Government position, which is supported by the EPLP, is that it is better to allow this type of negotiation to be undertaken by the works councils."
"It is our belief that it would be more effective to advance the status of the European Companies Statute."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, but I would like to draw the European Council' s attention to how vital the adoption and full-scale implementation of the northern dimension programme will be at the Feira Summit."
"I believe that the northern dimension action programme will help to increase regional stability and security everywhere in Europe and strengthen economic and political developments in Europe' s northern regions."
"- (SV) I have voted against the resolution for the following reasons:"
"1."
"The resolution says nothing about the need to give priority to sustainable development and the integration of environmental issues into all the policy areas of the Community."
"2."
"The resolution does not repudiate militarisation of the EU and does not acknowledge that every military operation must have a UN mandate."
"3."
"Nor does the resolution make it clear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights must not come into conflict with other international conventions or with the International Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"4."
"The resolution does not emphasise that enlargement must be given absolute priority."
"Security and defence policy (B5-0505/2000)"
"Mr President, Mrs Cauquil and Mrs Bordes, who are also present, join me in this explanation of vote."
"We have voted against this resolution to affirm our opposition not only to a common European army but to national armies as well."
"The past half-century shows that the armies of the great imperialist powers of Europe, in alliance or each on its own hunting ground, were not there to defend the people, but to carry on wars of pillage."
"For example, the French army was used for the colonial wars: Madagascar, Indo-China, Algeria."
"Since these colonies became independent, it has intervened to support infamous dictatorships, especially in its former African colonies."
"The other former colonial powers of Europe have done the same in the same situation."
"The recent intervention by European armies against Serbia and Kosovo is certainly nothing to be proud of."
"The author of the report is careful not to specify which enemy the future European army is intended to fight."
"So what is it for and who is it against, if not to allow the great powers of Europe to be able to continue, on behalf of the European Union as a whole, their Community political game in Africa, the West Indies or elsewhere?"
"Consequently, not only do we refuse to vote in favour of any resources whatsoever, human or financial, for this army, but we protest against its very existence."
"Mr President, I would like to make an explanation of vote on behalf of my delegation and say right away that we intended to vote for Amendment No 26 and paragraph 27."
"We are, of course, anxious for crises to be solved by peaceful means and for peace to be maintained."
"After the terrible events over the last century none of us wants military conflicts."
"Nevertheless, the crisis in the Balkans has demonstrated the shortcomings of the European Union."
"We therefore support the creation of an effective common security and defence policy for the Union, with its own identity."
"We need to learn from our experience with the war in the Balkans, so that a disaster of this kind cannot be repeated."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam made the Petersberg tasks the responsibility of the Union."
"That leaves Article 5."
"We support the idea of incorporating this article as a protocol to the EU Treaty, but we would like to emphasise that the sovereignty of the Member States must be preserved when it comes to decisions regarding participation in military interventions."
"For several months, the European Union has been treading an extremely complicated path, punctuated by the Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon Councils and tomorrow by the Feira Council, to try to put in place what is called a 'common European security and defence policy' ."
"The exercise is complicated, first because it is necessary to try to clarify relations with NATO, and because the United States not to mention other countries in NATO which are not members of the European Union, like Turkey, are not making our task any easier."
"Everything is also made more difficult by the determination of the Union institutions to extend the scope of this new policy, by presenting it as 'a further step towards European political integration' , in the words of the resolution we have just voted on. In other words, it is another step towards supra-nationality."
"As regards the scope of this security policy, there is deliberate ambiguity."
"It would not, strictly speaking, be a matter of so-called Petersberg-style tasks (crisis prevention and peacekeeping in third countries, excluding defence of national territory or vital external interests), but the European Parliament constantly insists on raising a much larger objective, a common security and defence policy in the broad sense. In fact, that is the title of the resolution voted on today."
"Ambiguity is increased by the decision to implement common military resources intended to prevent crises (for example, the European rapid reaction force, of 50 000 to 60 000 men, agreed at Helsinki), which means the 'integrationists' can constantly play with words and put it about that there is some question of implementing a defence policy in the full sense of the word."
"In terms of both method and objective - political integration or cooperation - we think it is counterproductive to be constantly brandishing the prospect of a unitary and integrated supranational power."
"To act effectively we need to establish voluntary cooperation, with variable geometry, where Member States of the Union with an interest in this or that action would participate - and there is no reason why non-member states should not participate too, where appropriate."
"To summarise, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group believes in advancing towards common security actions, provided we do not get boxed into a rigid institutional system, but instead establish flexible procedures based on voluntary input and respect for national sovereignty."
"We are open to the idea of common security actions, which we believe Europe badly needs."
"But at the same time we must remain very clear about the conditions for them. It is impossible to hand over power of military decision (even if we are initially told that only Petersberg tasks will be involved) to very imperfectly democratic European institutions - and so they will remain, to human eyes, because there is no such thing as a European people."
"There are three consequences of that: the national democracies must always have the last word, so the operations concerned must remain in an inter-state context; decisions can in no case be taken by majority on issues of principle; the system must be based on the possibility of 'differentiated actions' permitting each people to exercise its freedom of choice without discontinuity."
"I hope the Feira Council will decide to add this issue to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"- (DA) We are voting against the overall resolution, which emphasises the desire to develop a military dimension to EU cooperation."
"We cannot support the general approach of the text, which acknowledges the need for a militarisation of the EU' s cooperation on defence and in that way fails to respect the non-aligned countries of the Union."
"Nor can we support the more concrete proposals in the resolution, which call for increased defence budgets in the individual Member States and coordination in purchasing military equipment and establishing an actual army for the Union."
"We can support the need to draw up a common code of conduct for arms dealing between Member States and between Member States and third countries, but we cannot support the creation of an internal market for the armaments industry, as also proposed in the resolution."
"We are against the proposal for a European army which, in the name of stability, democracy and humanitarianism, would in fact defend the EU zone of influence and protect the interests of multinationals on a global scale."
"A renewed arms race at local and regional level, along with an increase in military budgets will mean a remilitarisation of the world."
"Furthermore we are opposed to a 'high-tech' army for the EU, just as we reject NATO."
"Together, Europe and the United States are seeking to impose this army as the military arm of the IMF-World Bank-WTO triangle."
"The peoples do not need an army; they need a social policy which guarantees their welfare."
"That will not happen without a radical break from neo-liberalism."
"The military intervention in Kosovo has increased the poverty of the peoples and exacerbated xenophobia, thus proving that stability and democracy were certainly not the objectives of that war."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats support the proposal for a European defence and security policy, which is to be discussed at the Feira Summit in Portugal in June 2000."
"The proposal includes both visionary and rational proposals for a common defence and security policy."
"There are, nonetheless, a couple of areas where the Danish Social Democrats believe that care ought to be exercised."
"Careful consideration ought to be given to the way in which the European Parliament is to be involved in the area of defence and security policy."
"We are uneasy about the European Parliament' s influence in this area, for we believe that defence and security policy is predominantly an intergovernmental matter."
"The proposal paves the way for the increased use of majority decision-making, over and above what is laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam in connection with a common defence and security policy."
"We see no reason for extending majority decision-making into this area."
"With regard to necessary future investments in new technology and new equipment for the military, we think that these should be made possible through changes to the order of priorities in the national defence budgets."
"There is no need to increase the overall European defence budgets."
"We would also refer to the Danish reservation concerning common action in the defence sphere."
"- (SV) The main features of the text which has been debated today by the European Parliament are also to be found in a proposal which was presented by Mrs Lalumière in May to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and which was voted on in June."
"In accordance with the ordinary way in which matters are debated, the issue will again come up for debate at one or other of the European Parliament' s part-sessions this autumn."
"I find this duplicated work peculiar and difficult to understand."
"I have therefore chosen categorically to abstain in all votes on this subject, which is so important and fundamental to a non-aligned country like Sweden, blessed with peace since 1814."
"- (SV) It is extraordinary that the European Union should wish to implement a security policy designed to prevent and solve conflicts."
"The European Union possesses political, economic and diplomatic resources for this purpose."
"True, the resolution says it is desirable that non-military measures should be used first, but the possible use of military forces is not excluded."
"I cannot support the proposal that military resources should be used to defend the European Union' s interests."
"In my opinion, it should only be possible to take military action following a decision in the United Nations' Security Council."
"It is not enough just to follow the principles of the United Nations' Charter."
"I cannot, therefore, support the resolution."
"""Women 2000"" (RC B5-0562/2000)"
"Mr President, I would first of all like to make it clear that I am speaking on behalf of the Dutch members of the EDD Group."
"We voted against the present resolution by way of expressing our dissatisfaction regarding the conduct of the European Parliament delegation during the UN General Assembly."
"We received the news that Mrs Theorin, chairperson of our delegation at that assembly, campaigned formally and informally on behalf of the EP for the introduction of the right of women to free abortion in all UN countries."
"On behalf of the EP no less, she is exerting pressure on other countries, including Poland, to concur with the EU opinion."
"As MEPs, we disassociate ourselves from this opinion and consequently do not wish to take any responsibility in this respect."
"We are of the firm opinion that unborn life, as a gift from our Creator, is worth protecting."
"Moreover, the European Union has no authority at all under its treaties to force candidate countries to adopt specific legislation in this area of policy."
"We would therefore make it absolutely clear that the right to free abortion cannot be presented to the candidate countries as a criterion for entry into the EU."
"Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the results of the Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations entitled 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century' of 5-9 June 2000 held in New York and at which Astrid Lulling, Member of the European Parliament, participated."
"As co-signatory to that resolution, Mrs Lulling made the following statement in Strasbourg:"
"'I have just had the opportunity of attending the special General Assembly of the United Nations called from 5 to 9 June 2000 in New York to evaluate progress since the last UN world conference on women, which took place in 1995 in Beijing, on the implementation of the Beijing Action Platform."
"The Assembly was attended by some ten thousand women, making it the ideal meeting place for analysing the achievements of the last five years and comparing attitudes - which are very different moreover - on the need to accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform."
"Although we are not euphoric, the results of the Assembly are acceptable."
"Because of certain reactions in this Parliament, both today and yesterday during the debate, from some colleagues who were not in New York - reactions obviously based on misinformation and misunderstanding - I want to make it clear that the Members of the European Parliament present in New York did not speak on behalf of this Parliament without a mandate. Actually, they were not entitled to speak, given the procedure at special General Assemblies of the UN."
"It is the Presidency of the European Union that speaks on behalf of the Union at that kind of international conference."
"So there are no grounds for putting words into the mouths of the Members of the European Parliament present in New York on mere intent."
"Certainly we were active behind the scenes, if I can call it that, and we had informal but useful meetings with Members of Parliament from the Member States and the candidate countries for membership of the European Union attending as part of their national delegations."
"For my own part, I contributed with my colleagues in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, to dispelling an impression which prevailed notably among certain third country delegations, that, for the women of the European Union, in terms of gender equality, sexual orientation and abortion were the absolute priorities in the 21st century."
"Because people were putting words into the mouths of various parties, particularly Poland' s, I would like to specify that as regards gender equality, Poland is adopting the acquis communautaire and is not calling into question the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam on discrimination based on gender."
"But the Treaty of Amsterdam does not oblige Poland to legislate on abortion."
"It can be recommended to do so, but subsidiarity applies."
"I wanted to make that clear to dispel any misunderstanding about what really happened in New York."
"It is true that the militants of a certain sexual orientation - which is fortunately only a problem for a tiny minority of women in Europe and the world, and which is not mine - are much more visible, even in New York, than the millions of women who, because of their economic and social situation, have other preoccupations and priorities when it comes to gender equality.'"
"The final document from the Beijing + 5 conference which has just ended in New York is a victory for women."
"After very acrimonious negotiations, realism in appreciating the needs of women and respect for their dignity carried the day."
"But there was strong political pressure from the United States, Japan and the European Union, and strong ideological pressure from feminist NGOs generously financed by the Western countries."
"How, for instance, can the pressure exercised by the European Union on Nicaragua and Poland be justified?"
"How can so-called 'sexual and reproductive rights' be weighed against development aid or deadlines for joining the European Union?"
"The pressure on the poorest countries was so great that dozens of members of the American Congress and national or European Members of Parliament officially dissociated themselves from their delegations, expressly condemning their positions."
"Along the same lines, it is a real education to note that, although they are all officially specialised in the position of women, the NGOs with the largest financial resources for political communication systematically militate in favour of notions of 'reproductive health' to the detriment of more serious and urgent needs, thus offering unfailing support to the European and American delegations."
"In any case, if this conference was ultimately a success for women all over the world, that was mainly thanks to the realism and resistance of the poorest countries, which were able to by-pass Western ideological polemics about sexuality to promote practical measures against poverty - like 'micro-credit' , against international trafficking in women and against lack of education and medical provision."
"If the voice of the poorest countries was finally able to make itself heard last Saturday around 4 a.m. despite pressure of all kinds, we owe that to respect for essential principles, the only guarantees of realistic and moderate international policy, I mean the principles of national sovereignty and equality between States."
"In this case, the UN showed renewed respect for the rules of consensus after ignoring them for such a long time, and that respect made it possible to focus the negotiations on the real needs of women."
"We are glad the European Union has applauded this victory for women and respect for national sovereignty by adopting the final document."
"- There will always be differing opinions, this is the essence and vitality of democracy."
"The more sensitive the issue, the greater sensitivity must be shown in dealing with it."
"This was obviously not the case, neither in New York during the Beijing + 5 conference, nor in our debate in this Parliament yesterday."
"In the treatment of Poland and other candidate countries, fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity and the political values of this Parliament, as indeed of the new Europe we are in the process of creating, were not respected."
"Amendments put forward by the EU delegation in New York do not and could not represent a consensus position of the Member States of the Union: on the contrary, certain of these amendments flagrantly contravened the constitution of my country of Ireland, and I have no doubt the legislative position of other countries which seek to diminish rather than promote the practice of abortion."
"Regarding paragraph H of this resolution, ""sexual rights"" is an undefined term not included in Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty nor in the Beijing + 5 Platform for Action."
"This new undefined term causes great difficulty for many countries including mine, as it could for example imply support for the sexual rights of paedophiles."
"I will therefore abstain from voting on this resolution."
"We have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Robert Schuman Declaration, the father of Europe."
"We would surely want to uphold the spirit, the ideals, and the values which formed the foundation of our European unity."
"Part of the Schuman legacy is to respect the diversity of Europe and the emerging cultures of the developing world."
"Consensus should be our motif, not imposition or intimidation."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I did not intend to interfere with the order of business, but something very serious is happening in Parliament and I feel I must make you aware of what is going on."
"In the forecourt of the Parliament a shameful demonstration is - probably still - in progress. A large group of young Italians with Lega Nord flags are calling out insults to the effect that the Italian flag should be burnt and shouting ""Down with the Italians!"" ."
"They are also shouting unrepeatable insults at the President of the European Commission."
"I am under the impression that the groups of visitors who come here to Parliament and who meet with the Members do so with the intention of familiarising themselves with the European institutions, not to insult them."
"I imagine that the Member who invited them did so in order to make them aware that we spend money on making the European citizens aware of the process of European integration."
"I therefore feel that the President of Parliament and yourself should be informed of this matter, so that the Member who is responsible for this group will have to answer for this incident."
"I do not see any Members who belong to the Forza Italia party in the Chamber."
"Forza Italia is the largest political force of the Italian Freedom Alliance, which includes this party, the Lega Nord, which is now part of their coalition."
"This matter must be dealt with, for it is unthinkable that we should have to put up with this type of demonstration taking place inside Parliament in the name of democracy, open doors and freedom."
"Forgive me Mr President, but I feel that these matters must be dealt with while the time is ripe, for otherwise, if we do not speak out, these demonstrations will end up being perceived as the norm."
"Apart from anything else, the Italian tricolour is flying up there among the flags which are part of the symbols of the European Union."
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor in order to add to Mrs Napoletano' s words. In addition to the indignation of my group and myself, as soon as I realised what was happening, I contacted the security services but they failed to respond."
"This would appear quite a serious matter, for, in my opinion, there should always be security staff on duty at Parliament, and they should be able to intervene when incidents such as this demonstration take place and put a stop to them."
"This is a very serious matter, Mr President, and it should be explicitly condemned, as Mrs Napoletano said - but I do not want to be drawn into a lengthy discussion here - we must find out who invited these delinquents to Parliament."
"I thank the Members for their important communication."
"Although I am merely the temporary President for this sitting, I have given instructions that the security services and the President of Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, be advised."
"It is truly unacceptable to denigrate and insult the democratic legitimacy of any country or its institutions, or of the European institutions."
"On behalf of the Presidency of Parliament, please accept this expression of regret in the face of this action against the Italian Republic, and I hope that normality will be resumed and that it will not happen again."
"Naturally, those responsible will be brought to account."
"Structural Funds (1998)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0138/2000) by Mr Turco, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the European Commission' s 10th Annual Report on the Structural Funds 1998 (COM(1999) 467 - C5-0325/1999/2211(COS))"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has examined the Commission' s 10th annual report on the Structural Funds regarding the implementation of operations during 1998."
"As you are aware, the sound and efficient implementation of the Structural Funds is of fundamental importance for the credibility and effectiveness of the Community institutions, in particular the European Parliament, considering its monitoring functions."
"Our report, which was adopted unanimously, takes note of the fact that all the resources available for 1998 were fully taken up but it also records that there are still considerable divergences in implementation between Objectives, between the Member States and between regions, and that this full take-up was only made possible by mechanisms for offsetting over- and under-implementation, which, in fact, made the implementation of the budget non-transparent."
"We therefore hope that the new rules for the next programming period will make it possible to ensure transparent financial management and avoid the usual yearly liquidity bottlenecks;"
"With regard to coordination, it urges the Commission and the Member States to coordinate Structural Fund policy more closely with the Cohesion Fund, the other regional development instruments and the various European Union financial instruments such as trans-European networks and the EDSP."
"This is because we are convinced that we can only reduce the structural divergences between European regions and areas through coordinated action."
"As regards additionality, which is one of fundamental principles underlying the Structural Funds, we call upon the Commission to find as soon as possible instruments to improve verification of compliance with additionality and more transparent procedures for assessing additionality."
"We strongly urge the Member States to ensure that this principle is strictly upheld."
"We consider it essential, moreover, in respecting the partnership principle, for management decentralisation to be accompanied by a clarification of the responsibilities and roles of the various partners and by a clear distinction between the functions and responsibilities."
"Furthermore, we have noted that the results of the interim evaluations are frequently not comparable or quantifiable because unsuitable and inadequate indicators have been employed, which is why it is absolutely necessary for us to have objective criteria and more suitable assessment methods for assessing the results of the programmes."
"We have also noted that, although there was an inexplicable and dangerous fall in the number of on-the-spot checks carried out under the regulation in 1998 compared to the previous year, they have brought to light a whole range of shortcomings, from an insufficient number of monitoring schemes in certain programmes to the co-financing of non-admissible expenditure."
"As a result, we consider that the Commission' s checks in 1998 were, unfortunately, still unsatisfactory, and that they must be sufficiently strengthened in order to guarantee proper implementation of the Structural Funds regulations."
"In our report, we therefore call upon the European Commission and the Member States to adopt a number of actions as soon as possible to strengthen controls and to keep Parliament better informed of measures adopted to increase transparency and improve the implementation of the Structural Funds."
"Since this 10th annual report was especially concerned with measures to promote local development, we have noted their strategic importance and emphasise their considerable contribution to local development."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to stress that our report is consistent with the opinion you expressed on 5 June last in Brussels, when you stressed that, in the interests of transparency, even the smallest European taxpayer has to know where and how Community resources appropriated to the Structural Funds are spent."
"I will leave to you the task of assessing whether a Commission report such as the 1998 report allows, I will not say the smallest, but any of the European taxpayers to satisfy their desire."
"Mr President, lastly, I would like to explain my position regarding the seven amendments which will be put to the vote on Friday."
"I, myself, have tabled a technical amendment, the third amendment, which corrects a transcription error likely to cause confusion and make paragraph 28 inconsistent with the rest of the report."
"I also accept Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2, since they are in line with the report."
"However, I cannot accept Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 6 or Amendment No 7, for I consider that they misrepresent the rest of the report."
"In any case, I would like to thank Mr Nogueira and Mr Larrea, the authors of these last amendments, and publicly acknowledge that, although I do not support their approach, I do concede that their argument is valid and well structured."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I want to congratulate Mr Turco on the excellent report he has presented."
"He has put his finger on the main problems encountered in implementing Structural Funds credits, and he has clearly indicated what we want to see in this area in the future."
"In particular, I want to thank him for taking account of the opinion of the Committee on Industry in the final version of his report, especially as regards the issue of job creation."
"For my part, Mr President, I am going to concentrate on just point: the need to coordinate Structural Fund interventions with other Community policies, an issue the rapporteur is likewise very concerned about."
"The Committee on Industry believes it is particularly important to avoid conflict between competition policy on the one hand and regional policy on the other."
"This is not an easy problem, and it is not a new one either."
"I shall be particularly grateful to Commissioner Barnier if he can tell us whether the Commission has looked at this aspect of the problem in the context of the re-examination of competition policy, and if he could tell us where the Commission has got to in its thinking on this subject."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that my Group supports much of what is in Mr Turco's report and is certainly wholeheartedly behind the general thrust of the report."
"However, I have chosen to speak in today's debate because some of the issues discussed in the report are at the core of what must be addressed if the European institutions themselves are to lift the cloud of mismanagement and waste which hangs over them from previous times."
"The only way we can hope to change the public's perception of what we are doing here is not only to achieve better value for money but also to be seen to be doing it."
"It is only if we can clearly show that the Commission's use of money is managed in a sound and prudent way that we can hope to win back the trust that has been lost over recent years."
"The report with which we are concerned is, of course, retrospective to 1998."
"Many positive changes have taken place since that time, not least since the new Commission took over."
"It is crucial, therefore, that we flag up the inadequacies that were inherent in the system and ensure that we go further in our aim to make better use of European taxpayers' money."
"This is especially so in the Structural Funds, which directly touch the lives of so many of our own citizens."
"We have before us an opportunity to concentrate the minds of both the Commission and the recipients - Member States and others - of this valuable EU assistance, on the criticisms identified in the report in many areas concerning the allocation of funds and the lack of monitoring of their use."
"A key remedy for addressing this very real problem is the effective use of exit strategies as a prerequisite to the awarding of funding."
"None of us here would personally enter into a business or private financial agreement without being sure of how and when that obligation would come to an end."
"All too often that is what has happened in the past."
"Until clearly defined, planned and effective monitoring of the success or failure of a funded scheme is introduced, it remains all too easy for ill-thought-out and badly managed projects to waste precious resources, to continue to throw good money after bad."
"Failure to act will result in the particular problems highlighted in this report."
"It will also result in the problems we have seen over the allocation of ever-scarcer resources within the Member States."
"Nowhere is this better highlighted than in the current delays, obfuscation and confusion in the United Kingdom over where to put this valuable money."
"This is particularly so in my home region, the West Midlands, where this delay is causing a great deal of uncertainty to local communities and the local taxpayers, who are having to underwrite the projects to the tune of many millions of pounds, pending the resolution of the problems I have outlined."
"Therefore, what is required is a simple benchmarking of projects to compare and contrast their effectiveness, to be undertaken perhaps by an independent auditor and used in conjunction with a clear and well-planned end-programme which will allow the termination of poorly operated projects and put an end to on-going waste - in essence, to introduce private-sector disciplines into this system."
"Only when the European institutions and the Member States adopt ideas such as these, will we again gain the reputation for financial probity that we desire and which the public demands."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if economic and social cohesion is rightly called the core of European policy, then it is safe to say that the Structural Funds act as its pacemaker."
"We are talking today about the functioning of a political instrument which we have since, with Agenda 2000, replaced with a new and we hope better one."
"Nevertheless, it is the duty and the right of this Parliament to review the Structural Funds by means of their annual reports and to derive political requirements from those reports, even if they appear to have been overtaken by events."
"We believe that the rapporteur, Mr Turco, has done an excellent job on both counts in his report on the 10th Annual Report on the Structural Funds, 1998."
"The many amendments made by Members of this House have substantially enhanced the report."
"I do not want to repeat here those criticisms which have been recorded and can be checked in writing."
"Mr Turco and others Members have already reiterated these criticisms."
"However, I would like to strengthen one demand, and that is the demand that in its next report the Commission should devote a special section to reporting on the measures which it has adopted in response to criticisms voiced by Parliament in previous years."
"The 11th Annual Report should, therefore, at the same time include a progress report."
"Because time is short, I only want to address four problems and approaches which we think point to the way forward."
"Firstly, the period covered by the report, 1998, was notable for the fact that it was only possible to achieve total implementation of appropriations for the entire programming period by means of last-minute measures."
"Experience has shown that we need special strategies for the initial and concluding stages of programming periods and a flexibility mechanism for crisis situations like those which arose in 1997/98."
"Secondly, the principle of additionality is one of the main pillars of our structural policy, and I do not want to undermine it."
"Nevertheless, there is a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality."
"For example, in the case of Objective 1 areas, it is frequently only partly true to say that there is an independent structural policy to which the European component is added."
"This is often because all the funding available in political terms has already had to be committed to guarantee adequate cofinancing, and rightly so."
"However, when it comes to the principle of additionality, this means, if I may resort to a metaphor, that it is like me being given a suit by Europe to complement a tie that I can afford myself at regional level."
"The forthcoming enlargement will add to this problem."
"So as I see it, we need a new definition of additionality."
"This might perhaps be something along the lines of additional European added value, which is already a prerequisite for the framework research programmes and for the Community INTERREG initiative, for example."
"Thirdly, we believe that the principle of partnership with local and regional authorities and with the two sides of industry is heading in the right direction and should be further strengthened."
"We need both more local initiatives and pacts and a regional debate about priorities for a given region."
"In this way our structural policy itself will contribute to regionalisation."
"Structural policy simultaneously reacts to and creates regional structures."
"Fourthly, controls and assessments are the alpha and omega of any structural policy that has the noble objective of making itself superfluous as quickly as possible."
"Even if there are marked structural differences between regions, this should not stop us from looking for common evaluation methods and indicators."
"Only in this way can we make horizontal comparisons between strategies and projects between Member States in individual areas of activity."
"The previous speaker mentioned this problem."
"Benchmarking should also be possible in this policy area soon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very positive Thursday for the European regions in general and for the outermost regions in particular, since this Parliament is dealing with reports as thought-provoking and important as those of Mr Turco and Mr Ripoll, which refer to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund respectively, as well as the assessment of the transparency of their implementation."
"It is therefore worth remembering that regional and structural policy in the European Union as a whole is a response to the specific disadvantages confronting certain European regions and, in particular, the outermost regions such as Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments."
"In fact, Articles 158 and 159 of the Treaty set the objectives for economic and social cohesion, giving regional policy the task of reducing the existing differences between the less developed regions and the others."
"It also leads to the special treatment of the outermost regions which is covered in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which will allow the Union to continue, consolidate and strengthen its action in order to achieve a specific system of measures that will take account of all the limitations suffered in those regions, whose situation is special, without damaging the coherence of Community law and the internal market."
"For these reasons, Mr Turco' s report on the 1998 annual report on such important financial instruments as the Structural Funds is also relevant, since it opens up the possibility of strengthening the effective and decentralised application of those Funds and also because it opens the way for discussion and reflects the specific situation of these outermost regions with regard to establishing criteria for admission to the Structural Funds and their inclusion in Objective 1."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been mentioned, the problem with this report is that it amounts to a retrospective review of a chapter in the history of the Structural Funds which has long since been closed, during the previous parliamentary term in fact."
"This looks pretty boring, and the press have already gone home."
"Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the seriousness of the issues involved, as the central point of this discussion should be to learn from the mistakes of the past."
"In view of the challenge of an enlarged Union, which will in future have 28 or more Member States, we can no longer afford not to use European money for European objectives such as employment, sustainability, environmental protection and equal opportunities in an efficient way."
"This was simply not the case during the last period."
"I am emphasising this because I have the impression that the new programmes are once again being approved because of pressure from the Member States, although they do not provide for optimum use of funds in accordance with Europe' s objectives."
"And this Parliament has been calling for optimum use of funds for years."
"We cannot afford, as we did in 1998, to spend EUR 30.4 billion only to find that unemployment is increasing again in the poorer regions."
"I would like to cite an example that underlines my doubts."
"The Commission is simply not throwing its weight behind the need to make European objectives the real guiding principle of Structural Fund policy."
"This House called for this report to include a chapter specifically devoted to equal opportunities."
"The three sentences at the beginning are not enough, we asked for a specific chapter, so that we could monitor this area of EU policy separately and effectively."
"Equality of opportunities is not just the remit of the ESF, it is the remit of all the Structural Funds."
"Let me give you another example. Although unemployment is rising in Germany' s five new Länder, money is once again being invested in roads instead of jobs in the new Community support framework."
"I expect the Commission to drop its ""business as usual"" approach and instead to become the motor of sustainable development in Europe again."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is once again time for us to consider a Commission report on the implementation of Structural Funds appropriations, this time for 1998, and to express the views of our group."
"The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank very warmly, depicts very varied trends in expenditure under the Structural Funds. The picture is one of some positive aspects compared with previous years, combined with continuing problems."
"I would like to concentrate on two issues."
"The first is that EU financial resources have undeniably led to a process of recovery in the poorest regions and Member States. Nevertheless, the gap between the least and most developed regions of the Community has scarcely decreased."
"That means that disparities in regional development continue to exist, even if the overall level is higher."
"This is of course totally unsatisfactory as far as I and my group are concerned. And this dissatisfaction is all the greater when you consider that the continuing regional differences, as measured in income per capita, are particularly reflected in unemployment figures."
"Even though there has been a reduction in unemployment in the EU in absolute terms in recent months, the total number of people without jobs is still far too high."
"In Germany alone there are still over 3.8 million unemployed, and the employment rate is still markedly higher."
"If we were to use this issue alone to gauge the success of Structural Fund policy, we would pass a devastatingly negative judgment on it."
"Secondly, the problems of unemployment, which are not tackled under the Structural Funds alone, underscore the importance of efficient coordination of the implementation of funds from the various EU and national support programmes and of restructuring and allocating more money to all those funds that generate new jobs.As the rapporteur rightly emphasises, there was some progress in this area in 1998, but it was still far from adequate."
"In view of all the difficulties which undeniably exist, I regard this as a key starting point for greater effectiveness and thus more efficient use of the appropriations implemented, and I believe that this is something that people hit by unemployment in the various countries would welcome."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to take proper stock of the application of the Structural Funds regulations, which remain a fundamental instrument of European policy for reducing inequality."
"That stocktaking can help us correct any past excesses and learn to manage present and future appropriations better."
"We learn that the implementation rate for programmes in 1998 remained satisfactory, although only slightly under 90% of total support was achieved for commitments, and 61% for payments."
"That is why we support Mr Maurice Turco' s report, and he is to be congratulated for approaching this issue pragmatically and without complacency."
"Moreover, this report reveals some mismanagement in the allocation of the Structural Funds."
"Beyond the overall picture, considerable differences in implementation have persisted between the different objectives as well as between the Member States and the regions."
"The difference between the budgetary appropriations and the final implementation remains a problem particularly affecting Objective 2."
"Moreover the full utilisation of the Structural Funds in 1998, or at least in terms of the percentages mentioned earlier, has only been possible thanks to a compensation mechanism for under-implementation, such as major transfer of credits from Objective 2 to Objective 1."
"We denounce this type of practice as lacking in transparency."
"Furthermore, we ask for a fairer distribution of expenditure, more transparency in the allocation and control of the funds, better eligibility criteria, a reduction in the number of priority objectives and Community initiatives."
"We also think a reduction in the programmes involved would lead to greater effectiveness in their implementation and the possibility of stricter control."
"To this effect, we join the rapporteur in asking the Commission to strengthen its control and inform Parliament of the results of its audits and assessments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report which not only highlights the importance of the Structural Funds but also a series of problems."
"I would firstly likely to remind you that the objective of the Funds is to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union and that, while it is true that the GDP per capita in the regions with the lowest rate increased by 9% between 1986 and 1996, over the same period the income per capita in the four poorest countries rose by 8%."
"Nevertheless, the difference when compared to the 25 richest regions continues to be the same: two and a half times."
"These figures should lead us to consider the fact that, while the level and quality of life in the poorest regions is increasing, we have not managed to reduce the disparities between the richest and the poorest regions of the European Union."
"A second factor is that only 10% of the interventions from the Funds correspond to local development measures, despite the fact that most population and poverty is found in urban centres."
"To this data we must also add a factor which will distort the statistics and will change the landscape of the European Union in the next few years, i.e. the incorporation of the new Member States."
"All of these issues point to the need for a series of criteria to be taken into account in the future."
"Firstly, we must leave room for prioritising the interventions relating to urban development."
"Secondly, we need to develop policies which will reduce the disparities between the richest countries and the poorest countries."
"Thirdly, we must show greater sensitivity towards phenomena which have been ignored in the European Union, such as insularity and isolation."
"Lastly, we must take account of all sections of the population with the real objective of creating ever more employment, especially in the least-favoured regions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as someone with a local government background, I should like to stress the need for local government agencies to become more involved at all levels, particularly when programmes are being formulated and implemented."
"This is how the required partnership is implemented and integrated, provided of course that the Commission and the state are actively involved."
"I should also like to stress the need for greater coordination between European regional policy and other Community policies and between the Structural Funds and other funding mechanisms."
"I should like to use the short time available to me to stress how important it is to uphold the principle of additionality and express the view that, despite the development over time of verification methods, it is impossible to compare Member States on this issue, due to the lack of a common methodology."
"Thus, we cannot logically adopt a proposal to impose sanctions in cases of non-compliance with this principle until a legal base has been adopted and a common methodology agreed."
"The principle of additionality must be taken into serious account and I believe that the Member States and the Commission, in the light of forthcoming enlargement, will have to work together to draw up and adopt guidelines defining a more integrated approach to verifying the application of this principle, taking into account, of course, the particular economic situation in each Member State."
"In closing, I feel I must congratulate the rapporteur on his comprehensive report and stress the fact that on the whole, the implementation of the programmes financed by the various funds was on the right track in 1998, the year covered by the report and a good year overall, in which the relative delays of previous years were recouped."
"Only when it came to monitoring interventions was 1998 a poor year."
"There seems to be a problem with this generally, perhaps due to a lack of staff, and the Commission must ensure that it takes the measures needed to ensure that the implementation of European policies continues to be monitored."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I especially welcome paragraph 20 on additionality and hope very much that the Commission will take particular account of the importance of transparency."
"I would add that this should also relate to the question of whether the principle is being complied with, not just overall by Member States, but at regional levels within them."
"I would also ask the Commission to consider introducing a little more flexibility at the stage when projects are being set up."
"I am thinking of one very worthy project within my own constituency which, because of the very short timetable and a misunderstanding, did not enable contracts to be drawn up by the end of December last year."
"The offer of funding was consequently withdrawn."
"I do not dispute that this decision was correct and I understand the Commission's wish to ensure that projects are completed in time."
"The sad thing about this particular decision was that the project clearly would have been."
"Finally, I believe that there is a great deal of merit in Amendment No 5."
"If I understand what is being asked for correctly, the practice already applies in Scotland."
"Management at this level allows for a high degree of coordination and exchange of best practice between those involved."
"It also encourages pioneering activities."
"I offer as an example our Objective 3 partnership's development of a tool kit for gender mainstreaming in structural funding."
"I understand that serious consideration is already being given to its use in other parts of the European Union."
"May I please ask the Commission to think very carefully about the merits of taking on board Amendment No 5."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to my colleague and friend Mrs Attwooll for her remarks about Amendment No 5, which is in the name of my colleagues, Nogueira Román and Ortuondo Larrea."
"I should also like to commend to the House Amendments Nos 4, 6 and 7, also in their names, which strengthen and underline important points in the report."
"But I make no apology for coming back to Amendment No 5 in the sense in which Mrs Attwooll spoke of it."
"It is vital for the concept of subsidiarity to be brought into the heart of our notion of structural funding and for the regional, local and national authorities within Member States to be fully engaged in the process of implementing the structural funds and applying them."
"As paragraphs 20 and 21 say, the additionality principle has not been operating with an effective, transparent style up to now."
"Several speakers in this debate have drawn attention to that."
"Perhaps Commissioner Barnier will not be surprised if I bang home again on the point that whatever might have been the failures of the past, he has the opportunity to make successes in the future and to ensure that the additionality principle is not just a formal principle requiring Member States to satisfy certain budgetary conditions in a global way."
"Rather it should become a substantive principle built into the idea of subsidiarity which he and President Prodi are researching so that at regional and national level within Member States we can see that the funds really are being used to enhance and improve development."
"Mr President, the main conclusion to be drawn is that, in 10 years of Structural Funds, no real progress has been made in closing the huge gap between the per capita income of the richest and the poorest regions of the European Union."
"Not only have we failed to achieve the main purpose of the Structural Funds, i.e. to help reduce regional disparities and achieve economic and social cohesion; in numerous cases, the situation has worsened and the gulf between the regions lagging behind and the developed areas has widened both in rural areas, especially island and mountain regions, and also in urban areas, which are plagued by mass and long-term unemployment, poverty, and a scarcity, or in many cases, a total lack of basic infrastructures."
"The report under discussion makes a number of critical observations and evaluations which are heading in the right direction and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on that."
"However, the reality of the situation is even worse."
"The lack of planning and transparency and the huge number of irregularities and cases of fraud in implementing the programmes, which have helped swell the coffers of parasitical undertakings, have actually widened the gap instead of fostering cohesion. In fact, the Structural Funds have, on numerous occasions, been used as a means of eroding cohesion and fostering asymmetric development."
"Greece is a typical example of this: in 1996, only two Greek regions were classified among the ten poorest regions in the European Union."
"Epirus acquired the dubious accolade of being the poorest region in the European Union."
"The scarcity of resources under the Damoclean sword of Agenda 2000 and persistent cutbacks in order to satisfy other requirements, such as enlargement, do nothing to strengthen cohesion or stabilize development levels; on the contrary, they help set further socio-economic degeneration of the regions in motion."
"President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Sixth Periodic Report on the social and economic situation of the regions of the Union, which was adopted last year by the Commission, indicated that the 25 richest regions of the European Union still had an average GDP per head that was two and a half times higher than that in the 25 poorest regions, and my fellow Members have also reminded us of this."
"The development gap between the Member States has certainly been reduced, but there are still disparities between the regions, not only with regard to the GDP per head, but also, particularly, in terms of unemployment."
"Despite the economic upturn, the unemployment rate in the Union as a whole stood at around 10% at the end of 1998."
"Moreover, the distribution of unemployment is extremely uneven."
"Whereas the 25 regions least affected are experiencing a relative stabilisation of the rate at around 3 or 4%, the trend has not been reversed in the 25 worst affected regions, with a rate which is still higher than 20%."
"In its 1998Annual Report on the Structural Funds, the Commission notes, rightly so, that high regional unemployment leads to social exclusion, hence making unemployment even more resistant to economic improvement."
"An integrated strategy combining measures to boost the economic base of the regions and measures to improve access to the job market, particularly through training, is essential if this situation is to be resolved."
"It therefore seems to me that structural actions must continue to step up their efficacy and impact in terms of job creation in order to sustain the current economic growth, especially in the regions most affected by unemployment."
"Furthermore, the work carried out under the European Spatial Development Perspective follows the development of the organisation of the European territory from a traditional, rather centralised model, towards a polycentric model which is the only way to promote a more balanced geographical distribution of work in Europe."
"The Commission has promised that the emphasis in the new programming period for the Structural Funds will be on improving transport networks, particularly in the peripheral or outermost regions, and on creating sustainable and effective transport systems that provide a balance between the different modes of transport."
"I must stress particularly that the priority objective of this increased coordination should be to reduce structural divergences between the central part of the Union and the peripheral and outermost regions, as specified in one of the amendments adopted by my committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mr Mauro Turco on his excellent work. His report states clearly that the results of the 1994-9 Structural Funds programming period, taking into account the assessments available at the end of 1998, have not met expectations on a number of fronts."
"This is particularly true in the case of Italy."
"Suffice it to say that there was a considerable delay in the use of many of the appropriations, although improvement was apparent at the end of the programming period, obtained purely by mathematical calculation through transferring Objective 2 appropriations to Objective 1."
"Suffice it to say that, as far as Objective 4 is concerned, in 1998, Italy did not fulfil any of its undertakings and has only paid out 3% of the funding."
"The checking and assessment mechanisms have been decidedly inadequate."
"There are essentially three reasons for this poor management and they were highlighted by the Court of Auditors: firstly, lack of planning and poor interaction between the measures funded and the various funding instruments, factors which prevented us achieving the expected added value; secondly, lack of global vision which meant that the projects defined were not ambitious enough; thirdly, delays in concluding previous projects and programmes, largely due to the absence of documents justifying the actual expenditure."
"Now, considering the forthcoming 2000-2006 programming period, even though management has been simplified and the number of objectives and Community initiatives reduced, I cannot contain my concern and I sympathise with many regional council chairmen as they tackle the issue of the failure to use Community funds and the responsibilities of the Italian Government."
"Months after the rejection by the European Commission of the Objective 2 area map it had put forward on the grounds that the area definition criteria did not correspond, the Italian Government had still not presented a valid, compliant proposal, and this was not for lack of good will on the part of the European Commission."
"The result is certainly not outstanding."
"We cannot afford to lose more time, and we cannot afford to decline ITL 10 000 billion either; neither the Italian economic situation nor the Italian taxpayer would allow it."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Barnier."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"Topical and Urgent Debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Basic freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo"
"Mr President, in some language versions the motions are shown as being tabled on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists by Mr Wiersma and by a certain Mr Sumberg, who does not, however, belong to our group."
"I, at any rate, have not changed my name."
"I am still called Swoboda and I am also proud of this typical German name."
"I would be grateful if this could be corrected where it is wrongly shown."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a chance to speak with some young lawyers from Serbia, who gave us an impressive account of the hopeless situation in their country."
"So I am glad to come back to today' s subject, the complete lack of press freedom and access to information there."
"The population only gets information from the subjective viewpoint of Mr Milosevic and his wife Mrs Markovic."
"Anyone who sees the facts as they are is treated as a traitor to the Serbian people and a NATO lackey."
"One of the young Serbian women told me that it is extraordinarily difficult for her to explain to her grandmother why she opposes Milosevic, as her grandmother only has her own information and experiences to go by."
"This means that she cannot understand why this young woman is involved in the OTPOR organisation."
"We must help the independent democratic media in Serbia so that they can provide accurate information as far as possible, and so that democracy may yet blossom in Serbia."
"I would also like to say, however, that we naturally expect the ""opposition press"" , or what remains of it, to denounce the current irregularities in political leadership in the city of Belgrade, for example, which is governed by the MRS, just as much as it justifiably criticises the Milosevic regime."
"As long as it does not do this and is blind to other shortcomings, it is not an independent medium."
"I would also like to draw honourable Members' attention to the following point: given that we are now hearing suggestions that Mr Draskovic is once again on the way to collaborating with Mr Milosevic, we have to be very careful about who we give help to."
"OTPOR, the real resistance group in Serbia, which grew out of the student movement, is as at present being prevented by Milosevic from registering as an organisation."
"Nevertheless, this will not stop it organising demonstrations and displays of good will on the streets of Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia."
"Next weekend, our delegation will be travelling to Montenegro, and on Sunday will be holding talks with representatives of OTPOR and of the opposition."
"We will, of course, take this opportunity to sound out what scope there is for supporting them."
"A contributory factor to the lack of freedom in that country is the Serbian University Law promulgated in October 1998, since when many professors have been removed from their posts."
"They are forbidden to give lectures and they have been removed from their posts because of allegedly inadequate qualifications."
"It is evident what is going on if I tell you that one of these allegedly unqualified professors is now a professor at the Universities of Saarbrücken and Berlin."
"I find it hard to imagine that these universities would employ unqualified Serbian professors."
"But, of course, they did not fit in with Milosevic' s doctrines."
"On the other hand, I have to tell you - because we here do not get to know everything that you can only find out by talking with people on the spot - that the extremist nationalist politician Selesj is currently a university professor in the law faculty."
"You can imagine how they rate quality there!"
"Today' s debate is, of course, first and foremost concerned with conditions in Serbian prisons."
"There are over 2 000 Kosovo Albanians held in Serbian prisons, most of them since spring 1999, that is before the NATO offensive."
"The situation in these prisons is indescribable."
"The people have received no legal representation."
"If they are then sentenced, this happens with total disregard for the law."
"Let me remind you about Flora Brovina, the doctor who did nothing more than respect her professional ethics as a doctor, by helping people regardless of their nationality."
"She was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Serbia, in Nis."
"The prisons are certainly not in line with any convention, and contravene the Geneva Convention."
"There is horrifying torture and abuse, and the world is simply looking on."
"A fortnight ago, I visited Kosovo with 12 colleagues, and that was when Kosovo Albanians gave us these 75 000 signatures."
"We have brought them here because we want to demonstrate the enormity and the awfulness of the situation of people who have been trying to find out for at least one and a half years where their relatives are - their fathers, their brothers or even their children."
"I do not think that we can simply file these 75 000 signatures away."
"We must attempt to at least give these people some certainty about where these missing persons are, what prisons they are in or where they met their death."
"That is the picture in Serbia."
"In Kosovo, which we also visited, although the situation is different, there are similar problems."
"We went to Kosovo last year because we wanted to help the Kosovo Albanians who for ten years have suffered under an apartheid-like regime to obtain attention."
"The aim we are working towards now in Kosovo is to achieve peaceful coexistence between the majority Albanian population and minorities who are also entitled to live there, be they Serbs, Ashkali or Roma."
"I believe that we should focus our attention on ensuring that coexistence is possible there."
"There were many incidents during the last few days of our visit there, and these are occurring again now."
"There have been murders of Serbs over the last few days."
"Nobody can say who committed them, but someone is responsible for the fact that a Serb - or even several Serbs - is murdered somewhere every day."
"We condemn these acts, indeed we condemned them on the spot, and have done so here on several occasions."
"We call on everyone in positions of responsibility, and now above all Kosovo Albanians, to ensure that when the occasion arises their compatriots behave in a restrained manner and prevent this sort of conduct against minorities."
"We did not come to the aid of the Kosovo Albanians so that they could make the life of minorities in Kosovo hell."
"It also has to be said, because we do not know who the culprits are, that it cannot, of course, be ruled out some of the people responsible for these acts are possibly being infiltrated into Kosovo from Serbia as agents provocateurs, because they simply do not want peace in Kosovo."
"All of us in the European Union, and also UNMIK, must take swift action in that region now."
"UNMIK must ensure that there is a legal framework, so that the culprits can be caught, put behind bars and punished."
"But in Kosovo there is also the problem of missing Serbs, which we are all familiar with."
"We call on the Kosovo Albanians to speak now and to inform the Red Cross if they know anything about the whereabouts of these Serbs and people of other nationalities, so as to put an end to this uncertainty."
"The few Serbs in Kosovo who want to work with the administration of course also have a problem."
"They are viewed as traitors by some of their own compatriots."
"That being the case, we must help these well intentioned Serbs to achieve some positive results, so that their cooperation is clearly of some benefit for the Serbian population."
"We must try to ensure greater police protection."
"That is why I appeal to all the Member States to send as many police officers as possible to Kosovo, in order to guarantee protection for minorities also."
"Mr President, freedom of the media lies at the heart of democracy."
"If the opposition has no opportunity to express its opinion, if a public debate about society is no longer possible, then you are looking at total dictatorship."
"And I know just how painful that is from personal experience."
"I also know how hard it is to act as opposition in this situation, and not to despair or give up."
"The transformation of society for which we are looking to the opposition there is virtually impossible under these circumstances."
"That much should be clear to us."
"It is virtually impossible because people stand a good chance of ending up in prison if they act in the interests of democracy."
"And it will be extremely difficult to intervene from outside, because the human right of freedom of expression is simply declared illegal."
"Therefore - and I am addressing this comment to the Commission in particular - we need all our imagination, flexibility and creativity to development instruments which will nevertheless enable us to support the opposition in this situation."
"It is not impossible to transform society even in these circumstances, as we saw 11 years ago."
"That is what we have to concentrate on."
"We should not always let bureaucratic obstacles get in the way."
"We really must find out what can be done under European mechanisms."
"And the answer is that they allow more to be done than has been evident up to now."
"It is also important to give these signals, because otherwise the opposition feels isolated and loses all its drive."
"If that happened things would be much, much more difficult and would take much longer."
"Mrs Pack has made it plain that the situation in the prisons is appalling and that for the inmates every day is one day too many."
"I therefore call on the Commission to take every opportunity, in all its talks with representatives of the Serbian Government or embassies, to present the list of prisoners and to request information on each prisoner."
"We are talking about human beings, and it is a humanitarian act to press for these people to be released and united with their families one day."
"I also wish to call on the Commission to offer indirect financial support to those organisations which are trying to draw up lists, to organise prison visits and to care for the families."
"It is enormously important to provide this humanitarian support, and this will also strengthen the democratic forces in Serbia."
"With regard to Kosovo, after one year that region has still not reached the position we would have liked to see."
"It is a great disappointment for me that there is such great hatred that it is not possible for Serbs, Roma and other minorities to live in peace in Kosovo although they are under an international protectorate."
"It is humiliating that we have not succeeded in promoting tolerance or at least cohabitation in this area."
"For the sake of the credibility of the international community it is therefore a matter of urgency for us to protect the minorities and give them genuine opportunities for living and working there."
"And this is also important for me because I believe that otherwise everything that happened a year ago will lose credibility."
"It is therefore vital for us to do more in this area and to endeavour to make it clear in the public arena that it is unacceptable for people belonging to a different race to be driven out of Kosovo."
"The Serbs, Roma and other minorities have a right to live there!"
"Mr President, fellow Members, this resolution deals in a meticulous way with a number of practical problems."
"I shall not repeat them, as our president, Doris Pack, has explained them better than we could."
"I would just like to highlight the issue of Kosovar prisoners, as did Mrs Schroedter."
"This is a fundamental problem and we must persevere in our actions, even if we know that we do not have many weapons to influence the Belgrade regime."
"Obviously, there is also all the repression in Serbia."
"But for the first time, I will admit that I cherish a certain optimism, given the way the Belgrade regime is developing, that it will collapse in the near future."
"In particular, I am thinking of the student movement, the virtually underground OTPOR movement, and on this subject, I think that the relentlessness with which it is suppressed and monitored by Milosevic' s henchmen is a good indicator of its power."
"Having said this, I think it is time for the European Parliament and also the Commission and the Council to engage in a debate - and I know that the president of our delegation does not entirely share this point of view - on the future status of Kosovo, the future status of Bosnia, and therefore also, directly, that of Serbia."
"The uncertainty surrounding the definitive status of Kosovo today is a source of instability, an incentive to extremists of all types, an obstacle to development, because this situation certainly does not encourage foreign investment."
"There is another fact that merits our attention: the presence, in a country with less than two million inhabitants, of over fifty thousand westerners with a standard of living 10, 15, 20 times higher than that of the Kosovars, cannot but present many problems in terms of discrimination and inequality, and is not without secondary effects that are not always as secondary as all that, and are in fact very serious and often very problematic, or even truly adverse."
"Having said that, I am not questioning the role of the KFOR, the role of the United Nations in Kosovo, at all, but we cannot consider and plan an ""occupation"" of Kosovo for many years without running serious risks."
"We must therefore unreservedly confront the issue of the final status of what was formerly Yugoslavia. Six years after the signature of the Dayton agreements in 1995, with a Bosnia that is still not a country where things run smoothly, with a Bosnia comprising two or even three entities, we must urgently put an end to all these problems and the Commission and the Council must urgently propose ways of overcoming these situations which were designed to be interim situations."
"We must propose ways out of the situation in order to create a conditions which might form a basis for imagining the integration of these countries into the European Union."
"In particular, I do not think we can avoid the idea of a federation between Kosovo and Albania, nor can we avoid associations between certain parts of Bosnia and Serbia."
"This is the result of a policy which we, the radicals, definitely did not want, but which the international community wanted, and to which we can no longer turn a blind eye."
"Mr President, a year ago, the current NATO General Secretary, George Robertson, described the task in Kosovo clearly and succinctly in the following terms: ""The objective is to get the Serbs out, NATO in and the Albanians home""."
"It was successful and a victory for justice and human rights."
"I was there before the war began. At that time, the Serbs had already driven 200 000 to 300 000 people from their homes and had ravaged and laid waste whole areas of the country."
"And I was there again a couple of weeks ago and can testify to the enormous change for the better which has occurred thanks to NATO' s intervention."
"I can also testify to the incredibly efficient work being done by KFOR, the UN mission (UNMIK) and the UNMIK police."
"I can, unfortunately, also testify to what the debate here ought especially to be about, namely the fact that it is now the Serbs who are being persecuted by people who act with spite towards them, throw stones at them, burn their houses down and attempt to drive them from their homes."
"Now, it is the Serbs who need our attention."
"The police are doing everything possible, but nothing like the promised number of police has arrived."
"The EU countries, in particular, have gone back on their promise. Only one fifth of the police force comes from EU countries."
"That is partly why the former liberation organisation, the KLA is all too easily able to engage in anti-Serbian and criminal activities, which presumably also include murder, arson and attempts to drive people from their homes."
"So, what is now needed may be expressed as succinctly as a year ago: the objective is to get the KLA out, the police in and the Serbs home to those places in which they have always lived in Kosovo."
"The KLA must be disarmed and stripped of any monopoly position in the coming election campaign. They must also be divested of the special privileges they have evidently been given when it comes to recruiting for the new police force."
"The KLA' s criminal activity must be brought to an end."
"The EU countries must send more police and judges."
"The Serbs must be helped to return home."
"Attempts must also be made to help groups of Serbs in Serbia itself. In turn, it must be absolutely clear that the election planned for October in Kosovo must be held, irrespective of whether the Kosovan Serbs boycott it, for what are especially needed are Albanians, who are accountable."
"At the moment, all Albanians have been turned into clients and can blame everyone else for terrorism, street fights etc. What we need is to arrange for the Albanian majority to be held accountable."
"Mr President, one year on from the end of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the situation is unstable and the opposing forces in Serbia are giving increasing cause for concern."
"The daily news is witness to the oppressive actions of the Yugoslavian government."
"Opposition is struck down and intimidated in the ways traditionally adopted by governments who feel insecure: newspapers and radio stations are closed down, equipment confiscated, various groups and non-governmental organisations intimidated and there are random arrests and trials with unjustified sentences such as the case of Flora Brovina."
"Many of the men, women and students who are victims of oppression today are the same people who have courageously spoken up in these past years, calling for peace, freedom and respect for human rights, and who have, in reality, been abandoned even by Europe."
"However, the situation in Kosovo is equally worrying, where the oppressed have become the oppressors, and this has been said by Kofi Annan, Solana and Kouchner."
"In the space of a year, 240 000 Serbs, Roma, Gorancs and Jews have fled from Kosovo in terror."
"And those who have remained are regularly attacked and, in many cases, killed."
"The most recent UNHCR/OSCE report states clearly that, in Kosovo, minorities have no access to education, health and public services and no freedom of movement."
"And it is not only the minorities who are in this situation: even the Albanian Kosovars who are openly against the vendettas or for democracy in Kosovo live under threat and in fear of their lives."
"Leaders such as Rugova are familiar with the situation, but even more in touch are those women who, together with Serbian, Bosnian and European women - the 'Women in Black' against war - have in recent years managed to maintain relations and build peaceful bridges."
"Some of them have had to leave Kosovo and others have been forced to remain silent."
"In Serbia, the centre of the 'Women in Black' is currently under threat of closure."
"In my opinion, Europe, and, in particular, the 19 NATO countries, should undertake a large-scale self-appraisal operation and revise its policies."
"The crimes and unlawful acts committed by NATO against civilians are now universally acknowledged."
"In the interests of the protection of human rights, we must not violate international regulations and we must start by observing the Geneva Convention."
"At this point, let us mention fundamental freedoms: for these freedoms to be established the embargo policy must be abolished."
"We must not treat civilians in this way, and the democratic Serbian opposition which is still today at the mercy of Milosevic is calling for us to change our policy."
"It may be that we should be the ones to give them strong support in Serbia and Kosovo."
"We owe it to ourselves, but, most of all, we owe it to a wonderful little boy from Kosovo called Felt who said to me while we were eating an ice-cream one day: 'This war has turned us all into nastier people' ."
"Mr President, the situation is indeed serious in both Serbia and Kosovo but, today, I would like to concentrate on the situation in Serbia and would like to concur with what Mrs Pack, the chairperson of our delegation for the region, has said on the matter."
"It is with growing frustration that we have to note that the situation in Serbia is deteriorating by the day."
"Milosevic is creating dictatorial conditions, a country governed by security troops, State media and State terror."
"He shies away from a democratic confrontation with the opposition."
"Every day, we are confronted with examples of repression."
"The independent media are thwarted."
"A very negative trend is setting in."
"Politicians are under threat."
"There is a murderous atmosphere."
"The assaults are relentless."
"The student movement, OTPOR, on which the opposition is pinning all hope, is being attacked without mercy."
"CCL recently branded them terrorists."
"Measures are also being prepared against the universities so as to force students to keep calm."
"All in all, a situation is being created in which democracy is becoming a farce and the regime is trying to keep a grip on the situation by means of totalitarian manipulation."
"We are sitting on the sidelines and can do all too little to bolster the democratic powers."
"We have insufficient direct influence on the situation in Serbia itself."
"It is nonetheless important that we express our indignation once again today."
"We need to remain involved, and it is also useful that we, as a Parliament, are here today expressing our broad consensus on the situation and on how the situation in Serbia is to be addressed."
"The opposition in Serbia needs us."
"A great deal of aid has been set aside for Serbia within the framework of the Stability Pact."
"The money concerned cannot be spent until Belgrade makes a U-turn, but that will only happen if the opposition can express itself."
"As Mrs Schroedter has already mentioned, we are asking the Commission to make a huge effort and employ a great deal of creativity in order to help the towns in Serbia which support the opposition."
"But in addition to this, it must also be possible to give the independent media some backing."
"Is the Commission prepared to cooperate in setting up radio and TV facilities which can reach the Serbian population from outside that country?"
"In my opinion, this proposal is worth a very serious effort."
"Mr President, we have heard here about the brutal and wide-scale repression of the freedom of the media in Serbia, and in fact Belgrade' s Radio B92 was closed down during the May part-session here in Strasbourg. Since then a whole series of repressive measures has been taken against the independent media and against the student movement OTPOR, whose leaders have been unlawfully persecuted, excluded from university and taken into custody."
"We are calling for their release and we are demanding freedom of the media, but we must of course do something practical."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Wiersma has taken on board something which I also wanted to see in this resolution, which is that we must we must support independent broadcasting stations in the territory surrounding Serbia just as much as we support the few remaining independent media still existing within Serbia itself."
"I come from Munich, and Munich has for decades been the home of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which have been a voice of freedom for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Following the fall of Communism, President Havel said that these stations, which now also broadcast from Prague, played a leading part in establishing freedom and the rule of law there."
"But it was up to the Americans to do that - Radio Free Europe was created at the time by the Americans."
"We in the European Union today have a chance to do the same for a small part of Europe as the Americans did for Central and Eastern Europe. I have in mind creating independent broadcasting stations in Hungary, Romania, Montenegro and Albania which will be an independent voice and a source of information for the Serbian people."
"We must make one thing crystal clear once and for all: our criticism has never been aimed at the people of Serbia, but against those in power who are abusing the name of the Serbian people for their own criminal ends."
"We must draw a distinction between the people and the regime, and we must support the people and we must give them information and an independent voice."
"We have some opportunities here."
"We must at the same time be very much aware that the issue of protecting minorities also affects Serbia."
"Not only do people frequently forget about the minorities in Vojvodina, but there is already a stream of refugees and expellees flowing into Kosovo from the border region of Serbia which has an Albanian population."
"The Albanians driven out of core Serbia scarcely get a mention in our media, yet they are significantly aggravating the situation in this region."
"We are, of course, also championing all the media and supporting all the minorities in Kosovo, and Mrs Pack has already pointed out that in practice there is not only tension between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, but there are also Serbs persecuting other Serbs because they are regarded as collaborators since they are willing to participate in the process of reconstructing Kosovo and reconciliation between the peoples of Kosovo."
"The issue of those held in prison is an important one, and I would like to add to what Olivier Dupuis said on this: there are many people in Serbia who have been carried off into custody, and about whose fate we know nothing."
"I would like to mention Ukshin Hoti, whose release we have repeatedly called for in this House: we do not know if he is alive at all or if he is being detained somewhere."
"His family hopes that he is alive and we must continue to draw attention to the fate of this famous civil rights campaigner, who for a time was the Foreign Minister of the democratic government in Kosovo."
"In this context I would like to make it very clear that it is crucial for us not just to point the finger of blame at others, but also to fulfil our own obligations."
"This region is, of course, marked by criminality, hatred and conflicts, but if we do not even send two-thirds of the police officers we have promised to the area, so that a whole shift is missing in this crisis region, and on top of that there is no night shift, and all this happens simply because we are not meeting our own obligations, then we can scarcely point the finger of blame at others. Instead we should now ensure that we build up this region' s police force and administration."
"Without an operational police force and at least the rudiments of the rule of law, there is no hope of peace in Kosovo between individuals and between ethnic groups."
"There is also the point that Olivier Dupuis made so clearly."
"There may be differences of opinion about ways and means, but we should be united on the essentials."
"We can no longer dodge the vital issue, which is the very future of Kosovo!"
"Mr President, we find ourselves gazing with bewilderment at each new act by the Milosevic regime, acts against its own people."
"Today, no one is safe from attack, whether he belongs to the majority or the minority in Yugoslavia."
"That is why I think it is important to maintain constant contact with the opposition and to attempt to bring about a change in the political scene."
"I also believe that it is absolutely right that the Commission also wishes to make a relatively large amount of money available if these changes should come about; many people regard such a large amount as being quite appropriate in view of the requirements."
"I hope that the Commission and Parliament will remain resolute in facing up to the Council, which is taking a rather softer line here."
"I also believe that funding for increased information provision should be implemented here and now, so as to provide more objective information about the actual conditions in the Balkans."
"The situation in Kosovo today is different."
"Whereas before it was the majority that was in great danger, now it is the minorities who are living in difficult circumstances."
"This is just as unacceptable as the previous situation was."
"We are unanimous in advocating the rights of all the people living both in this region and in other regions, so that they can live their lives freely and move about at will."
"Against this background, I am sceptical to say the least about the elections and their results."
"At the very least we should see these for what they are - an election decided by the Albanians, that is by that predominant part of the population which can move freely within this region. This does not apply to Serbs living in Kosovo, nor indeed to those Serbs who have fled Kosovo and are now living in Yugoslavia."
"However, the really critical issue - and I urge the Commission and the Council to really knuckle down to things here - is that more police and greater rule of law are needed."
"We are responsible for the rule of law applying to everyone in Kosovo on a uniform basis."
"Mr President, quite recently, and to mark the anniversary of the end of NATO' s airstrikes on Yugoslavia, there has been growing public condemnation of the international community' s intervention in Kosovo and of the tragic situation which has developed in the region."
"In his annual report, the UN Secretary-General notes that, one year on from the deployment of KFOR, we face a well-developed, organised and well-orchestrated campaign against the Serbs and other ethnic groups in Kosovo, which is undermining confidence in the future and transforming Kosovo into a breeding ground for retaliation and crime."
"The UN High Commissioner and the OSCE have condemned the fact that, one year on from the arrival of the KFOR forces in the area, the minorities living in Kosovo, mainly Serbs and Gypsies, are still unprotected."
"Even Amnesty International, which throughout the whole of the criminal NATO bombings in the region, only saw Milosevic' s crimes (with or without quotation marks), has now discovered that NATO committed war crimes in Kosovo resulting in the mass murder of civilians."
"Only the European Parliament seems incapable, including in today' s resolution, of drawing any conclusions from the tragic situation which has arisen in this area as a result of the military incursions of NATO forces into an independent Member State of the UN, in violation of the fundamental principles of international law."
"It seems that the witch hunt in which all the main political forces of the European Union have joined still continues to inspire the European Parliament, making it incapable of assuming its historical responsibility towards those who elect it for safeguarding peace and the rights of the people of the Balkans to live in peace and dignity and to uphold their right to be masters of their own destiny, not the geopolitical pawns of the new imperialist world order."
"Will we, as the European Parliament, ever be able to assume our responsibilities and understand that, while we talk of rights and democracy in certain regions, while we subsidize intervention in local elections in Montenegro and while we support the embargo on Iraq, condemning hundreds of thousands of children to death, we have no credibility whatsoever?"
"Will we ever be able to say, we are putting an end to the embargo?"
"That is the question which at some point will need an answer."
"Mr President, we have before us two resolutions on fundamental freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo."
"In this respect, I much prefer the joint motion for a resolution to the proposal submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"After all, the resolution speaks out unmistakably about the undemocratic nature of the Milosevic regime in Belgrade and the means it deploys in order to exercise power."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the other hand, does not seem to see any direct link between the continuous presence of Slobodan Milosevic on the political stage of the Balkans and the continuing instability in the region, one year on from the end of NATO' s intervention against Serbia' s ethnic cleansing which affected Kosovo on a massive scale."
"I would like to illustrate this link by referring to the position of Mrs Rada Trajkovic from Grazanica."
"This medical doctor forms part of the political leadership of the moderate Serbs in Kosovo."
"Her now suspended cooperation with UNMIK led to anonymous threats by the Serbs, because the Milosevic arm stretches far for the time being."
"At the same time, the whole of the Serbian minority in Kosovo remains just as vulnerable to acts of terrorism committed by Albanian extremists."
"Both motions for a resolution therefore underline the international guarantees of this minority' s physical safety - and rightly so."
"In this connection, I would like to make a critical comment on Paragraph 14 of the joint motion for a resolution."
"This clause calls for promoting reconstruction projects with EU aid, specifically in those areas of Kosovo where human rights and the rights of minorities are being fully respected and where democratic principles are guaranteed."
"In my opinion, this is an impossible criterion for granting aid, given the current situation."
"Remember, only one act of terrorism committed by an Albanian or Serb is all it takes to cause a setback within an entire region."
"Or do those drafting the joint resolutions have specific arguments underlying this proposal in Paragraph 14?"
"Commendably enough, the joint resolution presses for actual international attempts at ethnic conciliation and cooperation within Kosovo."
"How difficult this is was once again reinforced by the boos and hisses that rained down on the so-called ""Mandela of Kosovo"" , Adem Demaci, at the massive memorial service to commemorate NATO' s troops entering Kosovo Polje one year ago."
"Demaci spoke in the Pristina stadium: ""Today, I call on all of you to fight a different battle, namely the battle for peace, for the future, for co-existence."
"Do not forget the Serbian people who have stayed behind in Kosovo."
"They find themselves in a difficult situation."
"Even the Serbian regime would prefer it if they were not there."
"Help them."
"They are despondent and fearful."
"It is up to you to offer them safety and freedom."
"Only then will you be able to enjoy your own freedom."""
"It is exactly this disposition among both the Albanians and Serbs that justifies and inspires the European efforts within the Western Balkans."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to say that the political situation in the entire region we are discussing today by no means justifies complacency or even guarded optimism."
"Quite the opposite - a realistic assessment suggests that there are only a few faint glimmers of hope on a dark horizon."
"We are dealing with an ever more hard-line dictatorship in Serbia."
"In Bosnia, the structures of civil society are still so weak that only the presence of international troops is preventing violence from breaking out."
"In Kosovo, violence is a daily event, and the democratic forces in Montenegro are at risk from threats from outside and from polarisation within."
"That is the situation we are dealing with."
"Let there be no mistake about this: all this is due to the disastrous actions of one man, the clique surrounding him, and his regime - Milosevic."
"The entire instability of the region is due to him."
"As long as this regime continues to exist, so will the instability in this region."
"Therefore the foremost demand that the European Union must make, again and again, and which it must back up with all the power at its disposal, is this: Milosevic must go!"
"The media of course play an important role in this context."
"So it is not surprising that the Milosevic regime is now taking a harder line than before against the independent media."
"As I see it, this is a sign of weakness."
"A time when a regime has to repress any freedom of expression is a time when it feels particularly weak and under attack."
"This is normally a sign of the beginning of the end."
"But in this case, unfortunately, the end could last a very long time."
"That is why it is right that demands are being made here for the European Union to use its resources to bolster the independent media in Serbia."
"We have been doing that for years."
"It is not, for example, as if objective reporting is not penetrating into the region."
"We should not always hide our light under a bushel, and we should not always talk just about American broadcasters."
"I must point out that there is a whole string of outstanding and skilled stations broadcasting to foreign countries which have for many years, and to an ever greater extent, been transmitting high-quality, objective and valuable programming to these regions, and they have received European support for this."
"If it is possible to do yet more in this area, then the Commission is of course willing to look into this."
"We have, of course, already reacted to media repression in many cases in the past."
"And in the present situation the Commission has adopted and financed a whole raft of measures which I do not wish to describe in detail now, but which always aimed to enable independent media either to continue to appear, in the case of the print media, or to broadcast, in the case of audio-visual media, or else to open up alternative channels for the media."
"This is part of the overall project developed by the EU to positively influence events in Serbia and to demonstrate that democracy really does have advantages for the public and is good and right."
"Let me mention the other examples from this overall project."
"First, there is of course the ""Energy for Democracy"" programme, under which cities governed by a democratic opposition are supplied with fuel oil in the winter."
"Then there is the follow-up project in the area of education, entitled ""Schools for a democratic Serbia"" , which is currently being completed. And we are currently also discussing programmes run by the Member States themselves with organisations in Serbia and with the Member States, for example a programme entitled ""Asphalt - roads to democracy"" ."
"I believe that it is very important to demonstrate that democratic developments in Serbia will be rewarded and will receive a positive response."
"Against this background I would like to stress that we regard it as being particularly important to strengthen and stabilise the democratic developments that have already started in Croatia, as Croatia in particular is also capable of exerting a positive influence on Serbia."
"With regard to Montenegro, I must say that we certainly welcome the democratic way in which the most recent municipal elections in Podgorica and Herceg Novi have been conducted."
"The very fact that these elections were held in near peaceful circumstances is unusual for this region, and we have to be grateful for small mercies."
"Overall, the EU is supporting the democratic reform process in Montenegro in a wide-ranging and active way."
"Significant financial support has been granted to Montenegro, so that since 1998 over EUR 115 million has either been spent or committed."
"I am also pleased, in view of all the laborious history of this, that the Council has now finally agreed to grant Montenegro an emergency support budget of EUR 20 million."
"I am being very serious when I say that the significance of this emergency programme in terms of giving Montenegro a stable and democratic future is greater than simply the amount of money involved may suggest. I therefore hope that it will soon receive the approval of the European Parliament' s Committee on Budgets."
"That brings me to Kosovo, where ethnically motivated violence still dominates everyday life."
"We must condemn ethnically motivated violence regardless of who the perpetrators and the victims are, that is regardless of who is at the receiving end of ethnic violence and who commits it."
"The European Union will always condemn such violence with equal force."
"The acts of violence being perpetrated against the Serbian minority and also against the Roma minorities are unacceptable in our eyes, just as the violence committed against the Kosovars just a few months ago was unacceptable."
"Just as we condemn the trials against Kosovars held in custody in Serbia, we welcome the reopening of the proceedings in the case of Flora Brovina, which has previously been the subject of resolutions adopted by this House."
"We call upon all parties in Kosovo to solve the vital issue of missing persons and prisoners as a matter of urgency."
"We fully support KFOR' s efforts to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect the public as a whole."
"The Commission shares Parliament' s view that sending an international police force is highly important."
"Not only is the credibility of the policies of the European Union and its Member States at stake, it is also imperative, if we wish to achieve our objectives in Kosovo, for us to provide the minimum level of police presence required to guarantee stability."
"Unless an atmosphere of stability and safety can be created, which will also make it possible for Kosovar Serbs to return, then there will be no true peace in Kosovo."
"It is in everyone' s interest to ensure cooperation between all Kosovo' s citizens, on the basis of common institutions."
"It is clear to us that a continuing substantial level of EC aid will be required."
"This aid will be provided via the reconstruction agency and the fourth pillar."
"Against this background, the Commission welcomes the conclusions of the most recent European Parliament mission to Kosovo."
"The Commission also supports UNMIK' s endeavours in the area of local administration by means of twinning projects and by advertising posts in UNMIK' s civil administration and the pillars of the reconstruction programme as widely as possible in all the Member States."
"I consider it extraordinarily important that the European Parliament has today once again held an in-depth debate on the resolution before us on the situation in the Western Balkans, and that this not only expresses our concern but above all demonstrates our shared determination not to leave our work in this region only half done."
"We have started it and we are determined to bring it to a successful conclusion."
"Mr President, we have just heard an outstanding speech by a highly qualified representative of the Commission."
"We have held a high-quality debate lasting for over an hour on the most important topic in Europe today."
"I would like to ask if we can guarantee that this is properly recorded by the Parliament' s Press Service, and is not limited, as so often happens on Thursday afternoon, to just a few lines, while all the other debates are recounted in epic detail."
"Mr Posselt, I will pass on your request, and I assume that I will be able to do so before the end of this sitting, so that it is taken on board."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Coup d'état in Paraguay"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0571/2000) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on democracy in Paraguay;"
"(B5-0578/2000) by Mr Nogueira Román and Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Paraguay and the Lino Oviedo case;"
"(B5-0580/2000) by Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the attempted coup d' état in Paraguay and the arrest of General Oviedo;"
"(B5-0582/2000) by Mr Marset Campos, Mr Jové Peres and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the attempted coup d' état in Paraguay."
"Mr President, the European Union and this Parliament have followed recent events in the Republic of Paraguay with great concern."
"The first of them, the coup d' état of 18 May, was the subject of a resolution, by the Presidency of the European Union, which roundly condemned any type of modification by force of constitutional legality in Paraguay and expressed support for the President of the Republic, Luis González Macchi, who, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, restored the situation to normal."
"The second event which has been followed with great interest by this Parliament was the arrest on 11 June, of General Oviedo."
"That arrest can be seen as a response by the Government of Brazil to the appeal from the Paraguayan Government to the neighbouring countries for cooperation, given the threats of attempts to destabilise democracy originating from outside the country."
"This is a clear sign, Mr President, of cooperation amongst the countries of Mercosur, with which the European Union is negotiating a new, very advanced association agreement which is based on the fundamental principles of respect for political pluralism and the defence of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"In this context, we in this Parliament must, in my opinion, support full democratic consolidation in the Republic of Paraguay and appeal for the correct operation of the rule of law and justice in that country."
"Mr President, it seems to me to be particularly appropriate to point out that the defence of democracy and the rule of law is the cornerstone of the policy of cooperation with the countries of Latin America."
"The respect for democratic values is, and must continue to be, the central pillar of political dialogue between the European Union and the countries of Mercosur, both on a regional level and on a bilateral level."
"Good evidence of this can be found in the ambitious institutional support programmes which the European Union has been developing in Paraguay since 1995."
"These projects, Mr President, are fundamental in a country whose constitution only dates from 1992, whose first elections took place in 1993, which suffered 50 years of dictatorship and which, therefore, is very much in need of democratic stability and institutional continuity."
"In this context we are concerned about the fragility and instability of the Government of National Union, headed by President González Macchi, resulting from the withdrawal of the Liberal Party from the government coalition, and the growing difficulties which this governmental coalition must face."
"And, as if this situation were not ominous enough, they have to deal with a coup d' état."
"Mr President, I believe that both the European Union and the United States, which have expressed their support for the Government of Paraguay, while recognising that efforts are being made to consolidate a certain degree of democratic stability, must also remind the Paraguayan authorities of the urgent need to take measures on institutional consolidation and to begin also to resolve the great economic and social problems in that country."
"Having pointed out the importance of our institutional support and cooperation in Paraguay, I do not wish to end without reminding you that the European Union still has no office in Paraguay."
"I believe that a European Commission delegation in Asunción would not only aid and improve our relations, but could also contribute in a significant way to the achievement of these objectives which are so important to all those of us who believe in the democratic clause, which is the foundation of these agreements and our relations with that country."
"Mr President, as has been pointed out, the influence of the European Union in Latin America is important from an economic and commercial point of view, but also from a political point of view, and this is characterised by our encouraging a type of relationship which favours egalitarian treatment - cooperation and the promotion of democracy - and this is completely opposed and different to that which has for centuries originated from Big Brother, in the north of the continent."
"For this reason, we consider it appropriate and necessary to show our solidarity and support for the democratic régime in Paraguay and to reject coups d' état and support democracy."
"The prosecution of Oviedo, the perpetrator of coups d' état, must be taken as an opportunity to make progress on the road to democracy, but we are also obliged to mention that democracy will not be consolidated in Paraguay unless social justice is improved, the eternal problems of social inequality are eliminated and the problems of unemployment and discrimination are brought to an end."
"We can help considerably in this field, by appropriately implementing the contents of the European Union' s agreements with the Mercosur countries and in particular the agreement with Paraguay, which is so necessary."
"We therefore believe that our action in this area can be decisive and we would also like to express our full support for the joint resolution which we have signed."
"Mr President, fellow Members, the Greens, like several other groups, had tabled a motion for a resolution on Paraguay."
"As is customary in the House, we have tried to agree on a joint resolution."
"Unfortunately, we cannot put our names to it as it stands."
"As you are aware, the situation in Paraguay is characterised not only by a revolutionary tendency in certain sections of the army but, more generally, by very serious human rights violations and the harsh suppression of popular movements."
"We have tried, in our resolution, to emphasise both these factors simultaneously."
"Given the very long history of Europe itself, you will be well aware that, in countries where human rights are not observed by a government, generally republican or democratic or claiming to be republican or democratic, this government runs the risk of a military coup d' état."
"In a way, governments get the coups d' état they deserve, and a weak democracy is vulnerable to military coups d' état."
"The resolution before us simply pays tribute to the initiative used by another Southern Cone country to arrest the leader of a military coup d' état and extradite him to his country of origin."
"We welcome this initiative on the part of Brazil, but to say that and nothing more would mean framing a resolution on Brazil, not Paraguay."
"We can welcome the progress that Brazil is making on the road to democratic cooperation in the Southern Cone, but that does not make it a resolution on Paraguay."
"We would have liked the issue of human rights as managed by the legally constituted government in Paraguay to be specifically taken into account."
"We would have liked the European Union to exploit the methods of democratic persuasion afforded due to the aid it provides to all the Southern Cone countries in order to encourage the legitimate government in Paraguay to show greater respect for human rights."
"Unfortunately, in the current wording of the resolution, this is not the case, and we consequently prefer to vote against the joint motion for a resolution and, if necessary, maintain our own motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, I still remember the 1980s very well, when Latin America, including Paraguay of course, attracted enormous attention in Europe, because at that time a great many people, and above all young people, were interested in restoring democracy to Latin America."
"Fortunately, by the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s nearly every Latin American state had returned to democracy."
"But in several countries there are signs of a return to the old ways."
"Paraguay is one of the worst examples of this."
"It therefore makes sense that the European Parliament, which has always regarded itself as the patron saint of democracy in Latin America and elsewhere, should express its views on this."
"The second point that I would like to mention relates to Paraguay and Brazil."
"Mr Lipietz has already touched upon this, but with a somewhat different emphasis."
"I regard it as being extraordinarily helpful that within Mercosur, to which both these countries belong, a code of values has now been adopted under which dictators, or attempts to establish a dictatorship, no longer have a chance of success."
"Oviedo was arrested in Brazil and I hope that he will be extradited to Paraguay."
"This is proof that Mercosur is more than just a free trade area - it is a political area in which democracy is protected."
"By the way, I totally agree with Mr Lipietz when he says that what is at stake in Paraguay is not just General Oviedo, but human rights as a whole."
"There is nothing separating us on that."
"However, you cannot of course write a whole book in a short resolution."
"I hope that we will be able to discus this issue at some other point, and I assume that we will also be able to reach a consensus then."
"Mr President, as reflected in the resolution agreed between the four groups, we have had good news and bad news with regard to Paraguay."
"Clearly, the bad news is that democracy is once again being threatened, but there has also been good news: the democratic forces have resisted and, furthermore, General Oviedo has been arrested in Brazil."
"We believe that Paraguay is probably a forgotten country, which has been helped by its integration into Mercosur, and, from that point of view, it is important that our relations with Paraguay should improve the situation, and that Brussels should find a way to help that country and at the same time remind it, as we will surely do later in the case of Peru, of the democratic clause which is the inspiration for all our actions."
"We also believe that it would be a positive thing for the Commission to take account of Paraguayan civil society."
"Other equally positive signs are the reduction in corruption and the hope that General Oviedo, like Pinochet, will be tried."
"Mr President, it is appropriate today for the European Parliament to turn its attention to Paraguay and express its solidarity with the Paraguayan people, who still face considerable difficulties and uncertainties in their effort to consolidate a democratic regime."
"The history of Paraguay is one of the saddest and most unjust in Latin America."
"For those of us who for many years have sided with the resistance in that country, it is painful to remember how, in the 60s and 70s, there were at least three good reasons to feel sorrow."
"Paraguay was probably the only country in the world whose population had been practically exterminated during wars with its two neighbours, Argentina and Brazil."
"Only women and some old men and children survived those wars."
"At that time, Paraguay was the only country which had considerably more population outside its borders than inside, with exiles, outcasts and emigrants of every type."
"Lastly, Paraguay held the tragic record of suffering the longest dictatorship in the whole of Latin America, headed by General Stroessner."
"That dictatorship displayed the most extraordinary cruelty in its repression of any opposition, and at the same time its dictator and his entourage was enormously corrupt, with their monopoly on big business and, in particular, smuggling."
"The Paraguayan people never gave in."
"For decades the fight continued, embodied in the February revolution, and the so-called febrerismo, one of the brief moments of democracy and hope, which was quickly stamped out, firstly by force of arms, but then kept down at a very high cost in death, prison, exile and enormous suffering."
"Despite the harshness of the repression, the internal decay of the authoritarian regime and the growing mobilisation of civil society eventually forced a transition which opened the way to progress and representative democracy."
"This has been the situation over recent years, although the threat of regression and attempts at destabilisation have not disappeared."
"In fact there has been constant agitation from local bosses and members of the military who are nostalgic, not so much for power, but rather for the possibility of making money which that power used to offer them."
"We have therefore witnessed a constant tension between civil democratic forces and sinister personalities, the main example of which is General Lino Oviedo, consummate purveyor of repeated coups d' états, professional destabiliser, shady businessman and even alleged promoter of assassinations such as that of the Vice-President of the Republic, Luis María Argaña."
"In this context, and with Oviedo under arrest in Brazil, the resolution we are voting on in Parliament is a great opportunity."
"It condemns the enemies of freedom and the destabilisers, it asks Paraguay' s neighbours for respect and cooperation, so that the consolidation of Paraguayan democracy may become a reality and, above all, it underlines the European Union' s commitment to the people and democratic institutions of Paraguay."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes today' s debate, because it gives us an opportunity to voice a clear warning and to remind you of the political approach that we have adopted to Latin America."
"Overall, we have witnessed an impressive success story in Latin America during the last 15 to 20 years in terms of democratisation."
"That is why, in every single case where these successes are undermined, we must say, in the plainest terms, so far and no further."
"Paraguay, a country which was in any case a straggler in Latin America when it came to democratisation, appears to be in jeopardy."
"That is why we really must express our solidarity with the democratic forces in Paraguay, and not only in words, but also in deeds."
"The European Union has already been active in Paraguay for a good many years."
"Our attempts to have a concrete influence on the situation there have focused on two areas."
"The first of these is to develop and strengthen democratic institutions."
"I would like to send a very clear message to the current government in Paraguay that this cannot just be regarded as a job for Europeans, North Americans, or anyone else."
"We can help to develop these institutions, but the political will really to establish them, to use them and take advantage of them has to come from those who are currently in power in Paraguay."
"The support programme for the Paraguayan Parliament has already gone through three stages."
"There is now a further project entitled ""Modernising the institutions"" ."
"Because a suspicion may arise that these funds are perhaps not entirely reaching the areas they are intended for, I would like to make it crystal clear that we have seen fit to incorporate very strict control mechanisms both for Paraguay itself and for other countries."
"There is therefore no question of the funds involved being diverted through shady channels or into dark corners - we are talking about independent codirection under the direct control of the Commission."
"The more important programme both in terms of funding and of its ultimate impact is perhaps the programme designed to tackle the social and regional causes of democratic instability in Paraguay. This programme deals with people' s living conditions, especially in rural areas."
"In this case a number of major programmes with significant budgets have already started. The aim of all these programmes is to improve the day-to-day living conditions of residents of rural areas, which still account for 46% of Paraguay' s population, and so to integrate them more securely into the country' s political and social structures."
"I would like to mention in particular that this includes a special programme supporting the indigenous population of the Chaco region."
"All in all, there is no doubt that these EU activities in Paraguay are unusually far-reaching given the size of the country."
"Nevertheless, it is true that we do not have a permanent representative on the spot."
"However, I am pleased to inform you that consideration is currently being given within the Commission to reorganising our foreign missions, and that this involves a shift of emphasis, so that this point will be taken into account."
"But as yet no decision has been taken to change the situation in Paraguay in this respect."
"I would like to conclude by saying that as far as we are concerned, the key objective of our international work is to defend democracy and the rule of law throughout the world, including Latin America and also therefore in Paraguay."
"I very much hope that this debate on Paraguay today in this house, here in Strasbourg, will be viewed not just as a sign of European solidarity, but also as a sign that Europe takes its responsibilities seriously!"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Peru"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-570/2000) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on the presidential elections in Peru;"
"(B5-0573/2000) by Mr Lipietz and Mr Nogueira Román, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the presidential elections in Peru;"
"(B5-0575/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Peru;"
"(B5-0576/2000) by Mr Marset Campos and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the result of the elections in Peru;"
"(B5-0581/2000) by Mr Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the presidential elections in Peru."
"Mr President, on 16 March, this Parliament adopted a resolution on the presidential and legislative elections in Peru, in which it expressed its confidence, within the context of cooperation in our relations with Peru, that the presidential and legislative elections would be held in a fair and transparent manner, in accordance with the universally held principles of democratic systems."
"Parliament called for the consolidation and the deepening of the rule of law in Peru and for democratic maturity from the Peruvian institutions."
"After the irregularities in the first round which took place in April, Parliament decided to send a delegation of observers from this House to the vote on 28 May."
"Since the deficiencies and irregularities noted by different independent organisations, both Peruvian and international, had not been put right, and after the withdrawal of Mr Toledo, one of the two candidates for the Presidency of the Republic, the delegation from the European Parliament decided not to carry out its mission in those circumstances."
"The Presidency of the European Union, in its declaration of 9 June this year, expressed its enormous concern at the irregularities and anomalies detected."
"Despite the fluid relations which the European Union maintains with Peru, which are embodied in the cooperation agreement with the Andean Pact which has been in force since 1998, we should remember once again that these very relations are based on the universally recognised principles of respect for pluralist democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"On the basis of these principles, the European Union must carefully assess the necessary response to this delicate situation resulting from the elections of 28 May."
"The Council of Ministers of the European Union, in its declaration of 9 June, has decided not to adopt sanctions against Peru at the moment."
"The meeting of chancellors of the Organisation of American States in Ottawa, having heard the report of the electoral mission headed by Eduardo Stein, has decided to send a new mission, which will include the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Organisation of American States, in order to ensure that the Government of Peru is adopting the necessary measures to re-establish democratic legality."
"The OAS has not adopted sanctions against Peru at the moment either."
"Finally, the candidate, Mr Toledo, during his visit to various countries of the European Union and to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (incidentally, it would have been desirable for him to have met with Members of this Parliament during his visit to Brussels), expressed on several occasions the importance of preserving and maintaining economic cooperation and aid from the European Union to the Peruvian people."
"In this regard, and before making any decisions - and this is one of the key points of our resolution -, we should, Commissioner, send a high level European Union mission which could, after meeting with all the political forces and with representatives of civil society, make an assessment of the situation on the ground in the light of the democratic clause, which is an essential element of the agreement between the European Union and Peru."
"This mission seems to me to be particularly appropriate since the European Union is the main provider of development aid and economic cooperation, and it is also the main investor in Peru."
"Mr President, since you have asked us not to take up the time allotted, and in summary, I will say that one of the main contributions which the European Union could make in this difficult situation - and I believe there is good reason, as I have just pointed out, not to leave the matter exclusively in the hands of the Organisation of American States - should be, in my opinion, to promote, on the basis of a guarantee of the full exercise of all civil and political rights, a consensus amongst all the forces which would allow democracy to be recovered, strengthened and deepened in Peru."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens wanted the joint resolution of this House to specifically consider the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori as President of Peru and to ask that fresh elections be organised."
"The joint resolution which will be proposed to you and to which the Greens have not put their names, merely highlights the irregularities and concludes that these challenge the legitimacy of this election."
"We are therefore dealing with a far weaker declaration than the one we wanted."
"First, we deplore such a cautious choice of words."
"Let me remind you that the conditions of this election, at least in the second round, were so disastrous that not only did the main opposition candidate withdraw, but so did all the international observers."
"In these circumstances, it could be concluded, even before the election, that the election was not valid."
"After the election, obviously, Mr Fujimori' s government could argue that since their candidate Fujimori had obtained more than 51%, it had to be concluded that even in the absence of any opposition, the vote was valid."
"Having said this, the vote count in many regions showed an excess of theoretical votes in relation to the first round, which is completely impossible given that there were no longer any opposition candidates."
"The excess vote was around 20% in some places."
"So not only was there no opposition, but it was even necessary to resort to fraud in order to obtain the figure of 51%."
"These observations should lead the European Parliament to proclaim the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori and call for more elections, rather than being content with merely questioning its legitimacy."
"Unlike the case of Paraguay, we are not going to see this as a reason for voting against the resolution."
"We are prepared to put our names to the joint resolution of the other groups, provided, however, that two points are introduced."
"We agree with what Mr Salafranca said about making European Union aid conditional on sending a European Parliament delegation on current human rights to Peru."
"However, we think this insufficient as, at this very moment, since the election in fact, military demonstrations and intimidation are being used against those members of the population who show their fury at this election, which is invalid in their eyes."
"We therefore ask that a tiny amendment be added, condemning the use of intimidation against the Peruvian population."
"This condemnation is not accompanied by any particular threat, and with regard to the conditionality of European Union aid, we gladly support the wording put forward by Mr Salafranca."
"The second amendment we are proposing, on the other hand, is a sort of catching-up on the matter of legality."
"You know that the Organisation of American States goes further than the European Parliament' s joint proposal apparently does, as this organisation is actually volunteering to suggest a democratic way out of the political crisis which Peru is stuck in over this matter."
"We are simply suggesting that the Parliament should approve the current efforts of the Organisation of American States to find a legal, peaceful way out of the crisis."
"These are the two amendments that would enable us simply to support the joint motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, it is clear that President Fujimori has challenged the international community and, in particular, the Organisation of American States and also the European Union."
"Therefore, from our point of view, as well as lamenting the situation and supporting the democratic forces, it is still absolutely essential that, as we did in the previous case of Paraguay, we remind Peru of the need for any relations with the European Union to be maintained in compliance with the democratic clause."
"Secondly, only by sending observers will we be able to assess the true situation and find a way to act appropriately."
"Therefore, since two recent days, 9 April and 28 May, have caused us great concern, it is clear that we will only be able to act appropriately if we send observers, which we hope will be possible, and who we hope will be able to act effectively."
"Mr President, the serious anomalies which have led to the withdrawal of one of the candidates, Mr Toledo, from the second round of the presidential elections, demonstrate that the Fujimori régime lacks any democratic safeguards, and there has been a dramatic deterioration in the living conditions of Peruvian society which should be resolved by democratic means."
"Fujimori' s failure to take account of the condemnations of the OAS, and the warning of the European Union and other international bodies in relation to these elections, condemns that country to a form of isolation which will be to the detriment of the Peruvian people and will increase social and political tension."
"For this reason, the European Union must firmly denounce these proceedings and, having recognised the extent to which democracy has deteriorated, promote a series of measures which will help to overcome the current situation and lead to the repetition of the elections with full safeguards in place."
"This is the best way to help Peru and, therefore, the European Union must make an effort so that its influence in Latin America may counteract so many years of anomalies and suffering and favour harmonious economic development, democracy and the consolidation of human rights."
"Mr President, I shall be brief, because almost everything has been said already, while I was waiting my turn."
"The situation in Peru, like the situation in Paraguay, gives cause for concern."
"Nevertheless, I must say that what we have witnessed in Peru is nothing new."
"The President of Peru has for years been failing to play by the rules that we expect in a democracy."
"So I would not just send a delegation of observers to Peru, but I would also recommend that the European Union, the Council and also this Parliament should pay more attention to the whole region. We need more than just a resolution every now and again, we need to be constantly alert and critical, so that the people who are working for democracy are aware of our support."
"Furthermore, I would like to point out that is not just the OAS, important as it is for Latin America, that has supported democracy in Latin America. The European Union and this Parliament have in fact also played a key role here."
"We have spent a great deal of money in this region and it would be gratifying if now and again people talked about the European Union' s contribution in Latin America, and not just about North America' s role."
"This is not intended to be a chauvinistic remark, I am just making it so that justice is done towards us."
"I hope that the European Parliament' s views on Peru will not go unheard in that country."
"I know that a great many people set a lot of store by what this Parliament says."
"Lastly, I would also like to mention that the longest standing relationship between the European Parliament and another parliament is with the Latin American Parliament - to which Peru also belongs - and that involves certain obligations."
"I accordingly hope that we will obtain a large majority in favour of this resolution."
"Mr President, the situation in Peru worries us."
"President Fujimori took power with dangerous plans: to give absolute priority to supposed economic efficiency, claiming that a strong hold on power was required to manage it, and to overcome what he called 'party-ocracy' , subliminally blaming all the previous problems on the institutions of the democratic state."
"Our fears were confirmed throughout Fujimori' s terms in office, and clear signs of authoritarianism were observed, which saw outrageous propaganda and systematic manipulation of the media."
"Furthermore, the President' s disregard for the rule of law became evident."
"It was under those circumstances that the elections of April and May were held and, as we feared, they turned out to be a farce, and were recognised and denounced as such by anyone looking on."
"In summary, that is what our resolution says, and it is good and appropriate that the European Parliament' s voice should be heard in this respect, for our own dignity, and in order to demonstrate our interest in the democratic process in Latin America, but also in order to demonstrate our support, which the Peruvian democrats need and deserve."
"While we are voting in favour of the resolution in question, I would like to point out two issues relating to its text."
"Firstly, not just the mere fact that one of the candidates decided not to stand in the second round of the elections, but rather that that candidate was Alejandro Toledo, who is supported by all the opposition, and who in free elections would stand an extremely good chance of toppling Fujimori."
"My second point is that I regret the fact that the resolution does not refer to the disappointing role played by the Organisation of American States throughout this process."
"In fact, having denounced the irregularities of the campaign, demanded the postponement of the second round and withdrawn its observers, it does not seem consistent that it should remain silent with no further reaction or sanctions, contenting itself in reality with merely condemning the situation."
"By taking this attitude, I believe that the OAS has discredited itself considerably."
"I will end by expressing our solidarity with Alejandro Toledo, with the democrats and people of Peru, denouncing Fujimori as a sinister and autocratic personality, rejecting the position of those people who have reacted with silence and even at times with a certain complacency - which has been well publicised by the President to justify his tattered legitimacy - and reaffirming our commitment to rejecting this farce and to closely monitoring the events in Peru for the sake of the respect for democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has of course followed the whole election process in Peru, and with mounting concern."
"In view of the numerous irregularities and technical problems, and the adherence to the date for the second ballot, the European Union decided to recall its observers from Peru."
"As has already been mentioned, a similar decision was taken by the Organisation of American States."
"In taking this step, the EU wished to express its conviction that the Peruvian election could not have the democratic legitimacy that it would have had in normal circumstances, and which this country urgently needed."
"We must not simply express our regret about this step, we also need to consider what we can do to strengthen Peru' s democratic institutions."
"The Commission considers that it needs to be made clear to Peru, and as forcefully as possible, that we insist on strict observance of the principles of democracy and of the rule of law, and that this applies all the more so at a time and in circumstances when the democratic systems of other countries in the region are also being weakened."
"For example, we were discussing Paraguay just a few minutes ago."
"In its statement of 9 June, the European Union stressed that it would support the OAS mission to Peru."
"We expect this mission to express its findings in the clearest terms and to come up with unequivocal results."
"We will be following the situation in Peru with the greatest vigilance and are prepared to rethink our relations with Peru against this background."
"At the same time, the Commission attaches great importance to taking concrete measures to reinforce Peru' s democratic institutions and to promote political pluralism in that country, and will make proposals to that effect."
"The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed."
"As planned, Mr Turco' s report, which we debated this afternoon, will be put to the vote during voting time which begins in a few moments."
"Mr President, looking around the Chamber at this moment I think it is obvious that after yesterday's vote when we abolished Fridays, the abolition of Thursday has already begun."
"I hope colleagues will take note of this and try to revise that unwise decision as soon as possible."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to support the sentiments of the previous speaker, and also to suggest that votes taken on Thursday evenings should be taken into account when calculating the daily attendance allowance."
"President, I would just like to tell my fellow Member that he might just as well have voted for the abolition of Thursday too."
"I would simply like to thank all the honourable Members for providing such a clear demonstration on the subject of Friday' s vote of ""whittling away"" ."
"Mr President, it is a bit odd in such a small gathering to want to return to the decisions which were taken in an undemocratic manner yesterday."
"In my opinion, it would be preferable if those who are now vigorously protesting against the absence of fellow Members were to do what is necessary to get these delegates to attend."
"I can indeed see it happening that, if we do not have a quorum on Thursdays, we will need to discontinue the sittings on Thursdays."
"If we want to deal with a serious agenda, then we need to attend."
"Spread the word to your fellow delegates, persuade them to attend without biting their heads off."
"If you do not mind, ladies and gentlemen, I shall interrupt this fascinating debate to move on to something which is equally fascinating, the vote on topical and urgent subjects."
"Vote (continuation)"
"Mr President, first of all, this technical amendment has been voted upon, and I do not see why we have to come back to it."
"Let me point out that the rapporteur belongs to the TDI group and that consequently the honourable Member cannot complain."
"That is exactly what was on my list."
"The amendment has been voted upon as I announced it."
"We now come to the final vote."
"Mr President, I am merely trying to clarify - and this does not have to be done now, it can be done later - whether the amendment was tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members or by the rapporteur."
"This makes a difference and affects the way we vote."
"I would be grateful if this could be clarified afterwards, because we voted on the assumption that this was not a TDI amendment, but an amendment tabled by the rapporteur."
"I would like to make it quite clear that this amendment was tabled by the TDI group, and was voted by plenary."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that, in my opinion, amendments should be accepted or rejected on the basis of their content and not on the basis of who has put their name to them."
"They have already been voted upon."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"It is ridiculous for Members to say after the vote that they would not have voted in favour of an amendment because a particular group tabled that amendment."
"Whether you agree with an amendment or not should be the basis of the decision."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Tunisia (B5-0508/2000)"
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the report on Tunisia because I do not feel that this type of document serves much purpose."
"Since we are discussing the protection of freedom and human rights, I would like to take this opportunity to say that a serious violation, or rather an attempt at violation of the right to freedom of speech took place today in the Parliament forecourt."
"The victims were a group of young people with banners and flags who were demonstrating against globalisation and genetically modified organisms."
"Water was thrown out of one of the Parliament offices - I do not know whether it was in a bucket or another container - by, it appears, a Member of Parliament, who then protested in the Chamber against the demonstration. I repeat that this demonstration is a free expression of thought, even though I may not agree with the tone or expressions used."
"This incident was recorded on film and I would ask the Presidency to watch it and adopt any necessary measures."
". (FR) We voted for the joint motion for a resolution despite the fact that we neither approved of a number of the terms used, nor the silence pertaining to the French government' s responsibility with regard to the situation in Tunisia."
"This is because this is the only means given us by parliamentary procedure through which we are able to express our protest against the dictatorship in Tunisia."
"By protesting at this dictatorship, however, we are looking to denounce the support that it has been given by the French Government, just as many other dictatorships do and have done in the past, in the former colonial empire representing French imperialism in Africa."
"We note the Jesuitism of the parties that have succeeded one another in government in France, which are voting here for a resolution to demand rights and freedoms in Tunisia."
"When they are in power and when they have, therefore, the means to apply considerable pressure on the Tunisian regime, they do nothing, since, in fact, they do not give a hoot about the rights and liberties in this country, from the moment that its leaders secure order and, above all, from the moment that economic relations become smooth and profitable for France."
"Marset Campos Report (A5-0133/2000)"
"Bordes (GUE/NGL)."
"(FR) Mr President, we are not against the planned aid for the poor countries of Central America, and that is why we have voted for the report, despite the inadequacy of the proposals."
"We are, however, convinced that this aid will benefit the population only to a very limited extent, as there are no plans to control the allocation of these sums and consequently, there is nothing to guarantee that they are not, at least partly, misappropriated by the government, or even directly by the wealthy classes."
"Furthermore, all aid, even the best controlled, will be absolutely no use at all as long as these countries continue to be plundered and their populations exploited by large western cartels."
"Mr President, I voted for the Marset Campos report and I will tell you why, although I would first like to express my support for Mr Speroni' s speech."
"If what he said is true, as I am sure it is since he is a truthful man, then I consider that this is a very serious incident."
"With regard to my explanation of vote, I have to say that I am certainly in favour of assisting anyone who is in difficulty such as the population of Central America, but I wonder and I would ask you, Mr President, how it can be that the world' s poorest countries have to wait for a hurricane before they receive any assistance for their economy or their daily lives."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament should ensure that aid is always available for the communities who need it, wherever their location in the world."
"Schmitt Report (A5-0123)"
"Berthu (UEN)."
"(FR) President, the Commission working document 'Towards common standards on asylum procedures' is a short, fairly general text which, according to the introduction, is designed to launch a discussion following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty which, in its new Article 63, once again provides for the adoption of a whole series of joint European standards applicable to refugees and displaced persons."
"We have good reason to be surprised at this introduction to the subject."
"Why launch a discussion?"
"We had thought, quite logically, that all the discussions had taken place before the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and that the federalists knew where they were going."
"In fact, on reading the Commission document and the report by the European Parliament, we see that this was not the case."
"Yes, the need to harmonise asylum standards is broadly recommended by these texts."
"But, first and foremost, the reasoning seems weak."
"For example, it condemns the disparities in the way refugees are treated from one country to the next but does not provide examples."
"There may be perfectly legitimate reasons for these disparities, relating to the special features of a country, its culture or its links with former colonies."
"In reality, on closer inspection, there is only one serious reason - at least so it seems - for harmonising asylum standards: because abolishing internal border controls under the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that includes as far as third country nationals are concerned, demolishes the whole delicate legal balance and risks causing entirely uncontrolled secondary movements of refugees."
"So, in fact, we are currently trying to solve a problem largely created by the Treaty of Amsterdam itself and, what is more, we are going to solve it to our disadvantage as it is clear that asylum standards cannot be harmonised from the bottom up - for who would dare? - but rather towards the top with all the in-draughts normally caused by this type of policy."
"We risk being caught up in the system."
"In order to escape, we can only invite the governments to exercise the utmost caution, retain as much power as possible, and interpret Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam narrowly."
"Mr President, this explanation of vote is also shared by Arlette Laguiller and Armonie Bordes."
"The rapporteur' s succinct justification of his report expresses his misgivings on harmonisation with the fairly lax standards characterising the laws and common practice in some States, clearly showing the author' s desire to harmonise the right of asylum in the various countries of the European Union, but from the top."
"All the more so, given that a number of passages attack asylum abuses, even though governments in almost every country in Europe restrict this right, sometimes excessively stringently."
"This means that although, in some European countries, the application of this text could in theory improve the situation of asylum seekers, it would make it worse in others."
"Consequently, we have abstained from voting on this report, but we did vote in favour of the few articles, and especially the amendments, that at least express the idea that the right of asylum should be extended, and we denounce the scandalous nature of the policies of most European States, in particular France, which refuse to recognise this right, especially in the case of refugees from Algeria given the abuses by fundamentalists and the army."
"Mr President, here, at last, is a measure - fortunately not the only one - which is a credit to the European Union."
"I am totally in favour of this measure, for it is a precise declaration to the Commission that the burden of providing asylum for those who are forced to abandon their own territory, their home, family, friends and all they have in the world must be shared equally between all 15 Member States of the European Union."
"This is a completely new principle, a fact - and we hope that a directive will be produced to enshrine that principle - which makes of the European Union something tangible, something real."
"This is a decisive factor and it particularly influenced my decision to vote for the motion."
"Furthermore, I consider that it would be appropriate for the Commission to apply this decision retroactively and share the burden borne by those who accepted Kosovar refugees between the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, I abstained in the vote because I do not consider that these texts serve much purpose."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to say that there may be somebody who is attempting to turn someone else into a refugee this year as well, some intolerant person who is convinced that his ideas should prevail."
"We are against a Communist, dictatorial Europe which eradicates the identity of peoples by eliminating the differences between them."
"Communism is not a question of the poor fighting against rich capitalists: it means achieving equality by means of blanket standardisation, dictating how things should be instead of establishing genuine equality, which is based on the diversity of individuals and peoples."
"Communism and Europe in its current state represent equality expressed as the mobility of the power of society, which means that no changes need to be made to the current situation."
"We, on the other hand, consider that there is a need for a great deal of change and that the Europe of peoples should mean freedom for all peoples, including the people of the Po Valley, and that those young people from the Po Valley also have the right to demonstrate without fear of insult or intimidation, because we want our flags to fly as well as the red flag."
"The asylum issue is a major political issue concerning fundamental democratic rights, the safeguarding of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and the preservation of human dignity."
"The problem of political asylum seekers must be examined in this light alone and efforts to harmonize asylum policy come what may and turn it into a means of chipping away at fundamental human rights, reinforcing suppressive, policing measures and rebuilding fortress Europe must be blocked."
"It must not be used as a pretext for intensifying and strengthening the electronic filing systems created under Europol and Schengen, which target not only refugees but also the fundamental individual freedoms of the citizens of the EU themselves."
"We must take all the legislative and other measures needed to respect the rights of asylum seekers, by strictly applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention."
"We must respect and strengthen all the provisions on protecting and granting asylum to individuals or groups being persecuted in their countries by government, quasi-government or other groups on ideological, philosophical, political, religious, racial, cultural or other grounds by giving them guarantees and a dignified reception and living conditions."
"Asylum seekers in the Member States of the EU must be treated in a dignified and humane manner."
"We must also take proper account of all the parameters and peculiarities of their situation and of the dangers which threaten them should they return to their countries by introducing any protective measures required, even for those who do not satisfy the formal criteria for obtaining asylum, which criteria must be clearly defined in accordance with the principles of international law and fundamental human rights."
"Arbitrary and violent deportation is a common occurrence because of the applicant' s difficulty in resorting to the judicial authorities for protection, and the phenomenon of group deportations is intolerable and violates conventions on and the principles of human rights."
"We would like to highlight and draw attention to the fact that formulating even more harmonized criteria for granting asylum by gradually and effectively moving away from those laid down in the Geneva Convention and essentially replacing them with regulations such as those mentioned in the report, may have a negative and repressive impact."
"In this sense, we deplore the so-called ""policy of burden sharing"" which conceals a blatant attempt to relieve certain powerful states in the EU from the ""burden"" of receiving large numbers of refugees and relocating them to other countries."
"Finally, we firmly believe that the best and most fundamental way to address the refugee issue is to maintain the right conditions for peace and the social, economic and democratic development in every country in the world."
"Until these conditions are guaranteed and while they are being undermined by major economic and military interests which destroy the structures, societies, rights and dignity of the people as they please and for their own benefit, then there will continue to be an ever rising tide of uprooted and persecuted individuals."
". (FR) Although the number of asylum applications fell from 660 000 in 1993 to 227 000 in 1997, this is not because persecution has decreased but because it is more difficult to apply for a visa."
"The Dublin Convention allows asylum applications to be made only in the first State entered by the refugee."
"The aim of the Schmitt report is clear: ""To re-enhance the reputation and substance of the right of asylum, the qualification procedure should be tightened up, and abuses resolutely curbed"" ."
"Moreover, the States on the edges of the Schengen zone are considered to be ""secure"" ."
"They therefore become the border guards of fortress Europe."
"How can we consider countries that carry out serious discrimination against gypsies (Romania and Slovakia) as sufficiently safe for Belgium to send anyone it judges undesirable en masse there."
"Finally, the current concept of the refugee is far short of that stipulated by the Geneva Convention of 1951, ""A refugee is any person who, owing to fear of being persecuted, is unable to avail himself of the protection of that country."""
"In fact, nowadays refugees have to provide more and more proof that their lives are under threat, which obviously is difficult, if not impossible."
"For the European Union to finally apply the right of asylum, it would have to break with the obsessive practice of immigration control."
"The more we respect freedom of movement, the more Europe will be worthy of those who seek refuge here."
". (FR) The statistics concerning the exponential rise in asylum applications currently submitted every year in the European Union and the real situation are an unfortunate and tragic illustration of the importance of political asylum for each Member State of the European Union."
"In its desire to ""Communitise"" and standardise refugee reception procedures, subject areas which are, by their very essence, matters of national sovereignty, Europe is dragging us along in its policy of small steps towards an area of social inequality, positive discrimination in favour of foreigners and high insecurity, where drugs, illegal immigrants, bogus asylum seekers entering the territory of a Member State for strictly economical reasons, terrorism and crime are free to move where they will."
"For serious matters that affect the exercise of justice, the management of immigration into a country, public order or public freedom, the actions of the European Union can only and must merely be subsidiary and only concern truly transnational phenomena of criminality or public order problems."
"Finally, this report, just like many others relating to immigration management, is unrealistic and highly populist."
"Because in fact, wanting to systematically favour foreign nationals over national citizens, whatever the cost, by means of many and varied forms of aid, particularly regarding proof, accommodation, keeping families together or even financial, medical and educational aid, will only lead to rejection by the population of the receiving country."
"This is why the Members of the National Front and I myself will vote against this report which jeopardises people' s rights and security and also democracy."
"The creation of a legal penal system cannot be achieved in haste."
"""Communitising"" procedures for asylum, justice and internal public order within the Member States cannot be achieved without first consulting all the citizens concerned."
"I bet that if they were to be consulted, our Eurocrats, those advocates of a centralised federal super-Europe would have to review their plans out of increased respect for democracy in the construction of Europe."
". (FR) In any civilisation, asylum is a concrete example of charity towards those who, for many reasons, find themselves in difficulty, and nobody is contesting the validity of giving aid to those who are victims."
"Reading Mr Schmitt' s report makes me think we are not talking about the same thing."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs appears to believe that the disparities in the laws of the Member States actually conceal asylum rights that are non-existent or not often applied, as if we were living under totalitarian regimes and our nations had not been providing asylum for centuries."
"This same committee discovers the laws of democracy when it suggests that the discrepancies from one country to the next are linked to the political context as much as to the content of the applications."
"It is clear that, for a European Union that is naturally and deliberately cut off from everyday reality, the political will expressed by the citizens during elections is of no great interest, unless it conforms to Community doctrine."
"This House does not want to improve the situation for asylum seekers."
"The political will of this House is, in this field as in any other, to extend the scope of Community power to the detriment of the Member States, who are apparently unworthy of such power."
"If the German people and their government wish to be the European Union country most welcoming to refugees, they are to be congratulated."
"If the other countries do not match this, often because they simply do not wish to, then it is nothing to do with the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Even the Socialist French Government ""prefers"" - and I quote - ""a flexible approach enabling national characteristics of asylum procedure to be observed"" ."
"So what about the recurring proposal that costs should be shared?"
"Either the Member States have their own policy, for which they are responsible and which they therefore finance, or the European Union ""Communitises"" this field and includes the costs in its budget."
"If such and such a country finds its policy too expensive, let it change the policy."
"We do not want a Community policy in the hands of the Commission, nor do we want the policy of another government: we want our people and their elected representatives to retain control over their own decisions and destiny."
"Respect for human rights should be maintained internationally."
"If people' s rights are infringed, it is the responsibility of surrounding countries to offer asylum to those who request protection from persecution."
"The nations of the world have a shared responsibility for ensuring that all refugees receive a welcome fit for human beings."
"No countries can argue their way out of responsibility when refugees seek asylum on their territory."
"Practice in granting asylum varies from one EU country to another. In general, however, policy on refugees has been tightened up throughout Europe in recent years."
"Coordination of the Member States' responsibilities is necessary if countries are in practice to be able to pursue generous policies on refugees."
"We therefore welcome the Commission' s working document in principle, together with Ingo Schmitt' s report on the drawing up of a common policy on asylum and refugees, but we emphasise that it ought not to be the least generous countries which set the standards."
"We want to see a European policy on refugees which is better at distributing the overall burden between the countries of Europe on condition that the European, as well as the Swedish, policy on refugees will in future be more humane than they are at present."
"Nor must we forget that refugees and immigrants have a positive influence on the Member States."
"They often have experience and knowledge to contribute to society."
"Moreover, immigration is especially important now, given the shortage of labour which is beginning to make itself ever more felt in the Member States."
"With regard to Ingo Schmitt' s report, we want to emphasise that asylum applications ought always to be examined individually in the light of the individual applicant' s merits, as should also be the norm in the case of mass migrations."
"What is more, it is important that refugees should in principle be entitled to the same social benefits as other people resident in the particular country dealing with the application for asylum."
"This basic principle is established in the Geneva Convention and must be given due attention and complied with."
"We also think it important that the current definition of refugee and asylum in the Geneva Convention be reviewed and extended so that they also include people who seek asylum on the grounds of gender and sexual orientation."
"- (DE) In 1993 the Federal Republic of Germany watered down the right to political asylum in its constitution, thus sealing its borders against immigration by asylum-seekers."
"Germany has virtually ceased to grant asylum."
"Refugees are socially and legally marginalised or driven into the world of illegal immigrants."
"The aim of the Schmitt report is to extend this degrading and inhumane system to the entire European Union."
"It is precisely this system that is to serve as the basis for the ""common standards on asylum procedures"" ."
"The problems of asylum legislation are not addressed in the Schmitt report."
"There is not a single word about inhumane pre-expulsion detention centres."
"Nor is there a word of criticism about social discrimination against refugees, which in Germany takes place under the Law on Benefits for Asylum-Seekers."
"Mr Schmitt' s report omits to mention that refugees suffer from discrimination in the job market."
"In Germany, they are categorically forbidden to work."
"The rapporteur does not even mention the invasions of personal privacy or violations of data protection rights that are part of daily life for asylum-seekers."
"Thanks to ""Eurodac"" and the ""Schengen Information System"" , no other group of people is as closely monitored as refugees."
"They have become the first ""transparent people"" ."
"Mr Schmitt' s report does not offer any potential solutions to all these problems."
"Instead, the rapporteur complains that people ""wrongfully lay claim"" to the right of asylum in Europe."
"Since the change in the right to asylum, many refugees no longer have any legal claim to asylum. It was, and remains, totally legitimate to want to live somewhere other than your place of birth."
"Framing this right and creating optimum conditions for it should be a key priority for this Parliament!"
"Instead, the statements in the report help to discredit and criminalise asylum-seekers."
"With regard to accepting asylum-seekers, the Schmitt report demands ""burden sharing"" within the EU."
"Asylum-seekers are accordingly denigrated as being a burden."
"How can a humane asylum and refugee policy which meets the needs of refugees be based on a fundamental assumption of this kind?"
"Furthermore, the Schmitt report welcomes agreements whereby third countries would promise to readmit rejected asylum-seekers."
"These are an instrument of a fortress Europe policy which has nothing in common with a humane refugee policy."
"Such readmission agreements can lead to people seeking protection being pushed back to their countries of origin, and make it easier for EU Member States to refuse asylum."
"Mr Schmitt' s report also supports the concepts of ""safe third countries"" and ""safe countries of origin"" ."
"These concepts are responsible for victims of political persecution failing to obtain asylum in Germany, that is to say whenever they enter via ""safe third countries"" or come from a ""safe country of origin"" ."
"These instruments obstruct fair and equitable asylum procedures, and they should therefore be rejected and abolished as quickly as possible."
"The European Parliament must make proposals that take account of the interests of refugees and asylum-seekers in the European Union."
"We must press for an end to the policy of ""fortress Europe"" , of the weakening of the right of asylum and of undermining the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees."
"Everyone seeking refuge in the EU must have access to a just and fair reception procedure."
"Unfortunately, Mr Schmitt' s report goes in the opposite direction."
"It reinforces the fortress Europe policy and advocates further restrictions on long-term protection of refugees and asylum-seekers."
"I reject the extension of a fortress Europe and I accordingly reject the resolution on ""common standards on asylum procedures"" ."
". (FR) It should not be forgotten that certain Members of this House, within their own families, may have known asylum seekers."
"Only sixty years ago, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Austrians and others, persecuted by their fascist or Nazi governments, were able to benefit from the right of asylum."
"It was our pride and our duty."
"In France, our most famous asylum seeker was General de Gaulle, who was able to benefit from the right of asylum in England in order to prepare the resistance."
"The main value of this report is that it wishes to unify the laws of the Member States on asylum procedure."
"Laws and procedures should be harmonised before the Dublin Convention and the Eurodac system are implemented."
"It would be unfair to authorise only a single asylum request for the countries of the European Union, given that it does not have the same chance of success from one State to another."
"In my opinion, the standards set by the report are too low."
"There are omissions and certain points are still unclear."
"Persecution is not just political or caused by the States."
"Thus, persecuted Afghan women who are stoned for not wearing the chador, should without exception benefit from the right of asylum."
"Similarly, an Algerian journalist threatened with death by fundamentalists should be able to benefit from the right of asylum."
"Certain States that persecute dissidents are considered to be great democracies."
"This is why requests from Chechnya are not examined."
"In order to grant the right of asylum, the States require proof of persecution."
"But this is often difficult to provide, due to the persecution itself."
"The report remains vague on this subject."
"Finally, the procedure should take account of family ties, language, cultural affinity and the colonial history of asylum seekers' country of origin, in order to help them to cope with exile."
"If there is abuse or people are turned away, it is because of the lack of coherent rules."
"It would be unacceptable to be suspicious and restrict this great achievement in the history of humanity, which remains the only lifeline for freedom fighters worldwide."
"I abstained on Amendment No 14."
"The aim of this amendment is to ""request that in every application of the Eurodac system, emphasis be strongly placed on data protection in order to protect asylum seekers from any abuse of the information gathered"" ."
"This amendment admittedly aims to protect data on the information gathered."
"But I am against the actual idea of systematically collecting information, as by Eurodac, as I am against the very idea of accelerated procedures, which can give rise to many forms of abuse."
"Report Sörensen (A5-0126/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s decision to adopt rules on compensating victims of crimes in the European Union."
"As representative of the Pensioners' Party which sent me to Parliament, I would point out that the majority of victims of crime are elderly."
"In Europe, it is no longer possible for the elderly to set foot out of doors, not only at night but during the day as well in some areas."
"For this reason I am satisfied by this European Union initiative."
"Moreover, it should be stressed that the State must pay victims compensation on behalf of those responsible and then claim damages directly from the criminals."
". The UK Conservatives have always believed that more emphasis should be placed within the criminal law system on looking towards supporting the needs of victims of crime."
"We therefore applaud those sentiments in the Sörensen report which support our view."
"However, because the report also suggests changes in the structures of the voting procedure in the European institutions, and has serious resource implications, we cannot give it our overall support."
"- (FR) Congratulations!"
"Once again, Europe has shown its great sense of responsibility in taking an interest in crime victims."
"As highlighted in the report, the number of crime victims is constantly increasing."
"What is the solution?"
"As far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is material, legal, medical, psychological and social assistance for crime victims."
"For us, the Members of the National Front, it is different."
"It is not the symptoms of the problem that must be treated, but the cause."
"Giving support in this area is absolutely no use at all and merely enables the European governing bodies to ease their conscience."
"The very origins of crime in Europe must be tackled at source, because then, and only then, will the number of victims be reduced and will we be able to carry out our duty to help them to the full."
"However, we only need to make a simple observation to see that, throughout Europe, crime is increasing, people in urban and rural areas feel less and less safe, international terrorism, paedophilia, sex tourism, enforced prostitution and trafficking in women, money laundering, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and cross-border organised crime are ever increasing."
"In the name of the sacrosanct principle of the freedom of movement of people, these are the people who are drugged, attacked or killed."
"Your unrestricted freedom of movement within your unachievable area of freedom, justice and security, is neither necessary nor unavoidable."
"On the contrary, it is by re-establishing our borders and refusing to grant the tenants of the ivory towers in Strasbourg and Brussels any power in the field of policing, justice or immigration, that the security of European citizens may be preserved and guaranteed."
"So wake up and take responsibility!"
"Weeping over and counting crime victims in Europe will not save them or bring them back: what we need to do is make sure that people do not become victims, and to achieve that, we must find ways of ensuring our security, which you are incapable of doing."
"First of all, learn to take responsibility, learn to govern."
"Report Turco (A5-0138/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Turco report although I would have preferred to vote against it for it resembles a final balance sheet and is, above all, a very tedious report on the allocation and use of the Structural Funds in 1998."
"Personally, I am convinced that the European Union must completely change the way it allocates aid to those in need of its support."
"In my view, the system of programmes and grids which has been used for twenty years to create new items in the outgoings section of the European Union balance sheet, needs to be completely revamped."
"There is too much wastage and the desired objectives are not being achieved."
"I feel that it is time to change the European Union' s system of expenditure."
". (IT) The Union for a Europe of Nations Group agrees with Mr Turco' s report."
"What is more, it is important to look more closely at certain aspects of the report which, although they are more concerned with the last period of aid programmes than with providing an analysis after the event, are just as important for the current period."
"I therefore call for greater and more meaningful coordination between the Structural Fund initiatives, with particular reference to the ESF, and more tangible compatibility not only with the longstanding annual horizontal themes - for example the SMEs - but also with new solutions."
"Furthermore, since employment is one of the three governing motifs of the new programming period, Parliament should be kept regularly informed of the quality and quantity of available jobs by means of the Commission reports on the use of the funds in question."
"The information should include a balance sheet as well as forecasts."
"One further aspect concerns another governing motif for the current period: regional and local development and related issues."
"New actions based on local initiatives carried out in a partnership framework have recently been introduced to boost the profile of this motif."
"It therefore becomes important not only to learn how to be efficient in implementing these guidelines but also to be aware of potential obstacles to their implementation, and always proceed in the knowledge that the Community also has an objective in terms of employment."
"It will be important from this as well as other points of view to verify that these objectives and guidelines are consistent with those of the Member States, starting with their national annual employment plans."
"The final point has to be the detection of fraud."
"The Commission mentions this in its report but provides an overview, confining itself to general aspects and not providing a detailed evaluation, so to speak, of the frauds, still less revealing the means used to combat fraud in the past or those to be used in the future."
"This last aspect is, in fact, an unambiguous indication of commitment and political determination."
"Mr President, I would also like to speak for personal reasons in order to clear up some of the confusion."
"First of all, I did not invite the group, and I have already told the press that I do not agree with all that the group said."
"However, after the manner of Voltaire, I consider that anybody should be free to demonstrate his own ideas, especially in a place which represents the sovereignty of the people."
"I realise that some language can be offensive, but when one is on the receiving end of a bucket of water one is quite likely to be somewhat free in one' s response."
"I would stress that the incident was recorded on film, and it is clear from this film that the bad language aimed at the person who threw the water was delivered after the water had been thrown."
"Furthermore, I am sure that we have all witnessed demonstrations, including demonstrations by other members of the party of the Member who has just spoken."
"When, for example, his fellow party members demonstrated in front of Fiat against the owner of the firm, the language used certainly did not lack force, but nobody dared to suggest that the language used during a demonstration had to be suitable for a court reception."
"I therefore maintain that it should be possible to express one' s opinions freely, even if this means giving offence."
"Should the need arise, the offended party can always take the necessary action through the appropriate channels."
"But freedom of speech must be upheld!"
"Allow me to point out that the President' s private office has been informed of these events and will, I can assure you, take all the necessary measures."
"Mr President, I fail to understand why, at the start of the sitting, Mrs Napoletano referred to my party, Forza Italia, in connection with the incident which occurred in the Chamber."
"I would like her to clarify her remarks because not only did we vote for President Prodi but we have neither agreed in the past nor agree now with the insults delivered in the forecourt in front of the Parliament building."
"I fail to understand why Mrs Napoletano involved my party in the matter."
"I am genuinely perplexed."
"Please would she explain her reasons, for it is not our job to create bad feeling or pass judgement."
"We are judging the behaviour of these young people because of the things they said, but I would like to know whether what Mr Speroni said is true, for if it is true that a Member of Parliament threw water over these people, the behaviour of the Member of Parliament is also reprehensible."
"I therefore feel that it is for the Presidency to clarify the sequence of events."
"Of course the language used is to be condemned, but we must make sure that we ascertain all the facts."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is neither the time nor the place to start this debate."
"As I told you, the President has been informed of this matter and will take the necessary action."
"I personally cannot give you any explanation at present."
"Cohesion Fund (1998)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya (A5-0140/2000) - Cohesion Fund (1998), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission' s Annual Report on the Cohesion Fund 1998 (COM(1999)483 - C5-0326/1999 - 1999/2212(COS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as you all know, the objective of the Cohesion Fund is to contribute to economic and social cohesion and at the same time reduce regional and social disparities, through solidarity amongst the Member States."
"Thanks to this fund, numerous countries of the European Union have had the opportunity to try to lessen the distance between themselves and the wealthier countries, and the results have been spectacular but insufficient."
"The income per capita has increased from two thirds to three quarters of the Community average and the participation of the European funds in the growth of each of these four countries stood at an average of 0.5% per year."
"However, we should point out two problems for the future."
"Firstly, the incorporation of new countries, which means that the countries which currently benefit from the Cohesion Fund may find that they will no longer be in receipt of those Funds before they have achieved the objectives of real convergence."
"In this respect, we should consider a series of programmes for the future which will allow the new Members to achieve convergence with the European Union while, at the same time, the four countries which receive Cohesion funds should continue to receive them so that they can achieve the true objectives of convergence, growth and the generation of full employment."
"Secondly, another problem is the temptation of some wealthier countries to penalise those countries which, since they receive Cohesion Funds, have achieved nominal convergence on the basis of serious, responsible, sympathetic and rigorous structural and economic policies, but clearly still without achieving true convergence, by eliminating them, in this case, from the Cohesion Fund, which could give rise to two possible situations."
"Firstly, they may opt for less rigorous and more inflationist policies in order not to lose those funds."
"Secondly, growth and convergence with the other countries of the European Union may come to a halt in some countries."
"It would therefore be good to distinguish, Commissioner, between true convergence and nominal convergence."
"Lastly, I would like to take up a series of recommendations regarding the Cohesion Fund."
"Firstly, we should make greater investment in the railways, ports and maritime transport."
"Secondly, transport aimed at the integration of peripheral regions, islands and outlying areas should become a priority."
"Thirdly, we should pay greater attention to sustainable means of transport."
"Fourthly, we need to take more action in the field of reforestation and land reclamation."
"Fifthly, we must tackle the problem of the treatment of residues and solid waste."
"Lastly, as we pointed out previously, we need more investment in urban centres."
"I would also like to point out that, tomorrow, four amendments will be presented, two of them approved in committee as well as two new ones which are before the House."
"My position - the reasons for which I have explained in committee - is not to accept them, since in general terms they simply propose new criteria."
"We are talking about the Cohesion Fund and the 1998 audit, on which there is a regulation and criteria which have already been approved for 2000-2006 and we do not believe that this is the moment to change the criteria with regard to eligibility and the distribution of those funds."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, today, eight years on from Maastricht, the Cohesion Fund has, without a shadow of doubt, made a positive contribution towards promoting the economic and social cohesion of the regions of the EU and has had clear results in tackling social and regional disparities."
"Since I live in an area which benefits from the Fund, I can assure you that every one of my fellow countrymen is also aware of and acknowledges these results, not only because of the information and publicity campaigns, but mainly because the projects which have received funding belong to basic sectors which affect his quality of life, which he can see is improving."
"We would therefore like to commend the Commission for its actions so far in implementing the objectives of the fund and we urge it to continue its efforts to ensure that the Fund is used properly and helps improve its efficiency in the new programme period still further."
"We must, of course, stress that the environmental aid granted continues to concentrate on the water sector, despite the need in many other cases for other measures to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and the rational utilization of natural resources as laid down in Article 174 of the Treaty, which refers to reafforestation, land reclamation, etc. Considerable investment is still required in order to deal with the serious problem of treating solid waste and refuse, although we still need to adopt incentives for using the most modern, environmentally-friendly and efficient technology."
"It is also worth our supporting the promotion of further investment in environmentally-friendly transport infrastructures and we insist on the need to continue developing joint transport systems."
"In view of forthcoming enlargement, which presents a great challenge, I consider it essential that we take prompt action to ensure that funding under the Cohesion Fund continues, given that it intervenes in two sectors which are very important in helping to achieve the objective of economic and social cohesion in the European Union, which is the Fund' s very raison d' être."
"The fact that it has so far worked highly effectively should be enough to convince us of the need to continue funding to recipient countries, provided they need continuing support and depending, aside from the nominal convergence of the economies of Member States, on real convergence of both the incomes and, more generally, the quality of life of European citizens in their regions."
"I should like to close by thanking the rapporteur for his sterling work and his willingness to cooperate during the procedure to examine and supplement his report in committee and I should like to pass on to you this succinct and, to my mind, rather dramatic appeal by a farmer in my region."
"As he said so very simply yet so very forcefully on hearing of the achievements of our Union: ""Europe yes, but a Europe for all the Europeans of the Union"" ."
"Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on my own behalf and on behalf of the Greens, for this report provides a very good overview of how the Cohesion Fund has operated and of the work that was done in the course of 1998."
"I am particularly pleased with developments, which tend towards increased investment in the railway sector, ports and marine transport."
"Unfortunately, there is still quite a large imbalance in relation to the roads sector."
"We have therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that investment in the roads sector should not represent more than a quarter of all investments in transport sector infrastructure so that it will be possible to comply with the guidelines for budget item B5-7, which deals with trans-European networks."
"This is something which, in our view, is very important."
"We should like, on the whole, to see a more balanced investment policy, aimed at increasing diversification and investment in the environment and, at the same time, reducing investment in the roads sector."
"We also welcome the fact that the Committee accepted our proposal, which is now point 9, requiring that it should also be possible to use resources available for environmental projects for financing projects designed both to preserve and to carry out assessments of biological diversity."
"Investment in methods of dealing with waste in as environmentally friendly ways as possible is discussed well enough in point 8."
"We would nonetheless add something in the form of Amendment 3, which makes it clear that priority ought to be given to efforts to promote recycling and re-use."
"Naturally, the amount of waste ought also to be reduced."
"In addition to these environment-related amendments, we also have an amendment about the need to comply with the additionality principle."
"We would ask the Commission to submit a report on the extent to which the additionality principle is respected when resources are obtained from the Cohesion Fund."
"Mr President, I must congratulate the rapporteur and the Commission on their evaluation of the implementation of the Cohesion Fund in 1998. The report now before us reveals some very positive results."
"There is a clear trend towards real convergence without this having adversely affected the rigour of the budget policy. Even when measured strictly the Cohesion Fund has clearly played an important socio­economic role in infrastructures with development potential."
"We therefore expect a more refined evaluation by the Commission of the application of the funds."
"We are delighted to note the increase in employment, the absence of fraud, the greatly increased monitoring and the proper implementation of the programmes. However, certain issues must be raised."
"I would draw the Commissioner' s attention to the need for greater coordination of European funds with the objectives of sustainable development within the EU and real balance between the regions. These objectives require the promotion, as already mentioned, of alternative means of transport such as the railways, the sea and cabotage which will reduce congestion on the roads and stimulate the ports."
"These objectives also require the role played by the Cohesion Fund to be integrated into a regional development strategy which aims to establish industries in small and medium-sized towns and in the rural areas which form four-fifths of the EU. They also require integrated support from the Structural and Cohesion Funds for structures allowing technology to be distributed democratically, particularly by following the process decided in Lisbon and promoting investment leading to new businesses and jobs."
"Finally, these objectives also require a civil and social dialogue and the participation of research bodies subordinated to this strategy."
"The principle of cohesion considered in the Treaty must not come under threat during enlargement."
"The Cohesion Fund must be reworked bearing in mind the positive results with the new socio-economic indicators which are expected to ensure that this experience of the cohesion countries is not lost either for current beneficiaries or for future ones."
"I would ask the Commissioner to give his opinion in this respect."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak, as I wanted to say a few words on this report, which is extremely important."
"It concerns a subject which is of great interest to me personally, given the commitment of the European Union in favour of the countries which are furthest behind in development and which are catching up with the support of European solidarity."
"Today, four countries are directly concerned by the objective of cohesion."
"We are talking about a budget of almost EUR 17 billion for the period now beginning, 2000­2006."
"But if we look back over the last ten years, including the year cited in this report, 1998, I would say to the Members here and to all those listening to us that the four countries that were the furthest behind, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, have gained ten points in ten years in relation to the Community average gross domestic product."
"If there is one policy - and fortunately there are others - whose efficacy can be shown, it is the cohesion policy."
"I would like to say this at a time when citizens and taxpayers sometimes wonder about the importance and usefulness or efficacy of the European Funds."
"So the subject dealt with by Mr Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya in his report is an extremely important one."
"I would like to thank him for his clear-sightedness, precision and competence."
"Furthermore, several speakers from all parties have thanked him."
"The form of the report is just as important as its content."
"With regard to content, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the investment allocated to transport, your rapporteur argues for a better balance in favour of sustainable transport, in particular in favour of railways."
"He may be sure that the Commissioner for Regional Policy, who was once Minister for the Environment in his own country, is extremely supportive of this move and will oversee it personally, particularly in the programming of the Cohesion Fund for the next six years."
"I share this concern."
"It has also been highlighted by Mrs Schörling and Mrs Damião, and you may rest assured that I will endeavour to increase the tendency towards sustainable transport, in particular railways, that has been noted over the past few years."
"But this tendency is not enough: I want to emphasise it further over the next six years."
"With regard to the other investments that can contribute to the objective of sustainable transport, I am referring to ports and airports, the Commission - let me be frank - wants to see a certain amount of caution concerning air transport and certain forms of maritime transport."
"In any case, we want to look into matters in detail and modify the rate of cofinancing to take account of the commercial nature of the activities and revenue generated, which is the least we can do."
"Having said this, the tendency in favour of sustainable transport is one that the Commission will support with all its might."
"With regard to the environmental aspect, your rapporteur highlights the need - as Mr Mastorakis also said so emphatically - to pay more attention to the serious problem of the treatment of solid waste and household refuse."
"To date, the Fund has focused on three sectors which are the subject of Community directives: the treatment of drinking water, the treatment of waste water and the treatment of solid waste."
"The priority was to allow the Member States to respect the deadlines set in implementation of the directive on waste water, and we are well aware that the problems that I have just mentioned, in particular the matter of waste or water treatment, are problematic in the countries concerned."
"I have been able to see this personally in the Azores and I know that the situation is the same in the Greek islands, to use these two examples: these problems are particularly difficult in the case of remote, outermost or isolated island regions."
"Also, with regard to the specific problems concerning the environment and thinking of islands in particular, I would like to express my wish to support investment in favour of renewable energy, and I have made this known to the Member States."
"More specifically with regard to solid waste, 14% of the total budget appropriation was earmarked for its processing, which represents a significant increase in relation to the 1993-1997 period."
"However, I share your rapporteur' s wish to use the most modern environmentally-friendly technologies for this purpose."
"Earlier today, Mrs Schörling expressed the satisfaction of the Group of the Greens that an amendment to paragraph 9 proposed by her group had been approved."
"This was not by chance, Mrs Schörling."
"I deliberately wanted to record the Commission' s agreement to using the Cohesion Fund in favour of biodiversity and protecting nature, not just anyhow or for just anything."
"This tendency has been realised in the approval of this amendment."
"You will also see my continuing desire, under Objectives 1 and 2 and the Cohesion Fund, for part of the loans to be used to benefit biodiversity."
"Having talked about content, I would like to say a word or two about form, and first of all reply to the comments of your rapporteur on the study on the socio-economic effects of the Cohesion Fund ordered by the Commission."
"It seems to me that these comments are based on a misunderstanding, which I would like to clarify."
"The five years cited by your rapporteur refer to the period between the commencement of the projects evaluated and the final evaluation."
"The consultants chosen by the Commission first of all developed an evaluation methodology and then evaluated the projects concerned."
"It is not unusual for a large project and the ex-post evaluation of its results to take five years to complete."
"The Commission, which has just received this study, is currently analysing it, and in any case, it will be sent to you as soon as possible."
"I would now like to bring up the issue of consistency between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds as raised by your rapporteur."
"I am particularly interested in this issue."
"This is why the Structural Funds programmes currently being negotiated by the Commission with the Member States of cohesion include indicative sums for both Cohesion Fund aid and European Investment Bank aid."
"The information requested by Parliament is available in the individual programming documents."
"In addition, I would like to emphasise that the recent restructuring of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy brings together the geographical teams and power within the same units for Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, so that Cohesion Countries, which are eligible for Structural Funds in most cases, will have the same contacts within this Directorate-General."
"This seems to me to be a more consistent approach for these countries."
"But consistency between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund also means observing the specificity of these two instruments, in accordance, moreover, with the general regulation on the Structural Funds."
"It would in fact be inappropriate to use the Cohesion Fund for the same purposes and in the same way as the Structural Funds."
"From the point of view of financial management, it is not the right time to abandon the specificity of each instrument."
"In any case, I am not in a position to alter the scope of the Cohesion Fund, which stems directly from the Treaty."
"Mrs Schörling, you spoke of the matter of additionality."
"Allow me, so as not to waste your time, to refer back to what I said earlier on the subject of Mr Turco' s report."
"I clearly expressed my wish to verify additionality and what is true for Mr Turco' s report is also true for the Cohesion Fund."
"I even said that the reality of this additionality would be one of the points which would enable me to validate or approve programmes and projects."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the annual report is a particularly useful tool for the analysis, assessment and reflection that regularly takes place on the implementation of regional policy."
"This report is even more useful in that it is comprehensive."
"As I agree that there are advantages in releasing the annual report as soon as possible, I can assure you that my staff will do their best to speed up publication as much as possible in future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that our reflection is not only linked to these annual reports."
"I can also assure you that beyond our regular meetings, the report on cohesion that I shall present to you at the end of this year will respond to a lot of the questions, criticisms and proposals raised by your rapporteur with regard to the pursuit of solidarity regarding countries benefiting from the Cohesion Fund, particularly in view of the perspective that concerns us all: enlargement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Integrated control system for Community aid schemes"
"The next item is the report by Mr Casaca (A5-0137/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Council regulation on amending Regulation (EEC) 3508/1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes [(COM(1999) 517 - C5-0317/1999 - 1999/0207 (CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal before us represents a revolution in control systems and provides the technical bases for a revolution in the method of managing the common agricultural policy."
"The proposed method is based on a modern geographic information system in which the cartographic information on holdings is digitised and integrated with the alphanumeric information needed to describe the holding and the aid received."
"In terms of control, this method has enormous advantages and significantly reduces the possibility of fraud or any other irregularities."
"In terms of managing the CAP, this will finally create a management infrastructure with the technical basis to transform a policy which until now has irrationally subsidised the richest countries, regions and farmers and encouraged surpluses and environmental damage. The new system is geographically oriented, it will encourage sustainable agriculture and it will assist the regions and rural communities which are most in need."
"This shows that there is the political will and discernment needed from the European institutions to put a new policy into practice."
"In my opinion, the integration into the system of virtually all the sectors financed by the CAP should be sought."
"The recent Court of Auditors report on classical swine fever shows that, even in areas where the geographic information initially seems less important, this is actually decisive and may form a fundamental instrument in rationalising the common agricultural policy."
"It seems to me that there is therefore every advantage in immediately integrating into the system three sectors which are not included in the Commission proposal."
"These are oil, flax and hemp and tobacco. For the first, this involves integrating the existing specific geographic information system into the general system."
"For the second, we know that the Commission has already proposed the integration of this sector into arable crops but we do not know when and if the Commission proposal will be approved."
"As for the third, its integration is the most necessary and urgent. The fact that tobacco is not at the moment subsidised per hectare but by quantity produced in no way affects the possibility of this being immediately integrated into the system and even less so the advantages which this offers."
"The application of a geographic control system will ensure that subsidised tobacco is actually produced on the holdings for which the aid is claimed."
"Furthermore, it would be absurd for the extensive information which the Commission requires from each holding in order to clear the accounts not to be integrated into the new system."
"In this respect, the Commission should reduce its requirements to what is necessary and reasonable."
"It must realise firstly that the CAP is placing an increasing and hidden administrative burden on national and regional authorities."
"Secondly, farmers should not be required to spend more time filling in forms than milking cows or tilling the earth."
"We do not want to turn farmers into bureaucrats."
"Although it is necessary to fight fraud, we must also prevent the complexity of the system causing a multiplication of minor formal irregularities and farmers being unfairly penalised."
"The simplification of the legislation applying the CAP is an absolute priority."
"Finally, our expectations of the Commission are as follows."
"It is incomprehensible that a project of this size and scope should not culminate in the processing at European level of all the information gathered."
"It is unthinkable that a common policy such as the CAP should be handled like a collection of fifteen national policies or, even worse, like a pile of unconnected invoices from 80 or 90 national payment authorities."
"The Commission must process all the geographic information now required from the fifteen Member States in a coordinated manner."
"However, it is also vital that this precious resource is used to further the policy of economic and social cohesion, environmental protection and even regional development."
"Mr President, as well as congratulating Mr Casaca on his excellent work, I must thank him for his support for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture."
"This opinion has tried to correct the Commission' s approach, which ignores most of the essential elements, not only for control, but also for administration."
"This source of information is found in the administrative information resulting from the payments of the EAGGF."
"Regulation (EC) No 2390/1999 demands that the Member States provide the Commission with the data on the payments of the EAGGF-Guarantee."
"Nevertheless, it only demands that that information is communicated to them on request and exclusively for the preparation of verifications in situ in the process of the settlement of accounts."
"This situation creates various control limits."
"Effective administration must be able to provide the institutions responsible with the elements for analysis and decision and amongst these elements is the cost-efficiency index."
"This approach must be applied systematically and must be based on the analysis of the payments corresponding to each regulation."
"The fact that this information can only be requested for the preparation of verifications in situ in the process of the settlement of accounts sets a time limit on the availability of the fundamental information for administration and control."
"Once the process of the settlement of accounts is over, it is no longer possible to make any analysis of administration or control activities."
"However, as well as these verifications relating to the settlement of accounts, effective control requires other instruments such as, for example, the cross-checking of the different information available."
"In order to reduce these deficiencies, it has been proposed to use the information available within the framework of the above-mentioned Regulation (EC) No 2390/1999 in the integrated administration system, which Mr Casaca spoke about earlier in this magnificent report."
"Therefore, in the first stage of the establishment of this integrated administration and control system, it would be sufficient to regulate the conditions for delivering the information mentioned and the need for the Commission to store it."
"Mr President, we welcome this proposal by the Commission to improve the system of control and I should like to thank Mr Casaca for his report."
"This is a very technical subject and indeed to comprehend it one needs an understanding of almost all the details of the entire common agricultural policy."
"Mr Casaca has made a very good effort to explain it to Parliament."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for its continuing efforts to tidy up the whole business of accounting in the area of agriculture."
"It is extremely important."
"We have recently been talking about regional funds and cohesion funds but the common agricultural policy is extremely important."
"It is the greatest instrument we have for cohesion since it is the only rural policy which the Community has and it brings immense benefits to peripheral areas and to people who are in businesses that are not otherwise viable."
"The policy was given a bad name in the past when most of the funds were channelled to the agricultural industry through the processors and exporters."
"We had the possibility for large amounts of fraud and racketeering through the payment of monetary compensatory amounts."
"With the reorganisation of the policy we have a new situation."
"It is fair to point out that the most recent report by the Court of Auditors for the year 1998 has not drawn attention to any single major failure of the Commission in this entire area."
"There have been problems but they were isolated, small offences, relating to areas of aid and also to premiums and the failure of national governments to understand the details of European law."
"But we have to recognise that for the most part the Commission was given a clean bill of health for 1998 which is the most recent report we have and it is to be congratulated on that. Considering that this is something like 48% of the entire budget - EUR 38 or 39 billion - it is quite an achievement, spent over fifteen countries, that the budget was within two and a half per cent of estimate and that waste and the possibility for loss were lower than the average for the budget."
"The changes to the whole system have made it easier to control."
"The fact that more money is now going directly to farmers makes it easier to understand exactly what is happening."
"The proposed changes will readjust our system of accounting to the new policies that have been devised."
"It is reasonable to expect Member States to produce the sort of detail that is necessary for the European Commission both from the management point of view as well as that of accounting, to have exact details of where and to whom the money is going, down to the last recipient."
"This is welcome."
"In relation to the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca, we can support all of them."
"We have received complaints from some people about the proposal to introduce tobacco."
"Maybe, as things stand at the moment, because the money goes to processors there is some point in saying that it should not be extended."
"But we spend EUR 1 000 million on the tobacco regime."
"There are about 135 000 farmers, about 135 000 hectares."
"That means approximately EUR 7 600 per hectare, approximately EUR 7 600 per farmer."
"That is a lot of money."
"It is only reasonable that we should seek to establish that this money goes to the farmers and applies to the hectares, as Mr Casaca has suggested."
"My group is asking for a divided vote to enable those who do not like the tobacco regime to vote against it but, on the other hand, our amendment is a message to the Commission that we really think this should be clarified so that the money will go exactly where it is supposed to: to rural areas and to farmers."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Casaca on his excellent report."
"My group will of course support it."
"The integrated administration and control system is actually the central plank of our present agriculture policy."
"We need reliable information on final beneficiaries, the number of animals kept and the surface area being cultivated."
"This is a difficult task which is only possible at all by virtue of technological progress."
"Mr Casaca' s report covers this to a considerable extent."
"Welcome as this is, we should nevertheless not lose sight of the fact that this will involve changeover problems."
"We learnt that when the present system was introduced under the 1992 regulation."
"Today, eight years later, two Member States have not yet implemented the system at all or only in part."
"We cannot allow delays of this kind to occur again."
"This subject was addressed at the time of the 1998 final discharge."
"The Commission informed us that the advance payments for these two countries, Greece and Portugal, had been reduced."
"That alone is not enough."
"In such cases there must be tangible sanctions that really bite, linked to the process of clearing the accounts."
"In connection with the final discharge, the Commission also presented the 1998 monitoring statistics to us."
"I do not want to burden you with figures here, but I will perhaps give you a short extract."
"In 1998 in the 15 Community Member States there were more than 3 million applications for ""area"" aid."
"Of these, some 12% were checked, partly on the spot and partly by satellite."
"Of those applications checked, over 40% were inaccurate."
"We should not of course immediately assume that deception was intended in every case."
"In some cases, there were technical oversights, in others misunderstandings about interpreting the rules, and so on."
"Nevertheless, these amounts add up to millions of course."
"These figures therefore demonstrate just how urgently a properly functioning control system is required."
"As the European Parliament rapporteur responsible for anti-fraud measures, I would like to bring a serious problem in this area to your attention."
"All the Member States report any irregularities to the Commission, but only a few Member States tell the Commission which of these cases are classified as fraudulent."
"For example, according to the statistics, in the United Kingdom there were 4 995 cases of over-declaration, 971 cases of duplicate applications and 52 cases of ""false"" applications."
"But not one of these cases was classified in the statistics as being fraudulent or as giving rise to suspicions of ""serious negligence"" ."
"Finland, Austria, Portugal and Sweden do not report any such cases either."
"So is there a kind of fraud-free zone in the EU?"
"I very much doubt it."
"The problem we have here also occurs in other budget areas."
"The administrative controls more or less work, but we do not have a reliable overview of criminal aspects."
"This problem needs to be solved as a matter of urgency if we really want effective deterrence in order to combat fraud."
"The ideal way of achieving this is to set up a European public prosecutor' s office for financial matters, which this House has repeatedly called for."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, expenditure within the framework of the EAGGF, Guarantee section, forms the largest entry in the whole of EU expenditure, and this year amounts to over EUR 41 billion."
"The far-reaching management and control measures which the Commission proposes are therefore very appropriate indeed."
"It is a matter of great urgency that such a large part of the EU' s expenditure should be used correctly and efficiently."
"I do, however, wonder whether the proposed measures are the most effective."
"In this respect, I would refer to the useful input from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this report."
"The Committee claims that, when data is collected, the existing databases are ignored, would you believe!"
"This is how useful information for managing Community aid falls by the wayside."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is right in saying that the Commission is acting in an absurd manner."
"Data on payments or revenue in respect of the EAGGF, Guarantee section, can only be used at the request of the Commission for closing accounts."
"But surely this is no reason to ignore this information."
"The existence of this wealth of information should have been a reason for the European Commission to adapt Regulation 2390/99."
"We at the European Parliament can still rectify this mistake made by the Commission by including an amendment to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development' s recommendation, which unlocks this source of information for the management of Community aid."
"If the regulation has been amended to this effect, we will back it without hesitation."
"Mr President, I would also like to support the report presented by Mr Casaca on the European Commission proposal on the Integrated administration and control system for Community aid schemes, which was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In my opinion, the reservations expressed by the Executive, particularly the Commission' s position on Article 1 of the proposal, are unfounded."
"The products which the rapporteur intends to add to the list all fall within sectors of considerable financial consequence whose control mechanisms have proved to be insufficient."
"In fact, these products have all been subject to fraud and irregularity in the past."
"Moreover, the extension of this system to a greater number of products would facilitate sound, effective management, which would lead to simpler procedures for both the Executive and farmers."
"It is, in effect, necessary to harmonise the excessive number of different regulations which are currently in force, for the purposes of containing costs as well."
"On the basis of the above considerations, I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to incorporate the position of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Casaca, and the Committees on Budgetary Control and on Agriculture and Rural Development for their proposals in the form of amendments and above all for the constructive debate on this proposal."
"I am particularly grateful for their support for the basic principles underlying the Commission proposal, on which we are in agreement."
"Although I cannot agree to all the amendments tabled by the committees, I would like to make it clear that the Commission supports the committees' basic view that the integrated administration and control system needs to be further strengthened."
"With regard to Amendment No 1, the Commission' s main motivation in presenting this proposal was firstly to adjust the integrated control system to the new legislative situation arising from Agenda 2000, secondly, to introduce the geographic information systems designed to improve the identification of agricultural areas and, thirdly, to stipulate compatibility between IACS and administration and control systems for other Community aid systems."
"Also on amendments, I would like to make the following point: in the case of Amendment No 1, I agree with the criticism raised earlier in the debate that not all Member States have yet made sufficient progress in establishing IACS."
"However, it was not because of the transposal situation that the Commission presented its proposal for an amended regulation, but rather to introduce the new geographic information systems available."
"As has also been explained, we have already taken advantage of the charging procedure, by setting a charge for those Member States lagging behind in that context also."
"Amendment No 2 suggests that various other aid systems should be brought under IACS, with those for olive oil, tobacco, flax and hemp being mentioned in particular."
"There is one particular point that must be borne in mind here: these schemes are not exclusively ""area"" aid schemes, so they cannot be wholly brought under IACS."
"However, IACS will, of course, be applied as far as possible in these cases."
"In particular, if flax and hemp are now to be integrated into the arable support system, IACS will then be fully applied."
"But IACS or the geographic information system will also be used for determining areas and for drawing up the olive sector register."
"With regard to Amendment No 3, the Commission is opposed to automatic exemption from the requirement to submit an area aid application for applying aid under a scheme not directly linked to agricultural areaThe Commission has in any case already granted an exemption of this kind for special cases, and it should retain the option of first being able to check whether such an exemption is sensible."
"The Commission is in full agreement with Amendment No 4 to the extent that it refers to Article 10, which is to be deleted."
"However, it is not possible totally to delete the provision affected in the way proposed."
"The Commission must also retain the right to carry out checks in relation to IACS."
"I shall now turn to the other points raised in the debate."
"It has been proposed that payments should be centralised and that all data should be centralised. We believe that the effect of this would be exactly the opposite of what we wish to achieve."
"What we are looking for here is subsidiarity."
"We cannot carry out all the checks from Brussels."
"We know that there are millions of applications, and that means that it is only possible to check and control applications for compliance with the rules through decentralisation."
"If we need information, we can in any case always access case-by-case details via national IACS operations and through national payment agencies."
"There is no problem there."
"But for the same reason, it would not only be organisationally counterproductive in terms of modern management but also highly costly to automatically send all data to Brussels and store it centrally there."
"Mr Bösch pointed out that of all applications checked with regard to area, 40% were inaccurate."
"However, we need to clarify what we mean by inaccurate applications, and above all just what the defects are."
"For example, if you look at the European Court of Auditors' Statement of Assurance and in particular at the representative spot checks carried out by the Court of Auditors for 1998, the following facts emerged with regard to the support system for producers of arable crops: out of the entire random sample taken, a total of 16 substantial errors were found in relation to area."
"The deviations in these 16 incorrect applications were in ten cases between 0% and 3%, in four cases between 3% and 5% and for only two applications in the entire random sample for the whole Community was the deviation over 5%."
"The other point that Mr Bösch raised, and which I also consider to be important, is the question of possible criminal aspects."
"The issue here is to what extent actual incidences of fraud are not subject of adequate prosecutions."
"You all know that under present legislation and also in accordance with the current contractual arrangements, all matters relating to criminal law are the responsibility of the Member States."
"If cases of fraud or suspected fraud should actually arise in this area, then the national public prosecutor' s office should automatically be involved."
"The extent to which it would make sense to set up some kind of European public prosecutor' s office for financial matters or to introduce some kind of European financial prosecution procedure is an issue which ultimately has to be discussed in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it would imply a treaty amendment."
"Just one brief observation, Commissioner."
"Your institution is calling for a public prosecutor' s office for financial matters in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I hope that there will be no further need for negotiations and clarification within the Commission."
"We will be glad to support you on this."
"I would like to make it clear that I did not say that we require anything to be clarified."
"I simply said that any decision would have to be taken in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Nuts and locust beans"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission (B5-0491/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on support measures for nuts and locust beans."
"Mr President, in the absence of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and on his request, I will speak on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture."
"The majority of nut production in the European Union takes place in arid areas and on steep slopes in drought conditions."
"These crops offer protection against erosion and desertification and play the role of firebreaks."
"They are of fundamental importance as a source of supplementary income, which is essential to the maintenance of a large number of rural operations in the least-favoured areas."
"Furthermore, this production is the basis of a significant primary and secondary processing industry, the key to economic diversification in rural areas which suffer very difficult conditions."
"The Community' s level of self-sufficiency in this area is between 50 and 60%."
"Community production must endure competition from third country producers whose costs are much lower and who are subject to greatly reduced tariff protection."
"For example, in the case of hazelnuts, the costs of production in the European Union are three times greater than those in Turkey as a result of the differences in labour costs."
"In the case of almonds, the cost difference is a result of the fact that in the European Union they are produced in very difficult climate and soil conditions."
"Tariff protection is very low and is being progressively dismantled following the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and other preferential agreements."
"The Commission clearly cannot ignore the fact that, when it holds commercial negotiations, its concessions have effects which sometimes turn out to be negative."
"For this reason, it must become customary to assess the consequences and automatically establish measures to lessen the negative effects of commercial concessions granted by the Commission."
"Despite the fact that the measures laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 789/89 have had positive results, they have not managed to balance the cost of production with prices on a market dominated by the enormous pressure of imports at low prices."
"The problem is that the support which this production has relied on is coming to an end, while the severe production conditions have not changed, and the competition from third country production has become tougher."
"In fact, the tariffs applicable to almonds, for example, are going to be reduced further next month from 4.1 to 3.5% and there is a quota of 90 000 tonnes at 2%."
"Furthermore, American exports to certain third countries enjoy preferential agreements which the European Union does not have."
"In fact, over the last ten years the price has remained the same."
"The tariff for hazelnuts stands at 3.3%."
"Nevertheless, a lower rate of 3% is applied for products from Turkey."
"The pressure of imports is such that there is less and less difference in prices between the select varieties and the common varieties, which has a devastating effect."
"The difficult growing conditions in the European Union prevent competition with third countries and it is not possible to improve competitivity unless we abandon the current production areas and move production to other regions."
"This would cause serious environmental damage, serious risks of depopulation and serious problems in terms of land management."
"For these reasons, Commissioner, the Committee on Agriculture presented the oral question which has led to this debate."
"The diagnosis of the problems involved in the needs of Community nut production is well known. This is demonstrated by the fact that all the political groups in this House have agreed on the presentation of a resolution."
"The pressure of imports and the difficult climate and soil conditions demand, therefore, support for Community nut production."
"The Committee on Agriculture, in the resolutions presented unanimously by the political groups, is responding to the conclusions of the recent appearance of the nut sector before the Committee on Agriculture and, to a certain extent, takes up the requests of the sector, which, as the Commissioner knows, is enormously worried and concerned."
"These concerns, demands and requests of the Committee on Agriculture and the political groups in Parliament are aimed at seeking a solution which involves the granting of direct aid to the income of producers which, by maintaining that cultivation, will lead to the prevention of environmental damage and depopulation and maintain certain primary and secondary processing industries in the least-favoured areas."
"However, on the other hand - and this is the aspect which has led to the anguish and concern in the sector today - given that the measures aimed at this sector are coming to an end, it is essential that they be extended until a new support system has been put in place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Jové Peres, may I remind you that the Commission itself discovered many years ago that growing nuts in the European Union involves certain difficulties!"
"Part of the reason for this, and you are right in saying this, is undoubtedly the keen international competition which exists, but the main reason is that there are various structural deficiencies in the main nut-growing areas."
"We unfortunately discovered that these structural deficiencies above all result in low productivity and high production costs."
"In view of these difficulties, a support system was introduced back in 1989."
"But even at that time it was limited to 10 years, and its objective was to improve the nut quality and marketing."
"This system involved a significant financial commitment."
"Between 1990 and 1999, this system led to expenditure totalling EUR 725 million."
"And as the contractual obligations are still in force, and run up to 2006, this year and in the coming years a further EUR 250 million will be paid out."
"In addition, a separate flat-rate aid for hazelnuts was introduced in 1997."
"However, as I have already said, it has been clear from the outset, as everyone affected knows, that there is a time limit on the measures to promote sales and that the objective is to facilitate the adjustments necessary to increase competitiveness."
"In view of the fact that the programmes will in part be continuing up to 2006, no further measures are planned under this budget heading."
"However, I would like to point out that a different form of support for nuts that did not exist previously has now become available."
"Above all, the general aid scheme for fruit and vegetable growers under the ""operational fund"" also provides for measures of this kind, and of course additional, non-market-specific measures are also possible under the rural development programmes which had to be submitted this year."
"However, none of the programmes submitted to us by the Member States, including those Member States with substantial agricultural areas, contains any proposals for measures of this kind, so that no such need was evidently identified when drawing up the programmes."
"That is the present situation, and that also sets out what the Commission is in a position to do in this field so as to counter negative trends."
"But the Commission should not be attacked if it was agreed beforehand that rural development was to be the responsibility of Member States and included in their programmes, and if at all possible at regional level within the Member States."
"So that is where priorities for supporting rural development need to be set."
"Mr President, I must thank the Commissioner for being present in this almost deserted chamber on a Thursday evening."
"This House will end up as barren as the programme which you are presenting us with for nuts."
"I would also like to thank all of you who are here to debate the future of nuts in the European Union."
"I had my speech prepared, but having heard the reply which the Commissioner has just given us and the words of Mr Jové in his presentation, I believe that I am going to forget my notes and try to improvise in reply to the Commissioner' s response."
"The Commissioner is aware of the problems of nuts in the European Union and he is aware that we are dependent on a single supplier in many cases: the United States, on the one hand, in the case of almonds, and Turkey, in the case of hazelnuts."
"The Commissioner is also aware of the benefits - as Mr Jové has stressed - for the arid areas where all these crops are cultivated, and this cultivation is not improvised from year to year, since it takes a long time to grow an almond tree or a walnut tree."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I believe that we are facing a very extensive problem."
"When you tell us that there are structural problems of low productivity and high production costs in the European Union, we must ask ourselves whether we want a nut sector or whether we want to be totally dependent on outside sources?"
"We only provide 50% of the supply, for the rest we depend on other countries."
"At this rate, we will end up with nothing."
"You tell us that there have had to be negotiations and that there is already aid from the COM in fruit and also within the framework of the rural development projects."
"Therefore, I would like to say that, in the COM in fruits, the operational funds are intended for those crops - for those fruits - for which there is large-scale production."
"In those cases, the operational funds - which are a very small percentage of this global production per hectare, some 1.5 or 2% - are a reasonable amount to work with."
"In the case of production per hectare which amounts to little more than ESP 100 000, I believe that the operational funds of the COM in fruits have very little significance and offer very little in terms of resolving the problem of nuts."
"With regard to the framework of the rural development projects, the Commissioner knows much better than I do that, in rural development, the second pillar of the CAP - which we all view with great hope and we congratulate him for having brought it up and united it in one budgetary line -, in the regions where these fruits are grown - which are basically Objective 1 regions in some cases, and Objective 2 regions in others-, the programmes developed there are LEADER programmes."
"In these LEADER programmes, and PRODER programmes in the case of Spain, where there are national programmes, which are organised from the bottom up, it will be difficult to consider a specific cultivation as being of strategic interest and as a strategic sector, when these programmes normally deal with problems of general interest."
"However, Commissioner, what we are proposing to you, and I believe that all the political groups are in agreement on this, is the partial continuation, not continuation sine die, but continuation until a certain date, Commissioner, of improvement funds and plans, because in some cases they have still not ended, and in other cases their objectives have still not been fulfilled."
"However, these funds are absolutely essential to the maintenance of the crop, as long as nuts are subject to differentiated treatment within the coming reform of the COM in fruits and vegetables."
"Commissioner, I believe that we are talking about a sum of money which is not especially large and which can be covered within the miserly budgets which, according to what your department tells us, are available for allocation."
"Therefore, Commissioner, the extension of these improvement plans, as long as they are organised, used, and allocated according to a differentiated treatment in the coming reform of fruits, which will happen shortly, I believe that this will resolve and calm the fears which Mr Jové has expressed, which are shared by all the nut producers in the European Union, as they communicated to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, where they received our political support."
"Since these producers have the political support of this House, I believe that it would not be justifiable to deny them a few pesetas of economic support."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I wish to reject the words of Mr Fischler - and his proposals - and I wish to support the motion for a resolution presented by various parliamentary groups, which has the practically unanimous support of this House."
"Mr Fischler, the European Commission must not continue to ignore the requests of the sectors affected."
"You cannot continue to insist that you alone are right and that we are all mistaken."
"You cannot ignore the fact that, if we do not adopt support measures for nuts and locust beans, many crops will eventually be abandoned."
"There will be irreparable consequences for many areas of the Union, from both socio-economic and environmental points of view."
"It must be said that both specific measures for nuts and locust beans, as well as the lump sum aid for hazelnuts, were in fact transitional measures aimed at the conversion of the crops, but there is no reason why they cannot be extended."
"Commissioner, a conversion in the agricultural sector cannot be treated as if it were a conversion in the industrial sector."
"In industry, one can modernise plants and improve productivity, but in the case of certain crops, however much investment is made, however many changes are made in terms of marketing, we cannot alter the fact that certain areas are arid or semi-arid."
"We cannot imagine that this problem can be resolved through the scant funds available in the rural development programmes."
"That is not the place to find a solution for these areas, as the Commissioner and the whole of the Commission seems to think."
"Furthermore, it does not appear that an extension of this aid until the adoption of the measures proposed in the resolution, nor even until the definitive measures themselves are adopted, will cause problems within the conversations in the World Trade Organisation."
"The sector produces a surplus and Community protection is minimal."
"If the quantities requested are not great, if there are no further problems, if this is the only way to maintain standards of living in certain areas, Commissioner, this aid must be retained."
"Mr President, having heard the interventions of Mr Jové and Mr Fischler, I believe I should change the form of my intervention and go straight to what I believe is the crux of the matter."
"The Commission' s main argument is that which was agreed ten years ago."
"That is to say, ten years ago there were certain conditions, we established a programme and it has come to an end."
"I believe that it is precisely the change in conditions compared to ten years ago which weakens the Commission' s position, and it is therefore important for them to be sensitive to an agreement which originates from the action of certain MEPs from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament at the moment."
"In my opinion, there have been three changes."
"Firstly, the competition conditions have changed. They are not the same as ten years ago."
"Secondly, according to the assessment of the agricultural sector, and this one in particular, it should be pointed out that there is much greater sensitivity towards environmental responsibility than there was ten years ago."
"It is an economic sector, I agree, but it has much greater environmental responsibility than it did ten years ago."
"Thirdly, if this aid is removed today, the loss of the land recovered over these ten years would be irreversible."
"I therefore sincerely believe that there is no margin, either within the framework of rural development or in other areas, because we are not talking about vegetables, we are not talking about any other type of product, we are talking about a very specific product, with very specific circumstances, which were analysed ten years ago and which must be analysed today once again."
"For this reason, I believe that it makes absolute sense to carry out a study of a new framework of aid and, in any event, there should be an extension with immediate effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, there are not many of us, just the little Mediterranean family, trying to defend the crops that Brussels does not like."
"We have had the honey problem - Mr Fischler, you refused a few handfuls of euros for hive subsidies - the olive oil problem, and now it is the turn of walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts."
"Brussels does not want to be involved."
"We are told: there was the 1989 regulation, but it was provisional."
"The fixed aid for hazelnuts in 1996 was temporary."
"These measures have run their course and must come to an end."
"But to put an end to Community funding is to spoil what has been achieved."
"In the name of the principle of continuity, coherence and protecting the financial interests of the European Union, the aid that has already been committed must not be ended, especially since another aberration may be added to this one, the fact that we are in deficit."
"We are importing."
"And if that is making profits for Turkey, then fair enough, but making profits for California!"
"You tell us that it is expensive, but you are not telling the whole truth. It costs EUR 250 million, but that is for years to come."
"You are avoiding giving the annual figure, which would represent 0.0 something percent, a tiny fraction of the European budget."
"In other words, Commissioner, action must be taken, first in the name of quality, in the name of seasonal employment, but also in the name of common sense, rurality, the environment, beauty."
"I do not know whether you have seen an almond tree in February, well it is truly a thing of beauty!"
"And as we have told you, we are dealing with regions in Spain, in my native Languedoc-Roussillon, in Greece, where the land is arid."
"We must prevent a rural exodus."
"As a minimum, since extending the COM for fruit and vegetables is not a solution, we must set aside a few euros from the European budget to finance this activity."
"But on top of that, Commissioner - you and I were both in Seattle - there is the problem of Community preference."
"Our honey over Chinese, Canadian or Mexican honey."
"Our olives instead of North African olives and our Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Languedoc-Roussillon and French Mediterranean before Anatolia and California, Commissioner."
"Not for a fistful of dollars, but for a fistful of euros."
"Commissioner, in your speech you told us how you viewed the situation, but I can assure you that the industry does not see it in the same way."
"It is true that aid was adopted in the past to tackle great difficulties facing the industry, but the problem is that today, ten years later and through no fault of the producers, the circumstances that led to the approval of that aid have not changed."
"As has been pointed out, our tariffs continue to be very low, European products are still unable to compete with those originating above all from Turkey and the United States, as a result of social and labour costs or because the crops, in the case of the United States, are in irrigable areas and are mechanisable while those in the European Union are in drought areas which are not easily accessible, where there is little chance of mechanisation, and it is therefore true that they are less competitive."
"However, this does not make the production in the European Union any less important."
"Furthermore, despite the importance of this production, we still have a deficit, and the disappearance of this crop - which may occur if the aid to the industry is not continued - would put the consumer in the hands of Turkey and the United States, who would set our prices from their position as a true monopoly."
"We should also remember, Commissioner, that there is practically no alternative to the cultivation of nuts because of the places in which they are produced."
"For all these reasons, it is not surprising that there is enormous concern in the sector at the possibility that aid may be withdrawn, since without it - and we must recognise this -, given that the future of these operations, as a result of the competition from third countries, is in jeopardy and the investment made in the modernisation of the production systems - which has taken place on a significant scale - will have been pointless."
"I would therefore also like to ask you, Commissioner, on behalf of the producers in the sector and especially on behalf of the producers in Catalonia, for the specific aid to this sector to be continued in the way that has been pointed out here and along the lines of the motion for a resolution which I hope will receive the support of this House."
"This aid only represents 0.18% of the total budget of the EAGGF-Guarantee and 0.16% of the total agricultural budget, for which, furthermore, it has been pointed out that there is a sufficient financial margin."
"Any other type of aid such as those you have mentioned, above all rural development aid, may be positive in other sectors, it is true, but in this case, given the specific nature of the sector, they are totally insufficient to guarantee the competitiveness, and therefore the survival, of these operations, whose interests the Commission - you, Commissioner - can in no way ignore."
"Mr President, here again, I would simply like to draw attention to the fact that, in this crop that I know so well, the return on investment is long term."
"Moreover, the producers have worked towards obtaining certification on irrigation, selecting plants, precisely organising the crops, and this work would be completely ruined if the aid that had been given up until now was not maintained at least long enough for the return on investment to take place."
"For walnut trees, for example, the return on investment is around 18 years, and consequently, I believe that economic and financial logic and coherence, and also political coherence, require that for these crops, the Commission should show continuity, logic and common sense."
"Mr President, I would just like to respond, very briefly, to the most important arguments raised."
"First of all I would like to make it as clear as possible that the Commission is definitely against production aids."
"Even the aids that we had in the past were intended to support improvements in structure and quality - they were not intended to be permanent production aids."
"In addition, I have to say that any such purely production-related aid would violate all the WTO rules."
"It has been argued that we are talking about a long-term investment here."
"That is quite right."
"But every farmer who has made an investment in this area signed a contract at the outset before he made that investment, so that he knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving investment aid."
"So it is not as if the Commission can now be accused of some kind of cynicism because it is withdrawing support in a way that the farmers affected were not expecting."
"Every farmer knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving support."
"We need to be very clear about that here."
"I have explained that there are new options."
"If a case is being made that this type of farming is absolutely essential for maintaining the landscape and preserving the environment, particularly in these dry areas, then this is an ideal case for environmental measures."
"It was precisely for this purpose that, amongst other things, we topped up the funding for environmental measures in the context of agricultural development."
"You cannot be right on both counts."
"You cannot argue that this is an important form of agriculture if it is obviously not important enough for the regional authorities to give it priority and grant support for it."
"You cannot have it both ways!"
"It has been said that this is all too little and that more money is needed, and it has been argued that this is only nought point something of the total agricultural budget."
"I am sorry, but the proportion of the budget the Commissioner can spend as he likes is 0.0%, so that if you want aid, you must at least play fair and say who you want to take the money away from!"
"Because the room for manoeuvre is precisely zero, there is no leeway in the budget as has been suggested in this Chamber!"
"In accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received two motions for resolutions to end the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I understand that the first point of order ever raised in the directly-elected Parliament in 1979 was by the Reverend Doctor Ian Paisley and his point was that the British flag was flying upside-down."
"Twenty-one years later I have to tell you that yesterday evening in the forecourt in front of the Tower building, where the motorcyclists were collecting, there were sixteen flags flying."
"Fifteen of them were the right way up but the Union flag was upside-down."
"To fly the Union flag upside-down is an internationally recognised distress signal and to fly it upside-down when it is not a distress signal is a gross affront to the flag, the British people and the British nation."
"I have corresponded with the President of our Parliament on this issue and she has written to me assuring me that this matter would be corrected and that the British flag would be flown the right way up."
"Can I now call upon you first of all to ensure that the flag is immediately placed the right way up and also to take measures to ensure that in future it is always displayed correctly."
"I can assure you, Mr Helmer, that everything will be done to ensure that the prestige of your flag is restored."
"Mr President, I have news for Mr Helmer, which should encourage him."
"He should be grateful that we see our Union flag up at all."
"I am advised that it is the most popular flag to be stolen in this place."
"Mr President, last year, the majority of MEPs in this House voted in favour of Friday morning sittings."
"Recently, however, a certain number of MEPs have, here in Strasbourg, attempted to prevent other MEPs from working during these sittings: I denounce this very undemocratic attitude, especially as those who did not want others to work were still receiving their per diem."
"I should also like to say this. We have recently taken a further decision and, from next year, there will no longer be a sitting on Friday mornings."
"I have received an e-mail from a Dutch MEP, however, saying the following, in English, and I quote,"
"""If these amendments"" , that is to say, for there not to be a sitting on a Friday, ""are adopted and under the existing rules Members who cannot travel back to their home country on Thursday evening will still be able to sign the attendance register on Friday"" ."
"(FR) Mr President, I think it is scandalous that MEPs are encouraged to stay here on Friday mornings anyway, in order to sign the register and to accept payment without doing any work, and I hope Parliament will have the courage to alter the existing rules."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Goebbels, I would ask you not to reopen the debate and to go easy on me, since I am myself an endangered species in my capacity as President of the Friday morning session in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I should like to return once again to the fax, which Mr Van Hulten made available to all of us before the vote, and which concerns the issue of whether sittings should continue to be held on Fridays."
"This is not just about participating in plenary sittings; there are other tasks which need to be dealt with in this regard as well."
"We will now have to deal with these matters at home."
"There are, however, no attendance allowances for working at home."
"But since we have been promised these allowances in Mr Van Hulten' s letter, in the coming year I will be claiming the lost allowances from him."
"I call on all colleagues to do likewise."
"Mr Van Hulten had better start saving up now!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, in its wisdom, the House has made a decision on Friday sittings."
"I should like to suggest that those responsible ensure that, even if no sittings are held on a Friday, official cars are still made available, because there will be many Members who will, in any case, wish to make full use of the Thursday here and who will need to have some way of reaching the airport or the railway station on the Friday."
"We will certainly note your suggestion."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, with your permission, I should like to draw your attention to an inconsistency between the Minutes and the lists of roll-call votes."
"Yesterday, we voted on the resolution on the Feira Summit and many colleagues will recall that - to laughter from many in this House - the Austrian Members of Haider' s party voted in favour of two amendments which were very critical of Austria and then, some time later, took the floor and said that they had made a mistake and wanted their votes to be registered as votes against."
"This correction - that is, that they voted against - is accurately reflected in the Minutes but, obviously in part thanks to their party headquarters' intervening, the names of these Members do not appear anywhere in the record of the roll-call vote taken on Amendment No 4."
"I would therefore request that the lists of roll-call votes be corrected so that they correspond to the events which we all witnessed here."
"The Minutes are correct in this respect."
"It would also be desirable to clarify how many corrections to the corrections we Members are entitled to submit."
"I take note of your comment, Mrs Berger."
"Mr President, during the debate on common security and defence policy there was a roll call vote on Amendment No 36."
"However, yesterday's Minutes refers to the wrong paragraph and thus the vote does not reflect what actually took place in this Chamber."
"I have not had a chance to look in detail at this voting list, but that is one mistake I have spotted already."
"I should like to draw that to your attention."
"Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
"We shall verify this and rectify it, if necessary."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Vote"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal) - Proposal for a Council Directive amending Council Directive 1103/97EC on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (COM(2000) 346 - C5-0292/2000 - 2000/0134(CNS)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)Explanation of vote"
"Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya report (A5-0140/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, never was there more need for an explanation of vote, for I made a mistake and voted against the Bedoya report instead of for it."
"I am therefore using the time available to me to make this statement."
"Of course I voted for the report."
"How could I not approve of the Cohesion Fund being used to assist Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland?"
"However, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that it would be appropriate to grant this aid for as long as it takes for the States' gross domestic product to reach the European Union average in full, for otherwise I can imagine a situation where, as the gross domestic product of each State approaches the average, the relevant Minister for Finance and the Budget says, 'Put the brakes on or we will lose our European Union aid!'"
"Casaca report (A5-0137/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted against the Casaca report, not because I am against monitoring European Union expenditure, but because I consider that this is the moment to start changing the agricultural subsidy system."
"We can all see that the European Union Agriculture ship leaks like a sieve."
"I believe that, if we want to subsidise agricultural products and farmers in their activities, we must change our procedure completely."
"I propose that, instead of granting farmers financial aid, we should grant them tax reductions and reductions in their social service and pension contributions relating to their activities."
"These expenses would otherwise be borne by the States and therefore, to a lesser extent, by the European Union."
"European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0147/2000 by Mr Sousa Pinto, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation completing Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 establishing a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (OEDT) (COM(1999) 430 - C5-0304/1999 - 1999/0187(CNS))"
"(A5-0157/2000) by Mr Turco, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Norway on the participation of Norway in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (COM(1999) 496 - C5-0054/2000 - 1999/0203(CNS))."
"Mr President, Article 13 of the Regulation establishing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction allows third countries who share the interests of the Community and its States to participate in the Centre' s work."
"Following a request for participation by Norway, the Commission submitted to the European Parliament a draft agreement between the European Monitoring Centre and Norway authorising Norway to participate in the REITOX network and to be represented on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre as well as on its scientific committee."
"In this regard, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted 8 amendments which give a favourable opinion with reservations."
"In particular, our opinion was influenced by the EMCDDA evaluation report which the Committee had asked independent external consultants to prepare."
"With regard to work scheduling, there is insufficient coordination of the management tasks of the director and the heads of department. The administrative procedures are burdensome and inappropriate for such a small organisation and this generates manifest problems in terms of administration, management, planning assessment, development, recruitment and training."
"These are the conclusions of the evaluation carried out independently by an external consultancy firm commissioned by the European Commission."
"On the basis of this evaluation, we must now decide whether to allow Norway to participate in the work or not, taking into consideration the fact that the work is completely inconsistent with the mandate and far from exploits the Centre' s potential."
"Having said this, our committee unanimously considered that the draft agreement between Norway and the Centre, together with the proposal for a Council Regulation aimed at adapting the regulation governing the Centre with a view to the participation of candidate countries in its work, is therefore an opportunity to stress the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the regulation governing the Centre in order to ensure its effectiveness and reliability."
"I urge the Commission to give us a tangible response regarding the amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Mr President, Mr Turco' s report, which recommends that Parliament accepts the proposal for an agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on the participation of Norway in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, was discussed at length and then unanimously adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The amendments made by the Committee in agreement with the rapporteur, which have been incorporated into the proposal, are intended to exploit the opportunity presented by this agreement with Norway to give fresh impetus to the Centre' s work."
"The committee took into particular consideration the 1999 report on the Centre' s work and the difficulties encountered, and the outcome of the interinstitutional conference on drugs which took place in Brussels late last February."
"These sources showed that some of the constraints on the activities hitherto carried out by the Centre, which also restrict Union activity in this field, are caused by the wide range of differing information gathered by the various national centres linked to the Centre, with the result that it is difficult to draw conclusions from this information which would be useful in terms of prevention or damage limitation measures and operations to fight illegal trafficking."
"The various amendments, including those dealing with the Centre' s Management Board, are therefore intended to ensure that the Board uses genuinely effective data-gathering methods which are capable of interpreting the data in the light of unit criteria and provide useful indications regarding the efficiency of the various national anti-drugs policies."
"Indeed, it appeared to many members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs that both the annual reports of the Centre and those tabled and adopted by Parliament fail to take into due account the analysis of the results obtained in the various countries, whose anti-drugs policies differ, moreover."
"The European Union needs to decide on its policies and recommendations to the governments of the Member States by means of a comprehensive assessment - which is not, as all too often happens, purely moralist - of the various strategies being followed in the various countries, especially with regard to prevention, damage limitation and consumer safety in the face of the constant emergence of new synthetic drugs."
"We believe that the agreement on the participation of Norway in the work of the Centre, which, we hope, will pave the way for other enlargement initiatives, provides a major opportunity to revitalise the activity of this technical and scientific body, for the EMCDDA must become an increasingly important reference point in the development of a European policy to fight the illegal sale and distribution of drugs which are harmful to the health of the citizens of our countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when expressions like 'bringing the European Union closer to its citizens' and 'good governance' are on everyone' s lips, an examination of the way the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction works, and of its scientific output, proves quite astonishing, as its conclusions are virtually non-existent."
"Like the increasing number of centres that are being set up in order to conceal our differences, this one, in its five years of existence, has done nothing to justify the millions of euros that are pumped into it each year."
"If you compare the amount of money which it is allocated with that available to national bodies, one would expect to see in-depth studies leading, as stipulated in the definition of its aims in Article 2, to the provision of objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction."
"This Centre ought to be in a position to establish definitions and uniform indicators with a view to carrying out an evaluation of the various anti-drugs policies implemented in the Member States, from both a health and socio-economic as well as a law-and-order perspective."
"When will we get to know, for example, what the consequences have been of the prohibitionist policy adopted in France or of the regulatory one adopted in the Netherlands?"
"The independent assessment of the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the conclusions of which were published in March 2000, is very specific regarding the serious mismanagement of the board of directors and of the REITOX network, which gathers information on drugs and drug addiction."
"The reports that we are looking at today are about expanding the Centre to Norway and to the 13 candidate countries."
"On this issue we must agree, but would it not be better to reform this body beforehand, so that it might finally serve a useful purpose?"
"New members should certainly be welcomed, but with what in mind?"
"Is the idea to reproduce the failure we have witnessed over the past few years, but on an even larger scale?"
"To add to the length of the beautifully presented annual reports which achieve precisely nothing?"
"It is high time that the European Union became aware that, a long way from the Centre' s magnificent premises in Lisbon, thousands of people are directly faced with the health and social difficulties engendered by drug dependence."
"We are not asking it to deal with such problems, we are simply asking that it should analyse them."
"Hundreds of varying initiatives are being implemented in Europe by both institutions and associations, which focus either on criminalisation or risk reduction."
"What is the Centre waiting for to evaluate these strategies?"
"How is it that Member States are being so reluctant to cooperate in evaluation?"
"Is it possible that there is a fear that the results may not be that great politically?"
"I therefore join the rapporteur in arguing in favour of the idea of a real reform of the Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in respect both of the way it functions and of expanding its activities."
"This, moreover, is a necessary precondition to taking on new members."
"Mr President, as other colleagues have mentioned, the rapporteurs hope that amendments to this regulation will facilitate the Kingdom of Norway' s participation in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and, in each of the amendments tabled, they have highlighted the action plans, Parliamentary resolutions and the annual evaluation of the Centre. They are also seeking to relaunch the Centre' s work, change the guidelines for action of the Management Board and - it must be pointed out - ensure that Member States cooperate with the Centre as required."
"We are all responsible for achieving this; the Monitoring Centre, our national public institutions and the Member States themselves."
"The only way to improve the Centre' s work is by ensuring that the information provided by Member States and the regulations governing the Centre are ever more thorough and reliable."
"Failure to do so would make it impossible to put an end to an evil that particularly affects the youth of Europe."
"I also believe that if we fail to take this opportunity to amend the regulation with a view to relaunching the Centre' s work, we run the risk of creating further problems when it comes to incorporating the applicant countries in this work."
"In the short term, I think that this is one of the key issues to be tackled, which is why we fully agree with the rapporteur and why I believe the report will be adopted unanimously."
"Each institution must fulfil their respective obligations and urge Member States to gather reliable information by working clearly and effectively together. What is more, they need to draw up specific action plans to tackle a problem that particularly affects the youth in our countries and implement them more rigorously and with greater enthusiasm."
"Mr President, we are examining two proposals for partial revision of the working procedures and methods of the Lisbon Drugs Monitoring Centre, in particular two proposals on relations with the candidate countries and Norway."
"This is therefore our chance - for the contents of these proposals are not in themselves revolutionary for the Centre - to discuss the role and usefulness of the Centre in terms of its function, which should also be our function, of providing political indications and assessments and adopting decisions and initiatives on drugs, although the European Union' s powers in this area are severely limited."
"I would argue that this type of discussion can only be based on an evaluation carried out by an independent body."
"A number of speakers, including, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Turco, have stressed that from very many perspectives, such as strategy, functionality and the poor capacity to integrate scientific work, this Centre' s contribution to political decision-making is totally inadequate."
"However, at this point I feel that it is necessary for the Commission to assume the responsibility of presenting a proposal for reform to Parliament as soon as possible, for we cannot record each year, if not the uselessness, the lack of usefulness of the Centre in terms of political decisions, and then each year, year after year, leave aside the debate and postpone it until the next year."
"The Commission must present a proposal for reforming the procedures which are described as bureaucratic and tedious and, above all, failing to focus on the scientific function of the Centre."
"Another important point: each year, the Centre and the Commission tell us that there is a data harmonisation problem because the data-gathering criteria differ from country to country."
"This is a political issue."
"At this point, the Commission must table a proposal on how the data can be harmonised, or the whole exercise will be completely pointless."
"The Centre does not in itself have this authority, but it must provide the Commission with recommendations for data harmonisation and table a proposal - maybe a proposal for a directive - on the subject, because this is a political issue."
"At the beginning of the 1990s, there was a great scandal in Italy because a leak from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health revealed that they were hiding the real overdose mortality rate."
"Obviously, it is more convenient for politicians and governments to say that a young man has died in the street from a heart attack than to acknowledge that his death was caused by an overdose, and the same applies to policy-making."
"An official DG XIV document on alcohol consumption states that the Swedish authorities talk of there being 2000 deaths per year due to alcohol abuse in Sweden, while the real figure is between 6 000 and 7 000 deaths a year, but these figures serve to cover up the failure of their anti-drugs policy."
"The data problem is therefore a political issue which must be resolved politically, by means of Commission proposals which Parliament may accept or reject."
"Mr President, as one of the longest-serving Members in the House my memory goes back right to the first committee of inquiry into drugs in the Community on which I had the honour to serve."
"I also have memories of other Community institutions."
"We have happily set up over the years several semi-European institutions in different Member States."
"Some of them have matured and grown and become quite effective."
"But if they do not do that they become flaccid, rot and become totally useless - just another expensive quango, not actually achieving any great results."
"It is appropriate that at the moment we are assessing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"We all too often have a tendency in Parliament, I am afraid, when we cannot to do anything more concrete, to set up another institution."
"That makes us feel good but does not actually change anything."
"So it is appropriate that we look at the work of this observatory in Lisbon at this stage."
"We should not kill it off until we are sure it is not being effective."
"But we have to accept that none of our countries are going to come up with a harmonised approach to dealing with the tragedy of increasing drug addiction and the murders, deaths and all that surrounds this dreadful trade."
"I take this opportunity to say to my dear colleagues from all parties in the Netherlands: your policies have tended to become like a honeypot for the criminal element in many of the accession countries."
"In the last month alone five young Irish drug dealers - and I admit they should not have been doing it - moved to the Netherlands because it was more comfortable for them to be there."
"They have all been quite horribly murdered by people coming from some of the accession states to the Community."
"So it is important that we include them in the work of this observatory."
"It is very important that we take a very serious look at the policies within Turkey, an accession state, in relation to the provision of drugs and to the criminal activities surrounding it."
"The observatory in Lisbon cannot work effectively without very close relationships with the Europol agency in The Hague."
"I would like to thank both the rapporteurs."
"They have done a good, serious job."
"They have asked very serious questions."
"The point was made that three years is far too long between assessments."
"I would like us to have another debate like this next year to really assess how effective the observatory is and how effectively it is using its very considerable budget in this work."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Turco and my colleague Mr Sousa Pinto for their important reports which show the essential work the agencies are doing through their investigations into how drugs actually function, their effect, the impact on society and which describe what help and improvements can be made."
"This is especially important and significant when we look at the whole question of enlargement."
"A previous speaker spoke very eloquently about the evil of drugs, and Mr Beysen referred to the tobacco vote a couple of days ago."
"There is an element of hypocrisy here, because half the House voted against having stronger measures on tobacco advertising and - I choose my words carefully - there are many Members in this House who are regular users, to different degrees, of alcohol, which is a very powerful drug."
"I am not teetotal, nor do I wish to be sanctimonious about this, but we have to be realistic about the situation that exists in Europe today."
"That must be our starting-point."
"We also have to be realistic about what we want from the Centre."
"I take issue with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mr Cappato on some of their remarks about the Centre as it functions at the moment."
"For the work of the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon to be effective, Member States have to cooperate fully."
"As Mrs Banotti has just said, the agencies have to be involved."
"The Lisbon Centre has to have reliable, accurate information and be able to monitor and involve all the different agencies in as many countries as possible."
"Mr Blokland said that we should not include Turkey."
"If you look at the whole question of drugs and the issues of enlargement of the European Union, Turkey is an intrinsic part of the supply routes for drugs coming into Europe."
"I know the Turkish authorities are looking at ways of improving the situation and so are the applicant countries and those which would like to be applicant countries."
"They want to address this problem."
"In many cases they do not have the civic structures and other organisations in place to properly enforce some of the regulations we would like and some of the monitoring that would take place."
"So we cannot exclude one country because we do not like it very much: we have to open our doors to as many countries as we can and encourage the work that is being done."
"Of course, there is not enough being done."
"There needs to be more progress."
"But if we just sit back and say that everything is fine or just say ""no"" to drugs and that people should not use them, we are not accepting the situation as it is; we are not giving the tools to those people who want to improve the position."
"I look forward to another debate, as Mrs Banotti has said - perhaps in a year's time - when we can actually start to pinpoint some of the progress that is being made."
"I congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament' s proposed amendments on the Drugs Monitoring Centre seek to fundamentally change the remit of the original Centre."
"As a result, the consensus enjoyed hitherto will be abandoned."
"The purely information-gathering centre is to be converted into a drugs-combating centre."
"It cannot be right to bring in the Swedish method through the back door, because this implies working towards the goal of a drug-free society across Europe."
"But there never will be a drug-free society."
"Or are cigarettes and alcohol going to be banned too?"
"Despite this restrictive policy being pursued with greater vigour, the number of drug-related deaths has not fallen."
"Last year in Germany alone, there were over 1 800."
"A drugs policy of abstinence has led neither to fewer addicts nor to less crime; neither has it led to less drug-related prostitution nor reduced so-called organised crime."
"European drugs policy therefore needs a new guiding principle."
"This principle is called damage limitation."
"Damage limitation is pragmatic and based on reality, whereas abstinence is a moral programme which does not work."
"Instead of solutions being sought, however, the mandate of the originally neutral information-gathering centre is now to be extended to cover criminal prosecution."
"At the same time, in the Commission it is intended that, from now on, the issue of prevention should only play a minor role as a small part of health policy."
"In addition, the Commission is making life difficult for NGOs working on drugs."
"For example, their prevention projects are being hindered by the Commission' s disbursing the approved funds several months late."
"Is it the aim of European drugs policy to place more emphasis on criminal prosecution and to cut back on prevention?"
"As far as I am concerned, this is the wrong way forward."
"That is why I shall be voting against this amendment to integrate criminal prosecution into an extended remit of the Drugs Monitoring Centre."
"All those colleagues who are interested in having a drugs policy based on people' s needs will, I hope, do likewise."
"Mr President, the scourge of drugs and the action taken to combat it know no geographical, social or national boundaries."
"Consequently, any attempt to study this phenomenon must not be contained within the geographical borders of the Member States or even the candidate countries, but must be based on information from as many countries as possible, if it is to help prevent and combat the problem more efficiently."
"We need to study in depth why and how more and more young people are turning to escapism and drugs at ever younger ages."
"Collating, substantiating and evaluating information from a number of countries will only help us carry out an integrated study and find basic answers if we collate and exchange data from as wide an area as possible on a comparable basis."
"For example, in Greece, most of the information obtained so far has been from treatment centres, leaving sources of information from other agencies which might contribute towards a more integrated evaluation of the dimensions of the problem unexplored."
"The treatment centres house young people who are able to access them because they are helped either by their family or by the wider social environment."
"But what happens to the large section of the population which has no such access, such as economic migrants?"
"According to information from the Greek Addiction Treatment Centre, 97% of the people using these centres are Greek citizens."
"However, according to prison statistics, the majority of drug users in prison are economic migrants who, either because they do not speak the language or because of a lack of information and social exclusion, have never set foot in such a centre."
"Consequently, according to the data collated and evaluated by the Treatment Centre, this category of users is almost non-existent."
"In my opinion, every user should have the opportunity to go to a detoxification centre without being obliged to give his or her full personal details."
"We all know that using drugs leads to crime, not only because drugs per se are illegal, but because the high cost of drugs set by the huge financial rings which supply them, inevitably forces all users into crime."
"Mr President, in company with most of the Members who have spoken before me, I can only say that these reports leave us two essential lines of thought to follow."
"Firstly, this is a positive evaluation which is consistent with the Commission' s proposal."
"There are no borders when it comes to subjects such as our present concern of drug addiction and the trafficking of narcotics, and so it is certainly a useful, sustainable initiative to set objectives which include countries which are not currently Members of the European Union but which are in the pre-accession phase, countries taking part in the PHARE programme or Norway, in their prevention or suppression strategies, for this will help us to broaden the scope of our anti-drugs strategy."
"On the other hand, however, both the rapporteur and the Members have stressed that this occasion calls for reflection upon the way in which the Centre operates and upon the results it has produced in recent years, and I feel that we cannot say we are satisfied with its performance up until now."
"And quite apart from our own reservations, there is also an independent report, which has just been referred to, which outlines all the limits and shortcomings of this action."
"My fellow Member said that these changes will transform the Centre from a statistics office into a drugs monitoring centre."
"I wish it could be so but I cannot share her optimism."
"On the contrary, I fear that many proposals and concerns, including those voiced by other Members, will only serve the purpose of rationalising data and making it compatible."
"I was even somewhat surprised to hear Mrs Ghilardotti mention consumer safety."
"I would not like the Monitoring Centre for Drug Addiction to be likened to the Monitoring Centre for Food Quality and Safety!"
"Let us be careful, for this is an extremely serious phenomenon which is damaging the whole of our society and destroying entire generations. We must fight against it."
"So, the efforts to make data from the different countries compatible and the call for efficient dissemination of the data are all very well, but if we think we can achieve these objectives, even our information objective, without taking into consideration the contributions made by the individuals concerned, Non-Governmental Organisations, voluntary associations and rehabilitation communities in the different countries, then we are living in a fantasy world."
"We must involve them, and then the Centre will be able to perform a genuinely effective and productive part - and we must monitor this - in the fight against drugs."
"Mr President, unfortunately, the drugs problem is likely to remain on the international community's agenda for several decades to come."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, established 7 years ago, is an important tool for collating comparable data from the Member States."
"It is used to monitor this serious phenomenon and determine the approach to be taken in a multidimensional policy at national and European level."
"At least two main criteria must be met if we are to achieve this objective: first, we need reliable assessments of the measures taken and, if they are efficient, we need to implement them, not only in the Member States, but also in the candidate countries, the rest of central and eastern Europe and in any third country with the right legal framework under relevant agreements."
"Permit me to say that the fight against drugs is a prime example, perhaps the only example of an issue which calls for globalized measures and decisions and where globalized measures and decisions will only have positive repercussions."
"The second main criterion which I should like to mention is the need to provide the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon with the necessary economic and administrative resources in order to facilitate its difficult and ambitious objectives."
"It is clear from how it has operated to date, as documented in the recent experts' report, that we do not need simply to supplement Regulation 302/93, as suggested by the Commission. We need to amend it as described in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"These amendments refer mainly to the modus operandi of the board of directors, the provision of technical assistance by the Centre to the aforementioned countries and the Centre's help with evaluation procedures at national, European and international level."
"I am certain that this will guarantee better operating conditions for the European Monitoring Centre and increase the potential for taking integrated and efficient decisions."
"Finally, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their thorough work."
"Mr President, whenever reference is made to a particular undertaking, it seems only sensible to assess the way it operates so that improvements may be made on the basis of the culture of quality and continual improvement."
"This is why we agree with those who assert that the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has not performed satisfactorily and therefore why we, like others, are critical of it."
"We endorse the amendments and reforms aimed at enhancing the objectivity, reliability and comparability of the information provided, given that quality information is essential if related policies are to be improved upon."
"As a group, we should like to see the proposal taken a stage further in order to encompass damage-reduction programmes. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as this issue clearly has pan-European public health and socio-economic implications, it requires a strategy at European level."
"Whether we like it or not, Europe is not confined to the European Union, which is why we must support moves to broaden the scope of this proposal to incorporate countries that do not form part of the European Union and those who at present have the status of candidate countries."
"As the issue of hypocrisy is so often raised in relation to the tobacco and drugs debate, would it not be appropriate here to mention other forms of hypocrisy, such as those tax havens in which drugs money takes refuge?"
"Mr President, in the previous Parliament, many Members, especially from Southern Europe, were in favour of free trade in milder drugs."
"In the North, it is generally believed that any free trade in milder drugs lowers the threshold that makes it possible to move on to using hard drugs."
"It is important that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in the context of the positive climate that exists in Parliament with regard to drugs, also acquires sufficient resources for its anti-drugs activities outside the European Union."
"It would appear that this is not the case, however."
"The Centre is being given new tasks without the corresponding resources to carry them out, and the amendments, by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in particular, tend in that direction."
"Resources must be increased via the PHARE and TACIS programmes."
"The most important drug routes to the European Union area will, in the future, be Afghanistan, Russia, Chechnya and Turkey as well as Kosovo and the other former Yugoslavian regions."
"All the PHARE countries have to be made to go the way of Norway."
"And they must be given the technical assistance to do so."
"Estonia is one of the biggest drugs routes from Russia to Finland, and from Finland to the common markets of the EU."
"All countries that receive financial aid must be made to go the way of Norway."
"There are, at present, no conditions set for EU aid. By way of example, Montenegro receives financial and political aid from the EU to pay its police force, but not for the fight against smuggling and drugs, but for its struggle against Milosevic."
"No such conditions are imposed on the aid by the World Bank or the IMF."
"The EU should, however, impose conditions for the aid it gives."
"Mr President, the fight against drugs is one of the most important tasks we have as citizens and politicians."
"That applies both to citizens down on the floor of the House and to those up in the gallery."
"Drugs breed crime and social destitution and tear many people' s lives apart."
"It is therefore a positive sign that we can now see both the candidate countries and Norway involved in the cooperation we already have."
"In order to be able to carry out a credible assessment and produce reliable statistics, we must however have a strategy concerning what information the Member States are to send in to the Centre."
"Otherwise, the statistical basis will be fairly meagre and not serve any larger purpose."
"However, it is not only the Centre' s responsibility, but also that of the respective Member States to ensure that the information sent in is also relevant and can be used for some purpose."
"Responsibility for taking measures to combat drug abuse now lies, in the first place, with the Member States."
"This ought not, however, to stop us trying to devise common assignments and strategies for preventive work, which is perhaps the most important foundation stone in the fight against drugs."
"It ought, moreover, to be possible for the Union and the Centre to have a role in supervising the domestic production of drugs, as one of the previous speakers mentioned, for we cannot get away from the fact that many of the drugs that are in circulation today, and which young people encounter on the streets, are synthetic drugs, produced in the Union and nowhere else."
"In view of the open borders we now have, it is a problem if more drugs than we would wish are being produced in a particular place."
"I should like to say that the definition of a drugs-free society is a good one."
"It is a goal or vision, just like every other vision the Union has when it comes to social destitution and other phenomena we wish to combat."
"It is an aggressive approach I should like to see maintained."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco, for their excellent reports."
"The fight against drug abuse and the drug trade is important."
"This report has been produced to complement the current regulation concerning the Monitoring Centre."
"Moreover, it is intended that the candidate countries should be involved in the work."
"Let me comment on that first of all."
"It is, in fact, important that the candidate countries be involved."
"I myself come from Sweden."
"In recent years, we have developed cooperation with the Baltic countries and with Poland in order to end the drugs trade and prevent drug abuse."
"The drug trade is not confined by national borders. We must therefore have cross-border cooperation to prevent the trade from developing."
"The same applies to cooperation with Norway."
"Norway participates in the internal market and is to become a member of Schengen."
"Norway has much the same problems as Sweden when it comes to drugs crossing the border."
"It is therefore important that we cooperate and gather information from these neighbouring countries, as well as study how they conduct their policies."
"The rapporteur also deals with how the Centre operates at present."
"I think he draws an important distinction, for the Centre should not be dabbling in politics."
"Instead, it is we who should be engaged in politics here in political assemblies, as well as in the Member States - in fact, mainly in the Member States, when it comes to drugs policy."
"However, the Centre should create a basis for political decisions."
"In this regard, there are at present deficiencies when it comes to collecting statistics."
"We must obtain relevant and reliable information which can be compared."
"What is more, the Centre can carry out analyses and assess the objectives which we in the political assemblies establish, so that we might revise policy accordingly."
"The Centre must become significantly better in this area than it is at present."
"Analyses must be carried out of the policies which are applied - different types of policy are pursued in, for example, the Netherlands and Sweden."
"I think it is important for us to analyse what these differences, in the guise of policy, in fact look like when it comes to problems such as drug abuse by young people."
"The joint debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Report (A5-0147/2000)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )"
"Report (A5-0157/2000)"
"Following the vote on the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, I would like to intervene on a point of order pursuant to Rule 69."
"It was not clear from the Commissioner' s speech whether the Commission accepts the amendments that Parliament has just adopted."
"In particular, I did not understand whether Norway will start to participate in the work of the EMCDDA after it has been reformed, that is, whether it is the Commission' s intention that Norway should be allowed to participate in the work of the EMCDDA immediately or whether it should wait until September, when the reform is scheduled to take place, when the Management Board will issue its recommendations. This would allow Norway to join an existing body rather than something which, according to the independent consultancy firm' s report, is currently ineffective, inadequate, extremely expensive and altogether useless."
"Mr President, the Commission intends Norway to become a member of the Monitoring Centre we were discussing this morning, as soon as possible."
"As I mentioned earlier - and I was also speaking for my colleague Mr Vitorino - we see eye to eye on many of the concerns raised by a number of Members of this House this morning, but this is not an opportune moment to raise the issue of the functioning of the Monitoring Centre itself."
"This morning' s debate was about adding Norway, and the countries of Eastern Europe of course, to the centre' s list of members, or that is how the Commission saw it at any rate."
"Mr President, the Commissioner' s words on the report on the participation of Norway are not satisfactory, in the sense that Parliament once again unanimously considers that Norway should certainly start to participate in the work of the EMCDDA as soon as possible."
"The problem is now that the EMCDDA is not in a fit condition for Norway to join."
"I therefore call upon Parliament to postpone the vote."
"In accordance with Rule 69, the rapporteur can ask, if Parliament so decides, to postpone the vote and the matter will be deemed to be referred back to the committee responsible for reconsideration."
"I see that our co-rapporteur is also requesting the floor."
"I would point out to you that Article 69 stipulates that this procedure takes place without debate."
"I would therefore ask you not to start the debate again, but I give you the floor as co-rapporteur."
"Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me, as rapporteur, to say that the debate we have engaged in this morning is the first opportunity since 1993, when the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction was opened, to make a statement on the fundamental issue of changing its regulations."
"I think that Parliament would have seriously failed in its most basic political responsibilities if it had not undertaken a thorough review of the Monitoring Centre' s duties and tabled a set of proposals that represents a thorough overhaul of its operations. We believe that the Drugs Monitoring Centre is crucial, much needed and has a useful role to play in the future of the European Union, but not by means of this report, with which, in essence, the Commission apparently agrees."
"The regulation now requires me to submit the request submitted by Mr Turco to postpone the vote to the House."
"(Parliament rejected the request) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Community design"
"The next item is the report (A5-0150/2000) by Mr Ferri, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on Community design (COM(1999) 310 - C5-0129/1999 - 1993/0463(CNS))."
"Mr President, having seen Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs, we are now being called upon to assess the proposed regulation and to decide whether to adopt it. Of course, the regulation follows the same line as the directive, and it therefore contains all the same strengths and weaknesses as the directive on such a contentious, competitive issue where there are a large number of interests at play."
"In the end, the directive did not deal with the issue of spare parts for the purpose of repair."
"I am referring to the famous repair clause, the spare parts clause: the complex, organic world of the automotive industry."
"The committee took great care over its work - and I would especially like to thank its chairperson - although a more conservative, extremely cautious interpretation prevailed in the end, for we did not want to push the boat out too far, since the directive will be supplemented on the basis of three years' monitoring of the use of spare parts for the purpose of repair."
"However, one of the strengths of the regulation lies in its definition of the Community right for products and designs and registered and unregistered products: the proposal to use the central Community trade mark office for design as well, offers an exclusive right to protected use at Community level, with some exceptions."
"This is a step towards meeting the clear fundamental requirement of the single market and towards common rules on invalidity, surrender of rights and possibilities of use, particularly in two very important areas: novelty, which is connected to disclosure, and individuality of character, which is connected to creativity."
"These are two aspects of a fascinating world, which clearly requires protection, but also requires flexibility."
"This is why I insist, in particular, on a minimal package of amendments which, in the balance of protections between the Community right and copyright - I urge the European Parliament to give an up-to-date and, most importantly, realistic evaluation of the highly complex world of designs -will prevent the persistence of monopolies."
"I would therefore advocate that a ceiling of 25 years for the protection of registered design rights would be quite sufficient."
"On the other hand, the directive is not open to subjective interpretation."
"The directive states that the Member States must be able to strike a balance between the Community right and copyright."
"I would point out that copyrights last for as long as 70 years in a number of States."
"Thus, if we were to add the 25 years to the 70 years, we would end up preventing the modification of a common product which often - and also, so to speak, by its very nature and taking into account novelty and creativity - cannot last very long, not beyond the lifetime of a human being, for example, and therefore a ceiling of 25 years would seem reasonable."
"May I insist, therefore, that at least this type of adaptation to requirements is implemented and that the Community of Europe, the single market, is given access to a world which is so important, particularly for the SMEs where, in effect, the productivity of design and creativity - which for the European countries naturally represents a boost for jobs and employment - fits perfectly into this network of rights and freedoms."
"I feel that, even with the limits and constraints which I have stressed, in order to give the Members a balanced view, this proposed regulation, which introduces a standardised system with standardised protection throughout Community territory can, in effect, be an important milestone in the construction of Europe."
"Mr President, it seems that the long road to creating a single regulation on the legal protection of designs, drawings and models in the European Union is nearing its end."
"The large amount of time spent on this regulation was justified on the grounds of the importance of adopting the directive on drawings and models, a job that took most of the previous legislature and part of the present one."
"It was clear that once the more serious problems relating to the text of the directive had been overcome - a directive that can be considered as balanced - the task of establishing a resolution would be far easier and so it has been."
"The whole process proves that Parliament was right to adopt the approach in creating the directive first, followed by the resolution."
"Its decision to intervene to obtain the freeze compromise in drawing up the resolution, with the directive being subject to the codecision procedure, was decisive. What is more, this perhaps would not have been the case had the procedure been the other way round, i.e. first the regulation followed by the directive."
"Had this been the case, Parliament' s role would not have been as decisive and the balance between car manufacturers' interests on one hand and independent body part manufacturers on the other would not have been achieved. The same can be said of the interests of consumers and insurance companies."
"The fact that this agreement - which is far from perfect, but which provided a way out of the impasse in such a contentious issue - was reached, made the task of creating this regulation and this report on the Commission' s proposal far easier."
"This task basically involved incorporating the compromises reached in relation to the directive in the regulation."
"If the European Union intended to announce laws regarding the harmonisation of Member States' legislation, it was only right that its own laws were in line with the laws on harmonisation."
"Since the Commission' s proposal followed the wording of the directive almost to the letter, it received our support."
"On this basis, the majority of the amendments we endorse consist precisely in enhancing the similarities between the directive and the regulation."
"I should like to thank Mr Ferri for his report and, at the same time, welcome the flexible approach he adopted throughout proceedings."
"The rapporteur' s first report did advocate certain proposals which, though he believed them to be correct, in the opinion -and I believe in the better informed opinion - of many groups in Parliament, contradicted the freeze compromise relating to the repair clause."
"However, by adopting this flexible approach, Mr Ferri saw fit to withdraw his proposals and I thank him for that."
"At present, there are only two areas on which the rapporteur and my group disagree."
"The first relates to the definition of the individual character of the design, which incorporates an element that supposedly brings it into line with the TRIP agreements."
"This is neither the time nor the place to begin a debate on this issue. We do not agree with this interpretation and would go as far to suggest that the amendment in question includes certain distortions."
"The second point of contention relates to copyright and we shall vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Mr President, my colleague from the PPE-DE Group, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, says that the rapporteur, Mr Ferri, has accused her of being conservative."
"I say to my colleague, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, that it is a label she should accept with pleasure and a badge which she should wear with pride."
"I am speaking today on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues, Lord Inglewood and Mr Harbour who unfortunately cannot be in the Chamber."
"I wish to put on record the British Conservative support for Mr Ferri's report which we feel finds an acceptable compromise between the various conflicting interests."
"In particular, we believe it is right that the directive and regulation line up to provide as seamless as possible a regime for the protection of industrial design across the Union as a whole."
"I would also like to record our support for Mrs Grossetête's report and to emphasise that in our view it is of supreme importance that EU law is implemented consistently, properly and in a timely manner."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Application of Community law (1998)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0132/2000) by Mrs Grossetête, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the sixteenth annual report from the Commission on monitoring the application of Community law (1998) (COM(1999) 301 - C5-0213/1999 - 1999/2168(COS))."
". (FR) Mr President, the fact that this report is the final subject for this week' s part-session does not mean it is unimportant."
"Quite the contrary, we are all interested in a Citizens' Europe, in a Europe for the citizens. It is our duty to consider the interests of the European citizen, to ensure that Community law is applied in all of the Member States and that the European Commission, the guardian of the treaties, monitors this process with the utmost vigilance."
"The figures for 1998, in the report drawn up by the European Commission services, do not, sadly, indicate any significant improvement, and require vigilance from the outset."
"Few areas are spared and Parliament must pick out those which are particularly prone to difficulties: the environment, social conditions and public procurement contracts."
"Having said that, I am convinced that, in future, we will need to extend our vigilance to other spheres of activity."
"The European Parliament must also reiterate its request for information concerning the application of international standards."
"All of the Member States are affected to a greater or lesser degree by the problems of applying Community law."
"This is why I wanted to stress just how important it is that they behave in an exemplary manner in the period prior to several successive enlargements."
"How can we demand that those countries wanting to join the European Union apply Community laws if Member States are themselves unable to respect them?"
"If additional information is necessary, this is also in the interests of the citizen, who is becoming increasingly involved in the process of monitoring Community law."
"This is where the whole question of the infringement procedure comes in."
"The European Commission should not advocate more selectivity in dealing with cases which may give rise to an infringement procedure, a proposal according to which the Commission could abstain from intervening in cases of limited importance, such as, for example, the mutual recognition of qualifications."
"We must protest most strongly against such a move, which could not be justified on the grounds of cost and effectiveness."
"In doing so, the European Commission would find itself turning away from its role as guardian of the Treaties and would deny European citizens access to justice."
"As for methods, I think they can be improved."
"As has been indicated several times by the European Ombudsman, it is important to safeguard the rights of individuals through improved confidentiality, better access to documents and justification of the European Commission' s decisions on classification."
"In the same vein, more data should be obtained on Member States' responsibility for damages suffered by private individuals."
"Nobody would think of doubting the importance of petitions, which play a significant part in signalling that, in some instances, Community law has not been applied in Member States."
"In this spirit, we are urging that special publicity be given to all complaints in order that any action taken is made more obvious."
"Bearing in mind the approach that has been adopted, however, which centres above all on defending the working methods of the Committee on Petitions, I do not wish to support Amendment No 2."
"The attention paid to the CELEX and EUR-LEX databases, that is to say improved access and ongoing optimisation is, I believe, beneficial to the citizen."
"Consolidated documents should be associated with some indication of the successive amendments introduced, as required by Amendment No 1."
"I therefore support this amendment."
"Finally, there is the problem of the preliminary question."
"I do not believe that it needs to be called into doubt in principle, but we can look into its forms."
"When such questions are badly drawn up, the effect can run counter to the aim of legal clarification."
"I therefore suggest that the Court of Justice reconsider the way this procedure works."
"Moreover, I believe that, in order to clarify the text of Recital G, which reads: ""whereas it is primarily national courts that must apply Community law"" , it would be preferable to state ""control the application of Community law"" ."
"There is also, finally, the matter of relations with public administrations which are having to come to grips with new Community standards."
"The current state of affairs in Europe' s construction tends to emphasise the principle of subsidiarity."
"In consideration of this key principle, I am opposed to Amendment No 3."
"I do not consider creating a European administrative law to be appropriate."
"In conclusion, the fact remains that the aim of a control system is to penalise non-application of the law."
"With this in mind, I want to stress the importance of the procedure outlined in Article 228(2), of the Treaty."
"This is a new procedure, and is certainly a deterrent in effect, and the Commission should be less reluctant to consider it in future."
"By voting in favour of this resolution, we will be sending out a positive signal, from a European Parliament which is in tune with the citizens."
"(ES) Mr President, I share the rapporteur' s concerns regarding the fact that we are debating a report of this type at such a late hour on a Friday, especially given the importance we attach to the application of Community law. The figures given by the rapporteur have only compounded our concerns as they are a clear reflection of Member States' failure to apply Community law and this report actually incorporates proposals that would force them to do so."
"The fact that 1101 letters of formal notice, 675 reasoned opinions and 123 referrals have been presented to the Court of Justice clearly highlight the difficulties inherent in applying European Community law."
"I intend to chiefly focus on the proposal put forward by the Committee on Petitions that incorporates amendments signed by all of the groups in the committee."
"I should also like to point out, as a result of those gremlins which sometimes appear in this House, that the Committee on Petitions' conclusions were not incorporated in the rapporteur' s report."
"I have the distinct impression that the Committee on Petitions is considered the poor sister of Parliament and, in fact, at the end of the previous legislature its very future was in doubt."
"However, it is in my view one of the most important committees in Parliament, as it has direct and clearly defined relations with the citizens of Europe and the ability to deal with issues, such as concerns for the environment."
"The rapporteur points out that more than 25% of the petitions lodged concern environmental problems, freedom of movement, fundamental freedoms and the internal market, issues that, in my view, are central to the European Constitution."
"What is more, in view of the rising number of incoming petitions every year they also highlight citizens' desire to see Community law complied with."
"At times it appears that citizens' groups, residents' associations and other types of association show greater concern with regard to the application of Community law than the national public authorities themselves. This is particularly true of environmental issues, something I have personal experience of as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Proof of this lies in the petitions we handle on a daily basis in the Committee on Petitions. This is why I urge you to approve the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Petitions that are no more and no less than a clear reflection of the Committee on Petitions' concern regarding the procedures used for handling citizens' complaints."
"There are considerable delays - often one, two or even three years - between the Committee on Petitions' or the European Commission' s final decision on a matter following the initial complaint."
"The amendments tabled call for procedures to be simplified, as failure to do so would seriously undermine citizens' confidence in the effectiveness of the European institutions."
"Among other things, the amendments call for a certain degree of harmonisation in European administrative law so that all citizens of the Union receive equal treatment."
"Much more could be said, Mr President, about the nature and importance of the Committee on Petitions, but as time is short, I would simply urge members to agree to vote in favour of these amendments today, as they represent the opinion of the Committee on Petitions."
"Mr President, I share Mrs Grossetête' s regret: the construction of Europe must involve the creation of a legal area, and the diligence we have shown in timetabling such a major report for a Friday morning is certainly not reassuring."
"One great Italian thinker maintains that a society is commonly perceived as such only insofar as it succeeds in establishing rules for itself which are respected by its members."
"Certainly, the European Community used to be an institutional model with a remarkable history and the Union is so today; within this Community we have established rules for ourselves - and the Member States and the citizens respect them - but Parliament must not shirk its lawful duty to implement and ensure the implementation of the rules of Community law. Moreover, it must draw fresh strength, fresh nourishment, from its tasks."
"Although we have come a long way and we are making every effort now, I feel that we still have a long way to go. It is our duty to take on board the fact that there is still a great deal to do in the internal market in terms of standardisation, but also and above all, we must realise that there are a great many gaps in the development of the European legal system."
"It is good to know that the rate of transposition of Community directives into Member States' legislation stands at 95%, but this is not enough if the failure to apply Community law correctly is the result of bad practice on the part of administrations rather than the failure to assimilate directives."
"An effective intervention to deal with the national administrations is therefore, in my opinion, necessary, as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has stressed."
"This need is all the greater in that those who are in contact with the law and justice are often unfamiliar with the rules of Community law."
"As the report requests, it is therefore appropriate for candidates to the magistracy and forensic science professions to pay particular attention to the rules which we are developing."
"I tabled some amendments to Mrs Grossetête' s excellent report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, prompted by the concern that the legal protection of the citizens we represent is given insufficient recognition and enforcement in the individual countries."
"Petitions to the Commission and the European Parliament in this context should give us not only food for thought, but also cause for concern."
"The fact that some national courts hardly ever put preliminary questions to the Court of Justice under Article 234 of the Treaty is a further cause for concern, and the representatives of the Commission should instruct their departments to investigate the reasons for this situation."
"In short, we must not underestimate the economic and practical difficulties encountered by the citizens in gaining access to Community case law."
"It may be that we need to adopt a legislative initiative as soon as possible in order to facilitate access to case law in economic terms, perhaps by establishing a support fund."
"Mr President, the Commission' s report on monitoring the application of Community law is a most important document because it reveals the true situation in the European Union and more sittings should perhaps have been devoted to it, not just the Friday sitting."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, has produced an extremely balanced report containing a series of accurate observations which deserve special attention."
"The two reports quite rightly divide the subject of the application of Community law into three dimensions: the non-transposition of Community law and the incompatibility of transposition measures with the letter of Community law and application methods."
"As far as non-application is concerned, there are still serious delays in certain sectors, including the social sector, to which, I am sorry to see, the Commission' s report only devotes a few lines, despite the fact that the issues in question relate to social cohesion."
"There are numerous reasons for non-transposition and they need to be studied."
"Also, it is time that we considered political methods for reducing delays."
"For example, what if each country were to appoint a uniform body at the highest political level which would be responsible, vis-à-vis the European Union, for transposing Community law correctly and on time?"
"What if each country which took over the presidency had to make a prompt, public declaration of its country's degree of compliance with Community law, given that it does not make sense for a country to be responsible for administering political matters when it has not honoured its own commitments?"
"It might also be useful if the state of compliance of each country were publicly announced before each summit."
"Negligence in transposing Community law in the past did not have the same repercussions as it has on a single economic area in which the idea of not having a uniform legal Community order at the same moment in time is inconceivable"
"As far as the method of applying Community law is concerned, this issue relates mainly to the legislative system, both national and Community, and to the appointment of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman."
"The two basic problems relating to the legislative system are: first, often unjustified recourse to the procedure for obtaining preliminary rulings from the European Court and, as Mr Álvarez has mentioned, poorly prepared references and, secondly, the failure to take such recourse on crucial issues."
"Despite appearing different, both have the same root cause, which is the national judges' lack of familiarity with Community law."
"A general campaign is needed here."
"We need to propose to the Member States that all judges should gradually be trained and that this should be the sine qua non for the promotion of older judges to more senior positions and for the admission of newcomers to the bench."
"The present Grotius and Falcone programmes have become out-dated as a result of developments."
"Finally, I should like to say a brief word about where the Committee on Petitions can play an important part in improving the degree of application of Community law."
"This committee forms the interface between the European citizen, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"We need to upgrade this committee if we are to uncover omissions in the practical application of Community law."
"I am in favour of Mr Álvarez's proposals, which really do form the starting point for European administrative Community law."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I have the pleasure of welcoming Mrs Grossetête's report."
"I particularly want to stress a clause which she mentioned in her own speech: recital (e) says that on the eve of several successive enlargements the conduct of the current Member States of the Union in the application of Community law must be exemplary."
"And so indeed it must."
"Alas, we know that it is not so in all cases."
"I have on more than one occasion in this House referred, as others have done, to the shocking case of the foreign language lecturers in Italy who first received a judgment in their favour eleven years ago."
"The law of Italy has not yet been brought into conformity with it, to satisfy their rights."
"We are tested by our will in favour of the individual, the citizen, seeking their rights under Community law."
"No rights are more important than those against discrimination and those in favour of freedom of movement."
"If we do not satisfy these we let ourselves down in the face of our own aspirations."
"I have received disturbing correspondence this week from a number of sources in Germany, suggesting that a similar problem may be building up concerning self-employed foreign language teachers working there, where laws are being applied retrospectively for the convenience for the state with apparent injustice to the teachers."
"I shall be following that up and we may have to look into it again."
"I cite these two exemplary cases simply to stress the importance of Mrs Grossetête's report and to thank her personally for her own intervention in the former case which I am sure will move it forward."
"I apologise for the fact that I cannot stay to the end of this debate owing to exigencies of transport between here and Edinburgh, but I am delighted to have had the chance of participating so far."
"Mr President, fellow members, this Community law which we are helping to establish presents serious difficulties as far as application in Member States is concerned."
"European citizens have used this last resort as a way of expressing their anger and indignation at the disruption and even destruction of their daily way of life, foisted on them by bureaucrats for a purpose that sometimes escapes us and for stakes that do not justify it."
"While this report should have offered us an opportunity, as elected Members, to assess the many texts on which we are voting, and to learn from them for the future, we are limiting ourselves to a control/sanction approach."
"This type of constraining, over-regulated Europe is certainly not the one our respective fellow citizens want."
"The way in which this report has been adopted is appalling."
"The rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has demonstrated absolute scorn for the Committee on Petitions by not even seeing fit to put its conclusions to the vote."
"Yesterday, the plenary displayed a similar contempt when it ignored the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee regarding the Maaten report."
"I greatly fear that the trend will spread and the Commission will not see the text, on which we in this half-empty House are about to vote, as very much more important."
"Rather than unnecessary amendments, I should like a response to the following question."
"The 1998 figures show that reasoned opinions have doubled in volume, cases of non-conformity or poor application, revealed automatically, have gone up by over 50%, complaints by 18% and letters of formal notice by 12%."
"This is not, at this stage, evidence of effective control, but rather of the existence of a profusion of texts which, in the hands of the judges, leave our national assemblies, which are expressing the popular will both legitimately and democratically, under threat of condemnations as well as of penalties."
"Do the Commission and the rapporteur not think that it would be a good thing to reduce the number of texts and, above all, to modify those which quite clearly raise crucial political, legal and practical questions that do not appear to be so obvious and acute when they are framed, or would they prefer to carry on sanctioning our States and turning our fellow citizens into the real victims?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Grossetête, I should like to make three comments on the report regarding monitoring the application of Community law, taking as my premise the fact that the proper application of Community law is not just an assessment of transposition in arithmetical terms, but also an evaluation of the practices adopted in actually applying it."
"Firstly, I should like to comment on the issue of a community based on law and one based on values. In my view, the community based on law and the community based on values do not stand in contradiction to one other, rather they are interdependent."
"Anyone who breaks the law or perverts the course of justice violates certain values."
"And anyone who violates these values can be judged and condemned under the law."
"You will understand that, in this context, what I am saying from the Austrian point of view is that, in their actions towards Austria, the 14 Member States of the European Union have infringed EU law, international law and the UN Charter, that they have defied the spirit of the European founding fathers and thus damaged the community of values."
"And I therefore call upon you to repair that damage."
"My second comment concerns the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. On 1 February 2000, the Commission issued a statement on this matter saying that it would continue to fulfil its duty as guardian of the Treaties."
"And with regard to Austria it said that, in this context, the Commission, in close contact with the governments of the Member States, would closely monitor the situation, maintaining its working relations with the Austrian authorities."
"I would stress that, as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission has been closely monitoring the situation since 1 February 2000 and, to this day, it has not found any grounds for criticism, which makes it clear that neither the community based on law nor that based on values is being violated in Austria."
"My third comment is that yesterday I made a mistake!"
"I should like to say this in conclusion."
"I criticised my Socialist colleagues from Austria for the inconsistent way in which they voted, and I insinuated that at the end they had abstained from the vote on the Feira resolution."
"That is wrong; they voted in favour."
"This does not in any way change my critical attitude towards the double standards of the Austrian Social Democratic movement, which were also plain to see yesterday in the way its Members voted."
"But I must admit my mistake."
"It would not hurt the 14 either if, in Feira, they were to publicly retract the statement they made on 31 January 2000, contrary to the law, about one Member State, and if they were to rectify this mistake."
". (ES) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and in my capacity as chairperson of this committee, I should like to use some of my allotted time to refute some statements in relation to our consideration of other committees' opinions."
"The rapporteur is absolutely right, Mr President, to say that these amendments, though very interesting, are not relevant in this case."
"Firstly, everyone is aware how hard I have fought to establish genuine administrative law in this area, however, the report centres on a different issue."
"The same can be said in relation to the Committee on Petitions' other amendment that refers to an interinstitutional agreement and appeals to the Council and the Commission for greater cooperation."
"We shall have to vote on these amendments, but in another report."
"With regard to Mrs Grossetête' s report, Mr President, the fact that I have only tabled one amendment - and even that was in conjunction with Mrs Grossetête herself - is proof of my appreciation of her work and the spirit in which it was carried out."
"Those of you who know me will be only too aware of the fact that, if I disagree with a text, particularly one that is close to my heart and to which I attach great importance, I never hold back when it comes to amendments."
"There is one issue that I hope Mrs Grossetête will raise during the vote - I unfortunately cannot attend, which is why I am making a point of it here - and that is the mistake in recital G. It should state that monitoring the application of Community law is first and foremost the responsibility of the courts."
"As regards the other issues, this report is, in my view, thorough, comprehensive and of great importance."
"I should like to mention a few points in relation to Mrs Grossetête' s report."
"We should perhaps consider broadening its scope, not only to encompass Annex IV and the development of Article 65, but also possibly take it further and perhaps consider -as part of the creation of the Europe of the Citizens - setting up communication channels to enable citizens to discuss issues that affect them in relation to Community law and even the Treaty on European Union."
"Next year, Commissioner, we should like to see a more balanced and exhaustive report drawn up."
"As Mrs Grossetête herself pointed out, this report is very balanced and exhaustive in some areas but not in others."
"The overall message put forward is that Community law must be applied properly; our Community is a Legal Community; there will either be a European rule of law or not; and monitoring compliance with Community law must be considered a priority."
"Lastly, I should briefly like to highlight the importance of the infringement procedure and draw people' s attention, as others have before me, to this reform which is desirable and on which we all agree."
"We need to improve the way in which the infringement procedure operates, but do so in a way that does not prevent citizens in the slightest from fully exercising their right to directly contact the Commission which, at the end of the day, is what brings them closer to it."
"As we so often speak about bringing citizens closer to the institutions, this is surely one of the ways to achieve this aim."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Grossetête for her report."
"I agree with her: there is nothing more important that we could devote time to discussing in this Parliament."
"Preceding the downfall of the Roman Empire it was customary to take out the imperial decree, unroll the great scroll of purple and gold, read it, have it copied and distribute it - and nobody took the slightest notice of it."
"There is no surer way to bring about the downfall and disintegration of this Union than to make laws that Member States do not ensure are then observed."
"One thing that did not come up in the discussion was the greater use that could be made of the proceedings in this House, particularly Question Time, to bring to the attention of the Commission and exchange views with them on grievances that arise throughout the Union."
"These are increasingly being brought to the attention of Members of Parliament."
"In the early days I lived in a border area where the right of freedom of movement of goods and services was not being observed and I found I could get a lot of satisfaction by raising questions directly with the Commission."
"In those days Parliament did not have the same power or prestige that it has today."
"So instead of reducing working time in this House we should devote a little more time to underlining the failures of the European Union to implement its decisions."
"There are some areas that people, particularly in business, are well-familiar with, such as the single market."
"But there are other areas where there is a lot of confusion."
"I was at a conference last week."
"Someone pointed out the fact that we need 100 million migrant workers in this Union over the next 25 years if we are to maintain economic growth and meet our social obligations."
"If that happens, there will be a lot of movement of people."
"If, from the very beginning, the European Union and the Member States make it clear that these people have equal rights, that the conditions on which they are admitted are common conditions and that they are free to move within the Union after they enter, then citizens would be half-way towards accepting the situation and we could forestall a lot of the difficulties with migrants which are already emerging."
"Mr President, it is a shame that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has already left. However, I should like to speak in favour of the Committee on Petitions' conclusions."
"Out of respect for my colleagues, in my previous intervention I made reference to what I termed the 'gremlins' that sometimes appear in Parliament, but it is not these poor gremlins' fault."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi made it very clear that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights had no intention of incorporating the Committee on Petitions' conclusions."
"Proof that these conclusions were unanimously adopted lies in the fact that they were signed by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, another member of the Committee on Petitions from the European People' s Party, two members of the Socialist Group and I myself as draftsman of the opinion."
"I am of the view that it is imperative for any report on the application of Community law to incorporate the Committee on Petitions' conclusions, as this committee plays such a key role in ensuring Member States apply Community law."
"This is why I urge you to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 2 and 3."
"Mr President, it is not my wish to see a problem arise between the Legal Affairs Committee and the Committee on Petitions."
"The fact is that the basic points made by the Committee on Petitions have already been included in the text of the report I drew up."
"The reason why we do not agree with your amendments, as Mrs Palacio has explained, is because this is not the place to include them."
"If you look at the report in detail, you will find that the basic elements of your conclusions have been incorporated."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Mr President, my Group abstained from voting on the Grossetête report because in the middle of the perfectly acceptable general considerations on the application of Community law, the resolution put to the vote included a paragraph which we are unable to accept."
"This is paragraph 11, which invites the Commission, and I quote,: ""to be less timid in the use of the periodic penalty payment procedure in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 228(2) of the EC Treaty."
"This Article stipulates that the Court of Justice may, as it sees fit, impose penalties or fines, sometimes very stiff ones, on a Member State that, for whatever reason, fails to apply Community law."
"We feel, however, that the legal problem is not that simple, and that inflicting such penalties on Member States is excessive."
"In fact, there may be totally legitimate contradictions between Community law and national law."
"For example, a contradiction which may appear following a qualified majority vote in Council - and there are an increasing number of such votes - or a contradiction which may appear between a national constitution and Community law, or even a contradiction which may appear between Community law and a law which has been voted for after due consideration by the population of a Member State."
"These contradictions are very serious, they are still unresolved and this is why we see the existence of Article 228, which was brought in by the Maastricht Treaty, as wholly contestable."
"I should like in particular to point out that France is now liable to incur severe penalties through the 1998 law, concerning, for example, hunting seasons which contradict Community law, the embargo on British beef and the conflict which, Mr President, is in the process of arising, relating to the patenting of human genes which authorises a European directive that contradicts French law."
"This is why we absolutely cannot accept this report."
"It is a question of respecting national sovereignty."
"(FR) I am pleased that the proposed resolution contained in the report, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, on monitoring the application of Community law in 1998, which I presented as rapporteur, was adopted in plenary in Strasbourg."
"In doing so, the European Parliament sends a positive signal to Europe' s citizens, who have the right to expect a high level of protection through Community law."
"This Assembly has also demonstrated its vigilance faced with the difficulties of application that exist in several Member States and in many spheres of activity."
"It has remembered the importance of the infringement procedure, which must not become subject to opportune reform by the Commission."
"It has highlighted the position of the preliminary question in the European system and the need to step up training in Community law within the Member States."
"While nobody would deny the importance of petitions, I did not wish to go along with the amendments tabled by the members of the Committee on Petitions, in particular the request to set up a 'European administrative law' ."
"Account must be taken of the current state of progress in the construction of Europe and of the principle of subsidiarity."
"I should stress, however, that the intention is to ask the Commission to intensify its relations with national administrations when there is a problem, in order that it can be resolved beforehand."
"Taken as a whole, the resolution adopted serves to improve transparency and effectiveness, which is to the benefit of Europe' s citizens."
"The Minutes of this session will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the start of the next part-session, if there is no objection."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 noon)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 16 June 2000."
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great sadness that we learnt, last Tuesday, of the death of President Pierre Pflimlin, the former President of the European Parliament."
"Pierre Pflimlin was a true statesman."
"His career in public office began immediately following the war and took him to the offices of Council President and Head of Government in 1958 at a time when France was experiencing one of the most unsettled periods of its history, when he eased the transition period with General de Gaulle."
"He played an active part in framing the constitution of the Fifth Republic and became a government minister, holding this position until 1962."
"Pierre Pflimlin belonged to that historic generation of Europeans who, since the end of the war, as a member of parliament, a minister and a political activist, was at the forefront of all the efforts to build a strong and reunited Europe."
"As an native of Alsace and of Strasbourg and a friend and comrade of Robert Schuman, he was one of the most ardent proponents of reconciliation between France and Germany, and a powerful symbol of French-German friendship."
"He saw this reconciliation that he had worked so hard to achieve, as he confided to the Bishop of Strasbourg, as an absolute miracle."
"He knew, nonetheless, that this miracle was not a random event, but rather the outcome of proactive and constructive commitment, based on common objectives and efficient institutions."
"In 1959, Pierre Pflimlin joined the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and in 1963 began a three-year term as President."
"Around the same time he became a Member of the European Parliament (1962-1967) before returning in 1979 at the first elections by universal suffrage."
"He was elected First Vice-President in 1982 and was President from 1984 to 1987."
"During his presidency, the European Parliament established a key role for itself, especially in its budgetary capacity, and increased its standing in Europe and internationally, since Pierre Pflimlin had the honour of welcoming to Parliament the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, and other distinguished guests."
"With reference to Altiero Spinelli' s Draft Treaty establishing the European Union, he strenuously urged treaty reform by the Single European Act, while at the same time decrying its shortcomings in terms of the inadequate powers accorded the European Parliament."
"He committed Parliament to taking advantage of his friendly rapport with Commission President Jacques Delors, advocating tripartite meetings with the Council and the Commission, an early form of conciliation."
"For Pierre Pflimlin was also a man of dialogue."
"Confident in his choices, he respected the opinions of his political opponents, and always put the higher interests of Europe before ideological considerations."
"Strasbourg, where he was mayor for twenty four years, represented for him the symbol of this opening up, the visible sign of French-German reconciliation and a sign of hope and confidence in the future of Europe."
"He therefore put a great deal of sincere effort into developing his city and its role as European capital, creating real estate infrastructures and developing a genuine policy of welcoming visitors."
"Pierre Pflimlin left the European Parliament in 1989, but for many Europeans, especially young people, he remained an authoritative voice, someone who could generate enthusiasm for the political objective of building Europe."
"Until the end President Pflimlin impressed us with the vigour and clarity of his message, which is still highly relevant to us all."
"Let me once again, on behalf of the European Parliament, express our deepest sympathy to the family of Pierre Pflimlin, especially his daughter who is attending our sitting at this very moment."
"It was under Pierre Pflimlin' s presidency, in 1986, that the European flag and anthem were adopted as symbols of the European Union."
"I shall therefore ask you to please agree to rise while we play the European anthem in memory of President Pflimlin."
"(The House rose and the European anthem was played)"
"Statement by the President"
"Several days ago, ladies and gentlemen, 58 illegal immigrants tragically died in a lorry at the British border."
"This was on 18 June."
"The tragic deaths of these men and women who, like the two young Guinean men who died last year in the landing gear of a European plane, were investing their every hope in Europe, cannot fail to move us deeply."
"Every one of us was, I am sure, outraged at this tragedy, and I am sure that we are all agreed that the European Union should step up its fight against this sort of modern-day slavery."
"We must take every possible action to dismantle this 'industry' dealing in death."
"The European Union must respond immediately, encompassing a genuine common immigration policy as well as the redefinition of North-South relations, involving aid to economic development and access to know-how as a priority."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam has been in force for one year and the European Council at Tampere was held six months ago."
"The legal bases for action are in place. All we need is genuine political will."
"Action must be taken now."
"This is why the Council Presidency and the European Commission will, at your request, be discussing this matter before Parliament tomorrow afternoon."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, on a point of order, I have here a report which appeared in the British newspaper The Independent concerning a meeting which appears to have taken place between yourself and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II."
"According to this report, you left the meeting and then briefed the press on Her Majesty's political opinions."
"This has caused a certain amount of concern and distress in political circles in the UK, because as, I am sure you know, the protocol of such meetings is that they are private and should not be commented on."
"I would like to give you this opportunity to let us know what you understood the protocol of that meeting to be, and perhaps also to clarify what you said to the press afterwards."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that I gave no such press conference after leaving my meeting with Her Majesty."
"I can, however, tell you that the euro was the focus of all my discussions with the authorities I met, and that they all showed great interest in this question."
"I am quite inclined to tell you the whole story of my visit to the United Kingdom because, unfortunately, there were other aspects which, I am sorry to say, the British press did not cover, particularly the visit to a British farm which I was keen to make in order to fulfil a promise I had made."
"While I am on this subject, I have to tell you that the British beef I tasted was truly delicious."
"Madam President, yesterday, at the Euro 2000 final between France and Italy, an unfortunate and extremely serious incident occurred. As some disabled people entered the Rotterdam stadium, they were searched and subjected to a series of humiliating manoeuvres by the security guards."
"This situation caused some Italian cameramen to film the treatment of the disabled people."
"As a result, a considerable number of journalists were attacked and beaten up by the police, and pictures of this scene were transmitted by all the television companies."
"Some of the journalists were arrested simply because they were doing their duty."
"I believe that the Rotterdam police were not acting on higher orders."
"Indeed, I am convinced that the Dutch Government and the heads of the Dutch forces of law and order have disclaimed any association with the actions of the police, but I certainly believe that the treatment reserved for these European disabled people who are Italian and therefore European citizens and some Italian journalists who were lawfully carrying out their duty of reporting incidents should be strongly condemned by Parliament and, moreover, the other European institutions as well."
"I would also like to declare my disapproval on another matter in which you have taken a great interest, Madam President: the sentence passed on the 13 Iranian Jews who were sentenced to flogging a few days ago."
"Fortunately, they were not sentenced to death, and that may be due to the intervention of Parliament which monitored the proceedings to ensure that the defendants received a fair trial in Iran."
"At the dawn of the third millennium, more or less regular trials are still ending with the sentence of corporal punishment, and this does not seem worthy of either democracy or the civilisation of the third millennium."
"In my opinion, whatever crime a person may have committed, it is uncivilised to sentence them to flogging."
"I therefore call once again upon Parliament, the Council and the Commission to ensure that this Iranian Jewish minority is not subjected to further oppression at the Court of Appeal, for a certain element is already rejoicing that the Jews have been found guilty."
"Anti-Semitism must cease to be part of the history of the European Union and the world, for the Jewish people have already suffered far too much."
"Thank you, Mr Tajani."
"As to the first point that you raise, clearly this is a truly shocking incident and I shall look into the most appropriate way of notifying the Dutch authorities of your legitimate protest."
"As to your second question, on the sentencing of these Iranian Jews, I totally agree with your analysis of the situation."
"The best thing would, perhaps, be for me to write to the President of the Republic of Iran to request that these thirteen people be pardoned, but I shall do so only if the sentence is upheld by the Court of Appeal."
"I see that you agree to this suggestion."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, I would like to start by thanking you for the way that, during this initial stage, you take on board all our questions and follow them up with great care."
"I would therefore like to thank you for your work."
"As far as the Rotterdam incidents are concerned, I am in complete agreement with Mr Tajani."
"Indeed, these were serious incidents which we would have not have thought possible, an affront to the freedom of the press as well to disabled people for the journalists were detained for several hours on no grounds at all."
"In connection with these events, I would like to give you advance notice of our proposal, which we will expand in detail later on, to include a point referring to the said incidents in the topical and urgent questions on hooliganism."
"This will give Parliament the opportunity to express a considered, responsible opinion on the matter."
"I therefore call upon the Members to support this point when we vote on the topical and urgent subjects, for this will allow Parliament to express an opinion as it has a duty to do."
"Madam President, precisely because the actions of the Dutch police have been called into the question, I would just like to protest about actions against Jews and corporal punishment etc., being mentioned in the same breath as the routine inspection undertaken by the Dutch police, who, following a request from a number of disabled Italian spectators at the match, endeavoured to push teams from Italian television aside."
"When this attempt failed, these people were indeed detained by the police."
"Moreover, I have to tell you that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands himself, and anyone else who was involved had nothing but praise for the way in which the Dutch police, along with the police from other Member States who were in attendance, defended public order."
"I think this accusation is completely uncalled for, however much I, along with certain others, would have been only too pleased to see Italy win."
"Madam President, contrary to the first speaker I should like to ask you to make our position very clear on the following point."
"On Friday, a bill was put before the Yugoslav parliament - a draft so-called anti-riot act - which is essentially targeted at the country's young people, more and more of whom are mobilising against Milosevic."
"This bill has not yet been adopted."
"I should like to ask you, Madam President, and of course also the Council and the Commission, to do all you can to prevent a bill of this kind from being adopted."
"I do not know whether we will be able to influence the Yugoslav authorities or parliament, but the young people of Yugoslavia ought to know that we are on their side."
"Mr Swoboda, I willingly take note of your statement and your request."
"Madam President, I did not see the incident with regard to the handicapped or disabled people going into the stadium yesterday, or the supposed fracas with the Italian journalists."
"However, I was in Rotterdam all day yesterday, from early morning until late last night and I was at the final."
"I pass on my praise to the French, Italian, Dutch and many other fans who travelled from all over Europe to watch that final."
"I also pass on my praise to the Dutch police for the way they conducted themselves, and to the people of Rotterdam."
"It was an excellent day out in Rotterdam."
"It was one of the best football matches I have ever attended."
"The atmosphere was anything but hostile."
"It was one of the best atmospheres I have experienced at a cup final."
"On the point that Mr Helmer raised, can he join with me in congratulating Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on supporting the euro?"
"I was in Rotterdam myself, in the spirit of complete impartiality necessitated by my position as President of the European Parliament, and I can confirm that the atmosphere was indeed as you describe."
"Even so, we shall, nonetheless, look into the incident reported by Mr Tajani and Mrs Napoletano."
"You can count on me to proceed with the requisite diplomacy."
"I believe that we must look into this matter since it involved disabled people, making the incident much more serious."
"Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to yesterday' s elections in Mexico."
"There has been a change of power there."
"A new president has been elected in Mexico, as well as a new House of Representatives and a new Senate."
"The so-called institutional revolution, which lasted seventy years, has ended."
"I would ask you to send greetings to the new president."
"We can certainly all be happy about this change of power, because no revolution can last seventy years."
"Madam President, I think that what is missing is a comment on the football match between Italy and France."
"The reason why it all went so well was that Swedes and Danes were in charge of the match, so I think we should thank the referees and linesmen for their considerable efforts."
"Thank you, Mr Blak."
"So, yes, the referees, like both teams indeed, were excellent."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the examination of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Relating to Thursday: Relating to Thursday, and the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have received a number of requests for amendments to the agenda."
"Firstly, a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to remove item 1, ""Fiji and the Solomon Islands"" ."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago there was a coup in Fiji."
"Hostages were taken in the coup, and the press and politicians the world over have taken a stance on this."
"Now it is over: negotiations have been held, the hostages have been freed and the coup has been over for some time."
"I wonder what further urgent comments the European Parliament should now have to make on this."
"In my view this contravenes Rule 50 and Annex III of our Rules of Procedure."
"That is why we are requesting the deletion of this item from the list of topical and urgent subjects."
"Madam President, it is clearly true that there have been developments this weekend but it is too soon to tell what they will amount to."
"There is considerable doubt as to whether these developments will result in the restoration of full constitutional government in Fiji, so this issue still remains highly important and of topical interest."
"The Indo-Fijians, the Indian population of Fiji, are in considerable danger."
"There has been lawlessness, damage to property, and cases of assault and rape without any intervention by the security forces in recent weeks."
"I have had representations to the effect that people are looking to the European Union for some kind of effective action, possibly - and this could be debated in the context of the resolution - some kind of sanctions under the Lomé Convention."
"I do not want to debate the content now but I do want to ask that this be maintained on the agenda, because after what has happened over the weekend, there is still a risk of considerable discrimination against one ethnic group in Fiji."
"There is no confidence that the constitution will be applied properly and will be observed."
"I do not agree that what has happened reduces the topical importance of the issue."
"(Parliament rejected the request) President."
"I now come to another request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, this time to remove the following item, ""Tibet"" ."
"Madam President, once again it is not the content of a motion for a resolution that is at issue here but our Rules of Procedure."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy we have been trying to ensure - and I appeal to all those colleagues who have been involved in this initiative - that important issues of this kind are not dealt with in the topical and urgent debate; instead we want to ensure that proper treatment is reserved for them in the form of a committee procedure, an oral question or a Council statement."
"Here the issue is Tibet."
"We know how important this is."
"In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet."
"A motion reflecting the report's conclusions was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament."
"On 15 April here in this House we unanimously adopted a resolution on Tibet, and now we are repeating what we said on 15 April, perhaps with one or two minor additions."
"I do not believe that Parliament's reputation is enhanced by our constantly debating the same subjects."
"That is why we are requesting that this item be withdrawn."
"Madam President, Tibet is an issue which is on our agenda year after year after year, and to that extent I understand the point that the honourable Member has made."
"We have adopted resolutions on this subject time and time again."
"It is a country that is illegally occupied by China and its people are oppressed by that regime."
"It is an urgent issue because in recent months we have seen various measures being taken by the Chinese government to move people into the area of Tibet and to exploit the natural resources there."
"These measures were initially supported by the World Bank, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom."
"Now that the pressure has been put on, Germany and the United States have withdrawn their support."
"The World Bank is withdrawing support but it has not yet said so publicly."
"It is urgent that we put pressure on them to withdraw support for these measures so that this Parliament can stand up for the people of Tibet, stand up for democracy, stand up for the stopping of what is an illegal act in international law."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"President."
"Still on the subject of topical and urgent debate, regarding the ""Human rights"" section, I have received three requests to replace the sub-item on ""Hooliganism"" : a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to replace this item with a new sub-item entitled ""Outbreaks of racism in Germany and the killing of Alberto Adriano"" , a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to replace this sub-item by one entitled ""Incidents at the Rotterdam football stadium"" , and a request from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to replace this sub-item by one entitled ""Desecration of Prague' s oldest Jewish cemetery"" ."
"We shall examine each of these requests in turn."
"Madam President, the persecution on racist grounds of people in eastern Germany by their fellow human beings is becoming an increasingly serious issue."
"It is an old and yet highly topical matter."
"I mention this for Mr Sakellariou's sake, because just this weekend in Neissen people were once again persecuted simply because they speak a different language and because their skin is a different colour."
"We must not allow this in Europe, and it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, for the European Parliament to support the forces of reason - which are growing weaker - in their efforts in eastern Germany to combat these racist tendencies and take action against neo-Nazis who want to create no-go areas for foreigners."
"That is the background to this motion; the idea is that we state clearly that Europe has a vocation to be a multicultural Europe and that Europe supports all democratic forces battling against racism and neo-Nazism."
"It is with this in mind that I ask you to support our request."
"(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance) President."
"We shall now move on to the second request, which is from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we replace the sub-item on ""Hooliganism"" with another sub-item entitled: ""Incidents at the Rotterdam football stadium"" ."
"In my opinion, on the subject of topical and urgent debates, as we have often found, it is not a matter of the extent to which we agree or whether to deal with this or that subject but of how to deal with it, and it sometimes happens that some of us consider that certain debates or resolutions should be dealt with in a more appropriate context, so to speak."
"However, in this case, the matter is truly urgent pursuant to the Rules of Procedure because it happened yesterday, and I therefore feel that in treating it as such Parliament is being faithful to the intention behind the relevant provision of the Rules of Procedure, that is to deal with topical matters."
"I feel that in holding a topical and urgent debate on this matter we would be acting upon our discussion earlier this morning, which you agreed to champion, Madam President."
"We are all here and there is nothing to stop us, and in this way we will show all those countries against whom we often have to deliver opinions that we will not hold back on matters requiring thorough investigation such as discrimination against the disabled or where journalists are prevented from doing their job, and that we will not hesitate to investigate these incidents even when they occur within our Community."
"I imagine that none of the Dutch Members of any of the political groups will object if we decide to investigate the matter thoroughly, for there is no doubt in any of our minds that the incident was not in any way motivated by political will, but this is the very reason why we must prevent such incidents from occurring."
"This is our opportunity to do so."
"Madam President, that makes perfect sense to me, given that you have already promised to make inquiries in your famously discreet manner, and we are not going to entertain the idea of having a debate and a resolution on urgent subjects just because of some cock-and-bull stories."
"It seems to me to be obvious that we should await the outcome of your mission."
"(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists)"
"Madam President, I would like to make a suggestion and ask the Members whether this resolution on hooliganism will also deal with the incidents which occurred at the Rotterdam stadium. You can put it to the vote if need be."
"I am sure that it would be possible to include the matter and we could also decide to instruct the negotiators to take it into account."
"I feel this is a reasonable suggestion, for if we do not make an effort to act in some way we would certainly be guilty of reluctance to do our duty. I would find this totally unacceptable."
"Madame Napoletano, I do not think that I need to put this proposal to the vote."
"Everyone has heard the suggestion."
"When we come to framing the resolutions, we will all remember your suggestion and bear it in mind."
"Finally the third request, which is from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to replace the sub-item on ""Hooliganism"" with a new sub-item entitled ""Desecration of Prague' s oldest Jewish cemetery"" ."
"Madam President, our group believes it would indeed be more useful to concentrate on the matter of Prague and Czechoslovakia instead of hooliganism, because the foundations of the oldest Jewish cemetery were uncovered during the construction of an underground car park."
"The coffins were then dug up and removed from the cemetery completely without ceremony."
"Despite the Czech government' s promises to find an alternative site for the underground car park and to duly respect the cemetery as an historic monument, and despite the protests issued by various embassies, the construction work continued."
"Our group feels that it must be made clear to candidate countries such as the Czech Republic that the European Union insists on respect being shown for fundamental rights such as freedom of worship and philosophy of life."
"I think that now would be the ideal time for the European Parliament to issue a statement to this effect."
"(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party)"
"Madam President, we have just decided to retain the hooliganism motion on the agenda for the debate on topical and urgent subjects."
"I should like to make a particular request to the translation service and indeed those who are speaking to the motion: one of the football teams with which some hooliganism was associated was the team representing England."
"The Member State which has responsibility for that question is the United Kingdom."
"But it is very important in this matter to draw a distinction between Britain - as the state which has overall responsibility - and one of its parts, namely England."
"This is all the more important given the known intention of the Scottish Football Association to apply to host the next European Cup but one."
"I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to remove the sub-item on Iraq."
"Madam President, I will not tire of appealing to the consciences of my colleagues."
"We, and other Members, in particular the coordinators of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have established that the matters which we select for consideration in the topical and urgent debate are not always very appropriate."
"This also applies here, to Iraq."
"Three months ago, at the April plenary part-session, we adopted a resolution in which we say everything that it is possible for us to say about Iraq."
"All the issues are covered."
"I have carefully read the new motions for resolutions which have been tabled, but they do not contain anything new."
"Nevertheless, this is to be included as a topical and urgent motion because one group, which has travelled to Iraq of its own accord, now has to submit this motion for a resolution."
"I think that this would be wrong and irresponsible of Parliament, and that is why we are asking for this item to be withdrawn."
"(Parliament rejected the request) President."
"We now have a request to replace the item on Venezuela with a new item entitled ""Colombia and the international conference of donor countries in Madrid"" ."
"Madam President, there is to be an international conference on 7 July on the ""Colombia Plan"" which is to bring donor countries together, in the context of the aid plan for that country, also known as the ""Marshall Plan"" ."
"At the present time there are two different strategies on the table as regards such aid."
"One is a strategy from America aiming to increase police repression."
"Personally, and I think I may speak on behalf of my Group, we feel this approach is doomed to failure."
"Indeed this has already been demonstrated on several occasions."
"The other strategy, from Europe, which is intended to effect changes in culture, and which therefore represents a more preventative method, is, we think, a better solution and alternative policy."
"In any event, we think it important that the European Parliament should express its opinion on the subject in the few days before this conference."
"Madam President, I do not wish to speak against the proposal because I am in complete agreement with what my friend and fellow Member, Paul Lannoye, has just said."
"I do, however, deplore the fact that this proposal is set to replace a resolution on Venezuela which is the follow up to a visit to that country by an official delegation from the European Parliament following the serious floods which devastated that country, especially as we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter since then."
"I shall personally, therefore, abstain from voting on the proposal, though unwillingly."
"I would much rather the proposal had not been made, even though I do agree completely with Paul Lannoye' s argument."
"(Parliament rejected the request) President."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the item on ""Venezuela"" be replaced by a new point on ""Temelin"" ."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our hats are on fire as we say in Austria, but unfortunately the very fact that this is a burning issue means that there is no time for joking."
"The nuclear power station in Temelin is being commissioned earlier than was agreed or was expected, and it is not intended to carry out the environmental impact assessment until some time after the fuel elements have been installed, making it a pointless exercise."
"This is also happening against the wishes of the Czech Environment Minister, against the wishes of a large part of the Czech population and in spite of an urgent request from the German and Austrian Environment Ministers for detailed information on the safety arrangements."
"Obviously, the Czech Republic still has more time to implement the acquis communautaire in full, but people might well have doubts about whether the Czech Republic is willing even now to start taking on board these aspects of European policy which are of fundamental importance for its citizens and for environment policy."
"There is no need for me to describe the concerns felt by those living in the adjoining areas."
"The whole thing could happen as early as next week."
"I think that the European Parliament also ought to speak out on this."
"I am rather torn."
"I am Austrian and yet as a European from the adjoining area I obviously also wish us to proceed together on this."
"Madam President, this is a point of order."
"This absurd debate demonstrates that a Provan report on urgent procedures would be welcome, because the Prime Minister of Portugal has been waiting an hour for us to finish."
"I do not understand how a political group in this House can table two motions to replace a point on the agenda."
"I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure this is based on."
"I would be grateful if you could explain this to me, Madam President."
"Mr Barón Crespo, this is perfectly permissible under the Rules of Procedure."
"Having said that, you have just expressed out loud what many people were thinking to themselves."
"We must apologise to Mr Guterres, and I must thank you for urging our fellow Members to be much briefer."
"(Parliament rejected the request) I am sorry, but the Conference of Presidents proposed only four subjects."
"I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to add a new item on the ""European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia"" ."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely why we wanted to withdraw a number of items."
"We wanted to have fewer overall."
"But I will be brief."
"As you know, the Monitoring Centre is in Vienna."
"Some time ago there were difficulties there between the government and the Director of this Monitoring Centre and also the Austrian representative."
"Now it appears that the difficulties are being resolved and that better relations are once again being established."
"Nevertheless, I believe that this House ought to call on all governments - the Austrian Government and the other governments - to ensure that the Monitoring Centre is in fact able to operate effectively and to support it in its work."
"That is why we should like to add this item."
"Madam President, I request that this is not taken as a topical and urgent motion."
"The matter is potentially a very serious one, involving perhaps a breach of Article 10 of the Treaties, and I believe it requires more serious consideration than can be given to a topical and urgent motion on a Thursday afternoon."
"This matter has been drawn to the attention of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, which I have the honour to chair."
"We have received the opinion of the Director of the Monitoring Centre on the matter, we have asked our budget rapporteur to investigate more widely the question of the Austrian government's attitude to the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"We need to know the full facts regarding the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian member of the Centre's Executive Board."
"It may be that we need to refer the matter to the Group of Three Wise Persons charged with investigating the situation in Austria."
"But a topical and urgent motion would shed more heat than light on the matter, and seems to me to be an inappropriate vehicle."
"Therefore I would appeal to Members to vote against this request."
"(Parliament gave its assent) The other two requests therefore lapse, and there are no further requests for amendments to the agenda."
"(The order of business was adopted thus amended)"
"European Council/Portuguese presidency"
"The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and the Commission statement on the European Council meeting at Feira and the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council regarding the Portuguese Presidency."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I now give the floor to Mr Patten to speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by associating myself, as the Prime Minister has just done, with your moving tribute to President Pflimlin."
"I am sure that we all agreed with everything you said about his role as one of the architects of Europe and of democratic accountability in Europe."
"Can I also say that it is a privilege to follow that characteristically eloquent and politically perceptive speech."
"Before saying a few words myself about the recent European Council in Feira which I attended with President Prodi, who is not with us this afternoon because he is attending a meeting in Paris with the new presidency, I would like, on behalf of all my colleagues in the Commission, to pay tribute to the hard work, skill and energy that the Portuguese government has devoted over the last six months to the presidency of the Council."
"This ensured the success not only of the Lisbon and Feira summits, but of the day-to-day work behind the scenes that is vital in carrying Europe towards its ambitious goals."
"I would just like to add that it was a great pleasure working with the team of Portuguese ministers, as well as an extremely rewarding experience. We recognise how many of them, like the secretary of state, worked at a spectacular rate which would certainly have got them the man-of-the-match award during a number of the 90-minute matches of the last few weeks."
"The European Council on 19 and 20 June was a very valuable meeting of important consolidation."
"The agenda was very broad and I simply want to focus on what seemed to the Commission to be some of the most important highlights."
"First the heads of state and government confirmed that Greece meets the necessary conditions to enter the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"Greece will join the euro zone from 1 January next year which I hope will send messages to one or two other countries, including the one I know best."
"(Applause)"
"I notice that Mr Helmer is not here to join in the applause."
"(Laughter)"
"Second, the European Council took stock of the progress made in implementing the economic and social agenda adopted at Lisbon."
"The Council gave, as the Prime Minister said, renewed encouragement to the work that has already been begun, particularly on the e-Europe action plan, research and enterprise policy and the extremely important subject of social inclusion."
"In September the Commission will submit its proposals for indicators that will allow us to measure how well we are performing in meeting the goals set at Lisbon."
"These indicators can then be used as the basis for the synthesis report to the European Council in spring next year."
"Thirdly, some progress was achieved on completing the internal market."
"In particular Europe's energy markets are to be further liberalised and air transport will be made more efficient by creating what has come to be called a single European sky."
"Fourth, the Council welcomed the broad economic guidelines for 2000 and recommended their adoption by the Council."
"These guidelines reflect the need to sustain growth and to continue pursuing macro-economic policies that promote stability."
"The guidelines lay particular emphasis on the quality and sustainability of public finances and the need to continue reforming Europe's product, capital and labour markets."
"The Council restated its commitment to carrying through reforms that are essential to enable Europe to become a truly knowledge-based economy."
"During the Feira meeting we were shocked, as you said Madam President, by the news of the tragic death of 58 illegal immigrants hidden in a truck in Dover."
"The European Council issued a strong condemnation of this traffic in human beings and the Council renewed its commitment to Europe-wide action against the criminals involved in such activities."
"The tragedy at Dover underlines Europe's urgent need for a common immigration and asylum policy; a point that I notice much of the media -including in the country I know best - has been making."
"The Commission will be putting forward proposals on these matters before the end of the year."
"Trafficking in human beings is a serious international crime that no one government can tackle single-handedly."
"There has to be a common European definition of the crime and vigorous cross-border cooperation to ensure that those who perpetrate it are caught and are punished."
"Our citizens expect no less than that, and we must live up to their expectations."
"Our citizens also expect swift and positive action on food safety, especially in the wake of last year's food scandals."
"The Commission has been working energetically in this area."
"The European Council expressed strong support for what we are doing."
"The Council committed itself to making progress on setting up an independent food-safety authority, as soon as Parliament has delivered its opinion."
"I am confident that this opinion will be given by the first October part-session at the latest."
"At Feira a last minute breakthrough was achieved on the tax package - a lot of midnight oil and quite a lot of breakfast went into that successful outcome."
"This complex agreement involves the directive on the taxation of savings."
"Before the directive is adopted, discussions will be held with the United States and key third countries, such as Switzerland, in which we hope to promote the adoption of equivalent measures internationally."
"Meanwhile the coexistence model will continue, with European Union countries either exchanging information or levying a withholding tax themselves."
"The directive should be adopted by unanimity no later than 31 December 2002."
"Agreement on this, as honourable Members will recognise, was not easy, especially for Member States that have a strong tradition of banking secrecy."
"We welcome the positive outcome."
"In the areas for which I have some responsibility, there were also, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, some important developments at Feira."
"We took stock of the European Union's relations with Russia and the situation there, including in Chechnya, in the light of the recent EU-Russia Summit, which I think was regarded as fairly successful."
"It is too early to judge President Putin's economic programme; however, our basic message is that a sound programme will be vital to boost investor confidence."
"On Chechnya, there have, it is true, been some recent moderately positive developments in response to international and European Union pressure: for example the recent ECHO mission was able to take place and western humanitarian agencies have greater access to the area."
"The conflict nevertheless continues and we still have considerable concerns."
"In particular, we want to see much greater access for humanitarian aid agencies."
"We want to see genuinely independent investigation into reports of human rights abuses, and we want to see a real dialogue between the Russian government and the Chechens."
"I welcome the adoption of the common strategy on the Mediterranean."
"The presidency should take particular credit for driving that through."
"It will help our efforts to strengthen the Barcelona process."
"The Commission will be presenting proposals to reinvigorate the process later this month."
"The Mediterranean Strategy is global, covering all countries in the region and including the consolidation of peace in the Middle East."
"After years of conflict and tension in the Middle East, the time is clearly ripe for peace."
"We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon."
"Our expert mission has returned from South Lebanon and we are considering what we can do to help rehabilitation in the area."
"At Feira, Javier Solana and I presented a follow-up report outlining what had been achieved in the western Balkans since Lisbon."
"The Prime Minister again referred to the importance of that."
"The key challenges for the month ahead will be continued support to Montenegro, the strengthening of the Serbian civil society and the Serbian media, support of the Kosovo elections and to UNMIK and support for regional integration."
"I was in Kosovo again last week for what was my fourth visit and I also visited the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on Friday."
"I saw once again the challenge we face, but also the impact that we can have when we work together."
"I just want to add a couple of points."
"First of all we were enormously grateful to the delegation from Parliament that went recently to Kosovo and was able to confirm that our team there is doing a good job and that there is not an absorption capacity problem as far as the assistance is concerned."
"I hope that the Council and Parliament will support the proposals we have put forward for a new regulation to govern our financial assistance to the Balkans."
"If we want to speed things up, then it is important to speed up the consideration of things like our new financial regulation."
"I hope that we can also expect strong support for the proposals that we have put forward for asymmetric autonomous trade measures for the region."
"It is very important if we want those countries to trade more together that we should give them greater access to our own market here."
"That would give them the best sort of assistance in the months and years ahead."
"Before I conclude, I would like to say something briefly about the EU-India Summit."
"That summit was entirely a consequence of the initiative taken by the Portuguese presidency last autumn, although I know that there are many Members of this House like Mr Dupuis who have been active proponents of a closer dialogue with India for many years."
"We have sometimes, in the Union, underestimated the importance of India and underestimated the importance of developing our economic and political relationship with it. India is the greatest democracy in the world."
"At every election, more people vote than in the European Union, the United States and Canada put together."
"It is a democracy which shares many of our values and had a tradition of political tolerance when we still believed in the divine right of kings."
"What we managed to achieve at the meeting last week in Lisbon was an important step forward."
"I hope that in the new year we will be able to start the round table meetings with representatives of civil society in India."
"I hope that we will be able to inaugurate the think-tank network with India and that will see a further development and strengthening of our relationship with that extraordinary and important country."
"To conclude, the Feira Council crowned an extremely successful Portuguese presidency."
"Above all it laid the foundations for a number of important decisions which will have to be taken later this year at least."
"The Prime Minister mentioned some of the constitutional discussions that we have started to have in the European Union."
"I am tempted to follow him down some of those highways and byways."
"But perhaps I should leave that for the time being to my elders and betters, although I promise not to take a vow of omertà on the subject."
"Obviously we need to have some important political debates."
"The German Foreign Minister, albeit speaking in a personal capacity, made a speech which breached the dam and all sorts of remarks and arguments are now flooding through."
"I have always believed it is better in politics to talk about important things rather than sweep them under the carpet."
"I am sure we will be doing that in the next few months although it is important for us to concentrate on the real priorities for the IGC before Nice."
"We wish the Presidency of the French Republic every success in carrying the process forward."
"I very much hope that they will have as much success as the Portuguese Presidency."
"I am sure they will be as engaging to work with."
"(Applause)"
"- (PT) Prime Minister, I hope you understand, as a former Parliamentarian yourself, that in Parliament it is on political issues that we should focus our debate."
"There are at least two questions that I wish to ask you with regard to your speech."
"First of all, I was surprised to hear you criticise what you called 'a shift towards an intergovernmental approach' , because, if one thing has occurred in the six months of the Portuguese Presidency, it is that the Council has actually become stronger at the expense of the Commission and Parliament. This was also clear from your words when you described the Employment Summit as 'showing a strong desire for political leadership of the Union' , demonstrating that, in fact, you see this as leadership by the Council at the expense of the other two institutions."
"It is therefore worth tempering words and intentions with reality."
"If we look at the most uncomfortable issue of the last six months, which I admit you would not really want to discuss here, that is, the Austrian question, we see the extent of the shift in recent months."
"There are aspects of the Austrian question that are very dangerous for the future of the Union."
"The impasse in which the Union found itself at the Feira Council shows exactly why this shift is so dangerous."
"First of all, it replaced the principle of collegiality in Union decisions with a greater emphasis on bilateral action between Governments."
"If anyone should never have acted as spokesperson for the Fourteen, it was you, as President of the European Union."
"You should never, under any circumstances, have acted as spokesperson, even if you felt that Portugal should agree to the sanctions against Austria. As a result of your action, the Austrian question has become a European Union issue."
"From the institutional point of view, this issue will clearly taint the European Union' s internal relations unless it is quickly resolved. We all know that in order not to lose face, the basis of a resolution has already been negotiated."
"This basis of a resolution, however, is a sign of weakness: weakness, essentially, on the part of the Fourteen countries that have taken a political initiative and do not know how to get out of it."
"In contemporary politics, the trend towards handing political decisions to experts and judges shows just how weak politicians are."
"These sanctions originated from a political measure and the same people who initiated them should have had the courage to take the decision to lift them. This should have been done at Feira."
"As to the Intergovernmental Conference, unfortunately I do not have much speaking time left, but I must say that dangerous trends are being followed there too."
"I am not against closer cooperation, but it must be made quite clear that closer cooperation falls within the area of the Union' s sectoral policies and is not an institutional or political matter."
"Otherwise, at some point in the future, we will have two European Unions, a first- and a second-class Union. This situation would put an end to what has been the driving force of the European Union and the European Community since the Second World War."
"Closer cooperation must therefore not lead to a two-speed Europe. Instead, it must enable whoever wants to do so to move forward more quickly in terms of sectoral policies, but not in terms of the institutions, or else we will risk splitting the Union."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to echo our President' s tribute to President Pfimlin, who, as well as being a predecessor of mine and a great friend, was the person who welcomed the Spanish and Portuguese MEPs when we arrived in this House, precisely because we had built a community of values in our countries of the type we are now trying to strengthen."
"I believe that this is an essential point because the Prime Minister of Portugal, over recent months, has indicated that he is firmly committed to defending these common values."
"Prime Minister Guterres has paid Parliament a compliment by saying that relations with us have been good over this six-month term."
"I would like to return this compliment because, during my years of experience in this House, I had never known a Prime Minister to appear three times during a Presidency, but he has done just that."
"By showing this courtesy, the Portuguese Presidency has taken a significant step."
"I am not just pleased that he has come here, but also that there have been two issues fundamental to this Parliament on which he has helped us positively and demonstrated his political sensitivity."
"I am referring to the Statute of MEPs, on which the Portuguese Presidency has continued the work started by the Finnish Presidency, and the Statute of the political parties."
"The high point of the Portuguese Presidency was undoubtedly the Lisbon Summit, and furthermore I am happy that Prime Minister Guterres has indicated this in speaking of the knowledge society, because I believe that this is the key to the European Union' s investment in the future."
"In relation to the Lisbon Summit I would like to highlight the importance which my group attaches to the triangle of employment, social cohesion and competitiveness, which is absolutely essential to us, and which is already part, not only of the Portuguese Presidency' s plans, but also of our policies, and which has been strengthened in Feira."
"I would like to highlight the importance of the agreement which has been reached on taxation, because the European Union cannot make progress in the social field if the increasing discrepancy between employment incomes and capital incomes persists."
"In this respect we cannot invoke banking secrecy."
"If we are to progress in a serious and socially just way, it is very important that we take the step of dealing with all these incomes jointly, and, furthermore, I believe that this is a good first step in relation to the process of globalisation."
"Another fundamental point is the progress in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Portuguese Presidency began this, took it forward up until Feira and responded positively to the European Parliament' s suggestion to broaden the agenda, not only in relation to our requests but also to the Council' s compromises."
"I would like to point out firstly that, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, although it has still not been included, an important step has been made in that direction."
"There is something else, and in this regard I do not believe that President Guterres is going to criticise his Secretary of State. Last week, in different articles, I and the Secretary of State himself, both said that the method by which the convention was proceeding, that is to say, with the active participation of European and national parliaments, representatives of the governments and the Commission, is much better than Intergovernmental Conferences behind closed doors."
"I hope that Mr Seixas da Costa' s personal opinion can be endorsed by the out-going President of the Council, because I believe that would be very positive."
"Secondly, in relation to the debate on federalism and constitution, which fortunately has woken the issue of Europe from its lethargy, I would like to point out that it is not an academic or an ex novo debate, and that it must be held while respecting, and on the basis of, the current institutional balance."
"I agree with the challenge set by President Guterres when he said that we have to talk about federalism in all areas."
"Fine."
"The problem is that we have monetary federalism, but we still do not have economic federalism, when we need to defend the euro and defend it seriously."
"Madam President, I would like to make a final observation in relation to an important decision taken by the Portuguese Presidency bilaterally with thirteen governments."
"I believe that the Portuguese Presidency was acting seriously and prudently when it proposed the decision of the fourteen countries."
"I must say that the European Parliament and the Commission have been on the same wavelength since February and the Portuguese Presidency cannot be criticised for defending our community of values in the face of a decision of a political party to form a government with another party whose ideology and beliefs are absolutely contrary to our common values."
"I believe that the Portuguese Presidency has shown signs of patience and perseverance and has defended our common values."
"Madam President, my group also salutes the Portuguese Presidency's cooperation with the European Parliament and thanks it for this."
"As far as the results of the Feira summit are concerned, however, we are rather more sceptical."
"In recent weeks a debate has broken out between the governments of the Member States about the future of Europe, and even about having a constitution."
"In stark contrast to these competing visions, however, is the way in which preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are shaping up."
"It even seems that the images of the distant future conjured up by a good many ministers are actually intended to conceal the European Council's inability to resolve the issues it has set itself."
"Since Maastricht this European Council has been putting off the problems, the unresolved questions and the necessary reforms."
"Many of these were already left unresolved in Amsterdam."
"The public's confidence in the EU has now reached an all-time low in all the Member States."
"In eastern Europe frustration is growing at the EU's hesitant attitude."
"The real initiatives - highlighted by Parliament in all of its resolutions for years - are in some cases not even being discussed in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The most important objective is surely to create and develop a European democracy and to eliminate the democratic deficit."
"In Feira we did not see a decision to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, one of the decisions most eagerly anticipated by the people of Europe."
"An alternative approach to the Intergovernmental Conference, which this Parliament has repeatedly advocated, was not even mentioned."
"I think that, instead of making people want to enshrine the prevailing system in a future constitution, the European Council will have given everyone cause to consider the system's gross shortcomings, manifest in the current Intergovernmental Conference."
"A procedure for adopting a constitution has not been planned or launched; there is barely a definite notion of doing so."
"Questions remain about parliamentary and judicial control in the second and third pillars, as they do about the status of European parties and so on."
"Neither are there any tangible plans for meeting the second challenge, to create a social dimension to European integration."
"I believe that all of this has serious consequences for the degree of acceptance of the EU by those on the inside and also for the expectations which the eastern European countries have of us."
"We still have a few more months, but the work will have to pick up speed and increase in gravity and depth at a much greater rate than we have seen so far!"
"Madam President, Prime Minister, the Feira Council did not provide any new items of substance. It was even repetitive where certain fundamental policies are concerned and made no changes to weightier issues."
"It was a disappointment for that very reason. Predictably, the main themes, ranging from enlargement to the CIG, via the Charter of Fundamental Rights, were largely put off for the Nice Summit."
"This is certainly why it became necessary to come up with a last-minute agreement on timetabling the tax package which, in the end and in essence, is restricted to waiting for another agreement a few years off, which will still be dependent on its unlikely acceptance by third countries, which are precisely today' s tax havens."
"It is therefore not surprising that this virtual agreement should have been particularly warmly welcomed by those who have never been keen on a greater balance between legislation on capital and labour and who have always opposed mounting any joint action against these tax havens for tax evasion, fraud or the movement of large sums of money."
"On the contrary and in the name of the completion of the internal market and the follow up to the Lisbon Special Summit, we have seen new pressures for speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation of the labour market."
"When the broad economic policy guidelines for 2000 were approved it was accepted that constraints resulting from the Stability Pact would have to be strengthened and provided for, which suggests that there will be further and greater problems, particularly in the social domain."
"The reasons for the large demonstration organised by the trade union movement at the Feira Summit are therefore understandable and the fact that tens of thousands of people took part in this demonstration definitely made it one of the most striking features of the Summit."
"There are also grounds for concern in another area, however. I am referring to the revision of the Treaties."
"Almost the entire task has been left to the French Presidency and the most important aspect in this area has already moved beyond the normal institutional framework, into bilateral summits and various conferences and statements. Nevertheless, in this area, we cannot let pass without comment the fact that the Feira Summit did not only fail to include the revision on the agenda but that it spoke about 'a form of closer cooperation' in the singular."
"We already had deep-felt concerns about what has up until now been known as 'closer cooperation' , given its profound and unmistakable connotations of the creation of a hard core, a vanguard or a pioneer group."
"This would therefore mean a multi-speed Europe, headed by a political cabinet. The adoption of this new wording, because it is undoubtedly much more indicative of such ideas, increases these doubts and makes us extremely apprehensive as to the kind of European construction which some people are advocating."
"The worst thing is that other people seem to be distracted..."
"I reserve a final word of disapproval for the obvious trend towards the militarisation of the European Union. Proof of this is the fact that we are developing our own military capabilities, clearly in tandem with NATO."
"We still think that the OSCE is still the most appropriate framework for developing the European Union' s security system. We also take the view that the prevention of crises and civilian crisis management should prevail over any interventionist action."
"- (PT) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the rotating presidency is one of the cornerstones of our Union."
"It is evidence that we are united on the path of cooperation and that we do not take the imperial route of some countries dominating others."
"In addition to this, it works well, as the Portuguese Presidency has clearly demonstrated."
"The fact that the Portuguese Presidency was a success and that comments on it have been universally positive confirms and reinforces the truth of this situation and our belief in it."
"As a Portuguese citizen, a non-federalist and a European, I can only be delighted, in spite of our political differences."
"Those who wish to see the Union' s system of a rotating presidency changed are wrong."
"It is not true that only the large and powerful countries can preside over the Union."
"The presidency can and must be divided between Member States, since this is symbolic of the fact that we share a common path."
"If there is one negative side to this six-month term, it is the Austrian question."
"The Portuguese Presidency alone cannot be blamed for the mistake, as I have to call it."
"It was a mistake committed by everyone, when they pushed the 'Fourteen' - and what is this 'Fourteen' anyway? - to excess and into an impasse."
"In the European Parliament alone, 406 Members supported this disastrous move."
"We cannot develop a short memory once we realise our mistake."
"Austria held elections and will continue to do so."
"Free elections."
"They did nothing that constitutes a violation of the Treaties and their guarantees."
"The real issue is the violation of fundamental principles with regard to a Member State, which sets a dangerous precedent of arrogance or tyranny."
"It has never been clear why the Presidency of the Union became involved in a course of action that was supposed to fall under the terms of bilateral relations."
"Today there is growing embarrassment."
"Everyone is wandering around with a torch, looking for a graceful way out."
"There will certainly be a way out, but I doubt that it will be a graceful one."
"It is now the responsibility of the French Presidency to find it."
"It has always been said that the French authorities were largely responsible for the mistake that was made, so it is therefore appropriate that they should now resolve the problem."
"The Portuguese Presidency attempted to bring some basic realism back to certain fundamental issues."
"With regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the presidency made its position clear at the Feira Summit, keeping strictly to the terms of the mandate granted to it by the Cologne European Council."
"It is amazing, hearing some of the ideas that are being bandied around, how far some people wish to force us to go beyond the limited suggestion made in Cologne."
"We shall see!"
"As to the IGC, the signs given at the start of the French Presidency are, in contrast, quite worrying."
"We are all aware of the differences of opinion and the difficulties that already existed."
"Given such a situation, how are we to interpret the French Presidency' s recent initiative to go to Berlin and announce a completely different agenda for the future of the Union?"
"Jacques Chirac' s speech to the Bundestag was ill-judged and ill-timed."
"It showed a lack of vision and a lack of respect, from what one can see."
"It served only to create distrust in an atmosphere that is already very sensitive."
"This type of speech is not pro-European, and in fact, is clearly anti."
"The authors, from the French UDF, of a recently published draft European constitution, made it quite clear: any Member State failing to comply with the constitution would lose its place in the Union and be reduced to the status of a mere partner."
"What kind of madness is this?"
"Where is the sense in such a contradiction?"
"A final word: the French Presidency has the responsibility of not ruining what the Portuguese Presidency has managed to achieve through basic realism."
"Any idea of a pioneer group does not correspond to the idea of European cooperation that unites us."
"This obsession with hard cores or pioneer groups will only serve to create a perverse dialectic and an increasing and divisive tension between the countries who see themselves as leaders and those who do not want to be led and will not accept this."
"This is not the Europe to which we belong."
"Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin with a point which Mr Patten emphasised, I thought, very well: the Indian question."
"I would like to offer the Portuguese Presidency my sincere congratulations on having successfully managed this initiative, which is very important, in my opinion, even if the press itself has not yet realised this."
"It is important because, as Mr Patten said, India is a democracy, the largest in the world, and it is a country located at the heart of Asia, at the very heart of an Asia which, at the start of this new millennium, I think represents the greatest danger of the next century, much more so than the issues we have been discussing already today, like Austria, for instance."
"We must tackle the issue of China."
"China is as close to us now as were the totalitarian regimes before the Second World War."
"Yet we pretend not to notice, we continue to deal with China on a priority basis."
"We should be putting all the weight we possibly can behind India and attempting to make China see that Chinese citizens truly deserve to have democracy."
"I think the shift to an intergovernmental form of administration is evident, Mr Guterres, and that it is not solely dependent on the personality of the Commission President, Mr Prodi."
"I believe that Parliament too must take considerable responsibility for having undermined this body that is central to European construction, but I think that the Council is continuing to exacerbate the sideways shift and that we must, as a matter of urgency, change course and put the Commission back at the centre of the Community' s construction."
"I feel that in terms of foreign policy - you also spoke of defence policy - we are making no progress towards Community construction."
"Absolutely everything is based on an intergovernmental approach."
"We have not managed to grasp just what is our scope for input to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We cannot ask Mr Solana questions."
"We do not know what matters he is dealing with."
"As the European Parliament, we do not have any scope to intervene."
"We do not know what tasks you, the Council, have given him."
"In my opinion, the fact that relations are not more acrimonious than they are and that there is still a degree of politeness and some superficial agreement is due only to the two personalities holding the key foreign policy positions, Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana."
"I think that if anyone else were involved, the balance between the institutions would already have been upset."
"I believe that in the course of this intergovernmental conference we cannot avoid starting to plan and set ourselves an agenda for the reform of the European Union providing for gradual communitisation of the common foreign and security policy."
"It is just not possible for us to go on exacerbating the sideways shift in the wrong direction."
"We cannot envisage any sort of foreign policy which is not, in the medium term, managed directly by the Commission, or by a Commission Vice-President. Similarly, I think it would be dangerous to disregard the question of how each country is represented within the Commission, even if a good number of my fellow Members are experiencing some amnesia on the subject in plenary."
"I think it would be premature, and I think that Portugal cannot be unaware of this issue, to reduce the number of Commissioners to less than the number of Member States."
"I think the only condition which could possibly allow us to make this leap forward and rid the Commission of its 'national' status, involves electing the President of the Commission by universal suffrage."
"I think that the countries which are not large - to avoid describing them as something else - should weigh up this proposal carefully."
"I hope that Portugal is concerned about it - but I know that other Member States, Belgium, Luxembourg and others too, are talking about it - as I think it is an urgent matter and that it would be much more important to start to tackle the question of the 'check and balance' system operating between our institutions than to engage in sideways shifts that are liable to freeze any further progress and put it on hold by discussing constitutions or Charters of Fundamental Rights, without even having any legal basis for this charter."
"Mr President, in the EU, matters are so often on the agenda that it is difficult to say when the various developments begin."
"The precedence of EU law may be dated back to the judgements given in 1962 and 1964."
"The right of veto in accordance with the Luxembourg Compromise prevailed from 1966 to 1986."
"The changeover to majority voting may be dated back to the Council of Ministers' new rules of procedure from July 1987 and the Single European Act' s majority provisions for the internal market."
"The possibility of closer cooperation was introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, but unanimity is required, and that possibility has never been made use of, except in areas where there was already unanimity, for example in connection with EMU and cooperation under the Schengen Agreement."
"With the Feira Summit, the EU' s Member States acknowledged for the first time that closer cooperation could take place without the agreement of every country."
"Feira put the issue on the Intergovernmental Conference' s agenda."
"It is too early to say whether the outcome will be a general clause or whether earmarking will be introduced, but the initial breakthrough has occurred, and the principle of equality between countries has in that way been abandoned."
"From now on, Germany and France can set the pace, even if Great Britain and other Euro-sceptic countries wish to see cooperation take a different direction."
"Formally, changes to the Treaties will still require unanimity but, in reality, it will soon be possible to increase cooperation without waiting for the stragglers."
"Those who want to see further integration have good reason for congratulating the Portuguese Presidency, but for those of us who want to see more democracy and equality between the countries of the Union, the Feira Summit is no cause for celebration."
"I also believe that the sanctions against Austria ought to be lifted, and preferably sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, I remain dismayed at the way in which Austria continues to be prejudged by 14 Member States of the European Union and believe that it is still far too early to assess definitively the overall consequences of the Feira summit."
"Certainly, there will be results on one or two further fronts thanks to the indisputably conscientious and ambitious work done there."
"Inevitably it was an intermediate and preparatory summit which did not deliver satisfactory results on fundamental issues and it was therefore disappointing, and above all not very spectacular, apart from the only item not on the agenda - that is, Austria - and it was therefore also a rather thankless task for the presidency."
"But what it really will be remembered for is a missed opportunity to return to normal relations within the Community."
"Neither in Feira nor in the ensuing days did the presidency succeed - against the wishes of the majority of Parliament - in smoothing the way back to normality."
"The further humiliation of Austria was at the very least tolerated."
"This will be the enduring image of Feira."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council presidency has given itself a bit of a pat on the back by declaring that the Portuguese Presidency has done what it set out to do, no more and no less than that."
"That may be true, Prime Minister Guterres, for the routine tasks."
"The image people have of the Portuguese Presidency will not, however, be determined by whether or not routine tasks have been completed, but by two events: firstly, by the fact that as President-in-Office of the Council you have had a hand in imposing the sanctions on Austria, and secondly, by the complete lack of progress in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Why does this matter?"
"Posterity's opinion of us as a generation of European politicians will not be determined by the successes which you listed; it will be determined by whether we succeed in carrying out the historical duty of our time in the Union, which is enlargement towards the east, the reunification of Europe after a century of European civil wars."
"To make this possible we need to reform ourselves in the Intergovernmental Conference, and no progress has been made here at all so far."
"This must be noted."
"There is no doubt that this is a difficult business."
"The candidate countries themselves are having to make their contribution; we must of course be ready for enlargement and we cannot make enlargement conditional on the success of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"After all, it would be disastrous if our lack of ability to reform became a yardstick by which enlargement was judged."
"That is why we need to put more effort into making progress here."
"The fact that, for example, the French President has made a proposal to draft a European constitution enshrining the division of responsibilities is a major step forward, because dividing up responsibilities would create the confidence necessary for more majority voting in the Council, which is one of the most important preconditions for its ability to act."
"The example of Austria is harmful because you are painting a picture of a European Union which interferes in the internal affairs of a country."
"This is not the kind of European Union which the people of Europe want; neither is it what the candidate countries want."
"It is regrettable that this has happened under your presidency."
"- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner Patten, Prime Minister of Portugal, nobody will be surprised if I add my voice to those who have, in the main, congratulated the Prime Minister on the great skill with which he has led the Council of the European Union over the last six months."
"I am doing so for other reasons, as I have already said here over these six months, but above all, because I feel that this Presidency has made three important marks. Firstly, it has adopted a new political stance."
"Secondly, it has made a commitment to building a Europe with a social conscience, which provides a practical response to the problems of European citizens, and thirdly, it has established a new dialogue, based on the universal European values that have been asserted and developed over these six months."
"Firstly, there is the new political stance in its relations with Parliament, which my colleague Mr Barón Crespo has already mentioned."
"I would like to contribute a further example, of which there can never be too many."
"This concerns the number of subjects that were opened up to codecision and then closed during the six months of this Portuguese Presidency. Above all, there is the respect with which the Portuguese Presidency always treated this Parliament, which will certainly have contributed to future presidencies adopting a new stance in their relations with Parliament."
"Secondly, there is the Portuguese Presidency' s assertion of civil values and respect for human dignity."
"Here I must return to the Austrian question, Prime Minister, to ask you and to ask myself what would be the attitude of many of those who are today criticising the Portuguese Presidency for having had the courage and the determination to condemn a xenophobic and fundamentalist agenda if the Fourteen Member States and the Presidency itself had remained silent?"
"We prefer to praise the Portuguese Presidency for its courage, determination and boldness, although others might prefer to highlight its silence, perhaps even its cowardice."
"We think that this was an important statement to make, not just within the Union, but beyond it as well."
"It has clearly been understood, because when the Austrian Government announced its programme, it put considerable emphasis on the protection of human rights and, above all, on its acceptance of the European project."
"I would, however, like to focus on other political issues related to the second mark made by the Portuguese Presidency, this Europe with a social conscience that I mentioned, which has earned the praise of many people, in particular the Secretary-General of the European Trade Union Conference, which also held a demonstration in Oporto. The Secretary-General highlighted quite clearly, however, what the presidency was able to achieve by discussing issues such as full employment, the social agenda, a society that remains true to the values of the European social model and that is based on knowledge and information."
"These points are, today, at the centre of the European Union' s political agenda and will never again be relegated to being second- or third-class issues or merely the responsibility of the Member States. This debate continues to raise questions: why are many of those who criticised this Council three months ago for not having reached - in their opinion - substantial conclusions, today criticising the presidency for placing too great an emphasis on the intergovernmental approach precisely because these conclusions have been successful?"
"The third and final mark made by the Portuguese Presidency is that it has asserted Europe' s new position in the world."
"You have already talked about this, Prime Minister, in relation to Mexico, South Africa and the EU-India Summit. The same applies to the EU-Africa Summit, which we feel was a key point, a turning point leading to the creation of a new, necessary relationship between the European Union and Africa."
"The European Union cannot continue to be hypocritical in its treatment of Africa and the Summit was a major step in this new approach."
"Prime Minister, these three marks mean that that you are drawing a conclusion here and confirming a desire."
"Your conclusion is that European ambition is not the heritage of large countries alone. The conclusion is that the desire and commitment shown for constructing and proving allegiance to the project by its founders are also the heritage of those who, even in remote and even small areas in territorial terms also have ambition and take pride in being Portuguese and, at the same time, European."
"The desire is that the reasons we have today to feel proud will not end or die out with the Portuguese Presidency. They must remain alive so that we can continue, as a Member State, to develop this project and confirm these values and a culture which is our own, which deserves our respect and above all, which is worthy of our every effort."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, the Portuguese Presidency has been conscientious and committed, it has sought to cooperate closely with Parliament and I too should like to thank the Portuguese Government for this."
"However, the other side of the coin is the outcome of the Feira summit, and in my view the results for all fifteen Member States were more than disappointing."
"I should like briefly to make three points."
"Firstly, the Presidency Conclusions say of the Intergovernmental Conference that significant headway is being made."
"I have to say that I find this difficult to understand because really everyone knows that in fact the Conference is not making any progress at all."
"Since then, additional ministerial meetings have been arranged and today the German press reported that in French Government circles even a failure is not being ruled out in Nice."
"Secondly, many action groups and non-governmental organisations, but also a majority of the European Parliament and national parliaments, are calling for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated in the Treaties."
"But no mention was made of this in Feira."
"There was no clear affirmative answer as to whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be legally binding, and I should like to agree with my colleague, Mr Voggenhuber, from the Greens that this is not the way to counter scepticism about Europe in our countries."
"The public do not want yet another grandiose-sounding piece of paper."
"Thirdly and finally, it was not until paragraph 50 that the Heads of State and Government expressed their shock at the tragic deaths of the 58 refugees in Dover."
"I, Mr President-in-Office, am shocked that it did not occur to the Council to do anything more in response to this terrible tragedy than to step up the fight against so-called illegal immigrant smuggling."
"No thought was given to making even the slightest adjustment to the EU's policy of a European shield with its sometimes fatal consequences for people in need."
"But in my view this is precisely what is urgently required to prevent tragedies such as the one in Dover from being repeated."
"What we need most of all is a return to international standards of refugee law and application in full of the Geneva Convention on Refugees."
"Drastic policy changes are required here precisely so that we do not continue to encourage those who make money out of trafficking in human beings."
"Mr President, I am similarly dismayed at the way in which Austria continues to be prejudged by 14 Member States and in my view, despite the many words of praise about the Portuguese Presidency, the absurdity of the sanctions against Austria, which Member States agreed together but are applying bilaterally, will, as a German newspaper once wrote, go down as a peculiar irony in the history of the EU and therefore unfortunately also in the history of the Portuguese Presidency."
"A so-called Community of values cannot end at Lake Constance."
"The work of the presidency will surely only be credible if the values which are to be defended are binding on all the Member States of the EU and are not employed arbitrarily and on demand as political propaganda by individual politicians against a democratically-elected government of an EU Member State."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to add my voice to those who earlier paid their respects to the memory of President Pflimlin."
"One of his lasting legacies is an understanding of the continuing need of the strength of the three political institutions of the EU and for mutual respect between them."
"It is perhaps inevitable as we are discussing the ending of the Portuguese Presidency that, with the recent speeches in Berlin, the memory is going to focus more on the second half of the IGC than the first, but I would like at this stage to record my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency for their assiduousness in consulting the Parliament both here in the plenary and in the Constitutional Affairs Committee."
"The Berlin speeches by Foreign Minister Fischer, visionary and controversial, by President Chirac, controversial but not visionary, and by Prime Minister Blair, neither visionary nor controversial, which threaten to overshadow the memory of the Portuguese Presidency, leave certain questions in the mind which the Portuguese Presidency can still help us with."
"Firstly I understand that Prime Minister Jospin has said that he would rather see no agreement in December in Nice than an unsatisfactory institutional reform."
"Could the Portuguese Presidency confirm that sufficient work has been done to ensure that agreement can be reached in December?"
"Secondly, on enlargement, could he confirm that there is still the political will in the Council so that candidate countries, this House and the public of Europe can expect to hear target dates announced for the first wave of accession?"
"This is something that the Commission and many in this House would like to see."
"My last question on close cooperation would include Commissioner Patten, if he is able to demonstrate that he has not imposed a vow of silence."
"Is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic interplay between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution, by the Council, to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and, by implication, the people of Europe?"
"Mr President, my assessment is a rather critical one."
"The future of Europe depends on two major issues: democracy and employment."
"Democracy: the Intergovernmental Conference does not appear to resolve the issue of the alleged democratic deficit, and so-called closer cooperation on its own will not suffice."
"Greater democracy means guaranteeing full authority to adopt legislation and initiatives to the peoples' elected representatives."
"It means independence for Europe from the United States and therefore greater autonomy for NATO."
"Greater democracy means political control of the economy and its institutions, starting with the Central Bank, and not the reverse."
"Employment: the e-Europe action plan may serve to prepare the citizens to become Internet shoppers but it will certainly not create jobs."
"Employment policy is short-sighted and biased towards the market."
"A completely absurd ideological process is currently developing in which the State is replaced by the market, and it is absolutely clear to us Communists that the Union must change direction completely."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its term of office: progress has been made on various issues and the debate on the future of the Union and preparations for it have been instigated at political level, despite the fact that the Intergovernmental Conference has stuck at present to the original agenda."
"The resolutions on the European Security and Defence Policy and the new rules governing collaboration between the Union and ÍÁÔÏ are highly positive, even if certain aspects of future developments are still somewhat obscure."
"The Portuguese Presidency referred to federalism and to future issues in general, but without, for example, raising the matter of own resources and without a spectacular increase in own resources, enlargement will become practically impossible and politically painful."
"Mentioning closer cooperation as the Union's main means of progress gives the impression that we are preparing, formally, for a two-speed Europe."
"Only if this cooperation is confined to certain sectors will it remain the driving force behind the Union."
"We were delighted with the confirmation of Greece's accession to the euro zone and if this presages the accession of all those who are still outside the euro zone, then so much the better."
"In essence, as far as employment, competition and environmental and public health policies are concerned, the Lisbon Summit made minor concessions to the citizens of Europe, but not enough to meet their real needs."
"Mr President, the Feira Council neither surprised nor disappointed us."
"However, we must concede that, institutionally, the Union is in a rut. At the same time, certain parties responsible for European policy are voicing various ideas in the press which the citizens of Europe can follow, but without the opportunity to take part in any debate."
"Europe will be complete once we are all involved, including those who want no part in it."
"And it must be a Europe which gives hope to all its citizens, whose fundamental rights will, we trust, be incorporated in the new Treaty."
"- (PT) Mr President, this is a rather improvised speech, but I had to find something out because I am rather confused and I am not sure if this is due to a simultaneous interpreting error."
"Just now, I heard Mr Nassauer, of the EPP, strongly criticise the Portuguese Presidency, and only the Portuguese Presidency, because of the sanctions against Austria."
"Now, on 13 February, the European Parliament voted on a resolution that was subject to a vote by roll-call, and it appears that Mr Nassauer is recorded as having voted in favour of this resolution."
"There must therefore be some mistake here, either in the simultaneous interpreting or in the register of votes."
"I would be grateful if the Bureau could clarify matters for us."
"We will clarify this matter, Mr Ribeiro e Castro."
"As you know, I can only permit interventions concerned with the Rules of Procedure and with the false interpretation thereof."
"I cannot therefore allow you to speak any further."
"Nevertheless, what you have said has now been said and it will be useful and have an effect."
"Mr President, it is not possible in a mere 240 seconds to give a full report of the positive work which President Guterres and all his team have done on behalf of the European Union."
"I am consequently obliged to confine myself to a few brief and far from comprehensive comments."
"Portugal, quite rightly, focussed the European debate on growth and employment."
"If we are to gain the full benefit of the internal market, we must, in my opinion, intensify the economic aspects of the European Union. I am not referring to an economic government."
"Such a term only leads to confusion, and indeed who would wish to be governed solely by a government of Finance Ministers?"
"Europe does, however, need more effective coordination of national economic policies, given also that we now have an independent single monetary policy."
"It is not that we Socialists wish to see a policy of economic coordination against the central bank, but we do wish to see constructive dialogue between the decision makers in monetary policy and the decision makers in national economic policy, with each party, obviously, having to retain its own autonomy of action and decision making."
"This essential coordination is aimed at maximising the advantages to the Community of a common economic policy action."
"A few simple rules must be set within the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, but more especially within the Euro-11, requiring every Finance Minister to justify to his fellows the broad outlines of his draft budget or tax reform or any other national action likely to affect the European Union as a whole."
"This sort of coordination between national economic policies, which I would term 'discretionary' , would make it possible to gradually direct national schemes towards jointly defined objectives."
"The development of the internal market also necessitates new regulations in order to guarantee workers' rights in the event of business mergers or buyouts, in order to avoid relocations for reasons of fiscal or social dumping and in order to guarantee basic public services for all sectors of the population, especially the most vulnerable."
"Another major priority, as Portugal understood, is to strengthen the social rights of European citizens."
"A more open and more flexible economy requires new guarantees of security for workers, for example, the right to lifelong training."
"Any request for increased mobility or adaptability should necessarily be matched by seamless social cover throughout the territory of the European Union, as regards the transferability of pension rights, for example."
"The Socialists expect the upcoming French Presidency to ensure that the draft social agenda makes rapid progress and is substantial in content."
"Portugal has helped e-Europe to make progress."
"At the moment, information and communication technologies are crowned with all the virtues."
"The possibilities are apparently endless - communication without frontiers, democratic access to information, trade and communication - but the dream quickly comes up against the realities of the sociological and economic world."
"The phenomenal development of the Internet within our societies must not blind us to the fact that there is a digital divide and that the gap between info-rich and info-poor is increasing in developed countries and, more especially, in the third world."
"Mr President, I would have so many more things to say but, unfortunately, my speaking time is running out: 240 seconds is really not very much at all."
"I should like to emphasise that Portugal and President Guterres' entire team have deserved well of the European Union and that France now has the opportunity to prove that even a large country can complete a successful presidency."
"Mr President, on 28 June the EU held its first summit with the largest democracy in the world and the second-largest trading power in Asia."
"India - and Commissioner Patten made this point - whose importance is often underestimated, has finally received the recognition which, in the light of its economic and political dynamism, it deserves."
"In the end the time was not wasted in exchanging pleasantries."
"It was possible to sign real agreements."
"It is not only for us, the EU, as India's largest trading partner, that it is important for further protectionist barriers to be dismantled and for liberalisation to be able to continue."
"The response to the reform process is significant additional investment from Europe."
"In mid-April our SAARC Delegation - of which I am Vice-Chairman - was able to see very clearly for itself in Delhi how much progress has already been made in restructuring the economy."
"In the new economy - information technology, for example - we are once again the most important partner."
"But we will only be able to take advantage of these well-trained technicians and qualified employees if the idea - which has not been thought through - of having a system of green cards is finally dismissed."
"A green card with a time limit will not work at all."
"We need cooperation between European and Indian companies."
"Employees can then be posted anywhere and they will have clear contracts which are valid throughout the world."
"At the summit, think tanks, contacts with NGOs and new networks were discussed."
"We have shared values."
"All the more important then are the respect for human rights, ethnic minorities and dissidents and the abolition of child labour."
"This is in no way a uniquely western way of thinking; these values are at the root of a shared democratic consciousness."
"The fight against unemployment and exclusion needs to be fought with the same intensity as the fight against terrorism and crime, and this was agreed by both sides."
"I hope now that the meeting of political and economic leaders will be the first page in a new book in which young people from universities, schools and businesses will also play their part."
"So Mr President, let us support exchange programmes so that people can meet one another, understand one another's way of thinking and in the future work alongside one another!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, I really wish with all my heart - given my political views - that the Portuguese had had an easier presidency, a presidency without the strains caused by the bilateral sanctions imposed on the Federal Austrian Government and therefore on my country."
"I wish above all that you had not had to take the blame for a policy possibly cooked up for you by others."
"The longer this policy remains on the boil the more indigestible it is, not only for my country but also for the whole European Union."
"You see, you cannot help but notice a certain contradiction in the fact that these measures were intended to be entirely political and were also taken at political level and yet to find a way out of this blind alley - which is entirely desirable and in everyone's interests - a solution is now having to be sought by means of a legal instrument."
"It was not least for this reason - since these measures are of course devoid of any legal base - that Parliament's President, Nicole Fontaine, pointed out at the beginning of the Feira summit that the European Parliament had adopted a resolution on 15 June calling on the Council to analyse relations between Austria and the other 14 Member States, and to draw up with all the parties concerned a procedure which would enable a solution to be found which would be acceptable to everyone."
"This procedure seems to have been established: the President of the European Court of Human Rights has been appointed and he in turn will nominate three wise persons who will report on Austria."
"In this context I must say that it is regrettable that no timetable was drawn up here."
"That would have made the exercise easier."
"It is very regrettable that even before this forum starts work its conclusions are already being prejudged by the future President and the work of the forum is coming under pressure because people are acting as though it were politically irrelevant."
"I can only hope that people accept the political relevance of this report from this legal institution and that a golden goal will be scored here under the French Presidency, namely an early end to the sanctions against my country!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increasingly frequent meetings of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union mean that they are increasingly unable to fend off charges that they are tackling issues which actually have no business at European level while continuing to ignore the issues which they should be addressing."
"In Feira a clear delimitation of responsibilities between European level and the level of the Member States was not discussed; the lifting of the absurd sanctions against Austria was not discussed, and neither was a really workable compromise on the taxation of savings interest discussed."
"The conclusion reached postpones the problem for 10 years."
"Conversely, issues were debated which at the present time do not belong on the European agenda."
"With how many countries should we actually begin further negotiations?"
"We must at long last develop phased procedures to govern cooperation between the European Union and countries in central, eastern and southern Europe, which meet the needs of both parties including where these stop short of full membership."
"What is the position on compliance with the convergence criteria when admitting further states to the euro?"
"Sustainable stability must be proved by all countries which want to join the euro zone, but also by those which are already in it."
"Only in this way will it be possible to boost the strength of the euro."
"We do not need closer cooperation on the social dialogue - that goes beyond the powers of the European Union!"
"We do not need more centralist regulation in this field; if we really want to unleash the forces of growth in the EU we need more competition between the individual national social security systems."
"Only the results in the field of security and defence policy are to be welcomed."
"Here Europe needs to act; here we need more Europe."
"That is what the people of the EU rightly expect of us."
"I call upon you as a matter of urgency to put an end at long last to the sanctions against Austria - and we do not need a report from the Court of Human Rights to do this either, as the media is in any case monitoring the situation on a daily basis - and to concentrate your efforts on the real European issues!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are some fine phrases in the conclusions from the Feira Summit, as there are about progress at the current Intergovernmental Conference, but there are really no solutions in sight."
"The Summit again pointed to the importance of rapid enlargement, yet the candidate States are still looking to the EU to adopt positions from which it is ready to negotiate."
"We must be more vigorous about the process of European integration and must not begin to be in two minds about it."
"The candidate States must not be required to wait for an unreasonable length of time."
"A new political will is required that will produce more tangible results than Feira did."
"At the same time, it is a question of being clear about how the institutional questions of enlargement towards the east, qualified majority voting and the numbers of commissioners and MEPs are to be solved."
"The EU must be able to operate effectively following enlargement, too."
"At the same time, issues internal to the EU must not delay the enlargement process."
"The processes must therefore run parallel."
"With enlargement, there also comes the demand for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"There should be no getting away from the fact that constitutional conditions are to apply. There is nothing controversial about that."
"However, the EU Charter puts the EU' s development in a new perspective."
"We must show what kind of EU we want. Is it to be one which offers new opportunities and which is more competitive, innovative and entrepreneurial, with more small and medium-sized businesses?"
"Or do we prefer more publicly financed welfare and a weak currency?"
"The Charter Convention ought perhaps to be given an increased mandate to draft proposals for constitutionalising the Treaties, because the issues are so closely interrelated."
"There is undoubtedly a direct link between the prelude to a new treaty and the actual contents of the treaty."
"A parallel development could create new political openings and constitute progress, because the various interests would be directly dependent upon one another."
"To bring about parallel processes of enlargement and deepening, a decision in principle could be made in favour of a binding Charter for the constitutional portion, but not for the portion concerned with issues other than those of principle."
"The Convention would then certainly know what status the Charter was to be given and could see it as the prelude to constructing the new treaty."
"Both those whose priority is enlargement and those who give priority to a deepening of the Union would then meet with success."
"A development of this kind would make it possible to admit new Members early on and, at the same time, equip the Union well to operate more effectively for a long time to come."
"We have an historic responsibility to overcome barriers and not to intensify conflicts in the way that happened in the case of Austria."
"We need to replace short-term initiatives with long-term, in-depth cooperation."
"I believe that, in that way, our basic values, which form the uncontroversial part of the Charter, could be used as a lever for enlargement."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolutions."
"The work done by Portugal, as the country holding the presidency, has not been easy."
"There have been many difficult questions during the spring, but Portugal has shown that it is a country which takes European issues very seriously."
"The Feira Summit was in many ways an interim meeting prior to the French Presidency."
"Unfortunately, the outcome of the Summit was partly overshadowed by the tragedy in Dover, which really raises an issue which urgently needs to be taken up at EU level."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is delighted by the progress which has been achieved on, for example, the tax package and civil crisis management."
"We are pleased to have it confirmed that Greece is soon to be a member of the currency union."
"We are delighted about the formulations concerning enlargement."
"For liberals such as ourselves, no task is more important than that of unifying Europe."
"Where the reforms and the Intergovernmental Conference are concerned, we are disappointed, however."
"We should like to have seen more concrete results."
"Countries are still protecting their positions, and the debate about the EU' s future has only just begun."
"It is a welcome and wholly necessary debate."
"It must be conducted in all countries, in an open and unbiased way, and involve the citizens of all Member States."
"Minimum reforms in Nice will not be enough."
"Our citizens expect something more."
"They expect the EU to take proper steps forward towards an open, democratic Europe which can operate effectively with up to 40 Member States."
"We need to discuss the issues surrounding a constitution."
"The EU needs a constitution which, in a simple and understandable way, makes it clear what the EU is about and where responsibility lies."
"The baton has now been handed over to France."
"I feel a certain unease faced with the different signals emanating from the French Presidency."
"Even if different EU countries perhaps need, to some degree, to be progressing at different speeds, we hardly need a presidency which is moving at different speeds."
"Mr President, I can reply very briefly because my honourable friend Mr Beazley - and I use the expression in both a personal and a parliamentary sense - asked me a direct question in a speech which perhaps would have been better received in Berlin than in Paris or London."
"The honourable Member asked me how I saw the relationship between the institutions - between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"I can answer very directly: in my own area it is a subject about which I have made one or two speeches recently."
"I am absolutely clear that I do not want to see any increase in the Commission's competences in the area for which I am responsible."
"I want us to manage those competences more efficiently, and I want us to be allowed to exercise those competences fully to support the development of a common foreign and security policy."
"In my judgment it is not a question of our seeking to take new powers, it is a question of our seeking to exercise the powers that we have already been given by the Treaty."
"We should be trying to exercise those powers in a way that is even more democratically accountable."
"Let me give the honourable Member an indication of what I mean."
"We have to apply to the budgetary authority - to Parliament and the Council - for the level of our commitments in external relations every year, but we should be involved in a much more open dialogue with the budgetary authority about the direction in which those spending commitments should go."
"There should be a more serious exchange about our political priorities."
"So, to answer the honourable Member again, I want us to manage much better what we are already charged with doing."
"I want us to be allowed to get on with it, and I want us to be as accountable as possible to this Parliament and to the Council for what we are doing."
"Our aspirations are as simple and as straightforward as that, and they have the great advantage of reflecting what is written in the treaties."
"Finally, I should like to pay one last compliment in the direction of the Portuguese Presidency at the end of its term."
"It was, I repeat, a great pleasure to work with the Portuguese Government, with its ministers and its extremely hard-working officials."
"Speaking as somebody who during the course of a fairly long and not, I hope, entirely misspent political life, has sat under a number of chairmen, I do not think I have ever sat under a chairman who was better, more competent, more decisive or more courteous than the Prime Minister of Portugal."
"Money laundering"
"The next item is the report (A5-0175/2000) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering (COM(1999) 352 - C5-0065/1999 - 1999/0152(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have here a very good example of cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"I should like to begin with a few words about the history of this proposal for a directive."
"Since as early as 1991 there has been a directive to combat money laundering in Europe."
"This anti-money laundering directive essentially forms the basis for national legislation to counter money laundering, which may incidentally be something which people at home in the Member States had not realised, because they always assume that this is the work of their own legislator."
"He will also have had a hand in it, but the origins of the fight against money laundering lie in the 1991 directive."
"Following the submission of a whole series of reports to the European Parliament - including from the Commission - it held a hearing on this subject in December 1995."
"The result of the hearing was that cooperation between the Member States suffered from grave shortcomings because the standard of anti-money laundering legislation was extremely varied."
"There are states, such as the United Kingdom or Germany, which have gone much further than the directive."
"Others such as Luxembourg have implemented the bare minimum, and inevitably this has caused serious problems."
"Even at that time Parliament called on the Commission to draw up a new proposal for a second anti-money laundering directive."
"This has now been done."
"We are grateful to the Commission for this, and I think that this is a good example of the Commission responding to initiatives emanating from Parliament and acting on them."
"On the other hand, I must also make a number of critical comments."
"I believe that the Commission has overshot the mark somewhat in its proposal."
"It has, as it were, extended the scope of the rules which apply to providers of financial services and banks to other professions, which are also to be covered by the second money laundering directive and which are to be obliged to combat money laundering."
"But rules which were intended for banks are simply not so easy to apply wholesale to advocates, tax advisors and auditors because, for example, lawyers have a particular duty of discretion towards their clients and a special relationship of trust."
"It was our task therefore to rectify this in our consultations at the first reading."
"I believe that we have succeeded in doing so."
"Today we have created a situation in which the principles of the rule of law are still upheld, but in which legal practitioners remain bound to secrecy if they are either representing their clients before a court or advising them on a legal matter."
"Only when lawyers fulfil the same functions as banks - that is, to administer property or money - is it clear that the same rules should apply to them as to providers of financial services, and I believe that this is also achieved through the amendments."
"I believe that we have made the identification requirements which were laid down more practical."
"It makes no sense for an estate agent to have to first have proof of a customer's identity before entering into business relations with him."
"This would make the job impossible."
"The amendments have also made this provision more practicable and realistic."
"In connection with the list of predicate offences we are critical of the fact that the European Commission has not defined the concept of organised crime."
"We rectify this in the amendments."
"Where fraud affecting the European Union is concerned, we have restricted the list of predicate offences to the really serious criminal offences, and we have not included any of the minor offences which appeared in the Commission proposal."
"At this stage I should like to express my grateful thanks for the constructive cooperation which we have enjoyed with the Finnish and Portuguese Presidencies, and I am sure that in our further discussions we will also cooperate fruitfully with the French Presidency."
"With this directive we tried for the first time to make use of the new procedure in the Amsterdam Treaty which makes it possible to conclude a codecision procedure in one reading."
"Unfortunately we did not succeed."
"But it was not Parliament's fault."
"It was the fault of the individual delegations in the Council working group which had not brought definitive instructions from their capitals, making it impossible for the Council to submit to us definitive texts which were ready for negotiation."
"That is why we decided in the committee even before the summer break that we would enter into detailed consultations now in the first reading, complete the normal procedure of first and second readings and then await the Council's common position."
"This should not, however, prevent us from continuing to seek to cooperate with the Council on this issue because the Tampere summit made the fight against money laundering its very top priority, and rightly so."
"That is why we must all endeavour to achieve improved anti-money laundering legislation in Europe as quickly as possible."
"I think that this evening in this plenary debate we are also making a contribution to doing this, and I think and hope that good progress will be made so that we will have a second directive to combat money laundering in the European Union very soon, which will then I hope also be swiftly implemented by the Member States!"
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing a fundamental amendment to the directive on preventing money laundering."
"Since the 1991 directive was adopted many external factors have changed."
"Firstly, we have had experience with the existing directive and secondly, we need to take account of the changes in the Treaties."
"Given the growing awareness that money is the main objective and driving force behind organised crime, appropriate measures also need to be taken which target the profits from organised crime."
"The financial interests of the Community also fall victim to organised crime, as the reports about combating fraud in the Commission show."
"This is to the detriment of the budget of the European Communities."
"The Member States protect their financial interests in accordance with their laws, but the Communities do not have a police force or judicial authorities with which to bring defrauders before a judge so as to recover the lost money and impose punishments."
"That is why the Community budget needs to be protected by means of directives, regulations and other measures."
"Article 280 of the EC Treaty clearly states that, ""The Community and the Member States shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community through measures to be taken in accordance with this Article, which shall act as a deterrent and be such as to afford effective protection..."" ."
"The Commission proposal should be seen in close connection with this article of the Treaty."
"Most of the crime which harms the Community budget is also organised crime."
"The rapporteur is right there."
"But there are also exceptions. Furthermore it is not always international organised crime, and here the Committee on Budgetary Control would have preferred the Commission proposal."
"However, we do recognise the delimitation problems and, if there is simply a reference to Article 280 of the Treaty, we are prepared to go along with the rapporteur."
"Incidentally, we believe that the money laundering directive is firstly about prevention and providing a deterrent and secondly about gathering evidence."
"The Member States need to have a legal base for their own and the Union' s sakes."
"All appropriate evidence ought to be used to punish fraud and other illegal activities which are to the detriment of the EU budget."
"It would certainly be in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the October 1999 European Council to proceed in this way."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the cooperation which we have enjoyed."
"Mr President, laundered money is the reward for organised crime and political corruption."
"From an economic point of view, it represents an extremely unhealthy addition to the international money supply and helps to distort aid and reconstruction policies. This has happened in numerous cases which have already come to light."
"We have proposed a number of amendments in a bid to harmonise and tighten up supervisory arrangements and sanctions."
"However, crime is always moving into new areas, such as the trafficking in immigrants, trafficking in human organs etc., and is always finding new ways of laundering the proceeds."
"A great deal of work needs to be done."
"We feel that the revised directive does not go far enough, although we do, of course, support it."
"Unbridled globalisation calls for ever-increasing political regulation, coordination, harmonisation and supranational bodies, on a scale and to a standard which is commensurate with organised crime."
"Take the example, the extremely important example, of offshore activities; the OECD recently published lists of the countries and methods used to launder money and the frightening amounts involved."
"We think the Union should help countries, whatever the country and whatever its political regime, which are used to hide illegal activities behind offshore legislation."
"It should help them to harmonise and comply with common rules, even the hopelessly inadequate rules which prevail in the Member States of the Union."
"We can do this perfectly well, without any particularly illegal infringements, by including clauses and arrangements to foster harmonisation in trade and other cooperation agreements with these countries."
"Otherwise, I think we are wasting our time."
"Mr President, I came to this opinion on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee with many misgivings."
"The suggested extension of the directive to a new swathe of businesses and professions looks on the face of it to be both dangerous and burdensome: dangerous in that there might be a threat to the privileged lawyer/client relationship which is the linchpin of access to justice in a civil society, and burdensome because in theory this directive would now extend to your local high street jeweller."
"However, it is one thing to require a multinational firm of accountants to comply with this sort of regulation, quite another to require a small firm or one-person business to do so."
"I was attracted at first by the outrage of colleagues who said that this proposal represented the state turning lawyers and others into policemen on their behalf - but as I read and researched, my views changed."
"We must bear in mind, as has already been said by the rapporteur, that the proposal we are considering is before us at our request, at the request of Parliament, because we wanted to get to grips with money-laundering, with this international crime which represents a substantial threat to the single market."
"I have been impressed by the results obtained in England by the Criminal Investigation Unit, working with lawyers under what are already very extensive rules and regulations, but respecting professional privilege."
"They have been particularly successful."
"We should learn from that experience. In Scotland, lawyers are encouraged to see tough rules as self-defence for lawyers, protecting them against the claim of involvement in crime."
"We should as a Parliament stick to our original desire to tackle money-laundering strongly as a manifestation of organized crime and it seems to me that perhaps this problem will come back to haunt us."
"It is a shame that we have not been able to deal with this problem as what it is, a matter of criminal law, but have had instead to deal with it within the strait-jacket of the internal market context."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we vote in favour of this directive tomorrow or the day after we will be establishing one of the cornerstones of the fight against organised crime because, as Diemut Theato mentioned, the driving force behind organised crime is the money from drug trafficking, from trafficking in human beings and from all forms of organised crime."
"This money is laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy."
"This poses serious dangers: a danger to the economy because of distortions of competition; a danger to the company of being undermined, and a danger to the state whose stability is threatened."
"That is why it is so important that we take up the battle here against money laundering and prevent it from happening."
"Because if we succeed in stamping out money laundering then we will also stamp out organised crime."
"That is why I welcome the fact that a new proposal has now been tabled which extends the first directive."
"The situation has changed."
"Organised crime is using new kinds of businesses."
"Money is being laundered through different channels from the ones which were used in the past."
"That is why it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament, for the institutions, the Commission and the Council, to make decisions here so that we have a new effective instrument with which to combat money laundering."
"That is why we in the European People's Party support the fact that this directive extends the list of predicate offences to all areas of organised crime from which these proceeds are derived, and extends the scope to cover the professions and businesses which are abused or which may specifically be involved."
"I very much welcome the rapporteur's efforts to propose an approach which actually makes the directive enforceable and practicable and thus into an effective instrument in the fight against organised crime."
"We will be firmly supporting these proposals from the rapporteur."
"Mr President, organised crime is often taken by the public to mean spectacular killings such as the murder of Judge Falcone or drug trafficking."
"But in truth it means something different."
"Organised crime is the repeated, systematic committing of crimes by exploiting professional structures; for example, the systematic theft of cars, the systematic theft of credit cards and the like. This kind of crime has two consequences: firstly, the damage is considerable because it does not correspond to a single act, but to an accumulation of acts."
"Secondly, the money gained from the criminal acts is so great that it cannot be used up unobtrusively by private individuals."
"At conferences I always explain it as follows: organised criminals simply cannot eat, drink and be merry to a sufficient degree to get rid of the money inconspicuously."
"That is why they try to disguise the money acquired by criminal means and to pass it off as money which has ostensibly been acquired legally."
"This is called money laundering."
"Dirty money is turned into respectable money."
"Anyone who prevents this from happening, or at least makes it considerably more difficult, cuts organised crime to the quick, stunts its growth and damages its ability to propagate itself."
"Mr Lehne referred to the fact that we already had a directive on this very early on which harmonised standards in the European Union."
"Nevertheless, this new directive is necessary to allow more recent developments to be taken into account."
"We think it is good that the directive is not just being extended to banks but also to other businesses or professions which might be abused for money laundering purposes, and here the problems associated with the liberal professions have been satisfactorily resolved in our view."
"We also think it is good that all forms of organised crime, and not only drug trafficking, are to be regarded as predicate offences."
"We have attached particular importance to the inclusion of dealers in precious stones, dealers in luxury goods with a value in excess of EUR 50 000 and auctioneers."
"What surprised us rather was the fact that the Commission did not - although the problem is obvious - integrate electronic money into the directive from the word go."
"It would seem that the aggressive civil service intelligentsia within the Commission, who put a positive spin on anything to do with the Internet, drown out any critical murmurings about it also being possible to abuse this technology for other purposes."
"The Council has disappointed us: so far it has not decided anything at all; it is behaving like a broody ox."
"I therefore say to the Council: make your decision quickly now!"
"Money laundering is far too serious a matter to entrust to the cowboys and Indians games of small-time Councils of national ministers!"
"Mr President, in recent years criminal organisations within and outside Europe have set up powerful international networks which make huge profits from, for example, trafficking in women or drugs."
"The amounts which change hands in the process run into billions."
"The fight against money laundering is also in Europe's interests."
"The excellent report by my colleague, Mr Lehne, seeks to improve the existing directive on preventing money laundering."
"Institutions, such as banks, and also individuals with similar responsibilities, such as notaries and lawyers, are to be involved in resolving crimes of money laundering."
"We must, however, prevent possible new loopholes from opening up."
"Our aim will be to develop a pan-European information system to counter money laundering as quickly as possible."
"If we do not establish a collaborative network to monitor and combat money laundering then one day we will no longer have an overall picture of money-laundering activities."
"It must not come to that!"
"It is now nine years since the 1991 directive was produced and it is time to update it."
"However, it would seem that the new directive is limited almost exclusively to the tasks, roles and responsibilities of the self-employed and does not evaluate sufficiently the growth in illegal trafficking which is, sadly, linked to uncontrolled and uncontrollable mass migration, particularly in the Balkans, which has consequences not only in purely financial terms but also in the wider social context in the countries which are already part of the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary and appropriate for us to avail ourselves of the results of the work of the money-laundering task force without delay."
"The Commission proposes in the directive to lay down an obligation to provide information, but we are worried about the handling of the information."
"It might be appropriate to set up an authority or permanent monitoring centre, considering the considerable diversity of types of money laundering."
"The reference to banks or art dealers or auctioneers is too narrow in its scope, for not only tax havens but also Albanian pyramid companies and small commercial activities could be included which are a cover for illegal trafficking."
"Clearly, prevention has not been sufficient to date, so the alternative is now to resort to the budget to establish penalties."
"Finally, it should be noted that money-laundering operations should also be included in evaluations of respect for human rights because illegal activities are often linked to the arms and drugs trades and the trafficking of women for prostitution and children for paedophilia."
"Therefore, an evaluation of whether to accept a candidate State for enlargement should include careful investigation of its illegal money-laundering activities!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Safe harbour privacy principles"
"The next item is the report (A5-0177/2000) by Mrs Paciotti, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Draft Commission Decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles."
"Mr President, the right to confidentiality of personal data is a fundamental right in the European Union, but the market interest in the free movement of data is also protected."
"In order to keep a balance between these requirements, Directive No 46 of 1995 lays down a series of rules to be transposed by the Member States - which have indeed been transposed into national legislation - and provides for the establishment of an independent authority to ensure that these rules are observed in accordance with the principle of the voluntary disclosure of information: the data subject must therefore have the option to choose whether to consent to data processing and to have control over who processes the data and for what purpose."
"In addition to recourse to the guarantor authority, the right is also laid down for the data subject to have recourse to the law in the event of breach of the rights guaranteed to him by law."
"In order to transfer data to third countries, it must be established whether the countries guarantee an adequate level of protection."
"Where this protection is not guaranteed, data can still be transferred under the appropriate contractual conditions: standard contractual clauses are currently being developed by the Council of Europe and other bodies in order to facilitate the drawing up of contracts with countries which do not guarantee legal protection."
"The European Commission will ascertain that the third country provides adequate data protection and oblige the Member States to adopt standardised procedures."
"Now, problems do not arise where the laws of the third country guarantee data protection."
"Switzerland and Hungary do currently guarantee data protection, and therefore the European Parliament has no reason to intervene since it has nothing to propose."
"The case of the United States of America, where there is no general data protection legislation in the private sector, is different."
"Therefore, an attempt was made during the complex negotiations between the Commission and the United States Department of Commerce to find a solution which would allow the transfer of data to those private companies which voluntarily submit to a self-regulation system known as the 'safe harbour' system."
"Recently, on 6 June, the European Commission sent us the instruments it had drawn up on the basis of the conclusions reached and which it considers constitute adequate protection."
"The committee of representatives of the Member States expressed a positive opinion, but the committee of Member States' guarantor authorities criticised the instruments."
"Some of the concerns expressed by the committee of guarantors may be considered to have been dealt with by the subsequent clarifications supplied by the Commission regarding, for example, the scope of the system."
"Nevertheless, certain questions remain unresolved, in particular the fundamental matter of enforcement: the guarantee that the companies which use safe harbours will fulfil their undertakings."
"In fact, since there will be neither law nor contract, individuals do not have rights which can be invoked in Court."
"Means of controlling the safe harbour system do exist, with the possibility of the imposition of penalties, but these only come into play in the event of unfair or fraudulent practices. It is at the discretion of the Federal Trade Commission whether it takes them into consideration."
"The company responsible for processing the data also has the option of recourse to a private dispute resolution body of its choice, but this right is not available to the person whose rights may have been violated."
"The safe harbour system can only be considered to afford an adequate level of protection under article 25 of the directive if genuine protection is guaranteed for European citizens whose rights have been violated, that is if there is the possibility of getting the unlawfully processed data erased and of obtaining compensation for damages by means of recourse to a judge or arbitrator or any independent third party who has been assigned the task of guaranteeing that reparation is made for any harm suffered."
"The resolution also calls for the transfer of data to be authorised only when the system is fully operative and for operation of the system to be adequately monitored."
"By this we are not asking the United States to change its system, even though there have been many calls in the United States from authoritative sources for legislation to be adopted governing the matter."
"Our only concern is for the European citizens to be adequately protected, as the European consumer associations request and as American consumers would also wish to be."
"I call upon you to adopt it in order to ensure that an international model is not introduced which provides fewer guarantees in this sensitive issue and which other States might insist is enforced, but, above all, in order to give the European Parliament the opportunity to demonstrate that it is an assiduous defender of citizens' rights, rights secured by Community law."
"Mr President, Commissioner, while I have respect for Mrs Paciotti, I must begin by pointing out the ambiguity of her words."
"Clearly, what you are proposing is not a ""yes, but"" , as you have been arguing, but rather a ""no, unless"" and Parliament should be aware of this."
"It is a ""no, unless"" , as you have pointed out correctly, in the event that the system is not operative before the judgement on adequacy is confirmed, if these amendments regarding compensation for moral damage or damage to property are implemented and if we do not establish a right to cancellation or a personal right to judicial claim."
"In this light, I would argue, and I hope that the majority of Parliament will vote likewise by means of the amendments presented by my group and others, for a ""yes"" , but on the strict condition that we see realism, respect for the law, respect for institutional balance, but above all, Mr President, respect for the citizens and their interests."
"The opposing position is unrealistic."
"It is unrealistic since the negotiation has been satisfactory, given the context, the adversary, or opposing party, and the legal context, which I will return to."
"I am talking about a serious interinstitutional problem, since this Parliament is not undergoing a codecision procedure, it is not tabling amendments. We do not have that option."
"What we have is a power granted to the Commission and certain Member States who have unanimously backed this position."
"What is our intention?"
"It is to safeguard our responsibility, as established in the very ambiguous Amendment No 6."
"Because, Mrs Paciotti, it is our directive, we voted for it. We did not establish a criterion of equivalence, but rather a criterion of adequacy, and we established that the Commission was responsible for assessing that criterion of adequacy and a committee of the Member States was established which has unanimously adopted this position."
"Mrs Paciotti, if we want to change, let us change the directive, but let us not try, through this kind of subterfuge, which is totally against the law, to achieve a situation which will not benefit the citizens, because if these were the only criticisms made, I would support you. At least, I would support you if the directive were reformed."
"But you would have my support, anyway."
"However, it does not benefit the citizens."
"You say that information can currently be provided by means of a contract."
"It is not realistic, Mrs Paciotti, you know it is not realistic."
"At the moment, the information is circulating without any guarantee."
"Let us turn now to the Safe Harbour."
"To say that the Safe Harbour must be operative before we pass judgement on its adequacy will lead to its collapse."
"This is because no company is going to accept its implications in terms of investment and change, unless it knows that it will be guaranteed the possibility of having access to the free circulation of information."
"I must point out that the United States have at least 25 years of experience in this type of system, which supports the idea that this can work and that it is going to work."
"And it is going to work."
"With regard to appeals and damages, you, who are a great legal expert, know that an institution can only be analysed in context."
"Analyse it, therefore, within the context of the United States' legal and judicial system and the conclusion will be completely different to the one you have reached."
"The majority, not all, but the majority, of these rights involve legal redress, in the last instance, after having been subject to a complaint to the competent governmental body."
"And neither does this rule out legal proceedings."
"This is because American legislation, in relation to economic damages, does not consider moral damages and we cannot demand that they change their legislation."
"Lastly, cancellation."
"This goes against the principles established by the OECD in 1980."
"I will end, Mr President."
"I hope that tomorrow this House will support this position which, as I have said, is ultimately in the interest of the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to compliment the Commission on sticking with the negotiations with the USA over the last two years."
"The reality is that data is flowing across the Atlantic and we, and our citizens, have no protection at present."
"So the question for us must be: do we give them the protection that is on offer or do we say it is not enough?"
"If we do that, then what will happen?"
"Concerns have rightly been raised about the access for individuals to redress and compensation."
"But this raises the fundamental debate about the clash of legal cultures which has been so central to these negotiations."
"Clearly, as an elected Parliament, we have a duty to protect our citizens, but I fear that the conditionality in paragraph 7 of Mrs Paciotti's report endangers the whole agreement, for it could hardly be more fundamental to the debate about adequacy or equivalence. We are in a global context here and e-commerce will continually throw at us clashes of legal systems and style."
"Yet we cannot attempt to change the way the Americans deal with their own national legislation and legal system."
"They have their way and we have ours."
"They will come to their own conclusions about how they will change their system."
"Yes, they are considering it; yes, they have had several annual reports about the protection of personal data."
"I wish we had that within our European Union."
"I urge colleagues in the vote tomorrow to give protection to our citizens now."
"Conditionality will mean no protection now."
"But if we express our very strong reservations and to ask for clear review, this will give our citizens protection now and offer us progress in this very difficult area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Paciotti has produced an excellent, very logical report, precise in its observations and balanced in its conclusions."
"She has taken account both of the requisite protection for individuals against any misuse of their own personal data and of the need to reach an agreement with the United States as quickly as possible so as not to put a brake upon the development of trade."
"At a time when it seems certain that an information society will be developed on the back of the new technologies, we think it vital immediately to implement the means needed to protect the consumer and the citizen from the abuses inherent in the marketing and innovative techniques that are so greedy for accurate information."
"In the context of an agreement with the United States, the rapporteur emphasised the extent to which this country lacked any legally binding standard on personal data protection."
"So American firms may use all the data they wish without the Federal State finding fault with this."
"We feel that it is particularly dangerous that the Commission should be willing to ratify an agreement that offers so few guarantees for the citizen."
"The 'safe harbour' system proposed by the American authorities offers no protection at all."
"It is a voluntary standard which American firms would themselves apply internally and then only with regard to Europeans."
"This text, moreover, does not give citizens the right to go to court if their rights are flouted."
"It would be a great shame, particularly now that, after years of discussion, the Council appears to be willing to set up a proper European body to monitor the use of personal data, if we were to ease off the pressure in terms of our demands on the subject with regard to third countries in general and the United States in particular."
"It is a condition sine qua non for any real protection of citizens' individual liberties."
"In conclusion, I should like to remind the Commission that personal data protection is an integral part..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, we fully support Mrs Paciotti' s report and its conclusions."
"The 'safe harbour' agreement would mean that we would have to transfer data to American businesses, companies and corporations without the possibility of recourse to an independent authority in the event of improper or illegal use of the data, and that we would therefore not even be protected by those minimal guarantees which exist in the Union."
"During the hearing held by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we took on board the concerns of the representatives of American consumers regarding the inadequacy of the American protection system and we also noted the need, expressed by President Clinton, for the United States to introduce an organic law on the protection of personal data."
"If we adopt this report, we will not only be expressing our political will to succeed in concluding an agreement containing protection clauses which respect European legislation, but we will also be encouraging a large proportion of Congress and of United States' public opinion to develop personal data protection laws."
"If such laws are not produced and the changes called for in the Paciotti report are not made, we may as well call the agreement with the United States the 'dangerous harbour' agreement."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Paciotti for the work she has done on this report and to extend my thanks to Commissioner Bolkestein, who has regularly sent his officials to assist the work of the committee I have the honour to chair in dealing with this report."
"Data protection, which is essential to privacy, poses huge challenges in an age of electronic communication."
"If we are frank, we will admit that no government has yet found a way to offer adequate protection to its citizens."
"In the European Union the route of regulation through legislation has proven far from perfect."
"In the US, the route of self-regulation has also brought up serious problems, as the report from the Federal Trade Commission to Congress last month shows us."
"Liberal Democrats have taken the view that the proposals in this draft agreement beg many questions, but that on balance, and since this is the deal on offer, it is better to have regulation to allow this valuable trade to grow than to allow anarchy to reign."
"There has been much debate in my group about the impact and the legal effect of this report."
"I take the view that this report says yes, but - quite rightly - requires firms participating in the safe harbour to agree to pay compensation in the case of individuals suffering damage from abuse of data held on them."
"In my view this is necessary for consumer confidence, which is a fickle thing, but others, probably the majority in my group, will support Amendment Nos 1 and 2 which they believe clear up all legal uncertainty."
"Clearly, we cannot know how the United States will react to our concerns."
"I am guided by the considerable economic interest of the USA in having this agreement, but I recognise that others are guided by a deep concern about the current lack of protection and a burning desire to see even the limited protection offered by this agreement."
"Either way, it remains our hope that legislative developments on the other side of the Atlantic will render the safe harbour obsolete and we salute the Commission in the work they have done in achieving what they clearly believe is the best achievable result."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Visas"
"The next item is the report (A5-0179/2000) by Mr Lehne on listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement."
", rapporteur."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a story behind this regulation too; its history extends over the whole of the last parliamentary term."
"You will remember that at that time, after the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, uniform rules on visas were to be introduced within the European Union for the first time."
"This meant that people from third countries entering the European Union were in principle to be subject to the same visa requirements in all countries in the European Union."
"At the time the Commission had already made a proposal which on the whole was very good and which also received support in Parliament."
"Unfortunately the Council then made fundamental changes to this proposal and more or less declared the entire visa list to be as good as non-binding when it said that anyone could go beyond it and either impose visa requirements on additional states or leave it at that; they simply had to notify this."
"At the time the European Parliament considered that its views had not been properly taken into account and, moreover, that this result was also contrary to what the Maastricht Treaty actually intended."
"We then instituted legal action."
"We won the case before the European Court of Justice."
"The Council regulation concerned was declared null and void."
"The result was that the Commission made a new proposal to us which was very similar to its first proposal, to which we again gave an essentially positive assessment in Parliament, and which then, because of the change of legal base - Maastricht gave way to Amsterdam - had to be recast in a new proposal, which is now on the table here and which we must once again debate."
"Parliament continues to believe that the visa list in this visa regulation must be definitive, which means that there must be no more exceptions to it, so no black, green, blue, yellow or grey lists, but please just one list, one list which is binding and no other."
"This is a crucial point if we are finally to have uniform rules on visas in the European Union."
"In addition, the Commission has given ground on one important point, which Parliament regarded as essential even last time round."
"It concerns the visa requirements for two associated countries, which are now of course already a long way into the accession process, namely Bulgaria and Romania."
"Parliament has always been of the opinion that these states should be exempt from visa requirements."
"We came to this conclusion on the basis that much progress has been made in these countries on internal security and many other issues."
"The Commission has now also accepted this and is proposing to include Bulgaria and Romania in the list of states which are exempt from visa requirements."
"We see this as a step forward."
"Obviously these countries have in the meantime also managed to convince the Commission."
"Now we can only hope that, if possible, after listening to the European Parliament, the Council makes the same decision and also recognises that important progress has been made here."
"My plea to the Council would be that it should debate this regulation as soon as possible."
"I should like once again to extend my warmest thanks to the plenary, but also this time to the Conference of Presidents, which put this report on today's agenda even though it had not originally planned to do so, precisely because this makes it possible to complete our business quickly and send out an appropriate signal."
"In the run-up to this debate a whole series of requests for amendments, which it was hoped we would adopt here, were sent to me from the Council."
"For example, there was a proposal to introduce so-called reciprocity."
"What is this?"
"Quite simply, citizens from individual Member States are subject to visa requirements in some third countries."
"These Member States should, it is argued, have the possibility of demanding visas from citizens from these same third countries."
"I rejected this."
"Not because I do not have sympathy for these Member States' demands, but because I believe that in introducing this we would again be contravening the overall principle and we would again be in breach of the provisions of the Treaty, which provides precisely for a standard visa list comprising a list of countries which are subject to visa requirements and a list of those which are not."
"For this reason I do not believe that we can introduce a provision of this kind."
"In Europe we have come so far - I only need to mention the implementation of Schengen, meaning that there are no longer any controls at the vast majority of borders - that nothing else is simply good enough anymore."
"We need standard rules on visas, and I think that the Commission has tabled a good proposal."
"We have also debated it in Parliament accordingly, I hope, as the Commission had in mind."
"Now it is the Council's turn."
"As soon as possible it ought to produce a result which is as constructive as possible."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, who has put forward a very concise and well-presented report and one that we are happy to support."
"I would like to draw attention to one or two points from it."
"I hope that most Members in this House will agree with me that we should be moving towards a visa-free Europe, a Europe without barriers, at ease with itself and the rest of the world."
"I know we still have some stumbling blocks and Europe and the world are not quite ready for that at the moment."
"But the rapporteur has spoken about no exceptions and I am delighted to support him in that we have one single list."
"I also want to draw attention to a few amendments."
"Amendment No. 2 is important."
"It says it is essential that we have procedures that are as smooth and as simple as possible and do not cause unreasonable expenditure for the applicants."
"Many of us in this House know as well as anyone that getting a visa can be a time-consuming and expensive business."
"We want to make certain in Europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction."
"Similarly, Amendment No 6 speaks about young people and encouraging them to take part in youth programmes by not giving them the extra burden of visas."
"That is important because young people are enthusiastic about the European ideal and we do not want to put anything in their way that makes them think that Europe is not welcoming and not moving in the right direction."
"My last point concerns Romania and Bulgaria, particularly Romania, a country I know well."
"Every time I go there I have to go through the procedure of getting a visa and the Romanians say that as long as the European Union wants visas from them they will demand them from us."
"So we are taking a step in the right direction and I am happy to support the amendments and the report."
"Mr President, the introduction of a European visa policy is the occasion to debate an important issue, and here in this House we are today discussing the latest developments in this visa policy."
"Mr Lehne's report gives important momentum to this process and we support his report."
"He is already aware of this, so I do not need to thank him yet again because I have already done so in private."
"The matter I should like to address here, something which I have reflected on many times, because I am of Turkish origin, is the following. We considered whether we should table any amendments, but in fact we decided not to do so."
"We will not therefore be making any recommendations here on how the report should be dealt with."
"However, I should like to take the opportunity today - because otherwise no one listens to me - to voice my opinion for once on something which I am very uneasy about."
"In my opinion, it cannot be right for the European Union to offer Turkey a chance to accede while at the same time maintaining the entry restrictions."
"I am surprised that we cannot manage to find an alternative way to deal with the Turkey issue, particularly within the context of this harmonised list."
"I am aware of the reasons for this, but I should nevertheless like to use our Parliament as a platform."
"Around 3 million people of Turkish origin live in Europe and it is for this very reason that our Commissioner ought perhaps to consider in the future how we are going to resolve this problem reasonably and humanely in the coming years."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal which is now under discussion is to be seen against the background of the new architecture resulting from the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"That architecture rests on two cornerstones, namely the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in accordance with the new Title IV inserted in the European Community Treaty, and the integration of the Schengen acquis into the Union framework, to which is added the dimension of variable geometry resulting from the different protocols annexed by several Member States to the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Commission proposal has a legal basis taken from the Amsterdam Treaty, and its content and wording take account of the institutional constraints that I have just mentioned."
"The Commission has carefully examined the report by Mr Lehne, whom I would like to congratulate."
"In the past, as rapporteur, Mr Lehne has already had the opportunity to show his interest, expertise and commitment in this subject that he has just presented."
"The Commission is pleased to note that the report adopted by the Committee of Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs broadly supports the Commission's proposal."
"But this is hardly surprising since, as Mr Lehne himself pointed out, the proposal meets a number of requests that the European Parliament itself put forward in various resolutions."
"As regards the amendments to its proposal, the Commission appreciates very much the Parliament's constructive contribution."
"To clarify our position: Amendments Nos 3 and 4 can be accepted, as the changes they make to the wording avoid any contradiction with other provisions of the regulation."
"We can also accept Amendments Nos 1 and 5."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are prompted by a wish to clarify the demarcation line between the scope of the regulation and other matters, some of which are governed by the Schengen acquis, integrated into the Community."
"The Commission is sensitive to the desire for clarification which it furthermore took into account in its explanatory memorandum."
"It takes the view, however, that the appropriate place for such clarification is not in an article of the regulation, and it is prepared to draft a new recital based on the gist of these amendments."
"Amendment No 2 in our opinion cannot be accepted since it relates to the conditions for the issue of visas, which do not fall within the scope of this regulation but will have to be addressed in a different instrument."
"Finally, the Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 6."
"Despite all the sympathy that can be felt towards the possibility of exempting young people taking part in European Union Youth Programmes from visa requirements, the Commission must stick to its aim of maximum harmonisation and avoid cases creating derogations from, or exceptions to, the visa requirement."
"The Commission is convinced that efforts to ensure that the need to obtain a visa does not constitute an obstacle to young people wishing to take part in European Union programmes will have to be made in the rules on the conditions for the issue of visas which will be dealt with by a different instrument and which are not covered by this regulation."
"To sum up, I would like to thank the Parliament, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, for their constructive approach and also, especially, for having examined the Commission's proposal on visas so swiftly."
"Parliament's swiftness is appreciated by the Commission, and it will help it, in the field of visas, to meet the deadlines set in the action plan adopted in Vienna and reproduced in the scoreboard drawn up following the European Council in Tampere."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I speak on yesterday's Minutes and something which is not in them."
"Yesterday evening I raised two points."
"One was on the success of Euro 2000."
"The second one was on whether or not Mr Helmer joined with me in congratulating Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on welcoming the introduction of the euro into the UK."
"I do not see that minuted."
"Could you change that please?"
"Mr President, there was a very large number of MEPs who could not be here yesterday because we were let down by the flight connections."
"I can inform you that 25 Scandinavian MEPs and interpreters took between 10 and 20 hours to arrive here in Strasbourg."
"I hope you will convey this to our French President and tell her that our having to meet here in Strasbourg is almost intolerable and a constant strain."
"I would also ask the President to contact Air France, which is about to take over the carrier which cancelled its flight to Strasbourg yesterday."
"I would ask her to urge Air France to retain the route and to operate it punctually so that we might avoid these constant problems in connection with our meetings."
"It would be best, of course, if we did not have to come to Strasbourg at all, but that is an entirely different matter."
"Mr Haarder, I shall of course take note of your comments."
"I think that in most of your cases you must also have seen that a survey is being carried out by the French Government, specifically asking you to say what problems you have in getting to Strasbourg by air."
"I am aware that many Members of Parliament had problems yesterday, but let me point out that when I am in the chair I am no longer French but European."
"Mr President, I would like to take up this issue."
"Many people were unable to get here on time because of air traffic problems."
"I actually managed to, but I did not even find a list to sign, so I hope that this will be recorded in today' s Minutes."
"Mr President, I was on the flight concerned yesterday."
"It took me 12 hours to get to Strasbourg."
"What is more, I also had problems obtaining a seat at all on a flight to Strasbourg."
"It is quite unacceptable for MEPs to have to spend time which should be devoted to political work or to their electorate at home on wondering how they will manage to get to their place of work and also on working out where they are going to spend the night."
"MEPs who are not so lucky as to win the lottery here in Strasbourg and to have permanent hotel rooms have, on each occasion, to ponder such matters as where they are going to sleep and how they are going to get a room at their hotel in town. We need some orderly arrangements if this Parliament is to continue."
"I address you as a Frenchman - even though I appreciate that your nationality has nothing to do with your role as President - for the EU has a French Presidency now, of course, and, as far as I know, it is in France' s interests for the Parliament to remain in Strasbourg."
"I would request that the President of France be informed of the impossible working conditions to which we are exposed because Parliament meets in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I just want to say that, after 11 years as an MEP, I am familiar with the French airline concerned. For that reason, I chose another and arrived on time."
"Mr President, I understand our Danish colleagues' concern about this air traffic problem."
"Yesterday was quite catastrophic, but I would remind you all at the same time that when the Danes' problems started, I myself had already been travelling for five hours on my way to Strasbourg."
"I took the shortest route possible from a European capital to Strasbourg via another European capital, and the journey took fourteen hours."
"I have always cast my vote in favour of Strasbourg' s special status, including on Friday."
"But things cannot go on like this."
"I am gradually coming round to the opinion that we must assemble in Brussels, which does not take fourteen hours to reach."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your comments are completely justified, and will be passed on to the relevant departments."
"I can see the requests to speak piling up on my desk."
"I hope your points are not just to do with problems of air travel to Strasbourg, as we have a lot of work on this morning."
"Mr President, this is nothing to do with aeroplanes, although I could speak about flights if you wished me to."
"I want to refer partly to a point of order and partly to yesterday's Minutes."
"As you will recall, the first thirteen items of yesterday's agenda took the best part of an hour to get through."
"We then had the privilege of the Prime Minister of Portugal speaking."
"At the moment the Prime Minister spoke about half the Chamber got up to walk out."
"This may have been because they had other meetings, or whatever, but it is a gross discourtesy for people to walk out when the Prime Minister is speaking."
"I would ask you to ask the political groups and Parliament to try to ensure that when there are heads of state or prime ministers speaking in this Parliament there are not other meetings happening at the same time, which give people the opportunity to walk out."
"Your comments will be passed on to the leaders of the political groups and we will have an opportunity, in a few moments' time, to see if the message has been received."
"Mr President, I wanted to briefly draw your attention to the admission procedure for visitors in Brussels."
"I can inform you that, when we receive visitors in Brussels at the moment, they are admitted and then required to identify themselves. Subsequently, however, their identity cards are collected at reception."
"I must admit, I find this rather an odd procedure."
"Why should someone who comes to visit us, one of our citizens, hand over their identity cards?"
"The cards are then thrown into a box and when they want to leave the Parliament building, they have to wait for fifteen minutes before they get their identity cards back."
"I would like to ask you what the reason is behind this procedure."
"If someone has identified themselves, surely that is sufficient?"
"Surely there is then no need to seize their identity cards or driving licences?"
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, to change the admission procedure in Brussels back to how it used to be: you identify yourself, a badge is made and you are admitted."
"Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, the simplest way of dealing with the problem you raise is to refer the matter to the quaestors directly."
"I shall, of course, ensure that this is done."
"Mr President, I should like briefly to draw the House's attention to current developments in Cyprus."
"The Turkish checkpoint has been moved into the buffer zone, thereby hampering the movements of the United Nations forces and cutting off a Greek village."
"Turkey is a candidate country and should show more willing, through Turkish Cypriots, as regards the commitments which it entered into in Helsinki."
"The situation could spiral out of control and I would like the support of the House on this and, more especially, of the British Government, which has a special responsibility in Cyprus."
"I too wish to raise exactly the same issue: as you know, the third round of talks between the two communities is about to start."
"Despite the fact that the Greek-Cypriot side has no intention of boycotting the third round of talks, the Turkish side has invaded the buffer zone, creating problems for the United Nations Organisation."
"I should like to ask the European Parliament, through its President, to write to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, on this matter and to draw attention to Turkey, a candidate country which, in essence, is inciting the Turkish-Cypriot side to take certain measures or is tolerating the measures being taken."
"Turkey cannot behave in this way and continue on its path towards Europe and the European Parliament should make that clear."
"Mr President, I wish to raise the same issue and to condemn the provocative action by the occupying forces in Cyprus."
"Turkey is obviously feeling daring as the result of the policy applied to it by the European Union, a policy which, in the final analysis, rewards its provocative actions."
"Turkey has also been encouraged by recent statements by Mr Verheugen in connection with the role of the Cypriot forces and the way in which G7 is dealing with the Cyprus problem. Under these circumstances, the future of Cyprus should give us serious cause for concern."
"Mr President, I merely wished to inform you in this connection that Turkish forces have proceeded 300 metres into the buffer zone alongside the British base in Cyprus and that they did so with the blessing of the British."
"What my fellow member Mr Ályssandrakis said is true; this is the outcome of several events which have encouraged Mr Denktash and the Turkish Government, such as the Helsinki conclusions, which, to all intents and purposes, recognise the invasion and occupation of 38% of Cyprus in that they state that the Cyprus question need not be resolved in order for Cyprus to join the European Union, the declaration by G7, which has abandoned action under the UN resolutions in order to resolve the Cyprus question - and G7 includes Member States of the European Union - and the Verheugen statements, which basically recognise the occupation and the partition of Cyprus in that Mr Verheugen has stated that there is no problem and that the free part of Cyprus will be able to join the European Union."
"The question, is this: what is the European Parliament doing in order to get the Turkish forces to withdraw immediately from the 300 metres which they have occupied, thereby extending the territory which they occupy and, more to the point, what is the European Parliament doing to free Cyprus from the occupying forces?"
"Mr President, I am taking the floor regarding the issue of Cyprus and the situation there because I do not think that it should only be our Greek colleagues who alert us to the problem which has now existed since 1974."
"It is unacceptable that a country seeking membership of the European Union and with which negotiations to accord it pre-accession status have now been going on for 27 years can occupy an area covering 40% of Cyprus."
"I think it is crucial for Parliament to make known its position on this problem and for us to make it clear to Turkey that the continued abuses - the green line has been overstepped - will lead to the immediate cessation of all negotiations with Turkey concerning the latter' s membership of the Union."
"Thank you, Mr Camre."
"If I might be permitted to make an observation, when chairing a sitting one is forced to note that every time the Minutes are adopted there are some Members who want to embark upon a political debate, and as soon as the political debate gets under way, the Members leave the Chamber."
"I think that one day we shall have to rethink the way in which these debates are conducted here in this Chamber."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"1998 discharge"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A5-0190/2000) by Mrs Stauner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1998 financial year (SEC(1999) 412 - C5-0006/1999 - 1999/2050(DEC))"
"the report (A5-0167/2000) by Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1998 financial year (COM(1999) 227 - C5-0003/1999 - 1999/2004(DEC))"
"the report (A5-0189/2000) by Mr Kuhne, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1998 financial year (Section I - European Parliament/Ombudsman Annex) (SEC(1999) 414 - C5-0008/1999 - 1999/2051(DEC))."
"I understand your concern, Mr Poettering, but I do not wish to get involved in an argument and I hope that your comments are not going to start one."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to point out that it was the PPE who insisted that we looked at the whole question of the funding of political parties in this report."
"It was the PPE and it was you, Mr Elles, who insisted on that."
"We are responding to that request."
"You insisted on it, we are responding."
"Mr President, I shall do my best to say what I have to say in the two minutes I am allowed."
"On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I should like first of all to point out that there has been considerable development in relation to the report on which we are to give our opinion."
"Let me remind you that the basic position of the Committee on Foreign Affairs was that we should look resolutely to the future, give ourselves the resources for a practicable policy and, in any case, also give ourselves, i.e. Parliament, real resources to monitor the action undertaken on behalf of the Commission, particularly as regards expenditure of the type we discussed."
"We noted that Mr Prodi' s statement was indeed very positive in this respect."
"He announced that collaboration with Parliament would be a fresh collaboration. As time has passed, we have observed that this collaboration is indeed in operation."
"Many Commissioners have had no trouble in appearing before our committees in order to answer questions, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"We also thought it would be rather clumsy of the committee to hold the current Commission responsible for the attitudes of previous Commissions."
"On the other hand, it is also obvious that we are continuing to demand that the present Commissioners show the utmost transparency with regard to Parliament."
"I think this is essential and indeed I believe it is the case."
"Finally, I should also like to say that, in the context of this Commission, we feel that Parliament will have to take firm control of OLAF because this is in fact one of the key means that we are going to be able to develop for the future."
"Whatever the case, Mr President, I think that the salient conclusion that should be drawn from our work - and this view is shared by a good number of fellow Members of all political complexions - is that henceforth, firstly, we shall do our utmost to monitor what is going on and, secondly, we shall insist, as a basic requirement, that the Commission should be open with us."
"Mr President, I should like to make one observation on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and one on behalf of the Socialist group as a whole."
"With regard to the development budget, the cooperation between Mrs Rühle and ourselves was excellent."
"Initially, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Development and Cooperation kept themselves to themselves, according to their own focus."
"Later on, we joined forces and managed, in tandem with the Commission, to put certain things in order thanks to the action plan."
"This conceals, of course, a particularly grave situation, which cannot simply be attributed to one single person."
"In actual fact, we have a budget for the development fund and, in broader terms, the development sphere, where clear goals are lacking and where staffing levels are inadequate within the critical spheres, which need to be worked on. All of this sets the scene for enormous backlogs and for a control culture dominated by self-interest and fear, rather than actual results and a duty to achieve results and take action."
"I believe that we are on the brink of a cultural revolution, which will bring about this change."
"This means that the 2001 budget will make it possible to set clear goals within education and health care."
"Amounts will be made available which allow for sufficient personnel and which can subsequently be verified to see whether the plan actually worked."
"But this requires delegation, responsibility, and - in a word - a modern efficient budget coupled with a modern insight into how budgetary policy works within development policy."
"This is how I see the action plan; this is how I see our joint action."
"I see it as a joint effort with the Commission."
"I am thrilled about the fact that we can, as it were, close off a chapter of fear and a culture of self-interest."
"I know there are many motivated officials within the Commission who will now be given the opportunity to perform within the sphere which we would all like to see do well, namely to give people who live in difficult circumstances - one in five still have no access to clean drinking water or primary education - a better chance of a decent life."
"We in Europe want to play a key role in establishing this with the necessary resources."
"But this means that we need to actually make this change within the next couple of months."
"This brings me to the more general comment I wanted to make."
"The whole discussion here today will eventually culminate in the 1998 discharge."
"For the Socialist group, this will also signify, more generally, the closing off of the chapter of fear and working towards the chapter in which we as Commission and European Parliament take joint responsibility."
"In this respect, the Kinnock reforms, or the general internal reforms, are essential."
"After all, if we do not succeed in building a new system of financial control and Activity-Based Budgeting, and if we fail to reallocate sufficient personnel to those areas where we need more people, then all we do is create more paperwork, shift more bits of paper with more control and fail to come up with the goods at the end."
"And this is, at the end of the day, what the European citizen judges you as Commission and us as Parliament on."
"It would mean a great deal to me if in the course of the forthcoming budget, we could, as it were, set our good intentions on a new course for 2001."
"I wish the Commission every success in advance."
"Mr President, I am going to confine my comments to the general Commission discharge for 1998, which has taken on a highly political and divisive tone right from the start of our discussions."
"I feel that we have been through several rounds of a boxing match but ultimately the whole committee, including the rapporteur, said that discharge should be granted."
"Rather than stick with the hysterical, drum-beating report that the rapporteur produced, which, if truth be told, had little originality, no sense of direction and no suggestion on how to move ahead constructively, the committee decided back in March to postpone the discharge and to set out seventeen clear conditions which we expected the Commission to sign up to in the space of a couple of months."
"We were delighted that the rapporteur saw the error of her ways and supported our way of thinking."
"Round one to us, the anti-PPE alliance."
"The rapporteur then tried a fast left hook with her headline-grabbing explanatory statement."
"She lost."
"Round two to the anti-PPE alliance."
"The Commission responded constructively to most of the points we set out in March."
"The next Stauner report was in the same hysterical tone as the first round but this time we were ready for her."
"Round three to the anti-PPE alliance."
"We thought the fight was over, but no, we were in for more with the new explanatory statement."
"We have yet to see the result of that round but we are confident about the final knock-out round and we confidently predict what will happen on Thursday."
"The only real question that remains is why her name is still on the report."
"The truth is, we know that the Commission has a long way to go in getting its act together."
"The Court of Auditors was right in not giving its O.K. to the Commission expenditure in 1998, but we are willing now to give the Commission the benefit of the doubt."
"We think that this is a genuine attempt at reform and the Commission needs a certain amount of time to implement the necessary changes."
"We will keep an eye on the situation and make sure the Commission sticks to the promises it has made."
"For example, the promise to cut the number of errors is a major promise but it will not happen unless we have the commitment and the resources to go with it."
"Commissioner, can you assure us that particularly in the areas of high risk, agriculture, structural funds and research, we will see more checks rather than fewer, as happened in 1998?"
"Will we see significantly more resources for auditing within the DGs in cooperation with the internal audit service?"
"Can you give us these figures, please?"
"You know, Commissioner, that one area where we were dissatisfied with your answers was in response to lessons learned from Fléchard."
"We know from the Court of Auditors, unlike Mrs Stauner, that we cannot get the money back."
"Will you make a commitment though to cooperate fully with our internal inquiry committee and give us the information we request?"
"Finally, I hope that in our committee, we will be able to stop fighting each other and get on with fighting fraud."
"Mr President, on a point of order I just want to ask you whether it is customary when the spokesman for a political group fails to turn up for the debate that the spokesman can then be inserted later."
"It seems to me that if a spokesman cannot take the trouble to be here for this entire debate and be here on time for his own speaking time he should not be allowed to speak at all."
"It is at the discretion of the chair, Mr van Hulten."
"I think Mr Pomés Ruiz is perhaps just a few seconds late."
"It is not always easy to get here on time with the lifts we have in Strasbourg."
"So, if you have no objections, I shall give him the floor straight away."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your generosity, and thanks also to my fellow Member for his understanding and kindness."
"I would like to begin, not with the most important report, but by replying to the comments of Mr Kuhne which I really consider to be unfortunate."
"At the moment, the political groups - as you know - do not have a genuine regulation."
"My political group, and practically all the others, are complying with the existing regulations."
"Your political group has its way of organising its finances, as do all the others."
"Fifteen offices of this Parliament are devoted to the European Socialist Party, and a crowd of officials, who are paid from public funds, are dedicated exclusively to the work of one political party."
"Other political groups prefer to have their offices outside Parliament, and have their own officials and adopt totally legal financing formulae."
"Therefore, at a time when we are asking for a statute for the parties - because Europe needs not only European parliamentary groups, but also European political parties - at a time when there is a certain harmony amongst all the groups, I consider the references in his report to peculiar things to be unfortunate - as the chairman of our group, Mr Poettering, has correctly pointed out."
"Mr Kuhne, you know that that is not the case."
"We lack regulation."
"My political group, like all of them, is going to comply with the regulations and provide information when it is appropriate to do so."
"However, when free to do so, each group has managed its finances in the way they considered appropriate."
"I would like to highlight the work of Mrs Stauner in this extremely important report, but I would like to point out, briefly, that we are not trying to weaken the new Commission, on which we have placed so many hopes, as we have on the Commissioner responsible for the budget and for financial control, Mrs Schreyer."
"We are analysing a financial year of the last Commission, and we have asked the current Commission to diligently manage issues which were pending from the previous Commission."
"The proof that we are fundamentally satisfied with its work lies in the fact that we are going to propose the discharge, obviously with reserves, of the accounts for 1998."
"We believe that the Commission is taking its time."
"Logically, at the beginning it needs more time, but we hope that other decisions will be taken much more quickly."
"We also hope that the Interinstitutional Agreement which we have finally reached will improve our relations, so that we can provide each other with mutual support and build Europe more quickly."
"We also understand that you are immersed in a process of administrative reform, which in my opinion and in the opinion of other MEPs, is not ambitious enough: decisions are lacking and there are matters which it is not dealing with."
"It is not your direct responsibility, but you already know that we believe that a lot of funds are wasted as a result of this passive attitude, the lack of motivation amongst officials and the failure to take responsibility, because people are too concerned with controlling errors or seeking their own promotion."
"To end, I would like to say that we agree with the discharge of the accounts which the three reports refer to."
"Mr President, I think that Commissioner Schreyer has already noticed in her first year of appearing before this Parliament that this Parliament is a force to be reckoned with."
"I can assure her that this will continue to be the case for the next four or five years."
"All I can say is that so far, she has throughout the discussions shown herself to be a worthy opponent."
"I would now like to comment on Mrs Stauner' s report on the resolution, which accompanies the discharge."
"With regard to the resolution, what matters most to the Liberal group is that so far, the Court of Auditors has failed to arrive at a positive statement of assurance."
"The error rate is still too high and I feel we need to clearly stick to the points made in the resolution: the Commission must ensure that a positive statement of assurance can be issued by 2003."
"Definite deadlines are needed and it would be useful if the Commission could clearly state, both internally and externally, which categories of the budget we want to reach a very low error rate in, where possible."
"Another important point is that these days, documents have suddenly gone missing not only within the European Commission, but all over Europe."
"We have heard that the Commission will set up an archiving system by the end of the year which will ensure that mistakes which have been made in the past - I particularly refer to the butter export to the Soviet Union - will no longer occur."
"As for those butter exports, the Commissioner has already commented on them in her response to the earlier interventions."
"There is a clear difference of opinion between the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors."
"It was evident from both the European Court of Auditors and the most recent report by the Committee of Wise Men that the Commission did not have the authority in terms of proportionality, retro-activity and such like, which it claims to have, or claims to have at least to a certain extent."
"It is up to Parliament to establish this and we will certainly do this."
"We expect constructive cooperation from the Commission on this score."
"Mr Kuhne has already mentioned the salient points in his report: a neutral staff policy on merit within Parliament, public service contracts and better management of the inventory."
"Concerning Mrs Rühle' s report, we could not agree more with the comments she made about the need for better coordination between the Member States and the European Commission."
"It is the Member States that foot the bill for the European Development Fund."
"If the Member States vote for a certain policy, which the Commission proposes within the European Development Committee, it seems only logical to me that, if they are in favour of this policy, they will pursue the same policy using their own bilateral resources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the 1998 discharge was a fascinating exercise in terms of both the budget of Parliament and that of the Commission."
"In April, the power of the plenary meeting became evident."
"Against the Committee on Budgetary Control' s judgement, we rejected the European Parliament' s discharge, and we formulated five requests for the Secretary-General of this Parliament."
"This illustrated that we can be just as firm with Parliament as we can with other institutions, notably the Commission."
"I should like to express my personal and heartfelt thanks to Secretary-General Priestley and his staff for the efficient and bold manner in which he met this request and has provided us with the information required."
"In my opinion, the 1998 discharge was a fascinating and at the same time useful exercise. And we can now grant this discharge with a clear conscience whilst taking into consideration the comments included in the Stauner, Kuhne and Rühle resolutions."
"But I am left with some concern, as if something bad could happen at any time."
"Indeed, the framework agreement between the European Commission and Parliament which is due to be voted on tomorrow is hanging over us like a sword of Damocles."
"I call on all MEPs, including the MEPs who are following this debate in their chambers, to study this framework agreement carefully and to examine how Parliament' s powers in respect of the grant of discharge are being whittled away."
"I would invite you to read Paragraph 17, which contravenes Article 276 of the Treaty of the European Union, and would also invite you to read Annex 3, which is clipping the wings of the individual MEPs and rapporteurs."
"I would call on you to fight the establishment of this Parliament, the establishment within your own groups and not to consent to this framework agreement tomorrow."
"Mr President, when we talk of discharge, there is a poor spirit prevailing among the groups."
"I would like to show my support for Mrs Stauner, despite the fact that the Social Democrats criticise her."
"This may be based on the fact that during the Fléchard case, when Delors was the President of the Commission, the Head of his Private Office was the present Commissioner Lamy."
"Under no circumstances can we accept that certain documents, which would shed some light on the use of funds, have vanished."
"I would also like to support Mr Kuhne in the assessments he makes in his report, which, for its part, was criticised by members of the European People' s Party and European Democrats."
"In my opinion, parliamentary rapporteurs have to speak and write what they think about the use of parliamentary funds, in which case the interests of no group can put up a barrier."
"Our group agrees with the conclusion that discharge may on this occasion be granted."
"Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group is unable to recommend giving discharge for the 1998 accounts concerning either the Union' s general budget or Parliament' s budget. We are, however, able to give discharge for the European Development Fund."
"It is true that what happened in 1998 is not the responsibility of this Commission, but I think there has been insufficient willingness to assign responsibility for the mistakes of the past."
"Where the general budget is concerned, I just want to highlight two serious issues, the Fléchard case and the problems surrounding ECHO's humanitarian aid, and also to emphasise that the whole budgeting process is characterised by a lack of precision."
"This is what we normally view as the existence of unused appropriations."
"Budgeting is not just about coming up with a few figures."
"It is just as much about designing one' s administrative and production machinery in such a way that the objectives laid down in the budget can be achieved."
"Like the ECHO case, the Fléchard case is an example of the irresponsible use of European taxpayers' money."
"It has not happened during the period of the present Commission, but in both cases I have just mentioned we see an insufficient willingness on the part of the Commission to hold high-ranking civil servants accountable."
"The Commission knows that there are criminal activities behind these cases."
"The Commission knows that certain illegal forces have made anonymous threats to our colleagues, Mrs Stauner and Mr Blak, and this ought to make the Commission realise that a much more vigorous approach is required if action is to be taken against the internal forces partly responsible for the fact that European taxpayers' money can disappear into the pockets of criminals."
"We now seem, of course, to have two spokespersons for the Commission: the official one, Commissioner Schreyer, and the unofficial one, Mrs Morgan."
"In the Danish Parliament, we have a saying about the Finance Committee."
"We ask, 'Do you know what a cat is?' , and the reply is, 'A cat is a tiger which has been to a consultation with the Finance Committee.'"
"That is not the case here. Mrs Schreyer can always come here sure in the knowledge that Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control will not hurt a hair of her head."
"Where Parliament' s 1998 accounts are concerned, I would note that the problem is the same as in other areas of the Union, namely an all too careless attitude to the way in which the money is used."
"On the subject of the Spinelli building, I would point out that it was acquired at too great an expense and in an unusual way, not easily seen through."
"I should like to add that this is not a criticism I am directing at the Secretary-General, for I do not believe there is any basis for such criticism. Rather, it is a criticism to be directed against the system itself, for this is not good enough."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Mr Kuhne and Mrs Rühle for their reports, especially the well-balanced one from Mr Kuhne."
"We have taken the discharge procedure most seriously and I should also like to thank the administration and the Secretary-General for their collaboration in this exercise."
"I think it was a good approach to clarify matters, look into them more carefully and solve some outstanding problems with a properly argued report enabling Parliament to have all the facts in order to grant discharge to the administration and the President of the European Parliament."
"This is whom discharge is addressed to, even though it concerns the administration."
"I am pleased to see that discharge has been granted to Parliament."
"I think we have done an excellent job."
"Group finances are also going to be more transparent and more appropriate to the exercise we are making ready for if we wish to continue along the road of financing political parties."
"It was a useful exercise, properly carried out, and Mr Kuhne should be congratulated."
"I think we should be able to vote broadly in favour of his report the day after tomorrow."
"I cannot say the same for Mrs Stauner' s report."
"I feel it is misguided to attempt to use the rapporteur' s role to one' s own ends: it is deceiving Parliament and deceiving oneself."
"This practice has been appalling."
"Right up to the very end, we shall have been witness to abuse of the procedure."
"More than 60% of the report voted upon consisted of amendments."
"Mr President, it is extremely rare for a report to be quite so turned around after the vote in committee."
"This clearly demonstrates that the rapporteur must interpret the committee' s opinion logically."
"If the rapporteur does not interpret the opinions expressed by the committee accurately then the report will be beset by amendments."
"The rapporteur is supposed to be the spokesperson for the parliamentary committee."
"I feel that a situation where 60% of the amendments are adopted is verging on the nonsensical, and indicates some deep-seated malaise."
"The practice of playing games with the explanatory statement must stop."
"It is not acceptable to attempt, as Mrs Stauner did, to include points in the explanatory statement which had not been accepted by the majority in committee."
"It is a matter of some importance."
"This Parliament has no clear majority or minority."
"We have to rely to a certain extent on parliamentary fair play."
"If a clear majority emerges, then this majority feeling should be expressed in all the aspects of a report, without resorting to playing on words or abusing procedures."
"Furthermore, some of the pictures shown on television from Germany, involving extremely prominent people, suggest to me that one must look to one' s own backyard before preaching to Parliament and to Europe."
"We must ensure that private and public matters are not muddled."
"We shall therefore grant the discharge."
"We shall support this report which the rapporteur is clearly against."
"Rest assured, Mr President, that the TDI group will vote in favour of discharge, at least the radical wing of the group which I represent here."
"Mr President, they are good reports we are debating today, but I am unable, for all that, to vote in favour of the reports as long as we have no guarantee that those who are to audit the accounts are being given all the information they need."
"The ombudsman is not entitled to receive full information; the Court of Auditors has complained that it is unable to obtain full information; in Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control, it is a permanent topic on the agenda; and our President, Mrs Theato, has severely criticised the new draft agreement between Parliament and the Commission, for the draft agreement will not give us the documents we are requesting, either."
"Let us reject it tomorrow."
"My personal experience of the Commission is of encountering a good deal of beating about the bush whenever I ask for information which ought to be available."
"Those who vote in favour of the draft agreement do not know how many committees and committee meetings they are approving."
"Nor do they know if there are any problems regarding the competence of any of the participants."
"Indeed, as a rule we do not know everyone involved in day-to-day legislation and in the administration of the now 800 billion being used."
"Nor do we know how much is being paid out to, for example, Danisco."
"As long as the Commission is not making the information available that the Court of Auditors and elected representatives are requesting, my group can be relied upon to vote against approving the accounts."
"Mr President, the European institutions must be aware that they have a responsibility and also an obligation to guarantee the European citizen an efficient and economical administration."
"Unfortunately though, the opposite still holds true, as borne out by cases such as Fléchard and the ECHO administration."
"The Commission is still denying Parliament access to information on these misdemeanours to this day, which on no account should we take lying down. Nor should we be surprised if European citizens continue to lose confidence in these administrative systems."
"Consequently, we Independents have no intention whatsoever of granting discharge to the report on the general budget."
"This ought to send out a clear signal that we are committed to creating efficient and economical administrative systems in Europe."
"Mr President, this brings us to the conclusion of a momentous two years for the European Union, which began with the 1996 discharge and its refusal."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Stauner on the courage which she has shown in getting her report - although not much of it is in its original form - through this Parliament."
"We need, in this debate, to associate the 1998 discharge with that of the framework agreement which we will be voting on tomorrow."
"Hopefully we will see signs of a more democratic Europe as a result of these last few months."
"First, Parliament's role in the discharge has been shown to be one of extreme importance."
"The Council, by its absence today, shows its lack of interest in the way in which we, as a Parliament, have used our powers to begin the birth of a political Europe."
"Without the 1996 discharge there would have been no Wise Men's report, no Commission resignation and no real urgency for Commission reform."
"But not all of us in this House have been heroes."
"We have found ourselves split between countries, within countries, within delegations, often with strongly held views."
"It was the Socialist leader, Mrs Green, who took the biscuit by voting for a motion of confidence on a motion of censure, which she did indeed get."
"Miss Morgan now continues this particular inheritance by asking for a depolitisation of the discharge process."
"Indeed, one or two of her amendments, like removing paragraphs 47 and 48 of the discharge report today show that some of these amendments look more Commission-born than in Parliament's interests."
"But where to now?"
"Monitoring is necessary to make sure that what we have gained as a Parliament is maintained."
"Mr Prodi needs to be supported in his reforms of the Commission."
"Last but not least, our most important role is to make sure we have greater accountability and more democracy and that it is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning for Parliament's rights in the European institutions."
"Mr President, the new Commission should be judged on whether it has the courage and the will to implement reforms and put the legacy of the past in order."
"Our granting discharge for 1998 is, in reality, a vote of confidence."
"We are giving the Commission a chance to prove that it is different from the old Commission."
"I would also take the opportunity to call for a cessation of hostilities here in Parliament."
"Let us unite all the forces that are in favour of the Commission' s developing into a modern, open and effective institution."
"The European project can only succeed if we show zero tolerance for fraud, nepotism and corruption."
"Otherwise, we shall never get the people on our side."
"Let us cut across party lines and national allegiances."
"Constructive criticism of the Commission must not go unheard due to Parliament' s internal bickering."
"There are more and more people who think that we should simply forget the past and concentrate on changing the general way in which things are done, but I disagree with that view."
"We need to clean up the legacy of the past, or matters will never improve."
"I do not think we have received enough in the way of admissions from the Commission when it comes to the events of the past."
"This applies both to the Fléchard and ECHO cases, and I can assure the Commission that these matters have not been buried away, just because we are now giving discharge for 1998."
"We shall not forget them until they have been resolved in a proper and dignified manner."
"I am, on the other hand, very satisfied with the new initiatives the Commission has taken to clean up the area of development aid, but these have also been overdue."
"Both Mr Patten and Mr Nielson have been very critical of the way in which development aid has been administered."
"Mr Patten has said it is embarrassing for the EU and the Commission and called it the worst way of providing development aid. For Mr Nielson, it was enough to call it a 'a pizza service without delivery' ."
"I am also very pleased that Mr Nielson has instituted an investigation into the extent to which the delegations are fulfilling their responsibilities in the high-risk countries."
"He has also promised that disciplinary action will be taken if they are not in fact fulfilling these, and I am very pleased about that development, but do not imagine that we shall forget you."
"Finally, I wish to say that I think it was a shameless attack which Mr Dell'Alba made on Mrs Stauner."
"Mr President, let me first say a few words regarding the quality of the work of our rapporteur Mrs Stauner."
"She has been criticised, particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, yet she has produced an outstanding piece of work, and I wished to make that point today."
"Let me also say a few words regarding the speeches made by the Socialist Members."
"In all sincerity, without adding to the controversy, I feel that we have nothing to learn from the European Socialists regarding the use of funds."
"Let me say a few words on the Rühle report."
"We were all extremely shocked both by the massive misappropriation of European Development Fund resources and also by the Commission' s attitude, which was to carefully conceal its dealings from the Court of Auditors, the former UCLAF (unit for the coordination of fraud prevention) and the European Parliament."
"In spite of this particularly scandalous state of affairs, we have nonetheless adopted a positive attitude and have attempted, along with the new Commission, to provide valid and practical solutions to the underlying problem."
"The purpose of the agreements between the European Union and a good number of third world countries is to enable the latter to have balanced and sustainable development but, in order to do so, the funds allocated would actually have to get to the end-users and, as we have known for a long time, corruption and fraud are depriving entire regions of the greater part of these sums."
"To take just one example, the medical aid granted the Ivory Coast, particularly to combat AIDS, we are talking about some 38% of the aid being misappropriated, or almost EUR 30 million!"
"Mrs Rühle' s report represents, then, the very last warning issued to the administration of the European Development Fund, who have until October to implement radical reforms in order to fulfil the expectations of Parliament, all the citizens of the European Union and, most especially, the populations of the countries concerned, who still have a vital need for European aid."
"So, until October, when we shall meet again."
"Mr President, could I just remind Mr Poettering and his friends in the PPE group that, when the Court of Auditors drew up its report on the financing of political parties, it was his group which was criticised and it was the Socialist and Liberal groups which received a clean bill of health."
"Maybe this is due to the fact that the PPE-DE group is not one group, that the British Conservatives are allowed to run their own shop and that they keep their own accounts."
"It is they who must improve their books."
"Mrs Stauner had to be stopped for speaking too fast at the beginning of this debate."
"It is a telling metaphor for the work she did in committee."
"She ran ahead of the committee without the rest of us realising what was going on."
"She tried and condemned the Commission for not sharing the outlandish views she has of financial management and control."
"Even the Court of Auditors does not agree with her."
"The job of the Committee on Budgetary Control is not to hang the Commission out to dry for the duration of a parliament, but to ensure that Europe's citizens are served by an executive that implements its political priorities efficiently and effectively."
"Fortunately that view was shared by the majority of the committee."
"One of the disastrous consequences of this whole standoff has been the proposal that is before us tomorrow for a framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission."
"This agreement will restrict the rights of individual MEPs, of rapporteurs, to ask for information from the Commission."
"It is a short-sighted proposal and if we do not postpone the debate until September then we should vote against it."
"Finally I should just like to say, as we are about to listen to Mr Chirac and what he has to say about the French presidency, that I hope that he will also listen to what this Parliament has to say, and in particular to Parliament's view that it should be able to decide for itself where it meets, when it wants to meet, and that this should not be imposed by the governments of the Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, the statements made by some of my fellow Members have already contributed significantly towards expressing the discontent aroused by the report on discharge."
"I should like to address you in the same vein."
"Mrs Stauner' s initial report on discharge for the year 1998 gave rise to a great many questions and criticisms, which were expressed, in particular, in the vote in favour of an amendment noting the discrepancies between the compromise resolution and the explanatory statement."
"In drawing up her second report, the rapporteur apparently did not take account of her fellow members' general lack of satisfaction."
"Once again, we must deplore Mrs Stauner' s method."
"She kept on asking the Commission for more and more information, going beyond the recommendations made in the resolution adopted on 13 April."
"Today she is still asking questions which have already been explicitly answered."
"This attitude has led the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to make radical changes to the draft report."
"This is the reason why the text on which we are to vote during this part-session is substantially different from the initial draft."
"This text does now afford us a more comprehensive overview of the Commission' s implementation of the 1998 budget, but at the price of a political conflict dominated by a feeling of frustration."
"We can only deplore the far from constructive attitude of the rapporteur both within the parliamentary committee and with regard to the European Commission."
"We cannot fail to note the same petty political excesses that some of us already condemned in the initial report on discharge for the year 1998."
"Our objective must be to work in close collaboration with the Commission in the interest of our fellow citizens and of the implementation of our policies, and to make the discharge report a proper assessment of the implementation of the European Union budget in both quantitative and qualitative terms."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs - and indeed the people of Wales, because I did not realize they were so concerned about the Commission's welfare that they had elected someone to represent the Commission's views in Parliament rather than their own!"
"I would also like to say, just to correct something that Mrs Morgan said earlier, that I am very lucky in this debate, because my party declared in our manifesto - which helped so many of us on this side get elected - that we would not give discharge to any EU accounts until the Commission reform process had been successfully implemented."
"I cannot therefore follow the lead of our excellent rapporteur, who recommends granting discharge to the Commission, for the reasons I have already given and because many people outside this place have been wondering what actually improved between 1996 and 1998."
"Most people believe that things got worse within the Commission in that time rather than better."
"I only joined the Committee on Budgetary Control a couple of months ago, and to me the meetings and the reports of the last two months have raised probably more questions than they have answered."
"To close, I would like to ask two of those questions."
"Firstly, can the Commission confirm whether Mr Fléchard is related in any way to Mr Delors and/or members of his cabinet?"
"Secondly, can he confirm whether any of his or Commissioner Kinnock's cabinet have actively lobbied MEPs for support of the Socialist Group, and in particular for Mrs Morgan's amendments on the Stauner report?"
"If they have, would this not be an abuse of their position?"
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Stauner, my colleague and good friend, for her report."
"Sometimes we seem to forget that we are dealing with the discharge in respect of 1998."
"I have carefully read the Court of Auditors' report on the accounts for that year, particularly in relation to agriculture and the Structural Funds."
"I have come to the conclusion, having had a lot of experience in Parliament and with European affairs, that things have been steadily improving and that 1998 was one of the best performances we had."
"The difficulties which occurred - a 4% possible error in the area of agriculture and a little more in the area of Structural Funds - did not result from the failure of the European Commission to dispense those funds in an efficient way, but from a failure - and it was a small failure - to control the Member States and the European governments and to ensure that the Member States and their administrations had done the job in the way it should have been done."
"That is my first point."
"The second point is in relation to Fléchard."
"I do not think it is reasonable to inform the people of Europe that there was a loss of EUR 14 million to the European budget arising out of this case."
"To say this is to use a sort of accountancy jargon that puts the whole issue beyond the understanding of the ordinary European citizen."
"The truth is that in the Fléchard case, Fléchard was suspected of fraud, the Irish government fined and punished them to the extent of EUR 17 million."
"Fléchard took the Irish government to court and won an injunction preventing the Irish government from taking the EUR 17 million."
"The European Commission intervened at that point and proposed a settlement."
"The worst thing you can say about that settlement is that it was made on a legal basis which was not in effect when the crime was committed, but was in effect while the case was still open."
"It seems to me that equating that with a loss of EUR 14 million is a gross exaggeration."
"Finally, the lesson to be learned from this is that in the future we in Parliament have to cooperate with the European Commission to ensure that national governments do not, as in the past, interfere in their responsibilities, and that when the Commission takes national governments to task, it can rely on our support."
"Mr President, I would like to repudiate in the strongest possible terms, the accusation levelled at me by Mr Dell'Alba that I used my role as rapporteur for the discharge of the budget for the 1998 financial year for personal ends - I repeat, for personal ends - and his comment that as a German, I, or rather, we Germans, if I understood the translation correctly, would do well to put our own house in order."
"It went beyond personal insult and such verbal attacks are unworthy of our Parliament."
"I urge you to take suitable steps towards ensuring that Mr Dell'Alba avails himself of democratic manners like everyone else, even if - as I readily grant him - he obviously finds it difficult!"
"Statement by Presidency-in-Office of Council - Action programme of French presidency"
"The next item is the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of Council on the French presidency' s action programme."
"It is my very great pleasure to give the floor to the French President, Mr Jacques Chirac."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, thank you for welcoming me here today."
"Since 1 July, France has held the presidency of the Council of the European Union, and I shall be chairing the meetings of the European Council on two occasions."
"I therefore thought it appropriate to present the priorities of the French Presidency to this House."
"Last winter, when I was invited to participate in the inauguration of this new Chamber, I made a commitment to involving Parliament fully in the work of our presidency."
"I think it natural and necessary to conduct discussions and debates within the European Union in close collaboration with the men and women that represent the citizens, the men and women elected by the people of Europe, who have the task of representing their opinions in the debate on the future of Europe."
"Therefore, the French Presidency, represented in particular by Mr Hubert Védrine, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mr Pierre Moscovici, Minister of State for European Affairs, intends to maintain an ongoing open dialogue with Parliament."
"The citizens of Europe want more transparency in the operation of the European institutions."
"The time when decisions could be taken behind closed doors has passed."
"Nowadays, discussions within the European Union must take place in the light of day and, of course, here in the European Parliament."
"We shall also be working hand in hand with the European Commission."
"I should like today to express my confidence in and support for Mr Romano Prodi, the European Commissioners and all the parties cooperating with the Commission."
"Having come into office in quite exceptional circumstances, they have managed to lay the foundations for a radical reform which will bear fruit in the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just fifty years ago the 'Schuman declaration' laid the foundations for the building of Europe, undertaking primarily to reconcile Germany and France."
"I should, at this point, like to pay tribute to the memory of one of the great and ardent Europeans who paved the way for Europe, Pierre Pflimlin."
"He devoted his life to France, of course, and Europe, a bold and noble idea of Europe."
"This House acknowledged his commitment by electing him its president."
"We have lost a great and fine figure in this venture we are all involved in."
"Ladies and gentlemen, half a century of European construction has given rise to a profoundly original European Union, based on the common will of the nations which make up that Union, and today we clearly feel that we are entering a new phase in the history of European construction, which has already brought us peace, economic success and social progress."
"The fine and necessary project of enlargement is going to change the European Union, its modus operandi and, perhaps, even its very nature, at a time when it is intensifying its political dimension."
"At the same time, as the areas in which the European Union is becoming involved are expanding, the citizens are demanding, quite rightly, that it should be more democratic, more transparent and more efficient, and that it should be more diligent in respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"The debate on the future of Europe has thus been launched, and this is good news because is it essential in crucial periods to look further than the immediate concerns and time limits, and to set the course for the future."
"I had the opportunity to express my views on this subject last week."
"My comments were intended to shed light on the future and to express what the Europe of tomorrow could and should be."
"They, of course, extend beyond the limits of the French Presidency of the European Union."
"One thing is clear, however, and I stressed this in Berlin: all further progress of the European Union is conditional upon the success of the institutional reform."
"If the IGC were not successful, then it would be pointless to consider the next stages."
"The French authorities are fully aware of the responsibility they bear in this respect and they are approaching this presidency with the ambition to achieve progress or a successful conclusion in all the matters impacting on future development."
"They shall do so with a commitment to safeguard, and improve, that which gives our whole project meaning: the protection of fundamental values and the respect of national and cultural identities, the continual determination to reconcile economic performance and social progress and to fulfil the practical expectations of the citizens, and the strengthening of Europe' s role as a major player on the international scene."
"This is the spirit in which France intends to take forward the remarkable work achieved by the Portuguese Presidency, in close liaison with the Swedish Presidency which is to follow us on 1 January next year."
"We have outlined four objectives for this six-month period: firstly, to make the European Union ready for enlargement, next, to place Europe more at the service of growth, employment and social progress, to bring the European Union closer to the citizens in order to drive the message of our shared project home, and finally, to affirm Europe' s position in the world."
"The Presidency' s first focus is on making preparations for the future of Europe, post-enlargement."
"As I said, the reform of the European institutions is one of the primary issues of our presidency."
"Let us not make the mistake of underestimating the importance of the matters on the agenda."
"The composition of the Commission, revision of the weighting of votes and the extension of qualified majority voting are all of critical importance given the prospect of the enlarged Europe."
"If we do not manage to resolve these matters, the European Union will be sentenced to paralysis in the short term, and I am convinced that all the Member States are aware of this and are in favour of finding solutions."
"The French Presidency is also determined to make progress on the matter of intensified cooperation, which was added to the IGC agenda at the Feira European Council."
"The objective is not to set the divisions between Europeans in stone, but rather to introduce greater flexibility into the operation of the enlarged European Union by allowing those who wish to do so to travel more quickly along the common path."
"You may rest assured that we shall provide ourselves with all the necessary means to make a success of these negotiations, in which the European Parliament will, of course, continue to be very closely involved."
"The European Council in Biarritz, two months before the Nice Council, will be an informal summit, chiefly devoted to institutional reform."
"It should give the necessary impetus for an agreement to be signed in December, an agreement which is worthy of the importance of the issues involved."
"None of us, neither you nor us, can be content with a minimum agreement."
"(Applause)Reform of the institutions will pave the way for enlargement of the European Union."
"I am, as you know, a staunch supporter of enlargement."
"It will be an achievement for peace and democracy in our continent, and it will make the European Union all the stronger."
"The French Presidency is, therefore, determined to achieve real progress in the accession negotiations with all the candidate countries, based on their individual merits and implementing the principle of differentiation."
"Our objective at the European Council in Nice is to arrive at as comprehensive as possible an overview of the state of negotiations, in order to provide effective guidance for the work of future presidencies and to clearly signpost the route to accession."
"Bilateral dialogue with the candidate countries will, moreover, be stepped up, and dialogue will also be emphasised in the European conference of Heads of State and Government which I shall be convening in Nice prior to the European Council."
"The second focus of the French Presidency is a Europe at the service of growth, employment and social progress."
"Opting for the euro means opting for growth and employment."
"It is a success."
"We can already see the positive effects in all the countries of the European Union."
"Coordinating our monetary policies, however, must necessarily be accompanied by serious social ambitions and improved coordination of our economic policies."
"For many long years, France has been putting the case for employment to be the focus of the concerns of the European Union and the central objective of its policies."
"A great deal of progress has been made thanks to successive presidencies, particularly in Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne."
"The Lisbon European Council in March marked a crucial phase."
"It was there that we affirmed our strategic objective to restore full employment and activity for all, increasing employment rates among the working-age population of Europe to 70%, and we set ourselves a target of 3% average annual growth."
"The French Presidency will be following up the action initiated by this Lisbon Council."
"On the first day of France' s presidency, I was keen to invite the European Trade Union Confederation to visit me."
"As you know, I attach great importance to affirming the European social model as based on social dialogue, on social protection appropriate to the requirements of our time and on acknowledgement of the role of the state as the guarantor of social cohesion."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights will have to support this model."
"Our priority, then, will be the adoption of a ""European social agenda"" ."
"Economic growth and industrial modernisation are meaningful only if they represent a rapid fall in the rate of unemployment which, despite the positive results recorded throughout Europe in recent years, is still far higher than in the United States or Japan."
"Europe at the service of the nations also means the determination to make great efforts to achieve social justice, improve the protection of children and boost commitment to combating exclusion in all its forms, particularly in the face of the new challenges of the knowledge-based economy."
"The social agenda will make it possible, on the basis of the communication which the Commission has just submitted, to outline a five-year working programme involving all the operators concerned: Member States, the European Parliament, the Commission, unions and management."
"We are looking for ambitious projects in fields as important as social protection, the involvement of employees in company decisions, reconciling family life and a career and lifelong training."
"This is how we intend to support our European social model: by making progress on practical projects, backed by a strong political will."
"At the same time, we must step up liaison and coordination between our economic policies."
"This is necessary in order to consolidate the euro and to make sure that the current growth in Europe lasts."
"The French Presidency is today proposing to improve the operation of the 11 euro states, shortly to become 12, by making its work more visible and more authoritative, to enhance the coordination of our budget policies by making the Community inspection procedures more effective, to make progress in the harmonisation of our tax policies in the wake of the European Council at Feira and, finally, to take action to prepare our citizens for the forthcoming advent of the euro."
"It is vital that the citizens accept the euro."
"Everything possible must be done to make a success of this crucial phase in both practical and human terms."
"Finally, we must put Europe at the forefront of the information society, build up growth in the European Union on the basis of our training schemes - some of the best in the world - our tremendous scientific and intellectual potential and our industry, which is a world leader."
"France will be endeavouring to develop fully the decisions taken under the Portuguese Presidency: support for innovative firms thanks to new risk capital developments, the establishment of a Community patent, the framing of a European scoreboard for innovation, the creation of a highly flexible network of scientists and the development of European projects, the fight against cybercrime."
"We must also ensure that the benefits of these new technologies are accessible to all, avoiding the creation of a digital divide, and, in particular, supporting Internet connections for all European schools by the end of 2001, as decided."
"We shall also be very attentive to enhancing Europe' s position in the highly strategic biotechnology sector, while, of course, monitoring the observance of the ethical rules which must be applied to any scientific, inventive or industrial activity involving living organisms."
"Growth and solidarity must benefit all the regions of the European Union, particularly the island regions which must be helped to overcome their handicaps."
"The Presidency will also ensure that links with the outermost regions are consolidated and intensified."
"The new terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam now have to be implemented to ensure that the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments benefit from the rights, advantages and specific Community policies due to their specific features and constraints."
"The third focus of the French Presidency will be to bring Europe closer to the citizens."
"This is now the legitimate concern of all successive presidencies leading the European Union."
"Europe still seems far too remote in the eyes of many of our fellow countrymen, who find it hard to see what Europe gives them or can give them in their everyday life."
"It is high time that the European Union took more notice of the matters of concern to the ordinary citizen. Let us achieve a Europe of the people."
"The adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up with the active participation of Members of this House will make it possible to enshrine in a single text the values, principles and rights which are the basis of our Union: civil and political rights, economic and social rights."
"It is crucial that the Convention responsible for framing the text completes its work in sufficiently good time in order to be able to deliver the charter by the end of this year."
"We shall also be promoting this Europe of the people by building the Europe of mobility, of knowledge and of young people."
"While respecting Member State authority in the field of education, we must also staunchly support individual exchanges, particularly at university level."
"Looking forward to the European Council of Nice, the French Presidency will be surveying the obstacles to the mobility of research workers, students and teachers, and investigating ways to overcome them."
"We must be ambitious and adopt a substantial increase in exchanges within the European Union as our goal."
"It is the synergy between European laboratories and firms, and the strengthening of the many important centres of research and innovation in Europe, which is at stake here, not to mention a certain vision of dialogue between cultures and cultural diversity and, ultimately, European citizenship, the feeling of belonging to the same political and human unit."
"In more practical terms, the French Presidency intends to achieve progress in initiatives likely to improve the daily life of Europeans, firstly in terms of public health and consumer protection."
"The traumatism caused by the mad cow epidemic and by other similar threats is forcing us to set up an independent European food authority."
"I know that I shall be able to count on the support of this House in this undertaking."
"We must also achieve recognition for the precautionary principle at European and international level, and make progress in the labelling and trackability of genetically modified organisms."
"Let us never forget that agriculture is the first of our common policies."
"The French Presidency will be particularly attentive to the WTO in the context of enlargement negotiations and in considering the problems encountered by specific industries, such as pig farming and the fruit and vegetable and banana industries."
"As for the environment, the main focus will be on the safety of maritime transportation and the transportation of dangerous substances and petroleum products."
"The ecological disaster caused by the wreck of the Erika is all the more intolerable in that it was due to human negligence."
"The French authorities are firmly resolved to make tangible progress in the coming months, on the basis of existing and forthcoming proposals from the Commission and from the authorities themselves to prevent our coastlines suffering a recurrence of this tragedy."
"Apart from this, Europe will continue to be in the vanguard of the fight to protect our environment."
"The environment must be ever better integrated into European policy."
"We are familiar with some of the environmental risks connected with the globalisation of the economy, which may irreversibly compromise the living conditions of future generations."
"Accordingly, the French Presidency is committed to arriving at a good agreement, as good as possible, next November, at the Hague conference on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, and will ensure that the Kyoto Protocol is properly implemented."
"(Applause)In the field of justice and home affairs, the French Presidency will ensure that the decisions taken in Tampere in October 1999 are followed up in an ambitious manner."
"There must be progress in implementing a European asylum and immigration policy with regard to three specific points: the issue of long-term residence permits, the harmonisation of reception conditions, and the fight against illegal immigration and the associated 'industry' ."
"We all have the Dover tragedy in mind."
"In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Presidency will draw up specific measures regarding sanctions against parties responsible for trafficking."
"There will also be particular emphasis on combating drugs and the financial crime often associated with it."
"In particular, Europe will have to contribute towards the adoption of measures to combat money laundering effectively in support of the action undertaken in the context of the G7 Okinawa Summit, in Japan. I shall have the opportunity to stress this point."
"Finally, we are resolved to make progress in achieving a European area of justice based on the mutual recognition of legal rulings and judgements."
"Permit me, in concluding this chapter on the Europe of the citizens, to say a word or two about sport."
"Now that the Euro 2000 football championship, which gave Europeans so much pleasure and so many thrills, is over,"
"(Applause)we must ensure that the European Union takes the specific nature of sport and its social role into more careful consideration."
"There is a real problem which must be investigated and solved."
"The French Presidency will make every effort to do so."
"(Applause)The fourth and final focus of our presidency: a Europe with a strong international role."
"In terms of the common foreign and security policy, the French Presidency will make a point of affirming the European identity, with the support of the High Representative and the Commission."
"One of its priorities will be to consolidate the Europe of defence and security which has experienced spectacular progress in recent months."
"This legislation must be put into practice and developed."
"In the operational arena, we are to hold the Conference on the commitment of capabilities, in order to give the Helsinki objectives due credibility."
"We would also like to see the interim bodies in place in Brussels since 1 March fulfilling their given role in the transition to the final phase."
"In particular the interim Political and Security Committee, intended to replace the Political Committee, should gradually become the mainspring of the CFSP, supporting and with the support of Mr Javier Solana."
"Finally, the arms industries must confirm the ambitious European defence policies by their harmonisation and their cooperation programmes."
"The results of recent months have been very positive in this respect, in terms of helicopters, missiles and the future transport aircraft."
"In all these areas, the French Presidency will spare no effort to ensure that Europe provides itself with ample resources for its foreign policy, in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, of course, with its allies."
"Geographically speaking, in addition to the summits scheduled with its major partners - the United States and Canada, Russia and Ukraine - three main priorities are discernible in the field of the CFSP:"
"the Balkans, and the continuation of the stabilisation process which has commenced, in both the military and the economic sector."
"The European Union must provide the countries in this region with a clear European perspective in order to persuade them to undertake reform and to cooperate at regional level."
"This is the purpose of the summit the Feira European Council proposed should be held between the European Union and the counties of the Western Balkans;"
"the Mediterranean, with the fourth meeting of ministers in Barcelona and, circumstances permitting, the first Euro-Mediterranean Summit to be organised in Marseilles."
"This will offer an opportunity to give new impetus to the Barcelona process by means of adopting a peace and stability charter and by strengthening economic and cultural links between the two shores of the sea we share."
"Then there is Asia, with the third Asia-Europe summit (ASEM) and the bilateral summits between Europe and China and Europe and Japan."
"Here too the French Presidency wishes to develop fully the relations it considers essential in order to construct the balanced multipolar world of the future."
"The French Presidency is also keen to ensure that the new convention between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries is implemented efficiently."
"Europe must be strong and open to the world."
"It must therefore play its role fully and consistently and show solidarity, in order to enable a new round of global and balanced negotiations to be launched within the World Trade Organisation."
"As you can see, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the route map that France has set itself for its Presidency of the European Union is both ambitious and very specific."
"In the first place, we must ensure that the institutions of the European Union are operating properly at this time when the Union is set to radically change its appearance."
"Tomorrow, the number of Member States will have more than doubled and we must find procedures to enable decisions to be taken and Europe to make progress while strengthening its efficiency and legitimacy."
"This is precisely what is at issue."
"The European Union will only retain its dynamism and its strength if we are able to ensure that it is appreciated by the very people it serves, i.e. the citizens of Europe."
"The European Parliament also shares these concerns."
"By working hand in hand, with mutual trust, on each of these matters, together we shall succeed in taking Europe through the phases that are essential for the future."
"It is my conviction that, in six months' time, when I come back to this Chamber to review our Presidency, Europe will not be quite the same."
"We shall have consolidated the edifice by making it more welcoming both for those that already reside in it and those that wish to enter."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the French Republic, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to stand here before you at the start of this new Presidency."
"It is always a very exciting moment when the torch is handed over in the race to achieve Europe' s goals, and the fact that we are in the year 2000 makes today even more special."
"Europe has already taken great strides towards its goal of economic regeneration during this first half of the year thanks to the Lisbon and Feira European Councils."
"Progress has also been made towards an extraordinary enlargement of the Union - enlargement which you have described, Mr Chirac, as a 'fine and necessary project' - and towards strengthening its institutions in preparation for enlargement."
"I would like to welcome your incoming Presidency, Mr Chirac, and say a few words on a couple of issues you raised in your speech."
"Firstly, I would like to say that I support one hundred percent your commitment to developing Europe' s social agenda."
"When I presented the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 in February, I announced that one of our major objectives would be to develop a new economic and social agenda for Europe."
"Less than five months on, I am extremely encouraged by the progress which has already been made in the implementation of the economic aspects of that agenda."
"The social aspects of Europe' s development are the other side of the same coin, and that is where we will focus our efforts during these next six months."
"The Presidency will, in particular, have to tackle a whole range of major issues in relation to which the Commission has already tabled proposals."
"Just a few days ago, the Commission adopted a social policy agenda outlining what needs to be done over the next two or three years to ensure that the conclusions of the Lisbon and Feira European Councils are translated into practical actions."
"I feel that this document strikes a good balance between the political directions agreed at Lisbon and Feira and our duties and powers under the Treaty."
"It should therefore meet with consensus at the Nice Council."
"Indeed, it is important for the Union to avoid creating inequalities in our society, all the more so in that we now have the right economic conditions to reduce these inequalities."
"The Commission therefore supports the Presidency in focusing on these issues."
"The anti-racism directive was recently adopted in a record time of only six months, and we now look forward to seeing the French Presidency take up the other aspects of this extremely important anti-discrimination package with the same drive."
"Indeed, the primary function of any anti-discrimination programme must be to secure equal opportunities for men and women, and we must also do everything in our power to put an end to that most detestable form of slavery, the trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation."
"One of the forms of inequality still present in European society is inequality of educational opportunities."
"At Lisbon, an action plan was adopted which now needs to be implemented, and I know that the Presidency will be taking strong measures to ensure that all our young people develop the abilities they need for integration into a knowledge-based economy."
"It is also our duty to advance this knowledge and increase the mobility of students, teachers and researchers in both quantitative and qualitative terms, as was proposed, at last, at Feira."
"I am glad that this subject has been raised, for it is an issue of major importance, the furthest-reaching implications of which have not yet been fully examined."
"Another source of inequality is the poverty trap in which too many European citizens find themselves."
"At Lisbon, the European Council committed the Member States to making great efforts to eradicate poverty, and a High Level Group on social protection is working with the Commission on this ambitious strategy."
"It is truly scandalous that extreme poverty still exists within our societies."
"At the Nice Council we should be aiming to achieve a consensus of positions on social exclusion, and the Commission has already put forward proposals on the matter."
"The Feira European Council also gave strong support to the Commission' s proposals in the area of food safety and committed the Member States to making progress on setting up an independent food safety authority as soon as the European Parliament has delivered its opinion."
"I am confident that this opinion will be given by the first October part-session at the latest."
"Once we have put forward our proposal, I look forward to seeing the plans for the authority move swiftly ahead under the French Presidency."
"We owe this to our citizens, who will not tolerate it if we drag our feet on matters of food safety, but we must also have a common approach to this issue if we are to maintain our internal market."
"We have all learnt from the recent problems and I feel that everyone is now ready to shoulder their responsibilities."
"The European public is extremely concerned about environmental issues, and I stand alongside the French Presidency in the intention Mr Chirac has expressed to make the protection and improvement of the environment one of our key priorities."
"Important decisions on climate change will have to be taken in November at the 6th session of the UN World Conference on Climate Change in The Hague."
"At this conference, which will be one of the most important to take place since Kyoto, the Union will have to confirm its leadership role: we must fulfil the commitments we made at Kyoto and maintain the pressure on our partners to fulfil theirs."
"The impact of our transport and energy policies on the environment, and, in particular, climate change, will be a key theme in two documents the Commission intends to submit to Parliament and the Council this autumn."
"The first is a Green Paper on the common transport policy and the second is a strategic document on different energy sources and the security of energy supply."
"These are issues of considerable concern to the European citizens, and they expect us to take effective action, especially as the situation now stands."
"The citizens are also extremely concerned about oil pollution disasters on their coastlines, and if we want to avoid repetition of these disasters the Council and the European Parliament must act swiftly and adopt a package of measures on maritime safety, as we have already proposed."
"Another important issue which is of concern to the citizens is the use of genetically modified organisms and biotechnology."
"We must ensure adequate protection of human health and the environment while at the same time allowing society to benefit from the development of modern biotechnology."
"We therefore urgently need to adopt the new framework legislation on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms."
"This series of provisions strengthens and improves the existing framework, and it is important that we achieve a balanced response that inspires both public and market confidence."
"We therefore have a common, ambitious programme for the next six months and it seems to me that the various lines of action can all be traced back to a strong desire for a better quality of life."
"At all levels of society, the citizens are calling throughout Europe for an improvement in social, ethical and environmental quality. We must heed this call."
"This is why I want to end by emphasising the need for a constructive relationship with our new neighbours."
"One of the major challenges facing the European Union is the need to stabilise our continent, and promoting stability in the regions on our borders must clearly be a central part of that strategy."
"We therefore fully support your proposal to organise a political summit between the European Union and the most democratically advanced Balkan countries."
"The Commission has already started to lay the foundations for this Balkan summit and we look forward to working closely with the French Presidency in order to make more detailed preparations."
"I have recently had occasion to reflect on the increasingly important continuum of interaction between the European institutions."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, our legislative system has been working ever more efficiently under the new codecision procedure."
"This procedure applies to a greatly increased range of legislation, yet there has been less need to resort to conciliation."
"A recent survey shows that more than half the legislative proposals put forward over the past year were adopted in two readings and almost a fifth required only one reading."
"This means that the legislative process is maturing and becoming more and more consensual."
"I find this encouraging, given that the Commission has recommended to the IGC that the scope of the co-decision procedure, together with the qualified majority voting procedure, should be extended."
"It will give even more democratic legitimacy to the European legislative process, and this is vital to the political health of the Union."
"President Chirac, I welcome your commitment to the success of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, that is to the necessary reform of our institutions."
"Your commitment gives a clear, positive signal to our candidate country negotiating partners."
"In Biarritz and in Nice, Europe will need all your skills and a great sense of responsibility on all sides."
"We are all aware of how essential it is to reinforce our institutions and make them function more effectively."
"This is the essential precondition for enlargement."
"We will have various other opportunities to go into this question in greater detail."
"Today, let me simply stress an obvious point, which is, moreover, the crux of what we want to achieve in Nice and beyond. With 27-28 or more States, the Union will need stronger institutions, not weaker ones."
"We will need a stronger, not weaker democratic commitment and a stronger, not more elusive legal system."
"In this respect, it therefore an illusion to believe that the 'Monnet method' is a thing of the past, something that could be more effectively be replaced with ad hoc arrangements."
"The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice are our institutions, and they provide the guarantees and the checks and balances without which nothing lasting can be built."
"Because they are so essential we must work to improve them, and this is the task to which we are all committed for Nice."
"The next six months are clearly going to be busy, and I am convinced that by the time France hands over the torch to Sweden, we will have made very considerable progress in building the Europe our citizens want and expect."
"Madam President, I want, on behalf of my group, to express a very warm welcome to Mr Chirac both in his role as President-in-Office of the Council and for coming here as President of France to underline the importance which France and he personally attach to the work of this presidency."
"Last Sunday, thanks to ""the blues"" , France became Champions of Europe."
"I hope that, under your Presidency, France will once again become a champion for Europe!"
"We have listened with great interest to your speech today and to the speech you made last week in Berlin."
"Both make important contributions to the European debate."
"The Europe of tomorrow matters to all of us."
"Much in the European debate is unsettled."
"What is the territory of Europe; what are its function, identity and values?"
"In launching such a debate you have done Europe a service."
"However, the incentive to speculate on tomorrow's Europe should not become a disincentive to act on today's Europe."
"As we contemplate enlargement, today's Europe of fifteen has, as you have remarked this morning, major tasks in hand."
"One cannot underestimate the importance of the ""Amsterdam leftovers"" as we prepare ourselves for this enlargement."
"You have spoken of having more than an accord à minimum."
"We certainly agree with that."
"My group attaches very great importance, as you have done today, to a charter of fundamental rights as part of the package that we contemplate in Nice."
"Like you, Mr President, we believe that Europe should be based on the values of freedom, dignity, tolerance, democracy and rights."
"We respect the role of the European Commission in bringing balance to our debate and our respective interests."
"We value the access which our citizens have to democratic checks and balances - through this House and elsewhere - in the formulation of European legislation."
"We value transparency and working in public on the record, not behind closed doors."
"We value the rights of citizens to appeal to the European Court of Justice where they perceive injustice."
"None of these things are characteristic of intergovernmentalism."
"We must be cautious about a drift in that direction."
"My group believes that a strong Europe needs European institutions with a key role for the European Commission."
"I agree with you that we should have a constitution for Europe."
"We can launch a debate on that but clearly it is too complex a question to resolve in the next six months."
"I would express one hope: that this debate does not become a third lock on the door of enlargement."
"Helsinki set two tests: firstly we must reform ourselves in Nice; secondly the candidate states must take on board the acquis communautaire."
"We should not add a third lock on the door by saying we must have a constitution before they join."
"It is our historic task to bring about a successful enlargement."
"I know from your remarks that you agree with that."
"It is important to give that reassurance."
"I believe that France, once again, has the opportunity to champion the cause of Europe."
"We wish you and your government every success in the next six months."
"Mr President, there was a time, when you yourself, Mr Chirac, took sides against the foreigner."
"What a contrast there is between your Cochin address and your speech to the Reichstag, in which you gave a foreign parliament the first taste of your federalist thinking, supporting the idea of a European constitution!"
"Have you changed or have times changed to this extent?"
"Does one have to be modern to have the support of a few well-meaning broadsheets?"
"Or indeed, as in the case of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is the need of the moment all the explanation necessary?"
"Was it really necessary - although not very Gaullist even in 1974 - to become a centrist under Mr Mitterrand, even though the support you gained on the left was more than offset by the support you lost on the right?"
"You recommended saying 'yes' to Maastricht because the 1995 presidential elections were drawing close."
"It would have been a simple matter to dismiss the single currency, the so-called single currency, and put it off forever but you preferred to reduce France to the mediocre level of a general council, rather than the rank of a statesman."
"Because Mr Mitterrand had had his Treaty, you wanted one of your own, in Amsterdam."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam proved insufficient, you are looking for another, this time in Nice."
"Basically, you are acting like a political schemer of the Third Republic, constantly underestimating France' s potential and overestimating that of your rivals."
"You have not noticed that in the nuclear age, the electric age, strength no longer lies in numbers, and that, in order to maintain its leading position, France must continue along the path initiated by General de Gaulle."
"(Mixed reactions in the Chamber) Defending France' s interests alone in all areas - but you are, of course, all anti-Gaullist over there, that goes without saying - in all areas and always, being restricted as little as possible by international commitments, such as Europe, NATO, the UN, G7 -8 -9, not waging war on behalf of others, not ratifying the treaties before the others do."
"How can you possibly claim that this supranational Europe strengthens France' s hand, when France holds only 11% of the votes within European bodies, a percentage which does not even match its economic power and still less its position in the field of leading edge technology?"
"By instigating a simplification of the closer cooperation procedures, you have offered our European partners a two- rather than a three-way directorate."
"I hope that those who are excluded from this will be opposed to the attempt which, in fact, is playing into the hands of the Germans."
"Is that not right, Mr Cohn-Bendit?"
"Belittling France by allowing important decisions to be taken without France' s agreement, when, through this closer cooperation, European treaties may, if necessary, be amended to the detriment of France..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, Mr President, France is assuming the presidency of the European Union for the next six months."
"While it would seem necessary and legitimate to seek to reform the institutions and to give them a new lease of life, given that the system is so flawed and lacking in democracy, we should nonetheless not forget the main thing, which is the welfare, respect and full development of the peoples which make up the nations of Europe."
"I am a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities."
"This name in itself represents our programme, whose prime objective is to ensure that the identities and aspirations of each country are taken into optimum consideration, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Following the crisis of the Santer Commission - which rocked the institutions - why the devil did they bury the expert committee' s report exposing the serious mismanagement within the institutions?"
"We must learn the lessons of the past in order to make preparations for the future to avoid, once again, strengthening the powers of the Commission, a technocratic structure operating without transparency or democracy."
"Should we not challenge the political dimension it has granted itself?"
"We cannot be content with a Europe adopting ever more dehumanised texts that are too far removed from the needs of the people, who are often the victims of such texts in their daily lives, especially when the vague nature of such texts often means that the final decision is made by the Court of Justice which, by dint of its power of interpretation, sets itself up as a true legislative authority, but without any political supervision."
"We reject government by officials as much as we reject government by judges."
"Consequently, the IGC must not be the instrument of a reform which will turn the Europe of tomorrow into a technocratic monster, ever more ignorant of the peoples' legitimate concerns and of the opinion of the national parliaments that represent them."
"We cannot agree to this reform granting some states the right and the power to force binding texts on states which are unwilling."
"The institutional reform we are promised is putting a stranglehold on our nations, especially the smallest ones."
"New administrative and voting systems are being created which give power and hegemony to those that some people call pioneer states."
"This is not acceptable."
"Diversity must be respected, and we must allow diversities to be expressed, for they are the true wealth of Europe."
"Whereas the construction of Europe ought to be seeking to achieve coordination between the policies of Member States, the objective of integration is leading us towards an intolerable process of uniformisation."
"This accelerated uniformisation, the origin of the single model, runs counter to the very thing that we strive to safeguard every day, namely diversity."
"How is it possible to claim to defend the individual' s aspiration for a better life when every day challenging our cultures and our traditions a little more?"
"The fact is, behind the institutional debates, there are a number of particularly important subjects, such as employment, health, food safety and the protection of local products."
"In addition, there is the entire debate on balanced regional development and respect for the users of territories, and also the future of public services and state monopolies."
"We maintain that the French-style public service, which is of particular structural value in terms of regional planning and social cohesion, such as postal, railway and energy services, etc., must be defended against the Commission' s position."
"Does defending the national interest make one anti-European?"
"Does asking for the directives such as those on 'birds' , 'habitats' , 'open air markets' or 'biotechnologies' to be amended make one anti-European?"
"On the eve of enlargement, we need to carefully consider this acquis communautaire that some parties would like to make 'immutable' in principle, with scant regard for democracy and subsidiarity."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we hope that you will have the determination to restore the right of expression to the elected representatives and the various peoples of Europe in order to prevent a new rural and territorial divide."
"In order for France to speak with a single voice, it is the voice of the people which must be heard."
"The 'blues' showed us the way."
"It was a fine victory, Mr President, but the championship was possible only thanks to the Europe of the nations!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I have listened with great interest to the speeches by the representatives of the various groups and I am pleased to have this opportunity to express a few thoughts on these."
"I should like, first of all, to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, who summed up the situation at the beginning of the French Presidency with great clarity."
"I am pleased to learn of the intentions which he announced on behalf of the Commission, which are generally in line with those of the French Presidency."
"We already had an opportunity to note as much yesterday as, according to the tradition, there was a working meeting between the government, all the Commissioners, the Commission President, the Prime Minister and myself. This enabled us to observe the synergy between our concerns and ambitions."
"Mr Prodi mentioned codecision in particular, and expressed his pleasure at the fact that this procedure was being gradually improved and was becoming more common."
"He looked to the IGC to extend the use of codecision. This is, as you know, one of the objectives of our presidency, along with the extension of qualified majority voting."
"Chairman Poettering made a brilliant and generous speech, for which I must thank him particularly. I appreciated it greatly."
"He mentioned a number of subjects."
"Mr Chairman, the presidency can already answer your question regarding greater transparency on the part of the Council."
"It has been announced specifically that the French Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for European Affairs will come to the European Parliament after every 'General Affairs' Council to inform Parliament and to ensure the necessary dialogue with Parliament."
"This is one step in the direction you suggested, and I hope that it will serve to improve relations between our two great institutions and also, of course, to clarify the development of the subjects under discussion."
"We also share your concern to have strong institutions, as you emphasised."
"I said as much yesterday in Paris, at the meeting with the Commission."
"I said this to Mr Prodi. This is a prerequisite if our work is to be effective and if the European Union' s role on the international stage is to be asserted properly."
"Let me add, to respond to a concern you expressed, that I endorse completely the idea you put forward to the effect that we need a single institutional framework and, above all, no parallel frameworks."
"That goes without saying."
"Everything that can give new impetus to the construction of Europe must be achieved both within the institutions and in accordance with the acquis communautaire."
"This is perfectly plain as far as the French Presidency is concerned."
"I have taken note of the wish to see that the Court of Justice is given the necessary resources."
"Chairman Barón Crespo, who appears to be as familiar with the subtleties of the English language as he is with the French, mentioned a number of subjects which lie at the heart of the presidency' s thinking."
"Regarding the European social model, one of the main objectives of the French Presidency is to arrive at an agreement on the social agenda in Nice."
"We shall do everything in our power to achieve this objective."
"Regarding public services, a subject mentioned by a number of speakers, the last of whom was Mr Saint-Josse, I should like to say that the French Presidency is very attentive to this matter."
"We are well aware of the need to modernise and adapt public services, but we also know that they are a key element in the equal rights and opportunities of all citizens within a country and that this equality cannot, of course, be subject only or mainly to the criteria of profitability, which would inevitably lead to people in unprofitable situations being deprived of services provided in other circumstances to people in cities, for example, in more favourable economic conditions."
"(Applause)"
"Quite obviously, this is not France' s ambition."
"For a long time I have represented an extremely poor, rural constituency in France, and I can tell you that I consider, and have always considered, that it had just the same entitlement - and indeed the same duties to contribute in the form of taxation - with regard to the main public services, the lifeblood of the nation, as any district in Paris."
"We shall therefore take great care to ensure that the necessary modernisation of public services is not confused with making them profitable, which would be a serious mistake."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Barón Crespo mentioned many other things, particularly closer cooperation, development of the social model and enlargement."
"He also mentioned the charter of rights."
"This is something to which we also attach great importance."
"We should like to see the convention, in which Parliament is to a great extent involved, issue its conclusions very quickly, before Biarritz, if possible, so that we can discuss them there."
"That also means that the charter must include all the values, all the principles and rights on which our convictions and our societies are based, i.e. not only civil and political rights but also economic and social rights."
"(Applause)"
"France is extremely keen to see economic and social rights clearly expressed in this charter."
"Indeed, this is the main demand from the European Trade Union Confederation, one I find legitimate and justifiable."
"If we wish to have a European social model, then it must be based on clear principles, which must be clearly defined, and they would best be expressed in the charter."
"The problem, which a number of speakers mentioned, of integrating the charter into the treaty is one which has yet to be discussed."
"The convention' s conclusions have not yet been published. We should await their conclusions on this subject."
"At the present stage, the opinions of the various operators involved are still, I would say, rather contradictory and have not, in any case, been firmly expressed."
"We need time before we give our opinion on this."
"I am not absolutely sure that a clear decision can be taken in Nice. If it is possible, so much the better."
"At any event, France' s ambition is to see the advent of the charter in Nice, a charter with the scope and ambition to which I referred just now."
"Chairman Cox, like Mr Poettering, pointed out the importance he attached to strong institutions."
"My response is similar."
"I think it essential to have strong institutions, i.e. which have the necessary power to accept their responsibilities, but also the power to avoid deadlock."
"It is clear right now that we are in a situation where the prospect of enlargement may lead to deadlock if we do not take the action required to enable Europe to overcome the sluggishness which is going to increase with enlargement."
"This, indeed, is the reason why we attach so much importance, firstly, to the problem of the weighting of votes and, secondly, to the problem of closer cooperation."
"Closer cooperation is in no way intended to create a Europe divided between those in the vanguard and those lagging behind, but simply to give the necessary impetus to the proper operation of Europe and thus to enable those that wish to go slightly faster in certain areas to do so, which will necessarily result in others being carried along in its wake."
"This is an extremely important and almost institutional factor in pulling people along."
"Mr Cox, you need have no fear on the subject of enlargement, which other speakers also mentioned, and which President Prodi discussed in a particularly firm manner."
"If we want to make absolutely certain of the success of institutional reform, i.e. the IGC and the related Treaty of Nice, it is because we want enlargement to go ahead as speedily as possible."
"Enlargement as quickly as possible is not, of course, synonymous with political decision."
"Enlargement is not a political decision."
"It is a shared political determination to be capable of applying the same rules throughout the Europe of tomorrow."
"Of course, it presupposes a determination to enlarge on the part of the European Union: this is clear and not seriously challenged by anyone."
"It also, however, presupposes a determination on the part of the candidate countries to undertake the reforms necessary to be able to join the European Union, without which the Union would be disrupted and the states joining without having undertaken the necessary reforms in order to adapt to the Community standards would face major social, economic and political difficulties."
"In this spirit, we are absolutely determined, Mr President, to ensure that the negotiations undertaken with each candidate country are continued and intensified."
"We shall carry out our work in this field as quickly and as well as possible, with a view, I would stress, as President Prodi said just now, to enlarging as quickly as possible."
"There is no doubt about it."
"The point of constructing Europe in the first place was to establish peace, and to cause it to take root, after so many pointless fratricidal wars; establishing peace and, consequently, democracy, since they go together."
"Peace and democracy cannot be established within just one part of Europe, they must be established throughout the whole of Europe."
"We can discuss Europe' s frontiers afterwards - that is another matter - but peace and democracy must apply to the whole of Europe."
"Enlargement, then, is not just a moral requirement of candidate countries, but is also in the fundamental interest of a Europe that one wishes to see existing tomorrow, based on the principles of peace, democracy, human rights and freedoms."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Lannoye specifically mentioned the problem of closer cooperation."
"I have just answered this."
"He also mentioned the state of the world today in terms which, I must admit, moved me and which I endorse."
"It is true that we live in a world where the gap between rich and poor is increasing."
"The UNDP report for 1999, by which I mean not the report tabled this year but last year, gave an example which, although not significant, is still striking, saying that the three largest private fortunes in the world today are equivalent to the sum of the gross national products of all the least developed countries, representing 600 million people."
"What is more, it can be observed that this phenomenon is on the increase, and so is the resulting exclusion, and this is one of the main dangers of today' s world."
"Major debates are underway on the subject of globalisation, as Mr Lannoye pointed out."
"I am not, of course, going to enter into such a debate right now, even though Europe cannot remain apart from these debates, and so the Presidency, like the Commission and Parliament, must necessarily get involved."
"Globalisation is clearly inescapable and inevitable and is, for the most part, the result of the development of techniques and technology."
"It also provides some advantages because it does facilitate trade and, nowadays, trade is the greatest creator of wealth."
"It does, therefore, have positive aspects, which it would be foolish to deny."
"It also has dangers, however, in three areas in particular."
"Firstly, the danger we have just mentioned: the exclusion of those who cannot go as fast as the others."
"This is true in terms of the citizens within a single country and today we can observe an increase in exclusion despite strong growth and declining unemployment."
"It is also true in terms of nations, where we can see rich counties getting even richer and poor countries, alas, becoming even poorer, as Mr Lannoye said just now."
"(Applause)"
"This is a shift in world society to which we must be very attentive and which we cannot, of course, accept."
"The subject is to be discussed, moreover, in the near future in G7 and G8, but it is a subject of concern to everyone, especially Europe."
"The second risk of globalisation which has also been mentioned is the serious threat to the world' s ecosystem."
"As soon as one seeks to maximise profits, which is understandable to a certain extent because profits are a factor in progress, but as soon as one seeks to maximise profits without real restrictions that are internationally acknowledged and imposed in order to prevent excesses, then there comes a time when the damage inflicted on nature is such that it is no longer able to regenerate."
"It is not obvious, but it is a real problem, which must be taken seriously."
"(Applause)"
"The typical example mentioned by a number of speakers was the Hague Conference to be held in autumn on greenhouse gas emissions."
"If, as seems likely and even highly likely, scientists' conclusions indicate that these emissions present serious risks to the ecological balance of our planet, thus seriously compromising the legacy we are leaving to future generations, then there are grounds for carefully researching ways to control these emissions."
"For, as things stand at present, it is true to say that globalisation is going in exactly the opposite direction to this."
"The final disadvantage, the final risk of globalisation, involves everything related to large-scale crime."
"With the development of globalisation and advanced technology, with the Net, we can clearly see a trend for the considerable development of cybercrime in all areas: drugs, terrorism, crime of every kind."
"Therefore, globalisation does entail risks, but what exactly does that mean?"
"It means that we cannot challenge globalisation as such, because it is going to spread, whatever we do. We have to make the best of it, and this can be done by controlling it and giving it a human face, which means that we must be aware of the risks it involves."
"This is the clear message that all major institutions, particularly the European Union and its institutions, must send out throughout the world."
"(Applause)"
"This answer is also addressed to Mr Wurtz who also mentioned these problems, along with others, of course, particularly with regard to the Europe of the citizens."
"I of course share his feeling that Europe must be first and foremost a Europe of the citizens."
"We must respond to the concerns of everyday life."
"We do not do this enough, that is true, even though, in my opinion, a great deal of progress has been made in this area."
"The social debates which have been underway for three or four years now within the European Union could not have taken place seven or eight or ten years ago, when they would not even have been considered."
"So, there has been some progress."
"I have expressed my views on globalisation."
"I do not believe, Mr President, that Fortress Europe is any sort of ambition or, indeed, any sort of reality."
"Europe is open, by definition."
"Europe' s commitment is to supporting a range of values, a culture and an identity which represents, I would say, the synthesis of the cultures and identities of each of the nations in Europe, hence the importance of maintaining cultural diversity and defending each European nation' s right to retain its own culture, identity and language."
"On this basis, union, according to the old adage of strength through unity, is the only way to safeguard these cultures and identities in future when confronted with the multipolar world which is developing today and which is universally in evidence."
"Tomorrow, we will be faced with a vast China, a vast India, a large South-East Asia and an organised South America, not to mention North America."
"It is quite clear that if we are content to remain where we are now, divided to a greater or lesser extent, then we shall purely and simply vanish."
"It is only by being united and, at the same time, retaining our own identities that we will be able to survive and, in this context, we must not be a fortress but we must, nevertheless, combine our forces and our efforts."
"Finally, Mr Wurtz mentioned the notorious Tobin tax."
"I should just like to tell him that the reform of the international monetary system is on the agenda, as he well knows, and that, clearly, we must combat the instability of the financial markets."
"That is obvious, and I am, of course, committed to this."
"It is one of the subjects we shall also be discussing at the G7 meeting in Okinawa."
"In this spirit, I am willing to admit that we shall have to look closely into all the possible means of achieving this twofold objective of stability and equity, adopting an open-minded and realistic approach."
"For a long time now I been taking not of Charles Pasqua' s comments on gastronomy, and indeed on other matters, and so I was very interested to hear him speak, there is no question of that, even if I did not completely recognise the Europe that we are building together from his remarks and description."
"Clearly, we are not looking at matters from the same perspective."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"In particular, he brought up the word 'federal' or 'federation' many times in his speech."
"This is an old and very French argument that we have had in France and, indeed, it is based on the fact that the meaning we give this word in France differs from that given in other languages, especially German, and this interpretation has led to misunderstandings that have, of course, degenerated into arguments."
"Both Charles Pasqua and I have served a man who we admired greatly, President Georges Pompidou, who was accustomed to saying, as he did not appreciate pointless arguments, ""Federation, confederation or a federation, it is all a con federation in the end"" ."
"(Laughter) Perhaps it was a rather provocative thing to say, but there was also an element of Cantal or Auvergne good sense behind this comment."
"I would make a friendly suggestion that Charles Pasqua thinks about this."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Mr de Gaulle will probably understand that I do not share his views."
"Once again I heard him out, but let me take the liberty of saying that there is one right that I am not prepared to grant him, and that is the right to claim to be speaking on behalf of General de Gaulle."
"(Applause)"
"Last but not least, Mr Saint-Josse mentioned a number of matters which have already been touched upon, and I should just like to pick out one or two of the arguments he pointed out."
"Firstly, cultural diversity and implementation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"I unreservedly endorse the expression of this necessity, and the spirit thereof."
"It is true that our cultural diversity is a source of wealth, and that the principle of subsidiarity is an absolute necessity."
"Decisions must be taken at the right level."
"Let us not go back over the past, or over a few examples that would make easy targets. In order for the principle of subsidiarity to be properly applied, however, we need standard rules."
"I am thinking of a specific decision taken by the Commission, and subsequently challenged, particularly on grounds of non-compliance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"I observe, however, that it was the governments that asked the Commission to take this decision in the first place."
"(Applause)There is therefore some ambiguity, if you will, and the more of us there are, the more essential it will be to enforce strict application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This, of course, means that there must be a standard set of rules to avoid any sort of ambiguity."
"I repeat, and I said this in Berlin in another context and from another angle, we must be able to identify clearly who is responsible for doing what, otherwise it just will not work, as we saw in the example I mentioned just now."
"(Applause)We must make ready to state clearly what Europe is doing, what each of the nations that make up Europe is doing, and what, within the nations, a number of administrative levels participating in the political and human life of these nations are doing."
"I am thinking, for example, of the German Länder, but there are, of course, many other examples that could be cited."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have had the opportunity to make a few comments on the very interesting contributions made by the representatives of this House, and I thank you for the welcome you have given me here today."
"(Loud applause)"
"I should like to thank the President, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the very full answers he has given the group chairmen in this House."
"We shall carry on with our debate."
"The President is forced to leave us because the family of the hostage held on Jolo, Sonia Wendling, asked to meet President Jacques Chirac, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, to see how all these poor hostages might be released as quickly as possible."
"I am sure, Mr Hager, that you share the anxiety of these families."
"Madam President, you could not be more wrong."
"It is a matter of deep regret to me that the President-in-Office of the Council left the House just as the representative of the last group of delegates was about to speak, thereby registering his disinterest."
"The honourable members are left wondering whether this is an act against the Independents or against the first Austrian representative to speak in this debate."
"I fear that in behaving as he has done today, the President-in-Office of the Council, who spoke out against exclusion earlier on, is guilty of that very thing I therefore refuse to give my opinion on the programme of the French Council Presidency, owing to a suspected lack of interest, and I regret that such a signal has been sent out at the beginning of the Council Presidency."
"In spite of the foregoing, being an optimist, I hope that in future this Council Presidency, like others before it, will take cognisance of its neutral position, and that at the end of the day, normality will also return to the group."
"Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me, as president of the French delegation within the PPE-DE Group, to take the floor on the day that the French Presidency of the European Union presented its priorities."
"In his speech last week in the Reichstag in Berlin, which was universally recognised as historic, the President-in-Office of the Council opened up new perspectives for the French Presidency, and also, I hope, for the presidencies which are to follow."
"He not only asked the real questions as to why we should build Europe, who should be involved, and how it should be done, he also provided answers key to the future of a European Union embarking on an unprecedented enlargement."
"To those who prefer to focus only on the short-term but certainly essential reforms that are awaiting the French Presidency and that must result in the future Treaty of Nice next December, I shall respond that these major reforms will only be achieved successfully if they are guided not only by modern European history, but also by an ambitious and realistic vision of what the Europe of tomorrow must be - a strong, democratic and free Europe that carries some weight in the eyes of the world."
"We all know that in order to meet the considerable challenges which Europe faces today, we shall together have to work out how to clearly define our plan for Europe, all together."
"We must be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for having had both the courage and boldness to encourage our partners to engage in discussions but also to suggest the guidelines for these."
"Our fellow citizens await a Europe which at last has the determination to review its modus operandi and to strive to achieve greater clarity, greater transparency and greater efficiency."
"The reforms of the Commission and the Council must respond to these requirements."
"We must keep in mind that, even if it is not an easy task, France and its partners are under an obligation to achieve results."
"We must reach an agreement, and a good one at that."
"Far from clouding the issue, today' s debate has offered some clarification as to the direction of the action to be undertaken in the months and years to come, which I shall sum up as follows: bringing Europe closer to the citizens, all the citizens without exception, be they close to the decision-making centres or remote, economic modernisation and a social Europe, efficiency and a strong presence in the world."
"I have every confidence in Jacques Chirac, President-in-Office of the Council, and in his ability, along with our partners within the European Union, to meet these historic challenges."
"Mr President, I have a point of order under Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure, which moreover is expressly quoted on page 25 of today' s agenda."
"According to the schedule, the Council was to have 30 minutes' speaking time."
"President Chirac spoke for one and a quarter hours."
"According to the schedule, Members of Parliament were to be allowed to speak, but the President did not silence the people interrupting Mr de Gaulle."
"Instead she cut his speech to a strict three minutes, even though she had allowed the other speakers an extra minute and, finally, she did not allow the speaker on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members to speak."
"He was entitled to speak before the response from the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The President has not fulfilled her obligation to run debates in this House objectively."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on setting the course we are heading for beyond the French Presidency, but this forces us to mention the questions that will be raised, regardless of whether the intergovernmental conference is successful."
"Our heading cannot be just the institutional construction which we know particularly appeals to the French."
"It must also answer the question: what do we wish to achieve together?"
"Are we ready to draw the conclusions of the great leap forward undertaken by the French President' s predecessors?"
"I am thinking particularly of the matter of adopting the euro."
"The questions that we must also answer are those that our fellow citizens are asking."
"They aspire to see Europe operating better."
"Whatever the advantages of talking about our visions for the future, right now we have to respond to the aspirations of the men and women who make up Europe, and in order to do so, all the members of the French executive must be involved in order to make a success of this presidency."
"I believe that the projects undertaken by Lionel Jospin' s government, in France and in Europe, give the President-in-Office of the Council every opportunity to fulfil this objective."
"We must also make a success of this agenda, and this means, first and foremost, making a success of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Key political questions will have to be settled, but if we want the European Union to be in a position to make decisions, then first and foremost we have to move into the realm of the qualified majority."
"Moreover, Parliament requested that intensified cooperation be included on the intergovernmental conference agenda."
"We are pleased to see that this has been possible."
"We should like to see the right of veto cancelled for the transition to intensified cooperation, but this increased flexibility should not pave the way for an increasingly intergovernmental mode of operation."
"Then, I should like to tell the French Presidency that it can count on Parliament' s support to prefer rather that we have no Nice Agreement than a mediocre Treaty."
"Beyond the Intergovernmental Conference, we are also awaiting a review of the working methods and organisation of the European Union' s institutions."
"We are thinking, obviously, of the reform underway within the Commission, but also and perhaps more importantly, within the Council."
"The French Presidency has set itself the objective of placing Europe at the service of growth and full employment."
"This is a renewed objective, for which we think a necessary objective is to step up work within the euro-11 group, soon to be the euro-12."
"We are delighted that the French President has made a commitment to the greater visibility and authority of this body, which we consider to be a useful one."
"As regards the social agenda, once again we are pleased to see that the prospect of full employment is henceforth seen as embracing the whole of the European Union."
"We are delighted, moreover, to see the commitment of Lionel Jospin' s government to bring a number of essential directives to a successful conclusion."
"I am thinking primarily of the directive on information and consultation of employees, as well as the working time directive for mobile workers."
"The French President spoke of the Europe of men and women, the increased attention we must pay to the concerns of our fellow citizens."
"In this respect, the work undertaken within the Convention on framing the Charter of Fundamental Rights is absolutely essential."
"At the European Council in Biarritz, the Convention members will be ready to propose a comprehensive text which is to include economic and social rights."
"However, the European Council will also have to be prepared for Parliament demanding time and again that the possibility of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty should be tabled."
"We consider this to be an essential point."
"What is the point in recognising rights if no legal recourse is possible?"
"With a view to creating a Europe that is closer to the citizens, I shall not go through the French Presidency' s entire programme, I have just two points to make."
"One of these concerns the ""money laundering"" directive which, I believe, offers the progress that our fellow citizens wish to see."
"They cannot comprehend our reluctance in this area."
"In the field of reciprocal recognition of legal rulings, we are continually faced with situations where the divergent nature of our judicial structures involve our fellow citizens in serious personal deadlocks."
"We need progress here."
"Mr President, one final word to express how important we think it is that the French Presidency should also transform the acquis of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the subject of services of general interest."
"These services of general interest contribute to the social and territorial cohesion of the European Union, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The test we are going to have to face in this respect concerns the directive on postal services."
"Such services are also part of the modern world, for example Internet access for all."
"We hope that the French Presidency will be able to propose a framework directive on this subject."
"Mr President, the programme which the French President has just presented is both ambitious and realistic."
"I was, however, hoping for a clearer commitment regarding the fundamental rights included in the Union' s agenda, for two reasons."
"In the first place, these rights must be enshrined in the forthcoming Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In his speech, however, the President did not cite the examination of this charter as one of the main points of the European Council in Biarritz."
"In his response to the first speakers, he suggested that there could be some discussion of a proposal for a charter in Biarritz, but with a content that, he is well aware, would make it almost impossible to incorporate into the Treaties at the European Council in Nice."
"Is France, the homeland of human rights for two centuries, not going to set a more ambitious objective?"
"This would be a great disappointment."
"In the second place, since Amsterdam, fundamental rights have formed the foundations of our Union and should represent the constant reference for any Member State action."
"The creation of an area of freedom, justice and security is the most difficult undertaking before us, especially given that unanimity is still the rule."
"This is a good subject of investigation for the intensified cooperation to which the President recently referred once again."
"The President was the first to refer to the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty in connection with the Haider case."
"In adopting such a stance, he set a very high standard, not just for the Austrian Government but, indirectly, for all the others too."
"The measures the French Presidency has already announced in the areas of justice and home affairs appear to live up to this challenge."
"They are, however, merely plans at this stage."
"Let me therefore address the French Presidency with the words the Greeks used to address the most promising athlete in ancient times: hic rhodus, hic salta [here is your Colossus, now jump!]."
"Mr President, Minister, let me share a few comments with you in the intimate surroundings of the end of the day's sitting."
"Apparently, Europe is some sort of vamp provoking everyone into political promiscuity."
"I do not know, after listening to President Chirac' s comments, what political party he is going to wind up in at the end of his career, but the transformation is extraordinary, and it is true that we have taken twenty-one years to persuade President Chirac that Europe is something other than that which he believed when he made his Cochin address in 1978."
"I should like to say that I am still convinced that we are not going to have to work so hard over such a long period to persuade Prime Minister Jospin to at last grasp the European cause firmly."
"He is not always against it and it is safe to make minor observations like that without getting irritated!"
"I simply meant that I am convinced that it is no longer enough today to repeat things endlessly: President Chirac said many things that I agree with."
"Ambitious, yes, it is ambitious, but let us see tangible proof of this ambition!"
"I am sorry, for example, that he did not repeat what he said in Berlin regarding the agenda for a constitution."
"In Berlin, he said we should have enlargement plus constitution at the same time."
"I would have liked him to say the same thing before this House: enlargement plus constitution, at the same time, so that we might have a constitution by 2003 or 2004 or 2005 as well as enlargement."
"Secondly, speaking of a constitution, we must be careful not to be too naive."
"Who does what?"
"It sounds good but what does it actually mean?"
"For Europe means shared authority, and increasingly shared authority: in other words, the constitution ought to tell us who does what, and how, together."
"That is precisely the problem!"
"If it were quite as simple to perform political surgery, we would make faster progress."
"And then I must say that, as Paul Lannoye said, I am saddened when I hear people discussing foreign policy and sparing no expense on arms and defence without even mentioning conflict prevention."
"Europe' s role is also to invent an alternative foreign policy based specifically on preventing conflicts, on the need for ever fewer arms."
"I am not saying that we do not need arms, I am not so naive, but I do not want European foreign policy to be exemplified merely by top fighter planes and soldiers obliged to go to Bosnia or Kosovo, but instead by our ability to prevent a conflict arising in Bosnia or Kosovo."
"From this point of view, I would say that President Chirac is going in the right direction and I think that Prime Minister Jospin would be able to catch up with him if he were more clearly and resolutely pro-European."
"Mr President, Minister, one presidency follows another, but, hearing Mr Chirac, we realise that the speeches and the pious hopes regarding exclusion remain the same."
"It must, however, be noted that the fate of the fifty million poor people or the fifteen million unemployed people in Europe remains the same, whatever the presidency."
"Europe is democratically bankrupt. The operation of the institutions is quite outside the concerns and outside the control of the citizens."
"Europe is a liberalising machine deregulating public services at the expense of the people' s basic needs."
"Europe is a fortress favouring illegal trafficking in modern-day slaves, as the Dover tragedy showed."
"The demonstrations in Seattle, Geneva and Millau, however, show that another sort of Europe, another sort of globalisation, is possible."
"To achieve a democratic Europe, let us begin by bringing down the Schengen fortress and agreeing that all men and women have the same freedom of movement as capital, and let us regularise the situation of illegal immigrants."
"To achieve a social Europe, let us begin by banning layoffs on the part of firms in profit."
"Finally, to achieve a Europe of justice and solidarity, let us begin by setting up, and not just talking about, a Tobin tax, up to a level that would make it possible to guarantee the subsistence of the billions of children and adults totally without resources."
"For the people, these requirements are the priorities in the debate, which is certainly needed, on the weighting of votes or the right of veto."
"Mr President, Minister, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals in the TDI Group who, as everyone knows, are European federalists."
"For this reason, we will be paying extremely close attention to any institutional steps towards closer cooperation, which must be clearly and firmly established within the Community framework."
"I shall use my speaking time, however, to remind you that this Parliament asked the IGC to grant Parliament the right finally to decide on its own location."
"This is a fundamental right, and three hundred Members of this House, moreover, made it very clear that they are unhappy about being forced to come to Strasbourg twelve times a year."
"I hope that the French Presidency will take due account of this issue, which we consider to be extremely important."
"It is no coincidence that the Friday sitting has been abolished, Minister."
"It is because many Members of this Parliament are fed up with the problems they experience in getting to Strasbourg and in working properly in these conditions."
"Mr President, in view of the way in which the list of speakers has been manipulated today in order to put paid to my colleague Mr Hager, I have only this to say to you: if the Austrian referee Benko had broken all the rules in the game between France and Portugal, as Madam President has done today, then France would not even have reached the final."
"That is the funny side of it."
"The less amusing aspect of the conflict we are engaged in today is that there are several hundred delegates sitting here who are actually willing to accept this without protest!"
"Mr President, we are delighted with what Mr Chirac, the President-in-Office of the Council, has said at a time when we have the strong feeling that there is a deep crisis in Europe and when we would like to know where we stand."
"I should like to discuss the three factors which I think are at the root of the crisis in Europe today."
"The first is a profound questioning of all the institutional players in Europe; the second factor is the distance and the lack of understanding that separate the general public from the European institutions, and the third factor, which is the key to the first two, is a loss of perspective."
"For a long time, we in Europe felt that we knew where we were going."
"This is no longer the case."
"That is why many of us welcomed the speech made by the President of the French Republic to the Reichstag, particularly his decision to declare the European Constitution to be the key to all future mechanisms for change."
"Today, he has chosen not to use the same words."
"Many of us regret this because we feel that his statement that the ideas he expressed in the Reichstag went beyond the French Presidency of the Union, represents a fresh approach."
"We feel instead that the issue of Europe' s prospects, the issue of the architecture of a new Europe and the issue of the future European Constitution belong right at the heart of the French Presidency of the Union."
"These are not secondary or incidental issues, to be addressed at a later date; they should be addressed as a matter of priority and are at the heart of the discussions that we will be holding."
"If we are unable to respond to the issue of Europe' s prospects, we will not be able to respond to the technical issues that face us."
"This would be a missed opportunity for us."
"I shall sum this up in one sentence: work on the Constitution and therefore on Europe' s prospects must be clearly launched during the French Presidency."
"It must be launched at Nice."
"Mr President, Mr President, the French presidency' s programme is interesting and in no way devoid of substance."
"There is a lot one can agree with."
"I nonetheless wonder whether it is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity to talk about housing, health care and sport."
"Ought the EU really to be devoting itself to those kinds of issue?"
"The idea of a community of values is important, but opinions are divided on how this is to be achieved."
"Many of us are disappointed at Prime Minister Jospin' s statement to the effect that there will be no change during the French presidency when it comes to the 14 countries' boycott of Austria."
"The intensive discussion in recent weeks of our visions of Europe' s future has been stimulating, but it causes disquiet in the candidate States."
"Where exactly does the EU stand?"
"This is an issue to which Mr Cox also referred."
"The unclear signals give scope to populists with nationalist agendas in the candidate States who want to prevent their countries from becoming Members of the Union."
"Was it a coincidence that no statement was made at Feira to the effect that we should be ready for enlargement by the year 2002?"
"Does the French presidency' s policy concerning a further Intergovernmental Conference at the end of 2003 or the beginning of 2004 imply support for Chancellor Schröder' s proposal for a new conference on the division of labour?"
"Even in that case, the signals are unclear, which is alarming for the candidate States."
"To conclude, I would point to one instance of unilateral action which is worrying."
"Why did France discontinue Slovakia' s membership of the OECD, citing the EU' s directive on TV issues?"
"Was it right to do this off its own bat, without checking what the other Member States thought?"
"What was the reason for its action?"
"This has also given rise to concern in the candidate States about the attitude we take to their legislation and to their legitimate interest in being involved in OECD cooperation, which is economically important."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency' s ship is heavily-laden and we hope, particularly having heard Mr Chirac' s answers, that it arrives safely in Nice, in six months."
"Nice is founded on an ancient Phoenician settlement, originally named Nicaia, meaning victory, and we are certainly expecting victory on the part of the French Presidency, both for the current citizens of the Union and for those who will be joining it."
"We were pleased to note the Presidency' s will, ambition and clear-sightedness, particularly with regard to the contradictions inherent in some of our European policies."
"Global warming is one such problem."
"Like a sword of Damocles, it hangs over not only the Union, but over the whole world."
"Integrating this essential factor into all European policies is the political challenge to which we must respond."
"I am not convinced that this is the direction we are currently taking, in spite of all the fine words that have been spoken here this morning."
"Mr President, the historical issue concerning the French Presidency, for I do feel that it is a historical issue, is first and foremost to open up the way for the construction of a Europe for all Europeans."
"We invited the new democracies in Eastern Europe to join us now that they have put the ordeal of Communism behind them and we were right to do so. Nevertheless, we were fully aware that we would not fit greater Europe into the institutions of little Europe."
"Since then we have dawdled and dragged our feet over the reform of these institutions."
"Ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall and one year after the Helsinki decisions on enlargement, I see the new Intergovernmental Conference under the French Presidency as the kick-start that all Europeans expect of Europe. I say this because it is not only the size of Europe that is changing; it is also its very nature."
"If we consider Europe as a whole, we must define Europe and define its borders, its values and the European project. Any definition of borders raises the problem of Turkey, which, to my mind, should become an associate country rather than a fully integrated one."
"We must also think of Europe in a different light, not as a huge nation-state, with a super-government, a super-president, a super-administration or even a super-tax."
"Instead, we should see Europe as the construction of an area of genuine federalism, which protects the diversity of people and of nations, which has a clear constitution that defines and limits the powers of Europe and which applies the principle of subsidiarity and ensures that this will be strictly complied with."
"Today, the French Presidency has an obligation to achieve results."
"As the French President said, unless the IGC is successful, there is no point in thinking about the following stages."
"A review of decision-making mechanisms in order to prevent paralysis and a review of the functioning of the Council and the Commission are all on the agenda and I think that the projects for tomorrow and beyond must not conceal what is required today."
"The success of the IGC now will actually be the best basis on which to build the huge project for the greater Europe of tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency is going to be a particularly busy one."
"The Portuguese Presidency has done a great job and achieved major, innovative results at the Lisbon Summit. Now the Member States of the Union need to implement the results swiftly."
"However, not enough progress is being made at the IGC."
"There is a need for stronger political will and for the political level of the negotiations on reforming the Union to be raised immediately."
"It is therefore important that the debate on the future structure of the Union has been reopened following the positions adopted by Minister Joshka Fischer."
"Now, the first task must be to define at Nice certain priority issues referred to by President Chirac in his introductory speech, such as closer cooperation, the adoption of majority voting as the rule and the adoption of a decisive Charter on Fundamental Rights which will be included in the Treaties. This would be a basic step towards defining a European Constitution."
"We feel that these decisions are crucial in terms of the reform of the Union: without them any discussion of its structure will be academic, and it is clear that, now that the single currency and the Central Bank have been established, Europe is in need of new political unity and, as has been said, a fresh boost for economic growth and social cohesion."
"President Prodi reiterated these points."
"I therefore feel that we can assure the French Presidency that we will make every effort to make these next six months a success: we are aware that there are considerable political differences between the countries and that now is the time to adopt clear positions."
"In our opinion, there is a clear dividing line between those who want enlargement to bring less political integration and those who consider that greater political integration and clearly defined timeframes will be necessary."
"We feel that opinion is also divided over the form that the Union' s institutions should take after enlargement. There would appear to be a choice between developing the supranational components - strengthening the role of Parliament and the Commission - and enhancing the intergovernmental aspects."
"We would like to make it possible for the countries who so desire to cooperate more closely to present a united front in a number of sectors such as economic and monetary union, which is still far from being fully achieved, internal security, and defence and foreign policy, which represents an open, dynamic core of more advanced integration."
"As regards management of the economy, we support the establishment of a Euro-12, for we feel that, with the introduction of the euro, this is necessary for the Central Bank as well."
"We consider it essential to maintain the fundamental goals of the European Social Model - adapting it, of course, to the diversification requirements determined by the new economy - and introducing new forms of flexibility which are different from those governing the labour market: flexibility which makes its own rules."
"We believe in increased synergy between the European Parliament and national parliaments, but we are against commingling which undermines the fundamental consideration that the European Parliament is the parliamentary organ of supranationality elected by direct universal suffrage."
"I would like to make one last point regarding the European Union' s role in the international institutions."
"President Chirac delivered a highly Europeanist speech to the Bundestag, and committed himself to revitalising the development of the European Union and providing it with a Constitution voted in by the European citizens."
"We support these proposals."
"President Chirac once again expressed French support for the German application for a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council, confirming his intention to strengthen the French-German axis in the context of a purely intergovernmental vision of the future structure of the European Union."
"For a long time we have felt a review of the membership of the Security Council to be necessary, but we consider that it would be more appropriate for representation to the Council to be by major continents, such as Africa, South America and Europe."
"Since we feel that the intergovernmental, supranational and parliamentary aspects should be balanced within Europe, we consider that it is the European Union as a whole which should be represented at the Security Council."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, the requests, proposals and projects presented during these past weeks by Mr Fischer, Mr Bayrou, Mr Monti and Mr Védrine and by President Chirac in Berlin, and Mr Chirac' s speeches here today are all evidence of the fact that, despite setbacks and despite our differences, we have entered a new stage of European construction."
"The positive results we hope for from the Intergovernmental Conference should allow us to proceed to the necessary reform of the institutions in preparation for enlargement."
"In this context, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament will each have to play an equally important and equally influential role, but these roles must include active cooperation."
"It is the citizens who are calling for it, the citizens who are the true protagonists of the Europe of today, but, more importantly, the protagonists of the Europe of tomorrow, an enlarged, integrated Europe which is capable of meeting the challenge of globalisation."
"The success of the euro will not be sufficient on its own for us to hold our ground against the United States and the China of tomorrow."
"It is true that we must move forward in the area of the common foreign and security policy and support our currency politically as well, but progress has to be made in the defence of the fundamental values of our Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights must reflect this."
"It is the duty of confirmed Europeanists such as ourselves, who believe in the social market economy, to fight the scourge of unemployment, and in order to do this Europe must encourage the small and medium-sized businesses and foster the development of trade, agriculture, tourism and craft trades, but, in the context of subsidiarity, it must also reduce the burden of taxation."
"However, as President Chirac stressed, we must educate our young people, prepare them for the challenge of globalisation, and not only from a professional and cultural point of view."
"We must educate young people to stand up for principles, and the fight against drugs and the development of the social function of sport may well play a significant part in this."
"But, Mr President, the best results take time to achieve: they are like mosaics, built one piece at a time."
"Yet are we sure that this Presidency will achieve the goals it has set itself just because it is French and France was one of the founder countries of the Union?"
"It will have the sure political and parliamentary support of the Forza Italia delegation in the PPE-DE Group, for the Italy of today and of tomorrow will certainly be a protagonist in the construction of that Europe in which we all believe so strongly."
"Mr President, what a change we have seen from Mr Chirac' s speech of a few years ago!"
"He is a President who in fact started out as an extreme eurosceptic, if I may use such an expression, but today he has made a truly European speech, which was applauded equally by the left and the right in this Parliament."
"I feel that I must congratulate the Socialist government on having convinced the French President so thoroughly."
"It is greatly to the President' s credit that he used words which sometimes tend to divide us."
"I am thinking here of the word 'federalism' , and he said that everything depends on what one means by this."
"That is precisely the problem with several words that are used in the current debate."
"The European Union has always had certain federalist characteristics such as qualified majority voting instead of unanimity in decision making within the Council; a directly elected Parliament, an executive Commission which is independent from governments;"
"Community law which takes precedence over national law, amongst other things. All of these are federal characteristics."
"On the other hand, the European Union is a long way from being a centralised federation, like many of the world' s federations."
"This is a decentralised federation in which the Member States play an extremely important role in decision-making and remain in control of the Treaties."
"All this ambiguity means that we should perhaps not allow issues of terminology or theology to divide us, but should instead unite on the specific changes that we need to make to the system."
"The same applies to the word ""constitution"" , which can also evoke quite different things."
"As a citizen of the United Kingdom, a country which does not even have any kind of written or codified constitution, I should like to ask the following question: what is a constitution?"
"This depends on what you mean."
"People interpret things differently and, with this word too, we run the risk of allowing vocabulary and theology, if I may use that term, to divide us, instead of uniting over the content."
"To some extent, we already have a constitution, which consists of the Treaties."
"The Treaties, after all, define the Union' s sphere of competences, the powers of its institutions and the procedures for adopting legislation or the budget."
"To some extent, therefore, they form a ""constitution"" ."
"Mr Pasqua defined the constitution as the foundation of a new legal order."
"Is this not precisely what we have founded in Europe?"
"Instead of allowing ourselves to become divided by the philosophical point of what makes a constitution, we should look at how our present constitution needs to be improved."
"First, it must be more readable and easier to use by consumers, i.e. the general public."
"The European University Institute in Florence has submitted a fine project for our consideration, which makes our Treaties considerably shorter, more readable and easier to use, without even altering their content."
"We must also look at the changes we need to make to our constitution."
"On this subject, we must above all do what President Chirac suggested, which is to ensure that, in a Union of almost 30 members, there is no risk of action being blocked."
"This is not really a question of creating a hard core."
"There is no hard core. What is a fact, however, is that certain areas, or certain States, sometimes create delays, which are sometimes temporary."
"There is therefore no need to create a hard core and we should instead create a situation in which our constitution prevents action being blocked."
"We therefore need to strengthen qualified majority voting, to extend it as far as possible, and where this is not possible, to return to the issue of closer cooperation."
"These are the two crucial points for the IGC."
"Concentrate on these and above all, do so before enlargement."
"Do this at Nice then, and not afterwards."
"Mr President, I congratulate the French Presidency of the European Union on its ambitious approach in all areas and for its intention not to end the Intergovernmental Conference with a minimal agreement, but with results which make enlargement a real possibility."
"Due to time restrictions, I will only refer to three points."
"Firstly, closer cooperation and integration."
"They will only be useful, Mr President, if four conditions are met: firstly, the Community dimension of the Union must be increased, rather than the intergovernmental dimension; there must be more integration, not more cooperation."
"Secondly, the existing institutions must be used, not replaced with new bodies."
"Thirdly, we should not have cooperation or integration of a variable composition, since that would mean a Europe á la carte, that is to say, an ungovernable Europe."
"Fourthly, in the same way, we should prevent this leading to factions or closed blocs which would divide the Union."
"In other words, we want closer integration which is open to all current and future members of the Union."
"My second point relates to the functioning of the Euro-12, which must be improved, but not by reducing further the current democratic deficit."
"The Commission must therefore have genuine powers for making proposals, and not only for recommendation, and Parliament must participate seriously, starting with consultation, but extending to codecision."
"My third point, Mr President, is that I am also one of those who believes that we need a Constitution for the Union."
"My question is, why not take a first step now by approving the basic treaty prepared in Florence on the initiative of the Commission?"
"This does not change anything, but it does mean something very important: that the citizens may finally become aware of which system is governing them."
"It would at least be a step forward in terms of this clarification which we are all requesting, but which we never get to see, at least with regard to something which must not be forgotten, Mr President, i.e. the distribution of competences in the European Union."
"We are leaving it for the future."
"Is the ratification process in certain countries not going to jeopardise this?"
"I leave that question open."
"I will end here."
"The ambitions are fine, but we want facts and we expect to see them at the end of the French Presidency."
"Mr President, since we are in the run-up to the Treaty of Nice and since we have had the pleasure of reading a number of valuable speeches by Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac, it may be a novel idea for Germany and France to share the Union' s presidency for a year."
"But under one proviso: that a fundamental breakthrough be reached in the field of European cooperation in line with all these fine speeches we have had the pleasure to hear and read."
"This is not only meant as a pleasant intro, because what I want to establish above all is that the French-German axis should not only generate philosophies for the future but should also solve the institutional problems of today and tomorrow."
"Whatever happens in Nice, decisions need to be taken on decision making."
"As we see it, all European legislation, which does not affect the constitutions of the Member States, should be decided on by qualified majority, with codecision from Parliament."
"In addition, decisions need to be taken on vote weighting and as we see it, it should be the size of the population in the Member States, as is the case in this House, that is the deciding factor."
"Decisions need to be taken regarding the number of Commissioners - in our opinion, this should be one per Member State - and on the number of MEPs - we said a long time ago, 700 is more than enough."
"Also, decisions need to be taken on the Court of Justice and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I completely echo Mr Gil-Robles' views that this should be included in the Treaties and that cooperation should be stepped up."
"As far as the latter is concerned, it is vital that we tackle the Union' s structure."
"Both Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac are right in this."
"I am not averse to a federal structure for the European Union."
"It could even be termed confederation, as President Chirac said earlier today."
"It is high time that we had a European constitution which is organised in the way that the university of Florence recently proposed."
"It is high time Mr Prodi had the authority and rights which a European government should in fact have."
"It is also high time we had a bicameral system, but not of the kind proposed by Mr Joschka Fischer, with a European Parliament, as we have now, and a second parliament comprising representatives of the parliaments of the respective Member States."
"It would be far better to convert the European Council of Ministers to a kind of Federal Council."
"Interestingly, this is a term which Mr Chirac used in his response to the questions."
"Surely this is the most natural way to provide Europe with a bicameral system consisting of a parliament and senate."
"All we need to do is to turn the European Council into a senate."
"Finally, such a constitution should very clearly and precisely define Europe' s and the Member States' respective remits."
"As far as I am concerned, the European package as a whole could quite easily be fleshed out a little bit and the powers of the European Member States could be increased once again, as long as it is clear what is European and what is national, and as long as we find our way out of the diffuse intergovernmental and Community structure in which we find ourselves at present."
"It would be ideal if the decision was taken in Nice to devise a project of this kind in two to three years' time."
"I hope that the words of Mr Joschka Fischer and those of Mr Chirac will not remain words but will be turned into action."
"I should appreciate a reaction from both honourable gentlemen who stayed behind during lunch."
"Mr President, Minister, the French Presidency has committed itself to a courageous, ambitious, brilliant agenda, considering some of the difficulties we are experiencing at this time."
"The important aspect of President Chirac' s speech was, we felt, our common values and intentions."
"In our opinion, a Europe which builds its future with constancy, continuity and responsibility is the best guarantee that the founding fathers' blueprint is implemented faithfully, that the endeavours of all those who have worked on it over the past 50 years are at the basis of its success and that Europe is built on solid foundations."
"It seems appropriate to break down the complex problem of the institutions: we must conclude the IGC on the three topics left over from Amsterdam and closer cooperation."
"This is the only way we can move forward in the intense debate on the future of the European Union and reconcile the economic development of Europe with the strengthening of the European Social Model and with the fight against social exclusion and modern forms of poverty, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, step up negotiations on enlargement and increasingly consolidate the European Union' s role in the world."
"In this context, we consider it essential to reinforce the European Commission, a supranational, independent body, the full expression of the unique characteristics of the structure of the European institutions."
"Enlargement is the conclusion of a political process which began with the reconciliation of the countries of Western Europe 50 years ago."
"This historic event must not be dismissed by replacing the Berlin wall with another wall, the wall of specific interests, egoism and bureaucracy."
"However, as the French Presidency rightly pointed out, enlargement must not weaken the Union' s action either."
"Mr Chirac' s words on the future of the European Union are reassuring, particularly because he spoke of a new stage which would start after the conclusion of the IGC, on subjects such as the consolidation of legitimate democracy in decisions, security and defence, the accentuation of the unique characteristics of the European institutions, a clear definition of responsibilities and the consolidation of the principle of subsidiarity, matters which cannot be ignored in the near future."
"The subject of closer cooperation has been widely debated and disputed."
"It used to be known as the 'two speed' Europe and is now referred to as the 'hard core' ."
"Some see it as an opportunity and some as a threat."
"In any case, all are in agreement that this situation should not lead to division but should spur us on to reach together those new frontiers which the current European model does not allow us to reach but which, in the future, it will have to."
"I would inform our French friends that Italy, which has been at the forefront of the European project ever since the beginning and which, we hope, is soon to enter a period of political stability, will be become increasingly active, implementing tangible actions, alongside the countries which sincerely desire to reinforce the Union' s foundations and to achieve the most important and ambitious cooperation objectives."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I shall not speak for long, so as not to delay even further the lunchtime of those Members who are still present."
"First of all, I wish to say how delighted I am to be here with you and to be speaking on behalf of the French Government, since I was a Member of the European Parliament, before it was located in this superb hemicycle - between 1994 and 1997."
"I should like to thank the numerous speakers who have expressed their thoughts, all of which were extremely useful, and particularly those who spoke in French, although it is not their mother tongue."
"More specifically, I should also like to acknowledge the encouragement given to the French Government by Pervenche Berès and Klaus Hänsch, as well as the ambition sought by some speakers, such as Mr Watson. I would also like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit with regard to the vision that drives my government and which has perhaps made an effective contribution to certain positions."
"This presidency is being held against the backdrop of a vast movement, which has two components."
"Firstly, we are in the process of preparing for an enlarged Europe, the united Europe of tomorrow and, as Mr Madelin said, this may involve changing the nature of the Union in addition to changing its size."
"Secondly, we must bring this Europe closer to its citizens and ensure that it goes further towards fulfilling their aspirations."
"It is quite clear that, in the wider debate on this issue, there are two phases."
"There is the shorter-term phase of this Presidency, which is taking place at a pivotal and undoubtedly decisive moment, and then there is the longer-term phase, in which broader approaches will be outlined and in which the future of Europe will really take shape."
"Here I am talking about a Europe of thirty Members."
"Unlike Mr Bayrou, I do not think that it is fair, appropriate or timely today to eradicate these two phases, as it were, and to introduce them both under the French Presidency, because that would entail the risk of complicating the outcome of the IGC or, quite the opposite, to minimise this outcome, and ensure that it would only appear as an annex."
"Let us focus on the task in hand."
"Let us see this IGC through with ambition."
"In doing so we will have established the basis which will enable us to move further towards European construction."
"What will we be doing, specifically in this IGC?"
"Our position is quite clear."
"It is our view that the IGC must succeed, that it is absolutely crucial that it succeeds, but not at any price."
"Our obligation concerns the means, not the outcome."
"As Mr Barón Crespo said just now, we want a ""nice treaty"" in Nice, which means a good treaty, not any old treaty."
"As Mr Corbett pointed out, it is true that the most important points are, in particular, the extension of qualified majority voting, which generally goes hand in hand with codecision with the European Parliament, and closer cooperation, because this is a bridge between the first and second stages, between the present and the future, since it improves the functioning of the European Union and because it enables us to think about the Europe of tomorrow."
"At the same time, however, the French Presidency considers all these things to be connected."
"Now, following the Feira European Council, and we are delighted that this is the case, four issues have been raised and we must reach a substantial agreement on all of them, by which I mean all four of these questions, and not only concentrate on one or other of them."
"That is why we will be changing our working methods."
"We intend to apply ourselves to this task, fully aware that it will be difficult, and we offer our thanks, of course, to the Portuguese Presidency, which has prepared the groundwork very well for us."
"We shall work with determination, specifically by taking the negotiation into a more political phase, which will perhaps be more ambitious."
"To this extent, Mr Hänsch is right: the Franco-German partnership that has been re-established and the Franco-German ambition that has been recharged will prove extremely useful."
"With regard to the Charter, I must pay tribute to the work carried out by President Herzog and to the Convention. This is a very original type of body, which brings together members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, representatives of Member States and of course, a representative of the Commission."
"I wish to assure the European Parliament that this Charter is one of our priorities and we hope that the Convention will prove worthy of the task so that we will be able to discuss it in detail at the Biarritz European Council, with a view, as the French President has said, to making as much progress as possible with the content."
"I am aware of the more or less unanimous feeling of the European Parliament about the restrictive nature of this Charter."
"We shall see how much arbitration is required, but the French Presidency takes the view that priority should be given to the substance of this issue, given that any kind of text will be a source of inspiration for all of the European Union' s institutions."
"Beyond these issues lies that of the European Union' s constitutional prospects."
"The first problem with this issue is the agenda, which I think would be difficult to set at this stage."
"The important thing is to pursue this idea whilst seeking to define its outlines more clearly and whilst thinking about the best method for continuing this exchange of ideas."
"Like Mr Corbett once again, I feel that we must realise that the term ""constitution"" may mean the will to speed up European construction and European ambition, but that the term ""constitutional"" leads, and will inevitably lead, to debate, because it could give rise to, or be nourished and fed by, or include, contents which may turn out to be rather different."
"Several Members of this Parliament have proposed that we should start by adopting the study carried out by the European University Institute in Florence. From what I have seen, they are certainly interesting, at least at this early stage, but I am bound to say that they will require a thorough examination."
"The Commission will shortly be giving its opinion on this study, Mr President, next week, I believe."
"Member States will also have to study this document, which inevitably raises many questions."
"It makes some useful contributions, but, at the same time, the question of whether it really simplifies the situation remains."
"This is an important matter that cannot be taken lightly and that is certainly not what the French Presidency will be doing."
"To conclude, I shall just make two observations on issues that have been raised by two Members of this Parliament, specifically Mrs Isler Béguin, who talked about environmental problems."
"Our commitment to firmer Union action with regard to the environment and our will to put the conclusions of the Kyoto Summit into practice should not be underestimated."
"I also wish to say that, with regard to the size of the environmental dimension in all policies, the French Presidency will fulfil its obligations during these six months, in collaboration with the Swedish Presidency, which will follow us, to ensure that continuity is maintained"
"I shall now finish, but nobody in this place will be surprised, particularly coming from me, if I say a few words about Strasbourg, specifically in response to Mr dell' Alba."
"We have taken note of the fact that the European Parliament voted to remove Friday mornings from the part-session."
"I will say quite frankly that the result of the vote gave us cause for regret and we hope that this is not an attempt to whittle away at Strasbourg' s role or to revive the issue of Parliament' s location."
"I shall say quite clearly that France, - and here once again for a moment I am speaking on behalf of a major national delegation in the Council - would not be able to accept this."
"We should really stop endlessly trying to keep the debate on Strasbourg alive."
"The Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Amsterdam, are very clear on this point."
"Instead, we should concentrate on the practical, material aspects of the issue."
"I am fully aware of the problems encountered by some Members of the European Parliament and I must tell you that the French authorities are extremely sensitive to these issues."
"We are anxious to see improved air connections to Strasbourg."
"Through the Presidency of the European Parliament, we have sent a questionnaire to Members, in order to find out their specific, individual needs."
"We hope that we will have a large response."
"We are also considering establishing a cross-border platform to coordinate neighbouring airports, which will make it easier to reach Strasbourg, both by air and by road."
"Honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, these are some of my thoughts, certainly not all of them, that have been stimulated by this debate, which was of extremely high quality and very encouraging for our Presidency."
"Knowing that they both have pressing engagements I should like to pay particular thanks to Mr Moscovici and President Prodi for staying with us until the end of the debate."
"Thank you very much."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for the fact that we are starting a few minutes late. However, there has been an important trialogue meeting, which the representative of the Council, Minister Moscovici, had to attend, and because he was held up, we have waited for him."
"He will have no chance at all to acclimatise because we are going to start straightaway with the statements from the Council and the Commission on the delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections, as per the agenda."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioners, please forgive me first of all for my lateness, which is not due to any lunchtime whim but simply to the fact that Jacques Chirac, the French President, was with us."
"Mrs Fontaine accompanied him, which prolonged the essential trialogue that we held with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, by a few minutes."
"Zimbabwe is experiencing a serious economic, social and political crisis."
"Despite some infringements of human rights, which have been rightly condemned by the international community, the country has remained, in essence, under the rule of law. It has been able to do so largely because of the dynamism of civil society and of the independence of its judicial system."
"Over the last three years, a reversal in its external economic situation has weakened its economic fabric, which is structured but ageing."
"Shifts towards authoritarianism and lax management of the economy have continued to tarnish the country' s image, undermined the confidence of the community of sponsors and has encouraged the people to challenge the government."
"This discontent was expressed in February' s referendum on the constitution, which was the first time that the Presidential party had lost an election since independence in 1980."
"Legislative elections were therefore a major issue for the ruling party."
"In order to hamper the success of the opposition, the ruling party risked heightening tensions by conducting a tough election campaign and by making the unequal distribution of farmland the issue for mobilising the rural world and veterans of the war of independence."
"With regard to this issue, the Head of State has allowed a huge movement for the occupation of properties to develop and has halted the legal framework for future compulsory purchases."
"These shifts, which I have just mentioned, have resulted in the deaths of 33 people, they have made the economic crisis worse and have distorted fair competition in the elections, thereby creating a real risk of instability in southern Africa."
"The European Union nevertheless considered it important that elections should be held and that the results should be credible and acceptable."
"It therefore sought the agreement of the Zimbabwean authorities to send, as far in advance of the elections as possible, a large mission of nearly 200 observers, thereby demonstrating the Union' s interest in seeing democracy consolidated in that country."
"Nobody can deny the fact that this presence contributed to reducing tensions and to restoring a climate, which was as conducive as possible, in such a highly sensitive context, to the free expression of the whole population' s right to vote."
"I wish at this point to pay tribute to Mr Schori, who led this mission, and to the remarkable work accomplished by his team."
"Although our observers noted that the degree of violence, irregularities and intimidation in the period leading up to the elections meant that the words 'free and honest' could not be applied to the fifth legislative elections in the history of Zimbabwe, they nevertheless emphasised the efficient organisation of the voting itself, the large turnout - I believe it was the largest since independence was achieved - and the peaceful atmosphere in which it took place."
"The vote-counting processes were not cause for controversy either."
"On behalf of the European Union, I should also like to congratulate the Zimbabwean people, who, by taking part in these elections in such numbers, have proved their determination to take their destiny into their hands in a peaceful and democratic way."
"I am also pleased to note that the results of the elections have been universally accepted by all participating parties."
"The entry into Parliament of a significant opposition - in fact it almost has a majority in the seats that were contested in these elections - suggests that constructive debates will be held."
"Zimbabwe has undoubtedly turned a new page in its young history."
"The fundamental problems still remain, of course, and they remain intact."
"This is why the Union is urging all political forces in Zimbabwe to mobilise and to bring together the threads of dialogue, in order to set the country firmly on the road to recovery."
"The Union hopes that the new government will adopt, with the help of the country' s new representatives, credible measures for getting the economy back on its feet, measures which are likely to restore the confidence of local operators and of donors."
"For twenty years, the European Union has shown itself to be Zimbabwe' s leading partner in its development."
"Zimbabwe is a friendly country and a partner country under the Lomé Convention and the European Union hopes to continue this policy, with acknowledged respect for human rights, for democratic principles and for the primacy of law."
"Because the Union wishes to continue to intervene on behalf of those who have been worst affected by the crisis, it is particularly willing to provide assistance for the necessary land reform in order to reduce poverty, despite the fact that this has not been implemented in an orderly, transparent or rational way."
"The European Union wants to believe in the future of a democratic and prosperous Zimbabwe, which is a factor for the stability and the harmonious development of southern Africa."
"Mr President, first of all may I say that I would have been delighted on this occasion to have spoken after Mr Schori who has obviously done an outstanding job - as the presidency said - in Zimbabwe."
"I think all of us who wish Zimbabwe well would want to congratulate him and all those who were in the EU observation team."
"They have all done a magnificent job."
"They clearly managed to fulfill their objectives under very difficult circumstances and they discharged their mandate in an extremely effective way."
"The mobilisation of a full and experienced team on the ground less than four weeks after an informal decision by European Union foreign ministers is a tribute to the enormous efforts of everyone concerned."
"This and the professionalism of the observation mission enabled them to surmount numerous political hurdles."
"It made the operation a reference point for electoral observation in countries in crisis."
"It is widely acknowledged that the European Union mission contributed to reducing the levels of violence, and I think it is also recognised that it helped to build up the confidence of civil society during the elections."
"Once again may I stress that the reputation of Mr Schori and the role that he played were key factors in our judgment for the success of the mission."
"I believe that the mission constituted the most credible observer voice during these critical times in Zimbabwe."
"This was reflected in extensive press coverage during the whole period, both locally and internationally."
"What is more the European Union mission being by far the largest observer mission deployed in the country and operational right across the nation, also contributed significantly to the coordination of the overall electoral monitoring effort in Zimbabwe."
"We have of course had a chance of becoming acquainted with the main outlines of the report, though we are looking forward to the opportunity of studying it in detail."
"I know that the first part of the report follows the interim report which the honourable Member made, and is an account of the violence and intimidation which sadly marked the early stages of the election campaign."
"We know from what he has said that the report analyses the voting process and the conduct of the poll and I think - though I would not want to take words out of his mouth - that by and large the actual conduct of the poll seems to have been pretty satisfactory."
"Finally, and most importantly, and this is what we are looking forward to hearing from the honourable Member, the report focuses on the consequences for Zimbabwe's future."
"The honourable gentlemen is right to recommend that the European Union should in the coming weeks and months monitor very carefully what is happening in Zimbabwe and provide assistance and support wherever it is appropriate for us to do so."
"We would certainly want to endorse this, and my colleague Commissioner Nielson and I will certainly intensify our efforts to strengthen channels of communication, both formal and informal, with President Mugabe and his government, to facilitate the transition to effective multi-party democracy."
"The honourable Member has spoken of how important it is that the government should prosecute those who have been involved in political violence or guilty of other human rights abuses; he has also stressed the importance of the courts determining the outcome of any challenge to the election results."
"It is very important that the government should respect their decisions."
"These are both enormously important points and touch, of course, centrally on the credibility of the whole democratic process."
"Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads."
"The outcome of the legislative elections could mark a major transformation in the country's political culture, the transition to a multiparty system in which Parliament will replace the ruling party Zanu PF politburo as the main policy-making institution."
"President Mugabe's electoral strategy, focused on land reform and support for the war veterans, failed to address the country's economic plight and this was obviously reflected in the votes polled by his party."
"The new government of Zimbabwe and all those who want to see the country rise above its present serious difficulties, whether they relate to the economic situation, the question of land reform or the terrible scourge of HIV, must now address the challenges effectively, collectively and constructively."
"We have considerable influence as a major donor."
"This influence has to be used to encourage the government to take positive steps for re-establishing the rule of law and good governance as a first step towards a more general recovery, and I know this is a point which my colleague, Commissioner Nielson will want to speak about after me."
"But, once again, I would like to offer my personal congratulations to the honourable Member on a very difficult job, extremely well done."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten"
"You have already indicated that owing to the problematic nature of the issue, two Commissioners are going to give their opinion on it today."
"I am therefore looking forward to hearing Commissioner Nielson' s opinion."
"Mr President, I would like to start by echoing the congratulations to the EU electoral observation mission."
"They have managed to do excellent work under very difficult conditions."
"The result of these elections offers the EU a new opportunity for reviewing our cooperation with Zimbabwe."
"According to the report by the heads of mission there is scope for positive development in Zimbabwe in the political, economic and social fields."
"Options for the EU to assist in such development should not be excluded, as they say."
"Zanu-PF will have to develop new and more appropriate policies in order to approach the international community for finance to stabilise the economy and restore growth, but the legitimacy of Zanu-PF is at stake because of the extent to which intimidation and electoral malpractice helped it gain victory and because, even discounting the impact of such factors, the MDC won 58 seats, almost as many as Zanu, with 61+1."
"The Movement for Democratic Change will not want to share responsibility for the crisis the country is undergoing or for the painful measures which will be necessary for economic recovery."
"Zimbabwe's EUR 110 million 8th EDF national indicative programme has a direct poverty alleviation orientation."
"Its main sectors of cooperation are agriculture, health and education."
"The Commission's approach so far has been that aid directed to the protection of basic social services and the reinforcement of civil society should be maintained even during periods of crisis."
"A total of EUR 19 million is about to be released for a micro-projects programme which in the interests of consensual policies has been delayed until after the elections."
"It can thus now go ahead."
"The Commission has maintained its support for land reform through this micro-projects programme, which is actually for poverty alleviation assistance for legally acquired land in resettlement schemes."
"However, in April the Commission froze the EUR 2 million for technical and policy support for land reform."
"Until the government's land reform policy was clarified, there seemed little point in continuing a technical and quite academic discussion on the principles of land reform."
"Hopefully this will change."
"The Commission and other donors are ready to support the process, provided it is in the framework of legality, transparency and poverty alleviation objectives, in accordance with the 1998 donor land conference agreements."
"The Commission is preparing a cross-sectoral programme to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Zimbabwe, which is in itself a development crisis and a major cause of present and future poverty."
"This programme is to be financed from the EUR 33 million in the 8th EDF second tranche."
"I will take a decision on this in the next few months depending on developments in Zimbabwe."
"In any event the European Commission is continuing to support poverty alleviation schemes."
"If the government seizes the opportunity offered by these new elections, EU support could be more substantial in the future."
"As noted by the heads of mission in Harare, it is premature to jump to conclusions on the election and its consequences."
"I fully share the view that EU-Zimbabwe development cooperation will depend on real progress in the fields of democratisation, rule of law, human rights and economic reform."
"Finally I would like to stress that there is potential for increased cooperation with Zimbabwe, but this will clearly depend on how the situation develops there."
"Mr President and Commissioners, I am speaking English not out of distaste for two languages that I like very much - French and Swedish - but because it was the working language of the mission."
"Thank you very much for your kind words."
"It is my pleasure to give the first presentation of the final report of the EU Election Observation Mission to Zimbabwe here in the European Parliament, an institution that has taught me so much and been such a joy to work in."
"""These were not perfect elections,"" said the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai drily."
"Indeed, in the view of our 190 election observers with experience of seven observation missions as an average, the pre-election period was one of the worst they had ever been in, while the actual election days, the polling, voting and count were among the best they had been."
"What should one make out of such a schizophrenic picture, where, on one hand politically-motivated violence and intimidation cost more than 30 people their lives, with many more being threatened, persecuted, injured, raped and tortured, and, on the other, where the voters turned out nevertheless in record numbers, giving the opposition party almost half of the votes?"
"All along in our mission I refused to use the term ""free and fair elections"", because it is not applicable. It is too blunt an instrument, in such a complex process as the one we witnessed in Zimbabwe."
"Our mission had, therefore from the beginning stressed that we were not only there for the election process, but that our final report would also attach great attention to the post-election phase."
"In this phase, the role and responsibility of President Mugabe, whose mandate lasts another two years, is crucial."
"I underlined this in a conversation with him as well as in my public statements in Zimbabwe, saying that after revolution comes nation-building, after elections reconciliation."
"Our hope was that, in spite of the extensive violence and intimidation campaign for which the ruling Zanu-PF had by far the greatest responsibility, the people, aided by a large international and national monitoring presence, could cast their votes in a relatively free, fair and non-violent environment on election day."
"Thereby the period after the elections would be essential, and so would the role of the president and the Zanu leaders, and they would hopefully contribute to a climate of reconciliation and calm."
"To a certain extent our strategy proved to be right."
"People did vote in great numbers."
"Violence and intimidation did not seem to scare them off from the polling stations."
"Many also openly showed their sympathies for the opposition parties."
"It is not that we were partisan, we had our code of conduct of professionalism and strict neutrality, but we did want the people to feel that their vote was secret, that on election day the President and the peasant are equal, and that democratic elections are the power of the people."
"There was much violence and terror in the run-up to the elections and we condemn it."
"But I would also like to stress that there was much more non-violence in the form of the millions of people who wanted to exercise the democratic right to vote."
"The main opposition party, while challenging the results in 20 constituencies, has also accepted the results of the elections."
"I believe that the people of Zimbabwe, who cry out for peace and law and order, progress and a decent life, deserve a better deal."
"Allow me now to summarise our conclusions and recommendations in four points:"
"It is imperative that the government moves swiftly to re-establish the rule of law and to allow the police and prosecution services to act against those who have been involved in or encouraged political violence or other human rights abuses."
"A new independent election organisation above partisan interest, and with sufficient human and financial resources to operate effectively is needed."
"The government must also allow the courts to determine the outcome of any challenge to election results in particular constituencies, and must respect their decisions."
"The European Union should endeavour to ensure that international observers are deployed in good time for the presidential election scheduled to take place in 2002."
"The European Union should make a particular effort during the coming weeks and months to monitor events in Zimbabwe closely and provide assistance and support where appropriate."
"I am glad to hear that both the presidency and the Commission also take this line."
"For that purpose, our central election unit in Harare will remain for some time, as well as 25 EU observers deployed through the country."
"Add to that our 14 heads of mission who will be on red alert."
"Let me use this opportunity to pay tribute to the Election Unit, to the EU observers including friends from Norway and Kenya who were integrated into our mission, as well as five Members of the European Parliament."
"The Commission, of course, responded in a swift and commendable way to the decision of the Council, and the continuous cooperation and dialogue throughout the process has been invaluable."
"Let me end by saying that the EU mission was a high-profile one, very well received among the people in general to a point that would be the envy of several Member States, including mine, Mr Patten."
"The mission can also be seen as an efficient conflict-prevention exercise."
"It was quickly on the spot, in great numbers spreading calm and peace; it was operational in no time, with a good national coverage and with a sustainable strategy also for the post-conflict phase."
"Our mission was an act of commitment to the people in Africa and to democracy worldwide."
"I see the mission to Zimbabwe as a natural consequence of our support for the struggle for African independence and of our wish to build a strong partnership with a peaceful and democratic Zimbabwe."
"Thank you very much Mr Schori, also for the fact that together with your five colleagues, you left Zimbabwe with a good impression of the European Parliament in Zimbabwe, under difficult circumstances."
"The elections in Zimbabwe have been both a victory and a defeat for Mugabe."
"They were a defeat in the sense that, for the first time in its short independent life, Zimbabwe has a multi-party political system, which was something that Mugabe clearly opposed."
"Apart from tolerating, and even, as we know, promoting, a climate of intimidation and violence, Mugabe has made considerable errors of judgement."
"On the one hand, he has underestimated the European Union' s seriousness, willingness and capacity to act in the case of Zimbabwe."
"However, he has also confused the factors within his own country."
"I wonder if this is due to the arrogance of a former, although once respected, African freedom fighter, or to his ignorance of the sociological and political evolution of his country."
"It is probably a combination of both things."
"Mugabe has brought to these elections the customs and methods of a war of liberation, on occasion treating political rivals as if they were colonial occupiers who needed to be banished."
"However, he was unable to appreciate that the emergence of the middle classes was an element which was going to have a different effect for the first time on these elections."
"This relative consolidation of a new urban vote, together with the manipulation of official democracy and the violation of human rights, would not otherwise have led to many citizens voting against him, and that is what they have done."
"The country and the population will gain as a whole if the current government and the emerging opposition show sufficient political wisdom and common sense to generously and cautiously deal with the transition from former political customs to other new ones."
"In this area, the opposition also has a role to play."
"Now, after all the accusations and condemnations, in the coming weeks we must watch carefully for any signs of verifiable reconciliation and self-critical acceptance of the errors made."
"Mr President, this will help the future of Zimbabwe, its society and the new political culture born of these elections."
"We must give decisive support to its future."
"Mr President, the fact that the EU observer mission has garnered great international acclaim reflects the fact that Mr Schori has done an excellent job in raising the profile of what we were doing there."
"I pay great tribute to him."
"There is no doubt in Zimbabwe that it has been a case of ""Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely""."
"Mr Mugabe has much to answer for."
"If the result may be said to have a positive side, it is the fact that there is now no longer absolute power."
"Much of the violence that took place before the elections can be based directly back to the leadership of Zanu-PF and to President Mugabe himself."
"The so-called war veterans - they must have been very young when the war of independence was on - have been paid to be on these farms."
"This is a grave problem which be traced directly back to the leadership."
"There were problems too with the fact that the postal votes, which were sent directly to the army in the Congo on Thursday, miraculously returned on Saturday, all in due form going into many marginal constituencies."
"Threats of violence against supporters of the MDC have continued after the elections."
"The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened."
"All these things must be stopped."
"We cannot possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation."
"The fact that President Mugabe wants to stifle inward investment by nationalising the farms, and threatening to do the same with the mines, will do nothing to resolve the economic situation in Zimbabwe."
"What Zimbabwe needs is much more inward investment from outside the country."
"This will not take place under the present regime."
"There is a great and wonderful opportunity in Zimbabwe now with the emergence of the MDC, for all races to work together."
"There is great hope for the future, but we must make sure that we keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe and especially on Mr Mugabe."
"We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe."
"We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems."
"Mr President, my speaking time is too restricted to describe the fate of a country for which, for so many years, the situation was in fact quite hopeful, but which for the past couple of years has been on a slippery slope towards greater underdevelopment, whilst the population of Zimbabwe is highly developed."
"This is probably one of the things we should give the Mugabe government credit for during its early years."
"The population is knowledgeable despite the fact that the opposition was prevented from taking part in the election propaganda in a normal way, at least as far as the official media is concerned."
"I know Zimbabwe quite well."
"For quite a few years running, I visited the country and followed the situation from close by, but I was surprised at the extent of intimidation prior to the elections and I fear that this may continue, even after the elections."
"Accordingly, I think we should act within the remit of our international responsibility and ensure that we continue to exert the same benevolent influence after the elections that we had in the run-up to them."
"We can do this by driving a hard bargain, yet remaining specific, regarding the planned reforms in Zimbabwe."
"A reign of terror pervades the countryside, and this cannot be allowed to continue, of course, because this affects the quality of life of the white and black population alike."
"I would like to underline this because these people are also being sucked into a maelstrom of events which are beyond their control."
"I hope that we will be able to keep the dialogue going with the government, the opposition and the civil society."
"Mr President, the political pressure that preceded the elections and the flagrant manner in which President Mugabe encouraged the violence means that we are not talking now about free and proper elections, although we were sincerely convinced on polling day itself that we were witnessing a desire to hold an irreproachable election."
"Everything spoke of a genuine desire on the part of the people of Zimbabwe to build a democratic civil society."
"The events of Zimbabwe compel us, however, to consider the relationship between democracy and values, and this may be the right forum for that, as we refer to the EU as a society of values."
"At the same time we openly admit that the EU cannot dash about the world paternally handing out advice to others from on high."
"It is a matter of dialogue."
"That was what Pierre Schori, as leader of the EU delegation of election observers, also demonstrated admirably."
"Something happened in Zimbabwe that should make every politician consider how we can prevent the demoralising effects of power - among ourselves also."
"Why does a former hero of a nation, the father figure of a struggle for independence, now allow the use of violence simply to underpin his own authority?"
"And what has happened to a person' s soul and sense of morality when he has the audacity to proclaim during the elections that the government will be staying in power, no matter what the result?"
"The philosopher and theologian, Niebuhr, once said that a person' s sense of what is right makes democracy possible, but his inclinations in the opposite direction make democracy absolutely necessary."
"In other words: a person' s virtue makes democracy possible; on the other hand, his vices make it necessary."
"I think this is one of the truest remarks ever made about democracy."
"It follows that, in order to flourish, democracy needs its internal structures to be looked at critically and, indeed, has to be prepared to submit to criticism."
"That means that we are willing, in the name of democracy, to encourage people to take a critical stand as citizens."
"On the other hand, it requires transparency in decision making and the flow of information."
"Only in this way can democracy preserve its self-remedying nature."
"In Zimbabwe I also realised very clearly that we cannot speak of human rights without the recognition of human dignity."
"It is just empty talk unless it is committed to the unique value and integrity of the individual."
"At the same time, I would like to pay my respects to those thirty or more victims of violence who were to die whilst expressing their desire to struggle in favour of a free civil society."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, these elections certainly mark an important moment in Zimbabwe' s national political life."
"They also augur extremely well for the European Union' s future cooperation with that country."
"There are many things that now seem possible or, in any event, easier, between us."
"The report drawn up by the mission led by Mr Schori, the thoroughness of whose work I must emphasis once again, as did Commissioners Patten and Nielsen, provides us with a perfectly clear and impartial analysis of the way in which Zimbabwe' s legislative elections were held."
"The electoral situation was particularly tense, not to say violent."
"I am convinced that the Union was right, profoundly right, to send this mission, a long time in advance, in order to bring an element of calm to this campaign."
"The benefit of this mission in this regard, as in many others, is undeniable."
"The mission must continue its work on the ground, as Mr Schori requested."
"The Council Presidency is delighted at the generally smooth running of these elections, even if, here and there, the voting conditions might have left us rather perplexed and the mission' s conclusions on this matter are extremely enlightening."
"It is now time to forge ahead in conjunction with Zimbabwe."
"The Council Presidency fully supports the Commission' s analysis of the need to cooperate with Zimbabwe."
"Numerous areas in which we can work have opened up, and they deserve our full involvement. Amongst these are the strengthening of democracy, poverty reduction, and the fight against Aids."
"It is crucial that European aid has a direct bearing on the economic and social problems that are besetting the people of Zimbabwe."
"Community funds must now be released, as Commissioner Nielsen suggested."
"For its part, the Government of Zimbabwe must also move forward and fulfil its commitments to land reform, to respect for court judgements and to economic transparency."
"I am convinced that this process needs to ensure the stabilisation of the country and also its democratic involvement in regional integration."
"This is why the Council Presidency, and you can be sure of this, ladies and gentlemen, will commit itself to achieving this aim with the same determination as the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Thank you very much, Minister"
"I would like to inform you that pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Trafficking in human beings"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on trafficking in human beings."
"Minister Queyranne will deliver the statement on behalf of the Council and in fact he has just arrived, punctual to the second."
"Minister, you are in the fortunate position of being able to start your speech immediately."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Ministers has been deeply shocked by the events at Dover and the deaths of 58 Chinese nationals in tragic circumstances."
"These events demonstrate the increasing pressure that migration is putting on Western Europe, which we have been aware of for some time."
"In order to respond to a situation which is of great concern to our continent, European solidarity must be considerably strengthened."
"Firstly, the point must be made quite forcefully that the existence of organised criminal networks, as well as the scale of professional smuggling, which is contemptible but lucrative, plays a central role in illegal immigration, both in increasing the flows themselves and in the methods for smuggling people, of which the tragedy at Dover is an extreme example."
"We know that most illegal immigration arrives in Western Europe, as a result of smugglers, particularly in the case of those people coming from far-off destinations such as China."
"This point must be emphasised in order to respond to those who say that it is immigration control that creates illegal immigrants."
"The increase in non-lawful immigration, on the contrary, leads to greater activity by gangs providing illegal entry to our countries. It is quite clear that this activity benefits from legislative or operational weaknesses in the destination countries and from all factors that allow the illegal immigrants to enter and remain in these countries in violation of their laws."
"That is not all, however. Behind the smugglers, we are beginning to see mafias operating to an ever-greater extent."
"Police Chiefs have identified a Russian mafia, exploiting Sri Lankans and Chinese, and a Turkish mafia is taking charge of Kurds, Afghans and Iranians."
"We also know that illegal immigrants from the Balkans are under the protection of Albanian mafias."
"The fact that many of these illegal immigrants are concentrated in Calais, a bridging post for the United Kingdom - more than 10 000 have been arrested since August 1999 - shows the extremely active nature of the smugglers: 400 of them have been arrested since August 1999."
"We should also no longer hide the fact that illegal immigration has become the subject of a veritable traffic in human beings, which consequently leads to crime, even to major organised crime."
"Since it is easier, more lucrative and less risky than other forms of trafficking, such as drug trafficking, for example, trafficking in illegal immigrants is becoming a major issue in police and judicial action and cooperation."
"The trade in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation is one of the most odious aspects of this trafficking."
"When there is this level of organisation, it is no longer simply a question of combating illegal immigration, but of properly fighting crime itself."
"The real culprits are those who organise illegal immigration, in whose hands those people hoping to emigrate are merely the playthings of a script that could easily become a tragedy."
"We must therefore combat these smugglers first of all."
"Non-lawful immigration or the trafficking in human beings is a new form of slavery that cannot be tolerated in our democratic societies."
"We know, for example, that in order to use the services of a smuggler, it costs a Chinese national between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 and years of illegal work to repay this debt. They generally live under constant threat, without rights or any protection, often in horrific conditions."
"The rhetoric of calling for a massive opening up of immigration for work or for the automatic right of residence for all immigrants only feeds this dream of Europe and helps to push hundreds of thousands of people every year into the clutches of criminal networks working in illegal immigration."
"The European Union must therefore not make the mistake of targeting the wrong people. It does not intend to do so and will concentrate on those who organise this traffic in human beings, which is one of the most cowardly and odious forms of trafficking."
"The Council is determined to implement all necessary measures to combat this odious trafficking."
"European cooperation must be based on the means available to the Member States, and the States have clearly decided to provide themselves with the means to fight this scourge effectively."
"Since 1995, France has had a central office for the prevention of illegal immigration and employment, which has greatly enhanced its action in breaking up criminal networks in the last two years."
"This body has succeeded in breaking up and halting the activities of around fifteen criminal networks per year."
"Given the reality of the trade in human beings and of the traffic in illegal immigration, the French Presidency wishes to promote European cooperation, based on the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and on the following principles: co-development, the integration of foreigners, the fight against illegal immigration and the common policy on Asia."
"The first point involves taking account of the situation in the countries of origin."
"How can we deter people from wanting to leave their country for Europe under any circumstances and thereby often putting their fate in the hands of slavery networks?"
"The Council must base its action on the guidelines adopted at Tampere and I quote: ""The European Union needs a comprehensive approach to migration addressing political, human rights and development issues in countries and regions of origin and transit"" ."
"Migratory movements are actually due to numerous factors: demographic differences between the North and the South, the continual increase in inequalities of income and wealth between the richest and poorest countries, the instability of certain political situations and the often false image that immigrants have of what a future in Europe might hold for them."
"Illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings are not inevitable, however."
"They can be combated by means of a firm political will."
"In a world that is undergoing profound upheaval, the task of controlling long-term flows must shift from politics to co-development and the stabilisation of the countries in which immigration originates."
"The whole purpose of co-development is to link up these countries' policies for development in order to exercise control over migration flows."
"France will strive to provide new impetus to this progress towards co-development, making use of its experience in this area."
"An agreement has already been signed with Senegal and others are being negotiated with Mali and Morocco."
"There are two questions to be answered: how can we encourage the development of local projects, specifically through aid for training and the resettlement of foreigners who wish to return to their mother country in order to contribute to its economic development, and how can this local development contribute to controlling migration flows by stabilising the population?"
"The study being carried out on these two issues will benefit the future work of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration, which is today striving to implement the specific measures established in five action plans, covering Morocco and Sri Lanka."
"Implementing this priority led to a seminar being held on 6 and 7 July in Paris, in which experts and several Ministers will take part."
"The purpose of this seminar is to draw up the text which will guide the work of the European Union, on the basis of a few pilot experiments carried out with countries that have cooperated in this area and which have stable state structures. I am thinking here of Morocco."
"The European Union' s second main priority, which was established at Tampere, is to integrate foreign nationals who are legally entitled to be in our countries."
"This is an important point with regard to the fight against trafficking in human beings, which feeds off the fact that some foreign nationals in the European Union are on the margins of, or excluded from, society."
"This integration requires a firm policy to provide equal economic and social rights and an equally staunch fight against any form of discrimination, particularly in the field of employment."
"The French Presidency is planning to hold a seminar in October on this theme, with a view to presenting the Council with a draft text on the harmonisation of permits for extended periods of residence, which is an essential mechanism for integration."
"The opportunity to adopt the nationality of Member States is also a fundamental aspect of integrating foreign nationals in Europe, but we realise that, in this area, each country applies its own laws."
"The third point emphasised at Tampere is the fight against the criminal networks that I mentioned just now, and against the traffic in human beings."
"This aspect is clearly one of the French Presidency' s central concerns."
"The Tampere Council specifically stressed this priority, and I quote: ""The European Council stresses the need for more efficient management of migration flows at all their stages."
"It calls for the development, in close co-operation with countries of origin and transit, of information campaigns on the actual possibilities for legal immigration, and for the prevention of all forms of trafficking in human beings."
"The European Council calls for closer co-operation and mutual technical assistance between the Member States' border control services"" ."
"Following the events in Dover, the Feira European Council called once again for rapid action by the European Union."
"This Council, and I quote, ""condemned the criminal acts of those who profit from such traffic in human beings and committed the European Union to intensified cooperation to defeat such cross-border crime, which has caused so many other deaths across Europe"" ."
"The Council has urged the forthcoming French Presidency and the Commission to ensure that the Tampere conclusions on this subject are implemented as a matter of urgency."
"The French Presidency has already proposed four initiatives to the Council."
"The first of these is a draft directive establishing sanctions against transporters who give lifts to illegal passengers."
"This draft text would extend the measures provided for in the convention applying the Schengen agreement and the purpose of the text is to provide the Union with a common mechanism for sanctions."
"This restates the obligation on transporters to do everything they can to ensure that the passengers they are carrying have travel documents and, if appropriate, the necessary visas. This mechanism also restates the transporter' s obligation to send back or to accept responsibility for sending back foreign nationals who have not been allowed to enter for the reasons I have just mentioned."
"This draft directive also provides for sanctions against those who have transported passengers who do not have the necessary documents or visas."
"The proposed text provides for a minimum fine of EUR 2000."
"A second draft framework decision seeks to increase the criminal punishment for aiding the illegal entry or stay in a country."
"On this issue too, by extending the measures of the convention applying the Schengen agreement, covering the obligation of States that are signatories to the convention to provide for sanctions against anyone aiding an illegal entry or stay, France has presented a draft framework decision whose purpose is to encourage the harmonisation of national legislations with regard to defining offences."
"This text will therefore play an important role in more effectively curbing the traffic in human beings."
"The French Presidency' s third initiative was to also submit a draft directive on cooperation in the matter of expulsions."
"The purpose of this draft directive is to facilitate the implementation of an expulsion measure passed by one Member State against a foreign national who is not legally entitled to stay, when this measure is taken by any other State, the foreign national having been arrested in their territory."
"Fourthly and finally, an improvement in European cooperation in the area of controlling migration flows and increasing control over external borders is one of the Council of Ministers' priorities."
"In its capacity as holder of the Presidency, France has submitted new proposals in this field, specifically an action plan, which the European institutions are about to discuss."
"First of all, it is crucial to increase police cooperation in the exchange of information on illegal migration flows and on criminal networks."
"The centralisation, cross-checking, analysis and use of this data must be carried out by the existing Working Group."
"As the Feira conclusions emphasise, it is particularly important to develop Europol' s role in curbing the traffic in human beings."
"The French Presidency therefore intends immediately to ask Europol to submit a report on the action it has undertaken in this area."
"The other aim in the field of police cooperation is to strengthen the rapid warning mechanism, which must be made sufficiently effective to enable Member States to be informed about and to react in good time to events connected with illegal immigration."
"This mechanism specifically involves the designation of points of contact between Member countries and entrusts the Council Presidency with the task of organising the necessary agreement for implementing the appropriate measures."
"Increasing this coordination also involves establishing a network of liaison officers from the Member States in the countries where the immigration originates, in order to improve understanding of particular situations, to control immigration at source, particularly through the checking of travel documents at the point of embarkation at airports."
"This whole range of projects, designed to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration, will be the subject of a seminar on criminal networks, which is to be held in Paris on 20 and 21 July, in other words, in a few days' time."
"This seminar will bring together high level representatives of the Member States, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the United States, Australia, Canada and Mexico."
"Several Ministers from the Member States as well as the heads of various immigration services and border police from Member States will be taking part in this symposium."
"I should also like to emphasise the fact that one of the fundamental points resulting from Tampere is the principle of harmonising the right of asylum between Member States."
"This is another important tool in the fight against illegal immigration."
"We have seen requests for asylum increase dramatically in most countries in the European Union."
"This increase reflects the higher number of illegal entries, since 80% to 90% of requests for asylum are rejected by the countries to which they are made."
"The right to asylum is frequently used by criminal networks as a legal tool to make the entry into a country and the stay there easier for illegal immigrants."
"The main difficulty in our task is therefore the need to reconcile this fundamental right to asylum, which is recognised in international conventions, with the fight against fraud."
"With regard to this matter too, I shall refer to the Tampere Summit, where the European Council restated the importance attached by the Union and its Member States to fully respecting the right to asylum."
"The Summit conclusions state that ""this system should include, in the short term, a clear and workable determination of the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application, common standards for a fair and efficient asylum procedure, and common minimum conditions of reception of asylum seekers"" ."
"It is therefore crucial first of all that we make progress with projects that seek to improve the functioning of the Dublin Convention, with regard to determining the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application."
"France is paying close attention to the work currently being undertaken by the Commission."
"We will have taken an important step forward if we are able to ensure that the State that is the original point of entry for a foreign national into the European Union has sole responsibility for examining that person' s application for asylum."
"The Eurodac system, which will soon be up and running, enabling the fingerprints of asylum seekers to be stored centrally, will certainly contribute to the fight against fraud involving multiple applications."
"We must also rapidly attain the objective of a fair and efficient asylum system in Europe."
"There is therefore an urgent need to harmonise the conditions of reception for asylum seekers, in order to limit internal flows into European Union territory and thereby achieve a more balanced division between Member States."
"This is why the French Presidency has submitted a draft set of guidelines, which is designed to make the Commission' s work and the drawing up of a future directive easier."
"We hope to reach our first conclusions at next December' s Council, so that we can contribute to the preparation of the Commission' s draft directive, which is planned for the beginning of 2001."
"The Council is therefore determined to use all necessary means to fight against the traffic in human beings and to do so in accordance with the Tampere and Feira conclusions."
"The Council takes the view that the issue of the ways and means of illegal entry is no longer a question solely related to the problem of immigration. This issue also involves the fight against organised crime."
"This is the approach that must inform our work, and the French Presidency hopes to mobilise all necessary means - national, Community and intergovernmental - to succeed."
"Mr President, first of all, I wish to emphasise that the Commission shares the sense of grief caused by the tragedy at Dover, which President Prodi expressed at the Feira Council and as I myself have expressed on behalf of the Commission."
"We feel that these events are a particularly tragic illustration of the need for a common policy on immigration."
"The Commission is pleased at the request made at Feira by the Heads of State and Government to speed up the process, and is firmly committed to play its part in this process, in conjunction with the French Government."
"The Commission wishes to reiterate the fact that the framework for such a policy was established by the Tampere European Council and that precise deadlines have been set for implementing it, both by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the European Council itself."
"If such a policy is to have a lasting effect, it must form part of the overall approach defined at Tampere, which requires both a more efficient management of migration flows and the development of partnerships with the countries of origin and transit, the establishment of a common asylum system and the guarantee of fair treatment for nationals of third countries who are legally resident in Member States' territory."
"It is within this overall framework that efforts must be made to overcome the particularly odious types of crime that are the traffic in and exploitation of human beings."
"These crimes are what lie behind the Dover tragedy, as well as all the anonymous tragedies that are played out every day, which we do not hear about since they are not reported in the press."
"Unfortunately, however, they do exist."
"More specifically, the Commission wishes to point out that a very short deadline has been set for the Council to adopt the necessary legislative measures to be able to prosecute and punish the behaviour of those who profit from trafficking in human beings."
"A deadline, which runs up to the end of this year, has been set for the formal adoption of the legislative instruments that will enable the main players in this kind of trafficking to be punished."
"The Commission wishes to confirm its desire to cooperate with the Council to ensure that this deadline is scrupulously observed and notes the fact that the French Presidency is about to present its first initiative, which is a framework decision designed to strengthen the fight against aiding illegal entry and residence."
"We welcome this response by the French Presidency and we shall study the text closely to see to what extent it covers the objectives that the Commission had set for itself under its own proposal."
"There are two aspects in particular to which we should pay attention in this context: employers' responsibility and the consequences of employing workers illegally."
"This does not only involve monitoring the European Union' s points of entry, but also monitoring what is happening within our Member States, particularly with regard to the illegal labour market."
"Furthermore, the traffic in human beings in particular must be curbed, since it involves trafficking in women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which is a specific feature of the traffic in human beings in general."
"The Commission wishes to point out that the protection of victims and the respect for their rights must remain a constant concern of this presidency, as some victims pay with their lives and others are forced into slavery"
"In this respect, the Commission plans to submit a proposal on providing short-term residence permits to victims who agree to cooperate with the police and judicial authorities in fighting the criminal networks that traffic in human beings."
"Victims' testimony is in fact crucial to the police and judicial investigations being able to produce effective results."
"If we expect victims to provide this testimony, we must guarantee them a minimum of personal security."
"The Commission also urges Member States to increase their cooperation with Interpol, so that this body is able to make full use of all its resources in the fight against organised crime in this area."
"In this respect, we wish to emphasise the importance of the conference to be held by the French Presidency on 20 and 21 July in Paris, which the Minister has just mentioned."
"We also need to develop and strengthen the Schengen acquis as included in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Priority must be given to researching the means for ensuring the proper implementation of existing laws on granting visas and controlling external borders by using the surveillance and monitoring mechanisms that are available for this purpose."
"A review must also be carried out of existing measures, and, should they be required, the necessary legislative amendments could be introduced to the Schengen acquis."
"All means should be investigated in order to facilitate administrative cooperation, following the example of the Odysseus programme, a third of whose projects that have been retained for 2000 are already contributing to the fight against illegal immigration."
"Furthermore, the Commission shares the desire of the French Presidency to see the procedures for placing responsibility on transporters reviewed and adapted as a matter of priority and has noted the Presidency' s announcement of an initiative to this effect."
"In our opinion, this initiative should form part of the development of the Schengen acquis and should deal appropriately with the various means that could be used in close collaboration with the operators because, without this cooperation, it will be difficult to fight effectively against the trafficking in human beings."
"Within the framework of cooperation with countries and regions of origin and transit in general, particular attention must be paid both to combating poverty and to respect for human rights."
"More specific action could be also be undertaken with regard to developing awareness-raising campaigns on the real possibilities of legal immigration and on all forms of trafficking, as well as increasing the ability of the authorities in the countries of origin or transit to effectively combat this type of crime themselves."
"We should consider the option of increasing the appropriations that have been earmarked for this purpose in the preliminary draft budget for 2001."
"In addition to this, forms of closer cooperation could be considered for applicant countries, particularly in the areas of training, equipment, and the exchange of information on criminal networks."
"With this in mind, we feel that it is important to develop cooperation agreements between Europol and the police forces in applicant countries as quickly as possible."
"The conclusion and the effective implementation of Community agreements on readmission will also contribute to diminishing the attraction of the offers made by traffickers, who claim to be able to provide their victims with guaranteed access to the destination country."
"In more general terms, we must review repatriation policies as a whole, including the issue of assistance for voluntary return, so as to guarantee coordination and efficiency whilst respecting the rights of the people involved."
"It is imperative that we make rapid progress in establishing a common European asylum system, based on absolute respect for human rights and on the principle of non-refoulement, which seeks to provide the appropriate status for any person in need of protection, through the use of fair and efficient procedures."
"The proposals that the Commission has already submitted concerning the European Refugee Fund and temporary protection, as well as the launch of the process of revising the Dublin Convention, should be swiftly followed up by other initiatives on the procedures and conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers."
"The Commission is in the process of evaluating the report by the European Parliament on its communication on a common procedure in order to present, before the end of this year, a legislative initiative on a common procedure for asylum in Europe."
"By the same token, we welcome the French initiative to submit a set of guidelines on the conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers."
"As was said at Tampere, the whole purpose of the exercise is to achieve, in the medium term, a common definition of refugee status and, to complement this, other subsidiary forms of protection."
"The Commission feels that any lasting solution will require a genuine immigration policy to be gradually established. This policy must take account of the Union' s views on social, economic and demographic developments, and will consequently guarantee the admission of migrants under an organised and clear framework, as well as their harmonious integration into the communities that receive them."
"The Commission is preparing a communication on this subject for the autumn, as well as legislative proposals, which follow on from those covering permission for the families of foreign nationals working within the Union to join them. Those proposals are currently under consideration by the Council, and the new proposals should define the conditions and the methods for admission, particularly for purposes of work and study."
"We all recognise the importance of this debate and this exchange of views has clearly been influenced by the emotions caused by the Dover tragedy."
"It is tempting to say that the solution lies in increasing repressive measures and, as you see, I am not rejecting the idea of doing so."
"What we must understand above all, however, is that, in the medium term, it is by producing a proactive immigration policy at European level, backed by clear criteria, which are shared by all Member States, that we will guarantee victory in this battle."
"This must be a balanced policy, both in its measures on ""the integration of emigrants"" and in its measures on ""effectively combating networks of organised crime which exploit the victims of the traffic in human beings"" We must never lose sight of the balanced approach provided by the two aspects of the European common policy on this issue."
"Mr President, it is a tragedy that it has taken the deaths of another 58 people to get the problem of trafficking firmly on the international, political agenda."
"The Dover disaster has once again opened our eyes to the unscrupulous practices of traffickers in human beings and to the powerlessness - or should that be unwillingness? - on the part of the European Union to stamp out this disgraceful type of exploitation."
"Trafficking in human beings has grown into a bigger business than trafficking in drugs, according to The Economist last week."
"Organised crime has discovered that this business is not only more profitable, there is less risk involved too."
"Every year, about half a million people are smuggled into the European Union."
"In the port of Dover alone, hundreds of illegal aliens are arrested on a daily basis."
"As the trafficking in human beings increases, so does the economic and sexual exploitation of these people."
"Traffickers demand astronomical amounts to smuggle their customers to the West."
"Upon arrival, their documents are often seized, as a result of which they are completely at the mercy of crime syndicates."
"Young girls are frequently raped during the journey and end up in prostitution or the illegal labour market later on."
"It is not unusual for victims who are unable to pay their debts to meet with terror and violence."
"It is clear that traffickers in human beings are becoming more professional in their activities."
"Their infrastructure, communication and control facilities outstrip those available to the police or courts in the countries of origin or transit."
"This internationalisation of organised crime is in stark contrast to the inability of the EU Member States to adopt a coordinated approach in dealing with the trafficking in human beings."
"Everyone is agreed that the problem transcends the control, reception and repatriation capacities of the individual countries and that we need to join forces."
"But despite the best of intentions, European cooperation is leaving a great deal to be desired."
"We do not seem to manage, once the police and courts are involved, to rise above the nationalistic knee-jerk reaction."
"And organised crime is exploiting that situation."
"Enlargement of the European Union would merely aggravate the problem."
"The new countries are, due to their location, extremely vulnerable to the trafficking in human beings."
"What is more, their police and court systems are even less adequate than those of the current Member States."
"In our resolution, we at least call for the application of the principle of solidarity and make a few very specific proposals for far-reaching cooperation in the fight against the trafficking in human beings."
"If we want to prevent tragedies such as those at Dover from happening again, extending the Third Pillar should not be delayed any further, and we are hopeful after President Chirac' s address and Minister Queyranne' s speech."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin my intervention by saying that my sentiments about the Dover catastrophe are deeply felt."
"Unfortunately they are nothing new."
"I live in an area of Europe where, every day, every week, the dead bodies of emigrants from the north and south of Africa appear. These victims do not appear in the news because, fortunately, they are yet to die on a massive scale, but rather they die in a trickle."
"Having said this, I am sure, as Commissioner Vitorino has said, that the European Union needs a common policy in order to manage the legal entry of immigrants - bearing in mind our economic, social and demographic situation - in a reasonable way, preventing arbitrary treatment and, above all, turning to legal immigration avenues instead of traffickers in human beings."
"I believe that we have the responsibility to establish a legal framework which will allow this to be done."
"We also have the responsibility - and I would like to highlight this - to apply laws which already exist in the whole of the European Union and which regulate our labour market."
"It is outrageous that some people import and use labour and then go unpunished."
"To this end, there is no need to create new immigration laws, but we simply have to use the ones we already have to regulate the labour market and punish employers of illegal workers."
"A year ago in October, the Tampere agreements were adopted."
"I hope that the Commission will do everything that the Commissioner has said and that the Council is up to the job."
"In that case they will have the support of this Parliament."
"Mr President, sadly, there will be many more Dovers."
"Not so long ago, we talked about the trafficking in human beings at the Strait of Gibraltar, and this was also referred to a moment ago."
"Prior to that, we held a debate regarding a ship transporting Kurds which ran aground off the Italian South coast."
"Each time, the authorities panicked, as is the case again now."
"It is high time we adopted policy."
"Because that is what it comes down to: each time a policy is announced, but this time, we need to do something about it, because we know that the trafficking in human beings simply continues."
"So what should we do?"
"Minister Queyranne and Commissioner Vitorino already mentioned it."
"We need to tackle the causes. We need to set up common immigration and asylum policy, fight cross-border crime and at long last establish surveillance of the EU' s external borders."
"But I would like to point out something else."
"The heads of government themselves, under the leadership of President Chirac, who were here this morning, could chip in straight away."
"When they meet in Nice, they could abolish the right of veto in European justice policy."
"In this way, they, and later on the Council of Ministers for Justice, can at long last lay down European immigration legislation by enhanced majority, something which this Parliament has been calling for for many years."
"In the case of crime policy, fighting the trafficking in human beings should not be the remit of Europol alone."
"It is necessary to harmonise the penalisation of this crime at European level."
"Indeed, the trafficking in human beings is a prime example of cross-border crime, which is what makes prosecution so difficult. This is why it is necessary to set up a European Public Prosecutor' s department in this field."
"Mr President, there has been enough talk. It is time for action!"
"Mr President, I would join my voice to those who have talked about the tragedy of Dover and the young lives cut short there, but I also want to add my revulsion at the attitude of many people: well, what do you expect, if you take these risks you have got to expect that you might die."
"It is a cruel and judgmental attitude that has appeared in much of the press and it does not help us find a solution."
"If governments are serious about combating trafficking, these are three areas they need to think about."
"How can people legally enter the countries of the European Union, especially those coming from third countries which experience poverty or oppression?"
"Secondly, how can we gain the confidence of those who could provide evidence against trafficking organisations."
"I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon."
"Thirdly, how the current policies of the European Union and its Member States help to create refugees."
"We should not be concentrating so much on a deterrent policy at our borders."
"We need to look at how we are contributing to the incentive to leave."
"We need to examine the consequences of our policies on, for example, trade, its rules and terms and who we will trade with, the conduct of companies based in the European Union and their operations in other countries such as Nigeria, the arms sales by Member States to repressive regimes."
"If we are looking at real co-development, that will be a major step forward and I welcome that."
"I think we should be considering how our open market closed-border policies are assisting the market forces driving the increases in human trafficking."
"Mr President, 58 Chinese immigrants who arrived at Dover, in the hope of a better life, have died in horrific conditions, surrounded by crates of tomatoes."
"I, like all of you, am deeply shocked."
"This crime, however, is a daily occurrence at European Union borders."
"Let us not forget Yagine and Fodé, the two boys from Guinea, who wanted to see Brussels last summer."
"Since the beginning of this year alone, dozens of young people from the Maghreb have drowned trying to reach the Spanish coast."
"Fourteen Kurds died of asphyxiation in the hold of a burning ship in Patras."
"Dozens of Albanians and Tunisians die en route to Italy."
"These are terrifying figures."
"They should be unacceptable in a European Union that prides itself on being based on the protection of human rights."
"How then, can we put an end to this?"
"That is the question."
"The debate that has opened as a result of the Dover tragedy has focused on the traffic in human beings and the eradication of the mafias that organise the criminal networks."
"The trade in smuggling human beings is undeniably flourishing."
"For a long time, we have known about the existence of criminal networks, such as the Chinese Triads, who make huge profits by transporting desperate people to countries that they are led to believe are paradises."
"Mafia networks must therefore be harshly punished, but so must the people who exploit illegal labour, since no immigration networks exist without economic networks."
"As a result, in France, Chinese illegal immigrants are forced to work for years in sweat-shops to pay for their journey."
"These modern-day slaves supply a cheap labour force to whole sectors of the economy, and bosses are therefore free to move them around, even within the European Union."
"The dogma of liberal globalisation has magnified the free movement of goods and capital, but is seeking to stop the free movement of people."
"Emigration, whether it is a result of political oppression or poverty, merely reflects global inequalities. It is a symptom of the ever-widening gulf that separates North and South, and the incentive to emigrate is all the stronger since images of Western prosperity are invading the screens of the third world."
"It is true that the free movement established by the European Union is a fundamental right, but this is reserved for its own nationals."
"Nationals of third countries have seen their movement littered with traps, as a result of the Schengen agreement and the mirage of zero immigration."
"All of these factors have simply created new forms of illegal immigration."
"A purely repressive European response to the issue of immigration would certainly consolidate Europe' s fortification mechanism, but this would be ignoring the most fundamental aspect, which is the uniting of efforts and sharing at global level."
"A seminar is certainly a good idea, Minister, but it should cover a common immigration policy based on the principle of freedom of movement, improving rights..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the horrific death of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants, discovered by British customs officers at Dover, highlights, above all, the scale of the pressure that migration is exerting on the countries of Europe."
"These people came from China, after all, in other words, from the other side of the world, from a country that has nothing to do with Europe and for which we can certainly not serve as an outlet for resolving their problems of poverty."
"In a case which is so typical, the best possible response we can provide is to combat illegal immigration and particularly the mafia-type organisations behind this new form of trafficking in human beings."
"We are rather shocked to hear the words of Commissioner Vitorino, who, on 20 June, on the subject of the Dover tragedy, said that this, amongst other events, was proof of the need for a genuine policy on admission and integration, which makes a definitive break with the fantasy of zero immigration."
"Those who mention the fantasy of zero immigration unfortunately too often do so in an attempt to provide an advance justification for a lenient policy."
"We do not wish to fall into this trap."
"On the contrary, we are calling, as a matter of priority, for a halt to this immigration, not only through a policy of co-development and of fighting the mafias, but also through strengthening control at the Union' s external borders and the reintroduction of controls at its internal borders, which have been so carelessly destroyed by European decisions over recent years."
"Where internal borders are concerned, of course, we will probably not reintroduce fixed controls in the traditional form."
"We must aim for a more flexible network, organised around jointly run border posts, near to borders."
"In any event, however, controls will be needed, otherwise we will face the gradual collapse of our societies' structures, which, if the truth be told, match the aims of globalisation too well not to suit Europe' s enemies to a tee."
"Mr President, less than 5% of lorries that arrive or pass through the port of Dover are stopped, and even less than that 5% are searched."
"So what is to be done?"
"Is it not obvious that we must step up the controls, section more policemen and carry out 20 times the amount of controls in order to be able to guarantee that controls are being carried out properly?"
"And the responses from the Council have not changed; they are still the same: Europol, Eurodac, police cooperation."
"On behalf of the Council, Minister, you informed us that the immigration policy and the fight against crimes related to illegal immigration are two separate issues."
"This cannot possibly be true, it is not true and I would argue that even the Members' speeches illustrate that it is not true."
"Parliament is ready to vote on a joint text - and I urge it to do so - a text which defines the direct relationship between restrictions on immigration and the way organised crime benefits from this trafficking, for this connection lies in the prohibition mechanism."
"Where there is no legal immigration integration policy, when it takes months to obtain work permits, when United Nations reports tell us that our societies, our countries in Europe need a regular influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year, immigrants which are not permitted to enter, not only in the highly-skilled new technology industries but also in the manual labour industries, restaurants and services, when we are under the illusion that we are banning everything and preventing all harm, we find ourselves overtaken by a flood of illegal immigration which is only illegal because it has, in actual fact, been banned by these laws."
"Minister, I believe that Parliament may be able to take a stance on this matter which opposes what you have said today."
"Mr President, we have a problem: we are not moving with events."
"We are here today for the 58 victims of Dover."
"Like Mrs Terrón, I am also from a country, Spain, in which we unfortunately witness hundreds of deaths and disappearances in the Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts."
"There are outbreaks of violence and xenophobia all over Europe and, while here we are talking about a new globalised economic society and a new information society, we do not realise that organised crime, trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation and drug-trafficking have also become globalised."
"All of this is interconnected."
"That is to say, we are talking about a new form of criminality and human slavery which reminds us of the pre-abolitionist era in the United States."
"Chinese, Moroccans, Russians and South Americans are transported, extorted and advised by mafias."
"This is the responsibility of some very important international organisations and there is a desperate need for international cooperation to combat one of the most shameful violations of human rights; international cooperation of European police forces and judges with police and judges in the countries where the migrants come from, who also have responsibility for the problem."
"If they do not have administrative, judicial or police structures, we will have to cooperate with them so that they may be provided with them."
"In this regard, the Action Plans which were mentioned by the representative of the Council may have an important role to play and I hope we can debate them in Parliament more transparently than we have up to now."
"We must go beyond words - as he has also said - because words do not solve the problem."
"We must give the necessary resources to Europol, so that it can work effectively, and to the Action Plans, so that they can be carried out, to the refugee fund and to our borders, so that they can carry out the corresponding controls, because, unfortunately, without economic resources, nothing can be achieved."
"Anything else is mere verbiage and preaching."
"Mr President, the tragedy at Dover was one of the most appalling incidents that anyone here can recall."
"A tragedy for the people involved, a tragedy for their family and friends, but also a tragedy for Europe and the European ideal."
"As a European Parliament, we must do everything we can to prevent a recurrence."
"This appalling incident was avoidable."
"Mr Cappato spoke a few moments ago about the controls at Dover."
"But the authorities in Zeebrugge knew that the lorry in question was suspect."
"They had never heard of the company on the side of the lorry and the driver paid cash for the ferry."
"Accordingly, they alerted the port authorities at Dover."
"Had they checked the vehicle in Belgium some of these lives could certainly have been saved."
"I thank the Minister for his genuine and honest statement."
"He spoke about the real culprits, the organizers."
"And of course he is right that we must fight organized crime and global trafficking, but identifying the culprits is only part of the battle."
"We must do more to support the countries from which these people came and improve the conditions there."
"Can we here in Strasbourg even begin to contemplate the misery and desperation that drove those Chinese people to spend months travelling in clandestine fashion halfway across the world?"
"And their prospects?"
"Probably to work in Chinese restaurants satisfying Westerners' desire for Chinese food."
"But to do this they died a tragic and desperate death because as Europeans we failed to come up with common and workable procedures for asylum and immigration and that must be on all our consciences."
"Mr President, the human tragedy and the facts of these cases are well known and, as Mrs Boudjenah quite rightly pointed out, they were well known long before the Dover tragedy."
"The political will has been made clear, indicating that it is time to pass a legislative act for identifying, arresting and punishing the culprits."
"Minister, Commissioner, you have truly disappointed me."
"You are not even following the line taken at the Tampere Council."
"The Tampere conclusions make a clear call for the Commission to submit a report on the implementation of the conclusions of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration for the consideration of the European Council in December 2000."
"This means that, in six months, you will have to draw up a report on what you have achieved."
"Listening to your speech, I have the feeling that I have been invited not to a Parliamentary sitting, but to a rather posh get-together."
"I had hoped that the Commission would go further, that it would have the courage, for once, to submit proposals, and that it would be able to do what the Council of Ministers is asking it to."
"Minister, the French Presidency may be content to make the point at the next summit, without any real desire to study the Commission' s report or to tell us whether the Commission is fulfilling its contract with regard to Eurodac. If, however, the French Presidency is not able to establish a concrete schedule for legislative procedures to be implemented at European level and to be transposed to Member State level, we will once again face failure, which will lead to another debate like today' s, following further deaths."
"Everyone will complain and Europe will not have made any progress."
"What I am really asking for is for the Commission to show that it is up to the task, and, in line with what President Chirac and Mr Queyranne said, for it to feel sufficiently chastised so that the work requested of it is sufficiently detailed for the politicians, Ministers and the Council finally to be able to take some decisions."
"Mr President, I would say that although emotions are running high everywhere here, trafficking has claimed 2,000 casualties over the past five years."
"What I do see, however, is that the OSCE, the IOM, the Council of Europe, the Commission and Parliament are all coming up with sound proposals. We talk and talk, draft and produce texts and can be very low, very pessimistic, but it is the first time that we are talking at global level and that something is being done to solve the problem."
"I am always a little hopeful, yet realistic on two counts."
"Realistic in the sense that practice and theory are two different things."
"For example, when we repatriate people, for example when we send illegal Poles from Germany back to Poland, you need to realise that, some of them have train tickets, obtained from their illegal employer, to return to Germany, within two hours of their arrival, because that is where they work, where they have their jobs and where they are able to earn money."
"Secondly, we should not overlook the role of the victims."
"This entails reception and a document entitling them to walk around freely."
"And the Chinese must be able to speak out."
"I have experienced this first hand."
"Chinese girls, and women, in particular, are more communicative than men, because I have the impression that women are less fearful when it comes to this kind of thing."
"I know of Chinese girls whose faces have been slashed with knives."
"They are scarred for life."
"If they return, if they are repatriated to their countries of origin, the scars will still be visible."
"They cannot go back."
"You need to realise that we need to be able to repatriate people of their own free will, but I do not believe in this free will."
"I think that for certain people, the situation is more complex than that."
"There are some who are very hopeful and want to go back, but you need to think of the role of the victims."
"In Great Britain, for example, in Dover, in the UK in general, there are no shelters for victims of trafficking in human beings. There is not even any sound legislation concerning this issue."
"Accordingly, Europe is responsible for its own legislation, for what we can do ourselves."
"And we can do this, we are in this fortunate position, unlike countries in the Balkans, the Ukraine, Lithuania, all these countries which are lacking money and resources, where the NGOs are embroiled in a lopsided power struggle."
"I would like to finish off with a comment on the police forces."
"I call on you to provide them with the necessary resources for they are fighting a one-sided war."
"Mr President, there have been deaths which weigh like heavy stones on our hearts and our consciences, deaths which call for a European reception policy, a policy of rights and duties for migrants, a policy which says: in Europe, nobody is a foreigner and nobody is illegal."
"Since 1993, 2063 victims - men, women and children - have died in the struggle to be allowed to live: the earth' s rejects, suffocating in containers, drowning in our seas and committing suicide in detention centres."
"The responsibility lies with the traffickers who now form an international network, and the Union will be forced to employ every means and exploit all possible cooperation between countries in order to break these criminal networks; the responsibility lies with a policy which meets the needs of migrant communities with closed borders; an emergency and security policy which induces fear of invasion."
"Yet immigration from regions near and far is part and parcel of the history of Europe."
"We will overcome illegal trafficking when we tackle the causes of the gap between rich and poor countries, when we practise a policy of cooperation and development which allows everyone to live as a citizen of the world."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for their words and to add my voice to the many who have expressed their shock and horror at this tragic loss of life discovered in Dover."
"The committee which I have the honour to chair has repeatedly made clear its view that we need a European immigration policy."
"This tragedy involving those so desperate to reach our shores - and it is of course no isolated incident - throws into sharp relief the lack of an immigration policy."
"We know that the numbers trying to come to our continent are not in fact increasing over time."
"It is simply that as the legal avenues have closed, so the private sector has moved in to exploit the illegal avenues."
"Last year's summit in Tampere gave a mandate to the Commission to start moving towards a common policy and I understand from my meeting last week with Mr Chevenement, President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, that the French presidency will launch initiatives to deal with the persons involved, to deal with the transporters of these victims."
"The European Parliament looks forward to being consulted on these initiatives."
"But these are not enough."
"How long will it take for governments to realize that they have no clothes in this matter?"
"How long will it take for them to realize that the criminals are so far ahead of them, and to develop the methods of police cooperation which will put an end to this vile trafficking?"
"I am even tempted to suggest that they might use things like the Echelon system to start fighting against these traffickers, but that might be rather provocative in view of the vote coming up on Thursday."
"The fact is that we should be proud that we have developed a society which is so attractive that people wish to come and join us, but we should perhaps also be rather ashamed that our development aid policy has not been more successful in reducing the push factors in some of the countries of origin."
"Until we succeed - and I recognise the work of the high-level working groups - in reducing these push factors, we ought perhaps to open our doors a little."
"It might even be in our own interest, rejuvenating an ageing population and enriching our own culture."
"I am pleased to hear that Canada is among the countries invited to the presidency's seminar."
"We might be advised to take a leaf out of Canada's book."
"The Liberal Government's proposals there are to close the backdoor to illegal immigration but at the same time open the front door to a legal migration policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate has enabled us to see that there is a broad consensus on the Tampere Summit guidelines, and in particular, on the three elements, the first of which consists of our relations with the countries of origin. This element also comprises actions for co-development, which we must improve, since immigration is a result of inequality and of the desire of people without jobs or prospects to come to richer countries."
"The second element is the provision of legal residence for foreign nationals and, from this point of view, I do not think that a policy of zero immigration is right for Europe."
"I think that this would be unrealistic."
"We must allow foreign nationals who live in our countries to live free from discrimination, and to become integrated."
"The third and last element consists of combating illegal immigration, and particularly criminal networks."
"I share the opinion of many of today' s speakers, such as Mr Cappato, for example, when they say that these criminal networks are part of organised crime."
"We must therefore stand up to these international organisations, these powerful mafias, which deliberately try to take advantage of loopholes in the law, problems in cooperation and the extremely high demand in the countries concerned."
"Under our Presidency, we have the opportunity to build on the proposals presented in this debate."
"I am thinking in particular of the proposal by Commissioner Vitorino on readmission agreements with the countries of origin, such as China, for example, with regard to making the trafficking in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation a specific crime."
"I also think that we must work together on specific proposals, such as the timetable for their implementation that you requested, including the regulation implementing Eurodac, which must be completed by the end of the year, in response to Mr Pirker' s question."
"Above all, we must use this presidency to clarify guidelines, particularly those on Europe' s long-term immigration policy."
"We have planned an informal Council meeting, a Justice and Home Affairs Council, for the end of this month, in Marseilles, and, to that end, we have tabled this issue on the agenda."
"Moreover, the Chairman of your Committee, Mr Watson, is also due to take part in this debate at the end of the month."
"I should like to point out that honourable Members of this Parliament are invited to attend the various conferences that will be held within this framework."
"Mr President, I am convinced, at the end of this debate, that there are only two fronts on which we can combat illegal immigration and in particular the types of exploitation it involves. This exploitation has been universally condemned following the Dover tragedy, as well as other incidents in the Straits of Gibraltar and on the coasts of several of our countries."
"Legislation must be harmonised because people should no longer be able to play on the present differences in laws on asylum and on punishment between countries and consequently play the free movement card to try to evade European vigilance. We also need closer cooperation because we are dealing here with powerful organisations, which must be confronted."
"In my opinion, Europe' s role, through the work of the Council, the Commission, which can nurture these ideas, and Parliament, is to promote our concept of immigration, which is balanced and humane, and to guarantee that human rights are respected in spite of the rising tide of organised crime and trafficking in human beings."
"First of all, I should like to state the Commission' s position on the Tampere programme."
"I must emphasise the fact that, since Tampere, the Commission has already proposed a number of legislative instruments, so that they can be discussed by the Council and adopted within the deadlines that have been established by the scoreboard."
"I am not only talking about the instrument for the regulation of Eurodac. I am also talking about the proposal for a decision on the European Refugee Fund, the directive on temporary protection, the revision of the Dublin Convention, which determines which State is responsible for examining applications for asylum, and the results of the consultation on the definition of the common rules of procedure on asylum issues."
"I think that we could even add the fact that, where legal immigration is concerned, the Commission has tabled a proposal for a directive allowing the families of foreign nationals working in the Union to join them."
"We carried out these measures in the six months following Tampere, in compliance with the deadline adopted under the scoreboard that the Commission presented to the Council."
"The Commission is not behind schedule, and although this is a complex debate, it is under way, both in Parliament and in the Council."
"I therefore understand why Mr Ducarme should say that he feels disappointed."
"We all feel disappointed and the reality of the situation is indeed disappointing, but I must tell you - and this point needs to be emphasised - that the Commission has tabled the proposals that were laid down within the deadlines that were set."
"You said that my speech did not match the deadline that was set for the end of this year, so that the Nice European Council can evaluate the policy on asylum and immigration."
"With regard to this point, I suggest that you look more closely at which deadlines we are in fact discussing."
"Nice has the task of undertaking a preliminary evaluation of the work of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration."
"These action plans have been drawn up by that Group and I must tell you that the Commission has more grounds for optimism today than it did three months ago, because we have managed to reach agreement with the Member States on measures for co-development that the Commission will have to implement under several Community policies, including those on human rights, economics and development aid."
"The Commission and the Member States have also reached agreement on measures to be adopted by Member States, with the five action plan countries."
"The deadline of December 2000 that I mentioned is another deadline altogether!"
"This deadline was not set for the Nice Council. This is a deadline that was set at Tampere for the approval of a legislative instrument which establishes common definitions, common incriminations and common punishments for trafficking in human beings, and specifically for trafficking in women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation."
"The Commission can reassure you on this point."
"Both the French Presidency and Mr Queyranne have just said that the French Presidency has tabled a proposal for a legislative instrument, a framework decision for the incrimination of trafficking and smuggling. The Commission itself is fully on time with this deadline and with presenting a framework decision for the prosecution of trafficking in human beings."
"I therefore think that we are indeed putting forward initiatives and I am counting on the support both of the Council and Parliament to be able to conclude these legislative procedures within the deadlines that have been fixed."
"I should simply like to make two additional comments: the first, which is directed at Mr Berthu, who, unfortunately, is no longer present, is that, when I was talking about the fantasy of zero immigration, I meant that sometimes, the argument of zero immigration is used as a rhetorical instrument."
"When one condemns the fantasy or the rhetoric of zero immigration, one does so in order to suggest that there is an alternative, and the alternative is to have a proactive immigration policy, which puts at the top of the list of common concerns the integration of legal immigrants into the societies that receive them. One condemns it in order to clarify the criteria and the principles of a coordinated immigration policy at European level."
"That is the alternative and - I am sorry to say so - I do not share the idea that the alternative is to reintroduce internal border controls by means of jointly run police stations, which would not be on the border, but thirty kilometres away from the border."
"Lastly, my second comment is to say that I am delighted at the fact that this debate has achieved a very broad consensus on the priority we must give to the fight against organised crime, and I shall make a wish. My wish is that this consensus still exists when, at the right time, encouraged by the French Presidency and supported by the Commission, and within the deadlines fixed at Tampere, this Parliament is provided with the necessary instruments for combating money laundering."
"I say this because to combat money laundering is to have an effective instrument with which to combat organised crime."
"That is not rhetoric, because it is taking the fight to the very area in which the battle must be won."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, at 12 noon."
"1998 discharge (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the 1998 discharge."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you will be aware, this morning' s joint debate on granting discharge to the Commission was not closed, since we still had to hear Commissioner Schreyer' s final speech."
"The Commissioner is now present and I am therefore delighted to give her the floor, after which we can close the joint debate on the issue of granting discharge."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"LIFE"
"The next item is the report (A5-0172/2000) by Mrs Lienemann, on behalf of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text adopted by the Conciliation Committee on the European Parliament and Council regulation (EC) concerning the financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (C5-0221/2000 - 1998/0336(COD))."
"- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the LIFE III second reading debate held here back in February, we concluded that this regulation was better than the LIFE I and LIFE II regulations."
"It was better because it was more rigorous, more transparent and more rational."
"It was better because it established the promotion of employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting potential projects."
"It was better because it established the reduction of the global impact of products, from manufacture to recycling and disposal, as one of the objectives that LIFE­Environment should achieve."
"Lastly, it was better because it established the improvement and planning of coastal areas as one of LIFE­Environment' s priorities."
"Despite these positive points, there remained four areas of disagreement between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and these were dealt with under the conciliation procedure."
"These areas were the budget, comitology, provision for a fourth stage of LIFE and the objectives of LIFE­Environment."
"The work under the conciliation procedure added further improvements to the LIFE III regulation and we can say quite simply that, although we lost on the issue of comitology, we managed to get our views across on the essential issues."
"I therefore congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, both on her work at first and second reading and on her work during the conciliation procedure."
"I would like to highlight what I think are the two most relevant points."
"With regard to the budget for the period 2000-2004, which was the main issue at stake, we would clearly have preferred to agree on an amount closer to EUR 850 million - the sum proposed by the European Parliament - than the EUR 613 million set by the Commission and the Council."
"Nevertheless, as they say, politics is the art of the possible, and if we had not agreed, as we finally did in conciliation, on an amount of EUR 640 million, we would have ended up bearing the political responsibility for leaving thousands of projects in limbo and without financial support for the year 2000."
"In any event, we told the Commission and the Council once again that, as far as Parliament is concerned, although these appropriations are more than the common position provided for, they still fall short of the sum that LIFE has demonstrated it deserves."
"I should also like to express my satisfaction with the agreement that has enabled us to integrate the sustainable management of water and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the objectives for LIFE­Environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, they say that every era and every generation creates an image that defines its relationship with nature."
"The concept of relationships with nature is changing radically in our own time."
"In future we will not be able to subordinate this relationship to profit, selfishness and exploitation."
"Whatever today' s policies may be, they must reflect this new philosophy of a relationship between mankind and society with the environment."
"With this in mind, the European Union has pioneered legislation in the field of environmental protection and has also been a key partner in international negotiations and agreements on the global protection of the planet."
"The transposition of European directives into national legislation has played and continues to play a crucial role in all our countries, particularly Portugal."
"The LIFE programme is just one financial instrument at the service of the European Union' s environmental policies and of those of its neighbouring countries in the Baltic, the Mediterranean and in Eastern Europe."
"This is not, however, the only financial instrument with repercussions for environmental policies. We know, for example, that regional and agricultural policy, which is to a large extent harmful, has an enormous impact on the environment and on Europe' s land and water."
"It is undeniably important for LIFE to be adopted."
"Having experienced many vicissitudes and a period of paralysis with regard to the projects financed by this programme, the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament finally formalised an agreement specifically on a budgetary framework of EUR 640 million for the period 2000-2004."
"LIFE III will therefore be operational before the summer."
"The agreement that was finally reached has many good points, part of the credit for which must go to the Portuguese Presidency - which once again demonstrated its constructive and efficient relationship with the European Parliament as well as its ability to mediate. Credit is also due to the European Parliament delegation and specifically to Mrs Lienemann."
"I also wish to welcome the agreement reached by the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament on the framework directive on water, an instrument that is crucial for the European Union' s environmental policy."
"Mr President, the European LIFE programme is the key European Union initiative to integrate environmental measures into the broad ambit of European Union policies."
"The Union as a political entity has a moral and legal obligation to ensure that a clean environment is protected and promoted under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty."
"In fact between1992 and 1992 the LIFE initiative cofinanced nearly 1600 projects with a total Community contribution of approximately EUR 2.1 billion."
"I am especially satisfied that the European LIFE programme has promoted the use of cleaner technologies and has also financially supported many waste recycling programmes."
"From an Irish perspective over 90% of our waste is still dealt with via landfill sites."
"I would like to welcome initiatives taken by the Irish government, including diverting 50% of all household waste away from landfill sites, reducing by up to 65% biodegradable waste consigned to landfill, developing broader waste recovery facilities and reducing methane emissions by up to 80%."
"I also welcome the fact that the Member States have allocated an increase of EUR 27 million for the new LIFE programme for the next five years and that the overall budgetary allocation made to the LIFE programme will be in the region of EUR 640 million."
"Congratulations to the rapporteur."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30."
"2001 budget (conciliation procedure)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0184/2000) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2001 budget in view of the conciliation procedure before the Council's first reading."
"Mr President, we find ourselves in a phase of the budget which resembles the lull before the storm."
"The Commission has submitted a second preliminary draft on which the agricultural sector would certainly like to comment."
"First of all, the European budget comes off worse compared to other major continents because there is less public funding available here compared to those other continents."
"Secondly, the budget has not yet reached the prescribed ceiling. I hope that the Council will make up the difference, if not, Parliament will be submitting proposals."
"There are also a few other issues which have struck me."
"We need to try to use the budget efficiently."
"On the one hand, there is a reshuffle of the headings, also in this budget, which begs the question as to whether the relative stability or the European Union as a whole are safeguarded."
"Does the budget tie in sufficiently with discussions with a social dimension within the European Union, such as those pertaining to consumer affairs, the environment and animal welfare?"
"The European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is open to issues of this kind, also with regard to proposals which may or may not be submitted."
"The same applies to the quality of policy, and in this connection, particular attention should be given to whether policy helps maintain a high-grade rural environment in Europe from a financial point of view."
"Can Europe' s rural environment count on adequate care and financial means?"
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development' s report and the opinion show that we welcome the deferment of the discussion regarding the EUR 300 million set aside for the reconstruction of the Balkans as far as it goes."
"The discussion has been postponed until October, but the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pulled no punches in this respect."
"The second point I would like to make in this connection is that, since every year, we have some money left in the agricultural budget, it should be possible to use this money the year after i.e. to earmark it and not to return it."
"Thirdly, particularly in respect of agricultural policy, resources must be used more effectively and more pressure should be exerted on the Member States or the Commission in order to speed up the submission of plans which can then be implemented adequately."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for an excellent report, and for having come to hear the views of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Our committee tabled two amendments for the report."
"Owing to tight meeting timetables, they have been brought to the plenary session via my own group, and I hope that they may be adopted."
"Amendment No 19 reminds everyone that there must be adequate payment appropriations for Structural Funds programmes, trans-European transport networks and other budget headings relating to transport, so that the programmes may be effectively implemented right at the start of the programming period."
"In this way payments made at the end of the programming period - as was the case the previous year - are avoided."
"Amendment No 20 concerns innovative measures."
"The appropriation must be kept at the level decided at Berlin."
"We have to remember that the Interinstitutional Agreement contains a pledge that the reduction in appropriations by EUR 200 million made the previous year should be made good this year."
"Our committee is not proposing to move appropriations set aside under the URBAN initiative to be used for innovative measures: the compensating appropriations have to be found elsewhere."
"The importance of innovation was stressed both at the Lisbon and Feira summits."
"Innovation must therefore be adequately supported."
"The implementation in practice of innovative measures in the area of Structural Funds has not got under way because preparatory work on the part of the Commission has lagged seriously behind."
"Our committee supports the policy of support for employment and the importance of SMEs in Mrs Haug' s report."
"The Commission and the Member States should also simplify and speed up administration procedures relating to Structural Funds."
"More attention should be paid to the success of projects at approval stage."
"Mr President, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are enthusiastic supporters of the common foreign and security policy, and we are also supporters of these Special Envoys which, at the moment, are inscribed in the Commission' s budget. If I need to mention the Special Envoys at all, it is because the Council is insisting on transferring the financing of the Special Envoys to the Council' s administrative budget."
"That may sound very sensible. The problem, however, is that, in doing so, there is a loss of the inspection and the control that of course exists in the case of budget items in the Commission' s budget."
"I therefore agree with what is stated in Mrs Haug' s report, namely that we must insist that these appropriations for Special Envoys remain on the Commission' s budget, for we in that way ensure continued parliamentary inspection and control and ensure that Parliament continues, for example, to be listened to and kept informed. In the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have been sufficiently constructive, however, as to think also about how a medium-term solution might possibly be found in a situation where negotiations with the Council were taking place."
"This can be read about in the Foreign Affairs Committee' s contribution to Mrs Haug' s report. For if the Council definitely wants these appropriations to appear in the Council' s budget, there is, of course, the possibility of the Council' s, in return, entering into a type of inter-institutional agreement with ourselves here in Parliament, whereby the Council promises to give us the same information, control, inspection facilities etc as if the appropriations had appeared in the Commission' s budget."
"That is, therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee' s constructive contribution, and I should like to add that we, of course, also insist that, whenever anything new is adopted concerning the common foreign and security policy - be it in terms of expenditure or of initiatives - the Council must inform the European Parliament."
". Mr President, I begin by endorsing the plaudits that have been offered to Mrs Haug."
"She has indeed worked quite hard although, in the case of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am afraid she was working so hard that she was not able to pay anything more than a goodwill visit to our committee."
"Therefore we have prepared the opinion which is before Parliament."
"I will briefly touch on some of the points that arise from it."
"Firstly, I want to support the points that are made by Mrs Haug concerning the implications of spending in the Balkans."
"It is a matter that has been of significant concern to the Industry Committee."
"We are particularly concerned about the implications for a wide range of the programmes that fall within our remit."
"It certainly is the case that, with the move to activity-based budgeting, we are moving away from the concept that everything that was previously in the budget has to be preserved for the future."
"Nonetheless a great deal of the programmes that are within our remit would be significantly affected by the spending proposals for the Balkans, unless Mrs Haug is successful."
"So on behalf of the Industry Committee I should like to voice our support for her in that regard."
"In two particular areas we are affected by multiannual programmes."
"I want to reiterate our commitment in the research area."
"I recognise that this is not a matter that is affected by the budget on this occasion, but we should not ignore the changes we are seeing in the energy sphere with Save and Altener."
"The figures that we see are seeing for Save, where there is a significant reduction in the budget for energy efficiency schemes, are a result of the budgetary process last year."
"That is only just now coming through."
"The final point I want to make in the trade sphere relates to the need for us to ensure that the omnibus regulation for the transatlantic dialogue is adapted."
"I hope the Commissioner will take that on board."
"Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries has been calling for the strengthening of the common fisheries policy on an international level as well."
"We must support our fishing industry and help it to be placed on an equal level with giants such as the United States, Russia or Japan."
"As draftsperson of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to express my satisfaction with the Committee on Budgets' support for our proposals on the international fishing organisations and agreements."
"Firstly, I will refer to our contribution to the international organisations."
"In an increasingly globalised world, the Union must increase its presence in these organisations which regulate offshore fishing, for reasons of prestige, good management of resources and, above all, the defence of the interests of our industry and our workers."
"My second point concerns the international agreements."
"This six-month period, with the French Presidency of the Council, will be decisive in terms of completing the negotiation of these agreements, including, amongst others, the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco."
"We are all concerned about the prolonged inactivity - seven months now - of the Community fleet which was fishing in Moroccan waters."
"This is by far the European Union' s most important agreement in this area and our main priority: five hundred boats, thousands of fishermen out of work and many economically paralysed areas depend on its renewal."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her work, which has not been easy, and I am happy that the amounts envisaged by the Commission for the funding of the agreements to be negotiated in 2000 and 2001, the agreement with Morocco amongst others, have been respected."
"Meanwhile, Mrs Haug, your report is a clear sign of the European Parliament' s support for the Community' s negotiators and for the thousands of European families who are impatiently waiting for the negotiations to be concluded."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Budgets for their sound cooperation."
"Secondly, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is extremely keen to radically expand its budget compared to last year, because we have 45 million children in Africa with no primary education and an increasing number of poor in the world, whilst our continent is becoming increasingly rich."
"But we maintain a sense of realism."
"We are prepared to make do with reducing spending to the 2000 level and thus cancel out the cut-backs which the Commission proposed in favour of financing Kosovo."
"No more, no less."
"We are aware of the broad support we enjoy in this Parliament."
"Thirdly, the issue of modernising the budget is essential."
"This morning, we talked about the 1998 discharge."
"The way this discharge is currently organised leaves a great deal to be desired. With our help, the Commission would like to change tack."
"The new approach involves a clear definition of goals and sectors within regional programmes, explicit grouping of sector-specific goals and a clear division of budget lines. We will, as a result, be able to deploy personnel where they are needed to carry out the activities."
"This results in a classification according to DAC sectors."
"It is a modernised budget and at the same time, it will inform us whether we have actually achieved the results projected in the budget, as will be apparent from the reports in Parliament."
"This budget, therefore, also accommodates the EDF budget, although we are not harmonised legally but we are in terms of content. The sum total will, as it were, show that we are clearly focussed on fighting poverty across different sectors."
"We very much hope that with this line of attack, namely a modernised budget, we will be able to turn the negative image, about which Commissioner Patten had every right to complain so bitterly, into a positive image of a Europe which is open to fighting poverty at world level."
"- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion on the 2001 budget is progressing."
"We are gradually gaining an understanding of the positions being adopted by the Commission, particularly with regard to the preliminary draft budget, and the Council will soon state its position."
"I believe that in the course of this complex process, whilst Parliament is working towards consensus on its views amongst Members so that it can advocate these views as vigorously as possible, it must demand complete clarification of the Commission' s proposals, as well as objectivity in the Council' s position. Parliament must then move forward, as a whole, with its own position."
"So we have reached a stage in the clarification process when ""wait and see"" stance is appropriate."
"It seems pointless at this juncture to make threats, to proclaim Parliament' s power or to put forward all of our views at once."
"Everyone realises, or will realise, the importance of the European Parliament in the budgetary process and how important it is to achieve consensus in this process."
"In the meantime, we need to know more about certain fundamental issues, such as:"
"implementation of the 2000 budget, especially both parts 1-A and 1-B of heading 1, ""Agriculture"" ;"
"evaluating the reductions proposed by the Commission in internal policy sectors - heading 3 - particularly bearing in mind the justification for these reductions and their effects on the policies that have been targeted;"
"promoting an in-depth analysis of the proposals for reforming the Commission, including the staffing needs of the directorates-general and its policy on externalisation;"
"identifying the priorities of the Council and the Commission with regard to external actions - heading 4 - and clarifying the relationship between commitments and payments under this heading, by investigating the reasons for the worrying delay in the implementation of commitments and by ascertaining the quality of the expenditure;"
"gaining full information on what is being proposed in the new programme for the Western Balkans, including Serbia and Kosovo, particularly with regard to its financing;"
"information on how it is intended to finance the common security and defence policy."
"As you will see just from these examples, what we need to know goes well beyond the discussion on financing the Western Balkans."
"In fact, it would be a mistake for the European Parliament to reduce the discussion of the 2001 budget to this one issue."
"I have two final observations."
"Taking the appropriations for payment as a point of reference, in 2000 these totalled 1.11% of the gross national product of the Member States, but a lower amount is being proposed for 2001, corresponding to 1.0%."
"Does it make sense to try to deepen the European project and at the same time to reduce the relative value of the European Union budget year on year?"
"And, bearing in mind the figures that I have just mentioned, does it make sense to discuss the financing of new priorities and to actually question some of the priorities already established, while at the same time returning considerable unutilised sums to the Member States?"
"I congratulate Mrs Haug on her fine work."
"Mr President, all the points I have to make are addressed to the Council and even though there is no-one on the front bench I am sure the hardworking scribes will relay that information back to the Presidency and to all the Council delegations."
"If you look at the Haug report, Parliament wants to find a solution."
"We are actually looking for agreement with the Council on the way to get a good budget by the end of this year."
"Let us get that point clear."
"We are not looking for confrontation, we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together."
"But do not be fooled into thinking that we are not prepared to take hard decisions if necessary."
"It is pretty hard to get an agreement when the Council just ignores Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Ever since the PDB was published by the Commission they have been duty bound to discuss with us the revision of the Financial Perspective which was proposed by the Commission."
"They have failed to do that."
"On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused."
"That makes it pretty difficult."
"And that will be at the forefront of our discussions at the trialogue this week and in the conciliation on 20 July."
"Whatever the Council votes on 20 July we will still be making that point in the autumn when it comes to our first reading."
"From the very first trialogue of this year with the Portuguese Presidency, the one thing that was obvious to everyone is that we need an agreement between the three institutions on the funding for the western Balkans."
"I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now."
"The Council's position is about 200 million less than ours, which means that we will not get an agreement on that and unless we have an agreement there is going to be a problem in how we fund the needs in category 4."
"It seems now that there might be some possibility of redeploying funds from the MEDA programme to help solve our problem."
"For an institution that tells us that what was agreed in Berlin was set in concrete, I think the Council has a bit of a cheek in moving large sums of money from the MEDA programme which they agreed 12 months ago and then lecturing us about what can and cannot be moved."
"Having said that, we are of course, prepared to listen to the Council, to hear what their suggestions are and I look forward to our trialogue this week and the conciliation meeting on 20 July."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her excellent report."
"The report under discussion concerns Parliament' s provisional position on the budget in the conciliation talks that are to be held."
"Just as Mr Wynn said, the problems really mainly concern Category 4: External Action, and the reconstruction of the Balkans."
"Last Spring the Commission proposed the so-called CARDS programme for the reconstruction of the Western Balkans."
"Its total value is EUR 5.5 billion."
"EUR 1.9 billion has already been found for the programme; of the remainder, EUR 1.4 billion would be found by the reallocation of Category 4 funds, and 1.8 billion by moving funds from the section of the budget dealing with agriculture."
"The sum to be reallocated is therefore approximately 5% of the total sum under Category 4, so that it may be technically possible, given there is sufficient political will."
"However, the use of agricultural expenditure for the reconstruction of Kosovo is not fair, as each EU citizen must play a part in the work and not just the farming community."
"In addition, the future needs of agriculture are hard to estimate, as the Agenda 2000 reforms are only just starting and the WTO talks are in their elementary stages."
"The Commission' s proposal for the CARDS programme is explicit and our group supports it."
"EU Member States have to bear the responsibility for the reconstruction of the Balkans, as most of them were keen supporters of the military action there, and many also took part in it."
"Unless the countries of Europe help th-e inhabitants of the Balkans in their reconstruction work, honourably and vigorously, then this could result in a deep feeling of resentment and bitterness that could last for generations."
"Military action is always an extreme measure, and somebody must always suffer the consequences."
"When the Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council and Parliament, which contained the financial perspectives for the years 2000 - 2006, was made, it was forecast that the reconstruction of Kosovo might call for 'fresh' resources."
"This is stated in point 3 of Mrs Haug' s report."
"The Council has, however, signalled that it will not adopt any amendment to the financial perspectives - not even between categories."
"The CARDS programme is so huge that it is impossible to adapt it to the present financial perspectives."
"There are two alternatives ahead: to fund just part of the programme, or table an amendment to the financial perspectives."
"The Council is responsible for the reconstruction of the Balkans."
"If it merely promises money, but is not prepared to give it, its credibility as a global player shrinks."
"In that case Parliament will have to act within the framework of the financial perspectives, which will mean severe cutbacks in the CARDS programme."
"Mr President, Mrs Haug is rapporteur in a novel situation."
"For the first time since the Berlin Agreement, negotiations will take place in the Council before first reading regarding a possible review of the financial perspective."
"My groups welcomes this development."
"The Commission' s initiative is necessary in order to finance the Stability Pact for the Balkans."
"We also endorse the plan to earmark resources for Serbia in the post-Milosevic era."
"Due to the Council' s attitude in last year' s difficult negotiations, there is insufficient trust in political pledges without a financial picture to match."
"But although we agree with the thrust of the Commission' s plan, my group would probably have reached different conclusions regarding the size and distribution of the proposed reductions under the external policy heading."
"As it stands now, the civil society, i.e. activities by non-governmental organisations in terms of human rights projects, is proportionately having to foot the lion' s share of the bill, and this seems to me a recipe for disaster if we want to achieve stability in the long run."
"My group hopes that the Council is prepared to take a constructive stance and at long last to live up to its pledge to make sufficient resources available for new priorities, such as the Stability Pact, without causing lasting damage to existing policy, which is put on the back burner for reasons other than content."
"This request has not yet been met - or so it seems, which is detrimental."
"The EU' s credibility will be in the balance, and in my opinion, this is a bad start for the further development of the EU' s foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, spectrum auctions are pushing up profits in Member States in a manner never before seen."
"At the same time the reconstruction of Kosovo, after the illegal war there, is being financed at the expense of other countries receiving aid, in a way that is improper and dishonest."
"Our group supports the former position expressed by Parliament, according to which the Council must agree to amend the financial perspectives, particularly with regard to Category 4."
"Waging wars and rebuilding countries must not be allowed to happen at the expense of former preferences in the budget."
"We also support the committee' s position according to which expenditure set aside for a common foreign and security policy is operational expenditure, which must remain the budgetary responsibility of the Commission."
"That will clarify the context in which discharge is granted."
"Furthermore, the granting of discharge must also concern a common foreign and security policy."
"However, we will not support the Council and Commission line wherein the main political focus will not shift at all towards the prevention of unemployment."
"Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, we spent this morning discussing institutional affairs with President Jacques Chirac and this afternoon discussing budgetary matters which really amounts to one and the same thing."
"Firstly, the budget with its EUR 93 million in payment appropriations represents a 5% increase, whereas national budgets are subject to greater austerity."
"However, the European agricultural budget is also experiencing a period of austerity, even though outwardly it appears to have grown by 7%."
"Agricultural revenue has dropped and so this 7% is a mere illusion; we have simply moved from a price support policy to an income support policy."
"We are witnessing the continued, and wholly scandalous, misappropriation of EUR 300 million of agricultural funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as though the Balkans formed part of the CAP!"
"The CAP is being drastically cut back to the advantage of the CFSP and, as you will see, this is being carried out with no modification to the Treaties."
"We are here as part of a consultation procedure that the Treaties do not provide for and we are operating within the framework of an Interinstitutional Agreement of May 1999 that the Treaties do not provide for either."
"Over the past 20 years, non-essential expenditure has increased from 5% to more than 45% of the total budget expenditure without any modification to the Treaties."
"We have carried out an institutional revolution, to Parliament' s advantage, without an IGC."
"Does this mean that the institutions are to adapt spontaneously or that the European Commission and Council will be able to operate with 20-21 members just as they do with 15 and, empirically speaking, solutions will be found?"
"If at the IGC in Nice we tried to make enlargement conditional upon deepening, this would be viewed as a pretext for delaying the entry of the countries of the East, and Poland has recently voiced its displeasure at this."
"We are all aware that the accession of the countries of the East would mean a budgetary revolution and increased taxes."
"In other words, the revolution that looks set to take place in European affairs over the coming ten years is not an institutional one but a budgetary and tax one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Haug report is a good report, particularly the part that deals with cuts in agriculture, which, in my opinion, are the key issue."
"It is a mistake to make cuts in heading 1, for agriculture is an essential factor in our economy, the economy of the European Union."
"Agriculture is certainly a fundamental part of any debate on boosting development or employment, not because any of us are agriculture lobbyists but because agriculture must not lose its funding."
"This point must be stressed, although the report also stresses the difficulty of finding sources of funding for that most remarkable and certainly important operation to be carried out in Kosovo."
"My question is this: is it possible to carry out the Kosovo operation without taking funds away from other credit lines in our budget?"
"And the answer is that yes, it is possible, it can be done without cutting other credit lines or interfering with sectors which are fundamental for the development of the economy within the European Union but rather giving them financial security for, if we do not do so, we will certainly weaken the European market and the euro against their competitors, NAFTA and the dollar."
"Therefore, since we profess to have an ongoing budgetary policy which must certainly be focused chiefly on boosting economic development and the economic growth of the individual countries, it is not at all sensible to be financing operations such as the Kosovo operation if this means that we cannot predict the extent to which we will be able to finance budget credit lines."
"Moreover, the very fact that the Council is setting a precedent by including Special Envoys and all our special interventions in its own budget lines is a serious matter. This must stop."
"It must be seen as highly negative. In my opinion, if we invert this trend, we will be doing a great favour to both our economy and Parliament."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"I also congratulate her on her efforts to reach a consensus, which is a very difficult job."
"There is an irrefutable fact in her report: category 4, which was approved in Berlin, may become insufficient if we continue to add the funding of new commitments."
"On the other hand, the implementation figures for programmes outside the European Union are very poor and in some cases this is the fault of third countries and in others, the majority of cases, it is the fault of the Commission."
"What is clear is that the budgetary implementations do not match the effort made in recent years to introduce these programmes into the budget."
"Furthermore, we have the problem of the European Councils."
"Every six months we have new commitments to finance because the Council has identified new priorities without consulting Parliament."
"Over time, all of this is resulting in a postponement of the decision on the non-obligatory expenses incurred by the Council, and this decision and postponement were not provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"To sum up, I would like to say that Terence Wynn' s position seems to me to be very coherent."
"This is logical, since he is also chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"I believe that - as he says - we must enter into trialogue with very open minds."
"It is clear that nobody is managing to give a reliable estimate of what is needed in Kosovo."
"It is also true that if we have to cut the external programmes, we must do so according to a principle of linearity and if it is not done in that way, somebody somewhere is assuming a very great responsibility."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Interinstitutional Agreement is something this House must maintain."
"If anybody is going to be irresponsible, let it not be us."
"Mr President, it was to be expected, but it always causes a certain degree of anxiety, mixed with impatience, to see once again that the negotiation of the European budget still leads to the conflict so typical of recent years."
"This is almost a carbon copy of the procedure for the 2000 budget."
"Once again, the insufficiency of what was adopted in Berlin, in March 1999, for external policy, rocks the foundations of the Community budget. The Council' s short-sightedness hinders any logical solution."
"Rather than a budgetary cycle, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that we have a budgetary big wheel."
"Somehow or other, the Commission has honoured its commitment to propose a multi-annual plan for the Balkans."
"However, sincerely, I agree to a large extent with the Council' s criticism that the figures do not seem particularly well founded."
"As the former MEP, Lord Tomlinson, said, there is nothing more expensive than a meal amongst Foreign Affairs Ministers: they are always ready to promise money without considering where it will come from."
"I truly believe that the proposal is rather inappropriate and has no sense of time."
"They are proposing to move funds intended for agriculture to foreign policy and these proposals have not even been accepted by the United Kingdom."
"Just imagine."
"That is no way to make progress."
"With regard to Serbia, they propose more than EUR 2 billion over the period."
"I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in order to topple Pinochet, the European Community spent EUR 10 million."
"Our contribution to the campaign against Pinochet in the referendum was EUR 10 million."
"We spend EUR 40 million a year on the democratic forces in Serbia and they are asking for two hundred and something more."
"When Milosevic falls, I will be the first to accept a revision of the financial perspectives."
"However, meanwhile, let us forget the annual EUR 200 million from now until the end of the period."
"Let us not push things to the limit."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I do not know if the Council is aware of the real situation."
"If it rules out - as it has ruled out - moving money from category 1A, Agriculture, to category 4, and does not accept any increase in the ceiling of category 4 for foreign policy, and all of this must be done by means of a redistribution of resources, we are simply dealing with a case of a non-revision of the financial perspectives."
"We are simply dealing with a case of budgetary procedure in the field of non-obligatory expenditure and, therefore, the most that could be said would be that the Council has not complied with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to make some general comments about the 2001 Budget."
"In respect of the fisheries budget, I note that an increase of over 27% is proposed in the funding of international agreements."
"These are the southern agreements with third countries which enable EU vessels to fish in the waters of Morocco, Mauritania, Argentina and elsewhere."
"I must remind the House that these agreements currently cost EU taxpayers EUR 269 million a year and are primarily of benefit to the fishing fleets of Spain, Portugal and France."
"These southern agreements are always calculated on a cash-for-fish basis while northern agreements on the other hand are arranged on a reciprocal basis."
"It is this disparity between southern and northern Member States which is evident in the CAP as well as in the CFP budget."
"For example, the Commission recently announced an arbitrary cut in export refunds which will cost the Scotch whisky industry around EUR 32 million a year."
"Their explanation was simply that Scotch whisky is a rich industry and therefore does not require any subsidy."
"Why then do we discover that it is intended to increase the subsidy to wine growers by 64.5% next year, taking the budget to over EUR 1 billion?"
"Why is the olive oil industry receiving an 8.9% increase providing them with almost EUR 2.5 billion next year, and most shockingly of all, how on earth can we justify giving to tobacco growers an increase of 2.8% taking their subsidies to over EUR 1 billion when we know that tobacco products kill half a million of our citizens every year."
"Meanwhile, the beleaguered dairy sector with dairy farmers suffering across the EU will receive a paltry increase of funding of only 0.3%."
"Let us make sure the budget is for all EU citizens and not just for the southern EU Member States."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0532/00)."
"We will examine questions to the Council, which is represented by Mr Moscovici, Minister for European Affairs, who many of you will know since he is a former Member of the European Parliament."
"Question No 1 by (H-0518/00):"
"Subject: Common foreign and security policy In view of the imminent development of a common foreign and security policy within the Treaty, what arrangements will the Presidency be making to ensure that Parliament is kept fully informed and is properly consulted in this field?"
"In particular, when will Mr Alain Richard, Minister of Defence, be willing to appear at a part-session?"
"Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the presidency shall consult the European Parliament on key issues and fundamental decisions with regard to the common foreign and security policy, and ensure that account is duly taken of the views of the European Parliament."
"Rest assured that the French Presidency will scrupulously adhere to such provisions."
"This is particularly true as regards recent developments in common foreign and security policy as a result of the Feira European Council and with a view to the one in Nice."
"As you are all aware, the common foreign and security policy is one of the major European projects as well as one of the priorities of the French presidency, as the French President, Mr Jacques Chirac pointed out this morning in his address."
"As Mr Alain Richard, French Minister of Defence, has already pointed out, he has every intention of addressing the European Parliament on as yet unspecified dates."
"I should also like to point out that either Hubert Védrine or I will address the Committee on Foreign Affairs each month on Tuesday afternoon after the 'General Affairs' Council meeting."
"In this way we shall be able to keep the European Parliament informed of defence-related matters."
"Thank you, Minister, for your first response during your presidency."
"I am especially pleased that we are able to see Mr Richard here."
"It is extremely important that the growth of our European security and defence policy commands full public support and respect, and strong and credible parliamentary scrutiny is certainly the way forward."
"I simply wanted to highlight the willingness of the French Government and in particular the Minister of Defence, to debate such matters openly with the European Parliament."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, consensus was achieved at the Feira Summit a couple of weeks ago on the idea that flexibility should be on the IGC agenda."
"At the meeting, however, no further details were given as to how flexibility can apply also to the second pillar, that is to say, to a common foreign and security policy."
"I would like to ask when the country holding the presidency of the Council will present its own point of view regarding how the flexibility clause can be implemented with respect to the second pillar."
"If and when that happens, will those Member States not in NATO be automatically excluded from those decisions, taken on the basis of flexibility, which lead to some Member States proceeding more swiftly along the path to a common defence?"
"I refer in particular to the statement made last week by Alain Richard, Minister for Defence of the country holding the presidency, in which he expressed his concern in the event that non-aligned countries are fully involved from the start in second pillar development projects."
"As you will be aware Mrs Kauppi, the matter of relations between the Member States of the European Union that are not part of NATO took up a considerable amount of discussion time at the Feira European Council and it is well on the way to a successful conclusion."
"As regards the flexibility of the second pillar, perhaps you will allow the presidency to take the Intergovernmental Conference in hand, which it will do following the 'General Affairs Council' next Monday, 10 July."
"We shall then be able to determine the various views on this matter."
"I should like to remind you that the role of the presidency is to successfully oversee the running of the IGC and not state the positions adopted by the various Member States."
"I am very pleased to see the President-in-Office here, as a former Member of Parliament."
"Will he, in the Nice Treaty or in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Nice at the end of the year, propose codecision between Parliament and the Council on matters of common foreign and security policy?"
"This is to be the lower House, as the President of the Republic told us this morning and if we are to carry public opinion with us in security and defence matters we need a proper position."
"So does he agree that codecision is the way forward in this policy area?"
"Mr Newton Dunn, I stand by my previous response."
"That is what Question Time is for. The President-in-Office of the Council replies to the questions in the way he sees fit."
"Question No 2 by (H-0519/00):"
"Subject: Transport of water from France to Spain and the sustainable management of water resources France is understood to be intending to launch an aqueduct scheme for transporting water from the Rhône to Barcelona, with the participation of the Lyonnaise water company."
"The water is apparently intended to be used to develop irrigated intensive farming in Catalonia."
"This scheme goes against all principles of sustainable management of water resources at the regional level."
"Is the Council aware of this scheme?"
"Does the Council not take the view that such a course of action is contrary to the precautionary principle and the principle of preventive action in respect of the environment as laid down in Article 174 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as it removes responsibility from the consumers of water which has been transported from elsewhere?"
"What steps does the Council intend to take with a view to promoting a policy of sustainable management of water resources in the EU and in order that schemes for transporting water over long distances do not threaten the ecological balance in the regions concerned?"
"(FR) There is indeed a project, or rather studies, in progress with regard to the transportation of water from the Rhone to Catalonia, but - for the time being at least - it does not involve the French or Spanish authorities."
"What is more, the European Parliament and the Council have put forward a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for a community water policy."
"It was adopted recently through a conciliation procedure on 29 June 2000."
"It should be noted that this framework directive is primarily aimed at conserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, as well as promoting the careful and rational use of natural resources."
"It sets out the basic principles for a sustainable water policy in the European Union based on the principles enshrined in the Treaty, for example those relating to precautionary, preventative and corrective action by according priority to the source of the threats to the environment, as well as the polluter-pays principle."
"It must be noted that this project should also apply to both surface and ground water with the aim of preventing any further deterioration, promoting the sustainable use of water based on the long-term protection of available water resources and helping to mitigate the effects of floods and droughts."
"The project is designed to ensure that these water sources are maintained in good condition through a series of measures that Member States are to implement according to a specific timetable."
"On the other hand, it follows that all initiatives of this type must automatically be subject to both a socio-economic and environmental assessment."
"Thank you for your response, Minister."
"However, given that you were able to elaborate on the matter, you no doubt have extra information. When you referred to the studies that have been carried out, I became worried because the reason I am raising this matter is precisely due to the fact that French and Spanish citizens have alerted our attention to it and are asking for more information."
"Their concern arises because this has already been the subject of a debate in Parliament that was rejected, specifically in the framework of the directive on water."
"However, as you are aware, all directives contain exceptions, and this project for the transportation of water could very well come under this exception. I am therefore seeking your assurance that until impact studies have been carried out and the members of Parliament have been informed, this project will not be the covered by an exception."
"I set the project within a global and general framework and stressed that at this stage neither the French nor Spanish authorities are involved."
"It goes without saying that as soon as I have further information I shall inform Mrs Isler Béguin."
"With regard to her other comments, I should again like to reiterate my final remarks when I said that we must ensure that all initiatives of this type are subject to a socio-economic and environmental assessment as a matter of course."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there have been fears expressed repeatedly in connection with the reading of the framework directive on water, that it could be possible later on in the EU to transport water from one Member State to another against the wishes of the first country."
"Does the President-in-Office see such a threat as likely, and is there a need to protect Member States against it?"
"To be honest I have nothing further to add to my previous responses."
"Question No 3 by (H-0525/00):"
"Subject: Digital radio Does the Council agree that a political endorsement of digital radio, similar to that given to mobile telephone technology and digital television, could help to enhance confidence in the future of radio?"
". (FR) I can simply say in response to Mr Perry' s question that owing to the absence of an initiative from the Commission, which should not be long in coming, the Council has still to determine its position on this matter."
"Mr President, I am disappointed with that response."
"The European Parliament held a hearing just a few weeks ago with representatives from the Minister's country as well as from my own."
"The point was made very strongly there by representatives of the radio industry that digital radio is one sector of media communication that is not developing as quickly and as effectively as it might do, and the feeling was that political backing was lacking."
"I would like to think that the Council, were they to receive a proposal from the Commission, would behave emphatically in support of digital radio."
"A problem has also arisen that various elements of the digital radio spectrum are now being allocated across Europe often quite freely, at no charge at all."
"Yet that same spectrum would, of course, be very profitable if were used for telephone communications."
"I wonder if can we be assured that the Council of Ministers will look very carefully at this and be sure that it does not pose any threat to the development of digital radio in Europe."
"I should like to remind you that digital audiobroadcasting has existed since 1989 and the main problem that still remains to be solved relates to the fact that the receivers are still too large."
"One of the key issues that the Council - which is keeping an open approach to all of this - must look into in due course concerns the definition of particular principles that are designed to enhance the legibility and effectiveness of this area of electronic communications."
"The issue of convergence between telecommunications, the media and information technology was raised at the end of 1999 during a Council meeting and again on 2 May 2000 during a public debate."
"On this occasion the Council highlighted the following points, namely that the regulation should be based on clearly defined political objectives, stimulate economic growth and competitiveness and ensure general interest objectives."
"The regulation should also aim at technological neutrality, with the rules that govern communication services being as far as possible independent of the technology implemented to provide these services."
"On 2 May 2000, the Council stressed the importance of striking a balance between legal security, chiefly guaranteed by the binding provisions, and the ability to react speedily to technological and market developments, using flexible measures."
"In other words, I repeat, the Council continues to approach the issue openly."
"Question No 4 by (H-0531/00):"
"Subject: EU-China WTO Agreement Is the Council aware that China has ordered state-run television, newspapers, and billboard owners to stop running Sprite commercials featuring the young pop-star, Sherry Chang Huei-mei, who sang at the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bain?"
"Is the Council also aware that China has recently warned Hong Kong and PRC business organisations not to trade with Taiwanese firms whom the PRC deems to be pro-independence?"
"In view of the fact that we have recently signed an agreement with China on their admission to the WTO, how will the Council respond to the use of this type of political blackmail, which is contrary to the principles of free trade?"
". (FR) For a long time now the Council has been committed to improving the human rights situation in China, including civil and political rights, which have been adversely affected by the issues Mr Cushnahan mentioned in his question."
"The key element in this commitment is the dialogue that the European Union has established with China in relation to human rights."
"In spite of some progress achieved in improving the legal system with regard to economic and social rights, little progress has been achieved on the ground, particularly in the area of civil and political rights."
"As a result, the Council is deeply concerned about the persistent and widespread restrictions imposed on fundamental freedoms, for example in relation to the freedom of assembly, expression and association."
"It has been agreed that the European Union would continue to publicly express its concerns on the human rights situation in China and raise such matters in meetings with China at all levels."
"In addition, the Council has agreed that the European Union will adopt a firm stance with regard to the motion for a resolution on human rights in China, presented by the United States at the 56th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission."
"Should the motion for a resolution be put to the vote, the Council has agreed that the Member States that are part of this commission would vote in favour of it."
"Lastly, the motion for a resolution was not put to the vote following the adoption of a motion of non-intervention, on China' s initiative."
"The Council also agreed that the position it would adopt during the next meeting of the Human Rights Commission would be based on the outcome of dialogue with China on the issue of human rights."
"With regard to the process leading to China' s admission to the WTO, the Council is of the opinion that it is not the appropriate forum for tackling issues relating to human rights and, also believes that an increase in trade transactions would support European Union efforts with a view to guaranteeing respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, values which form the very foundation of Europe."
"Mr President, first of all let me congratulate Mr Moscovici on his country winning Euro 2000."
"It is very good to welcome a former colleague into a new elevated office but let me remind you Mr Moscovici, of the frustration which we experienced as parliamentarians trying to question the Council."
"I hope that the next time that you come back to this chamber you will not respond in the same curt fashion that you did to Mr Newton Dunn, if the presidency wants to work with Parliament."
"As to your answer, I disagree with its contents."
"I believe the response of the EU in Geneva was appalling."
"It was cowardice to the highest degree that we failed to support the US initiative."
"Had we taken the much stronger position, then we would not be experiencing the arrogance that we see from China."
"I hope, the next time this issue comes back to the UN, that Member States will put principle above trading interests."
"This is an issue where, in the WTO, China uses trade as a tool of political blackmail, and we should have used the EU/China WTO negotiations for leverage in the same way."
"I would like to seek an assurance from you, given what you did say, that in future Member States will take a strong stance in their discussions with China where the abuse of human rights are concerned and will not be blackmailed by any economic threats by China in this regard."
"I should like to thank you, Mr Cushnahan, for your personal words of encouragement and for your congratulations following France' s success at Euro 2000 last Sunday."
"With regard to your other points, I shall endeavour, during the course of these questions, to express the views of the Council."
"I should also like to remind you that the presidency has the mandate to do this on the basis of the positions adopted by the Council."
"Minister, I cannot congratulate you on this success, since I must remain completely neutral, as you will appreciate."
"Furthermore, I am from a country which suffered an unexpected defeat, like other Members present."
"Question No 5 by Ioannis Souladakis (H-0536/00):"
"Subject: Improvement in the export capacities of the countries of South-Eastern Europe"
"The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe is a political choice made by the European Union to which it has given a very high priority."
"Within the context of this policy for south-eastern Europe it is evident that the area' s socio-economic reconstruction will play an extremely important part."
"In view of this, what specific action does the Council intend to take, in the form of economic parameters for the implementation of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, in order to improve the export capacities of the countries in the region as regards the European Union market, and to strengthen their afflicted economies?"
"I am well aware, Mr President, that we made few friends during Euro 2000."
"The European Union supports the idea that the deepening of international trade should, in the long term, replace the dependence on foreign aid and that trade integration should constitute one of the main facets of greater integration in the longer term for the countries of south-eastern Europe in the Euro-Atlantic structures."
"The stabilisation and association process is a key feature of European Union policy and, as you will be aware, it is designed to help the countries in question rebuild their economies by restoring and improving their infrastructures as well as redirecting their old war economies and planned economies towards a more market based one."
"As a result of the decisions made at the Lisbon European Council, which provided that stabilisation and association agreements with the Balkan countries should be preceded by the non-symmetrical liberalisation of trade, the Commission is set to put forward a specific proposal extending the existing trade preferences through the abolition of tariff ceilings that exist for some industrial products and the improvement of the access of agricultural products to the markets."
"The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe is generally designed to help the countries of the region attain stability and economic prosperity."
"In order to achieve this, a South-East regional group was set up together with a working group on economic reconstruction that also encompasses trade relations."
"The importance of liberalising and facilitating trade between the countries of the region, and also between these countries and the European Union, was highlighted, by both donors and recipients, at the regional conference on Pact funding held in Brussels at the end of March this year."
"In all areas covered by the Stability Pact, and therefore also in the economic and trade areas, reciprocal commitments between donors and recipients remain the key to the Stability Pact' s success."
"The commitment expressed by the countries of the region to implement reforms and generate the right climate for sustainable economic progress lies at the very heart of the Pact."
"Thank you for your reply; however, I have the following comments to make: I was debating the Budget 2001 in Parliament before you and the problem again arose of where to find the money to finance the Stability Pact."
"In this sense, my question meant exactly that, given that we are dealing with economies which, because of the economic system in place, used to function along different trading, or rather bartering lines. The question which I am basically asking is what can be done to ensure that products from these regions reach the markets of the Member States of the European Union?"
"That is the question."
"In other words, what policies will strengthen production in these regions without the European Union's having to pay out money which, due in part to internal problems, it is having trouble finding anyway."
"That is the nub of the problem."
"My question is: exactly what steps can the European Union take in order to create these networks, which did not previously exist, so that these people can sell their products?"
"It is precisely, Mr Souladakis, the aim of the Stability Pact and the Association Agreements, which, as I have reminded you, include provisions in both economic and trade areas. It is in fact our duty, once again, to agree to non-symmetrical liberalisation to offset the backwardness of these countries."
"However, I can assure you that both the Council Presidency as well as the European Council Presidency consider the future of this region a priority, which is why the French President has proposed a summit of the western Balkans during our presidency, perhaps in Zagreb."
"Question No 6 by (H-0539/00):"
"Subject: Lifting of sanctions against Iraq UN resolution 687, of 1991, indicates that sanctions against Iraq will be lifted if it agrees to renounce the weapons of mass destruction which it is alleged to possess."
"Since that time, despite thorough searches by thousands of observers, no such weapons have been found, nor has any capability to manufacture them been discovered, and official reports are wholly reassuring."
"However, the embargo against Iraq is still being applied, with dramatically harmful consequences for the Iraqi population. One very typical example is the huge increase in infant mortality, which over the last ten years has been recorded at 1.5 million child deaths due to lack of medicine, food etc."
"The 'oil for food' programme cannot constitute an alibi for the crime which is still being committed, since only a small part of the value of what Iraq is allowed to export returns as food and medicines, while the rest is retained for 'compensation' or remains frozen in Western banks, with Iraq unable to use it."
"Is the Council looking into lifting the embargo, whose only victims are the people of Iraq, and in particular its small children?"
"The European Union fully implements all United Nations Security Council resolutions, including those concerning Iraq."
"Resolution 1284, adopted on 17 December 1999, is aimed at recommencing UN inspections and, at the same time, improve the so-called ""oil for food"" programme"" , and finally lifting the sanctions against Iraq."
"The European Union urges the Iraqi Government to cooperate fully with the UN and its supporting bodies."
"The Council notes that since 1998 no checks have been carried out to see whether Iraq is in fact complying with the wholly relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular Resolution 687."
"As a result, the embargo imposed on Iraq remains in force."
"We are well aware, it is true, of the serious and even worrying humanitarian situation that has arisen as a result of the embargo, particularly for the Iraqi children."
"The Iraqi Government is chiefly responsible for this."
"However, as the panel of experts presided by Ambassador Amorim noted in April 1999, the Iraqi population would not have suffered such privations had the measures taken in 1991 by the Security Council not had to have been extended."
"The international community and the Iraqi Government should do their utmost to ensure that the ""oil for food"" programme works to the full advantage of the Iraqi people."
"This is why the Council welcomes the creation of a United Nations working party that is responsible for making general recommendations on the way in which UN sanctions can be made more effective, for example by better targeting them, and on the ways in which needless human suffering can be avoided."
"The Council noted that the United Nations Security Council, in its Resolution 1302, invited the UN Secretary General to appoint independent experts to draw up an in-depth study on the humanitarian situation in Iraq."
"I asked the question because there is a certain sensitivity in France to this issue."
"I have listened to the President-in-office's formal reply; however, we all know full well that the situation in Iraq is connected with the arbitrary policy imposed by the United States."
"Take, for example, the air embargo, which has not been ratified by a single UN Security Council."
"We also all know full well that, when Mr Ekeus, the United Nations representative, reported to the United Nations in 1997 after 6900 visits and inspections, he said that there was no reason to suspect that Iraq was harbouring nuclear or chemical weapons."
"I should like to ask the French Presidency if, taking account of all this and taking account of the fact that a large slice of Iraq's oil revenues is blocked in a bank, and a French bank at that, in New York, it plans to take any initiatives during the French presidency in order to put an end to this dictatorial regime imposed by the United States at a massive cost to the people and children of Iraq."
"You are right to highlight the fact that perhaps France is particularly sensitive to this issue. However, whether or not this is true, it is not renowned for its indifference to the sufferings of the Iraqi people."
"You will undoubtedly be aware that my country is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and, I repeat, hopes that all of these resolutions will be observed while at the same time seeking to examine all possible solutions, starting with the rigorous application of the ""oil for food"" resolution"" ."
"This is the difficult path we must now take."
"Mr President, I welcomed the Minister's reply but I would like him to give an assurance to this House that he and the Council will not lose sight in their consideration of this problem of the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and that they will keep pressing the Iraqi authorities for an explanation of the fate of these people."
"I should simply like to confirm our intention to examine the matter fully."
"Mr President, I have submitted a similar question, Question No 20. Unfortunately, however, the Council services informed me today that they had not had time to translate my question because it had only been submitted within three days of the deadline."
"I consider that unacceptable, it is not my responsibility."
"I should like to add to the debate by pointing out, as I stated in my question, that last month alone, i.e. in May, 8000 people died due to a lack of drugs."
"We have doubled infant mortality due to the lack of drugs."
"According to the statistics, the number of people who have lost their life in Iraq since 1990, as a result of the sanctions, now totals 1 309 153."
"Genocide is being practised against the Iraqi people on the pretext of sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein, who is still in power, on the grounds that he has nuclear weapons, which have not been found."
"My question to the Council is this: does it accept that this genocide, which has been going on for a decade, cannot continue, will it ask for the embargo against the Iraqi people to be lifted and does it intend to take measures, even unilateral measures, to protect the people of Iraq?"
"Firstly, I think that - although I am new to this role - there are in fact rules governing this particular exercise which require Parliament to translate the questions raised to enable the Council to answer them as precisely as possible."
"Secondly, I should simply like to state that no one is sanctioning Mr Saddam Hussein' s regime through these resolutions and I think that the term 'genocide' - used here, if I am not mistaken, in relation to those that have imposed sanctions -cannot be justified."
"This is neither France' s nor the Council' s position."
"This is not the time to hold a debate on relations between the Council and Parliament with regard to questions, since that would take up time allotted to Question Time."
"However, I must say that there are 6 questions which unfortunately, although they arrived correctly in some languages, and owing to a bank holiday in Luxembourg, I believe, did not reach the Council in all languages."
"The Council has decided not to answer them."
"In any event, this debate can be held in the Conference of Presidents, which deals with these relations and any incidents which may occur."
"Question No 7 by Esko Olavi Seppänen (H-0542/00):"
"Subject: Non-allied status of certain EU Member States"
"At the Feira European Council discussions are being held on the EU' s defence dimension, and the matter is also up for discussion at the IGC."
"Some EU Member States do not belong to the NATO military alliance."
"What is the Council' s view of the position of these Member States in any future EU defence cooperation and will those Member States which belong to the alliance respect - as the Portuguese Presidency has proposed - the other Member States' desire to remain outside any alliance?"
"There is no problem between Parliament and the Commission."
"The fact is, we received an explanation of the correct procedure, and it is in fact standard practice that we have the questions translated so as to be able to answer them properly and not have to improvise, since this would impair the quality of the answers."
"To come back to the question raised, Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union lays down that Union policy under this article does not impact on the specific nature of the security and defence policy of some Member States, including non-allied Member States."
"Similarly, the policy observes the obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty with regard to those Member States who consider that their common defence is provided within the framework of NATO, and it is compatible with the common security and defence policy established within this framework."
"After Amsterdam, the European Union undertook a process aimed at enabling it to take all of the measures needed to play a role in the areas of conflict prevention and crisis management, measures that are defined in the Treaty on European Union and known as the Petersburg tasks, without prejudice to the position of the Member States as regards their membership or non-membership of NATO or the WEU."
"This was reiterated in the presidency' s report that was approved by the Helsinki European Council."
"Mr President, at the meeting at Feira it was decided to increase flexibility."
"My interpretation of this is that flexibility will also be introduced in second pillar matters, in a foreign and security policy."
"Is yours the same interpretation?"
"At the same time I have been following the French President' s ideas on how the countries of the European Union should develop at their own pace and on how there should possibly be a hard and solid core of pioneer states."
"Do you consider that such a hard core - as the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, calls it - could include a country that is militarily non-aligned?"
"The question posed in this way is extremely complex and since it relates to the IGC overall, I suggest that I give you a more detailed response at a future meeting."
"I simply wanted to stress that at Feira we expressed a desire to see the framework encompass non-allied countries and those countries that are not members of NATO and, if it is indeed this type of flexibility to which you refer, it will undoubtedly be implemented."
"We shall, besides, have further opportunities to discuss the development of European defence and the intensified cooperation in this field."
"Question No 8 by (H-0545/00):"
"Subject: Priorities of the French Presidency as regards the advancement of women What specific measures will the French Presidency be putting forward as its priorities for the advancement of women in Europe?"
"Mrs Nicole Péry, my colleague and Secretary of State for Women' s Rights, will outline next week the French presidency' s programme in this area to your committee responsible. My intention here is to simply give a few brief details."
"The Council, under the French Presidency intends to deal with several matters relating to sexual equality."
"Firstly, the Commission has just sent the Council a communication entitled 'Towards a Community framework strategy for sexual equality' , also a proposal for a Council decision on a support programme for the community strategy on sexual equality, a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and Council modifying Directive 67/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards - and this is crucial - access to jobs, training and vocational training and working conditions."
"The French presidency, I stress, has already timetabled the presentation of these Commission texts."
"As regards the proposal for a decision relating to a programme on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty and the fact that the programme is due to start on 1 January 2001, the aim of the presidency is to adopt it during the 'employment and social welfare' council on 28 November."
"With regard to the proposal for a directive, the French Presidency shall endeavour to make as much progress as possible."
"Apart from these legislative texts, the Council, as in previous years, shall also to consider the implementation of the Beijing action plan by the Member States."
"What is more, the French Presidency will organise two events in relation to this: a ministerial conference on 27 October in Paris that will focus on three issues - women and decision-making, reconciling family life and professional life and mainstreaming - as well as a symposium on equality in the workplace on 24 November in Paris that will centre on discrimination in recruitment and the difficulties of returning to work."
"You therefore have my assurance that the French Presidency will grant the issue of sexual equality particular attention."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, for his very promising reply which, furthermore, puts into practice something which Mr Chirac, President of the French Republic, said this morning, when he stated that the French Presidency had ambitious and specific aims."
"You have demonstrated this in your reply."
"Mr Chirac also told us that one of the most interesting aspects to be dealt with by the French Presidency would be the reconciliation of family life and working life."
"In this regard I would like to ask how we will avoid this necessary concept being misused to relegate women further and also what role men will play in the reconciliation of family life and working life."
"It is not something I claim to want, especially as the male gender is completely varied, and we are not all the same."
"No, I think that it would be best to discuss the matter further with Mrs Péry, and simply say that, from a more philosophical point of view, the idea of reconciling family and professional life is certainly not to disadvantage women or return to a more traditional model, but on the contrary to move towards our common aim of achieving true sexual equality."
"We need measures to achieve this and, I do not doubt that the contribution of men to family life forms part of this."
"Question No 9 by (H-0552/00):"
"Subject: Council's views on the Pelinka case in Austria On 1 May 1999, Professor Anton Pelinka commented on the Italian television channel RAI on previous statements made by the Freedom Party's Jörg Haider in connection with national socialism."
"On 11 May 2000, a court in Vienna (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) found Professor Pelinka guilty of slandering Jörg Haider during the broadcast and ordered him to pay a fine of ATS 60 000."
"Mr Haider was represented by his lawyer, Dieter Böhmdorfer, who is now Austria's Justice Minister."
"Are Professor Pelinka's remarks not completely within the bounds of acceptability in a democracy?"
"The question is whether the Austrian court is guilty of serious encroachment on freedom of expression in general and academic freedom in particular, given that Austria is a member of the Council of Europe and of the EU, the founding Treaty of which lays down, in Article 6(2), that the Union shall, as general principles, respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"What view does the Council take of a Member State's Justice Minister having actively pursued a prosecution which blatantly ignores the above Convention and Treaty?"
"My response to that will be extremely brief."
"Of course the Council has been informed of this specific, undoubtedly difficult situation."
"However, and you will understand this, it is not within the Council' s remit to comment on legal decisions."
"Neither is it able to pass judgement on the way a legal institution is run in one of the Member States."
"Mr President, I would thank the French presidency for its succinct answer."
"I nonetheless have two follow-up questions, because this is a very serious case of a very dubious character from a democratic point of view."
"Fourteen Member States are planning to ask experts from the Council of Europe to investigate certain states of affairs in Austria."
"My first question concerns whether the French presidency considers that this request for an investigation should also apply to the Pelinka case, which would be only reasonable."
"My second question concerns Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, concerning fundamental rights."
"I wonder whether the French presidency believes there is cause for examining this case on the basis of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty."
"(FR) In response to this point, I should simply like to remind those present that a few days ago the Portuguese Presidency, that acted in a very balanced fashion, took measures not on the Council' s behalf but on behalf of the 14, measures that we endorse and that we shall apply both in our assessment of the Austrian situation and to the continued imposition of sanctions."
"We shall stick to these measures without adding further ones and of course without taking anything away from them, until we have proof that a significant assessment has been carried out on both the situation and political leanings of the FPÖ, the Austrian Freedom Party."
"Mr President, Austria has very strict laws prohibiting fascism, national socialism and the resurgence thereof, and there has been a succession of convictions over the past few years."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council know of any similar, or better, legislation in other States?"
"Will the Council continue to ignore the fact that the sanctions against Austria decided on by the 14 Heads of Government are in violation of the European Treaties? Will it persist in its refusal to take a stance on the matter, thereby remaining in breach of the Treaties?"
"Are bilateral decisions not to be dealt with by the Council in future?"
"I believe I have already answered the questions relating to the maintenance of sanctions and the assessment of the situation."
"As regards the other points, I am not in a position to comment in detail on the judicial or legal situation in Austria, but I know that there are other countries which appear to have a far more enviable political situation."
"And here I am not talking as President-in-Office of the Council but as a government minister."
"The second supplementary question will be put by Mr Ford, and I must remind you that he is the author of the next question, Question No 10, which is not going to be answered as Question No 10, since it is one of the six questions that did not reach the Council in all languages."
"Mr President, I should like to express my concern that nobody in the French presidency can read any of the European languages apart from French."
"Also on this point, will the presidency confirm that under the Treaty it is the Fourteen - minus the country concerned - which would make a recommendation to suspend Austria from membership, should that be necessary?"
"I am not arguing that it is necessary, but should it be necessary, could we not expect a view from the presidency over whether this particular case actually causes it some concern?"
"Is it not right and proper that the same person should not be judge, jury and executioner and that the person making the accusation should not also be the minister of justice at the same time?"
"Would one not criticise this kind of situation in, let us say, Zimbabwe or some other part of the world, if it arose there?"
"(inaudible) on the French Presidency' s ability to understand languages other than French."
"We are not all uneducated and illiterate."
"There are so-called rules of transmission between Parliament and the Council, which have prevented these questions from arriving today."
"I sincerely hope that, with or without translation, things will be sorted out for future part-sessions."
"These are short-term teething troubles."
"With regard to the other points you raised, as you have understood, the French presidency intends to observe the measures that have already been decided on by the Fourteen."
"And when I say 'Fourteen' I mean that it is not exactly a Council matter, rather a matter between the 14 Member States themselves."
"What is more, I repeat, these measures are of a strictly bilateral nature and do not impact on the fact that Austria is a member of the European Union, with access to all of its institutions and participating in all of its bodies and, throughout our Presidency, will be treated as such. In other words, it will genuinely be treated as a major player within the European Union."
"Mr President, I asked the President-in-Office to answer my question whether Article 7 of the Treaties actually asks the Fourteen to take action in respect of a country whose human rights record is called into question."
"He seems to imply that this is a matter for the Presidency-in-Office and not for fourteen sets of bilateral relations."
". (FR) I think there is some ambiguity surrounding this issue."
"No one is saying that Austria has been expelled from the European Union, something I stressed earlier."
"At the same time, these measures were adopted by 14 Member States on a political basis, and we are, of course, continuing to act on a political basis while once again fully respecting Austria' s rights as a member of the European Union."
"This is one of the questions which will not be answered by the Council, since it did not reach the Council on time in all languages."
"Parliament will consider this issue, but today we are not going to discuss it further, if the Members agree."
"Question No 11 by Maj Britt Theorin (H-0554/00):"
"Subject: International Criminal Court"
"The Commission, and particularly the Commissioner for humanitarian aid, played an important role in the setting-up of the new, permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) in June 1998."
"The adoption of the Rome Statute - on which the ICC is founded - was an important step in breaking the tendency towards the systematic use of rape as a strategy of war."
"The Statute is the first international accord to stipulate that rape, sexual slavery and forced pregnancy may be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"However, to become a reality, the Rome Statute must be ratified by 60 States."
"Although all the EU Member States have signed the Statute, only Italy, unfortunately, has ratified it."
"What initiatives does the Council intend to take to ensure that the other Member States also ratify the Statute?"
". (FR) In order to obtain a precise answer to this question, Mrs Theorin should refer to oral question H-0217/00 raised by Mr Cushnahan during the part-session in March, in which the Council stated that, since these Statutes were adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998, it strongly urged Member States to ratify them as they lay the foundations for the International Criminal Court."
"Let us not forget that such ratification, as a legal principle, is, nonetheless, something that relates to the exclusive competence of the sovereign Member States."
"Mr President, it is good news that France and Belgium have just recently ratified the treaty concerning the International Criminal Court, but I am nonetheless concerned about developments."
"It is now two years since the Treaty arising out of the Rome Conference was signed, and only a fifth of the States required have ratified the creation of a permanent International Criminal Court."
"At this rate, it is doubtful whether we shall meet our December deadline."
"I certainly think the EU ought to be leading the way in creating an international legal system and, when the national legal systems do not function, the international community must be ready to take action against the worst offenders."
"That applies especially to attacks on women and girls and to the deficiencies we know existed in devising and implementing the war crimes tribunals in connection with Rwanda and Yugoslavia in the 1990s."
"These clearly show that present systems are inadequate for combating crimes such as forced pregnancy, sexual slavery and systematic rape."
"If the ICC is to become a reality and to operate effectively, broad international support is required."
"I must nonetheless ask the Council if it is planning to take special initiatives to encourage ratification, also by non-EU States."
"Russia and the United States are important in this connection."
"Once again, the Council is of the opinion that the successful conclusion of the conference on the creation of an International Criminal Court would be a significant historical achievement in terms of making the world a safer and more just place."
"How can we even consider adopting a harder line at the same time, given that we cannot encroach on the sovereignty of States as regards the ratification of Treaties?"
"I should also like to point out that France, for example, has also ratified this Treaty, which it strongly supports and a few months ago I accompanied the French President on a visit to The Hague during which we paid a visit to the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia."
"This demonstrates to what extent we are committed to this matter, however our only weapon is our ability to urge them to cooperate."
"Question No 12 by (H-0556/00):"
"Subject: Role of the diamond trade in African wars It is a known fact that the violence in both Sierra Leone and the Great Lakes region is linked to the monopolies on local mineral deposits and the struggles to gain control of those monopolies."
"Some Member States, for example the United Kingdom, are already planning to impose an embargo on Sierra Leonean diamonds because there is ample evidence that the trade in precious stones has been and is still being used to finance the RUF guerrillas."
"Is the Council considering the possibility of influencing the trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone and the Great Lakes region in a way that might prove conducive to peace in those areas?"
"If so, could it say what steps it is taking or will take in the immediate future to achieve that end?"
"The Council has voiced its concerns on several occasions in relation to the illegal diamond trade that is fuelling conflicts in several countries in Africa, for example in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone."
"On 13 June, the Council warned the government of Liberia that it was not acting responsibly with regard to the situation in Sierra Leone, particularly in relation to the illegal trade in diamonds. The European Union will take this into account in its policy, especially within the framework of the Lomé Convention."
"Let me specify, however, that the Council has not yet discussed the initiatives put by the United Kingdom to the United Nations Security Council, nor has it established contact with the largest diamond importers with a view to preventing the illegal trade in diamonds."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I truly regret your reply."
"I believe that the problem relating to the trafficking in diamonds, which has cost, and is costing, many lives, deserves much more decisive and firm attention from the Council."
"I clearly cannot blame you for this, since you have just taken over the Presidency, but I would ask you to adopt much more energetic and forceful decisions."
"The European Union is committed to promoting peace and stability, not only in Europe, but throughout the world."
"If diamonds are not controlled it is clear that peace and stability in Africa cannot be promoted."
"In the case of Sierra Leone, Great Britain had supported the embargo, and France as well, to a certain extent."
"The Council could promote a generalised embargo of all diamonds originating in Africa and, above all, the control of certificates."
"We know these measures would be difficult to implement but, in any event, any advance in this respect would save human lives and contribute to the pacification of truly dramatic conflicts in Africa."
"Yes, I was simply outlining the stage the Council' s work has reached, which does not mean to say that we are not giving the matter our fullest attention and will not keep you regularly informed."
"I was merely giving you a progress report."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Question No 13 is one of six questions which the Council will not reply to today because of procedural problems."
"As the author is not present, Question No 14 lapses."
"Question No 15 by Mr Medina Ortega will not be replied to because its subject appears in the agenda of the present part-session."
"Question No 16 by (H-0565/00):"
"Subject: Violations of Cypriot airspace by Turkish fighter-planes Cyprus, a country which is due to join the EU within the next few years, is continuously subjected to Turkish aggression."
"Apart from the fact that the Turkish army has occupied 37% of Cypriot territory for 26 consecutive years, Turkey - a candidate for EU membership - disputes the island's status as an independent state on an almost daily basis."
"The latest incidents have been the subject of complaints to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on mass violations of Cypriot airspace and the Nicosia F.I.R. by a total of 78 Turkish fighter-planes on 27 and 30 April, and on 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 26 May 2000."
"The complaints were lodged through the most official channel by means of a letter from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations, Ambassador Zackheos, to Mr Annan on 5 June."
"What is the Council's official position on violations of the national sovereignty of an independent Member State of the UN and a candidate for EU membership, and to what extent are the tactics pursued by Turkey consistent with conduct befitting a modern European State?"
"Mr Marinos has drawn the Council' s attention to the violations of Cypriot airspace by Turkish fighter planes."
"The Council values the principle of sovereignty highly, and in this case can only reiterate its commitment to Resolution 353 of 20 July 1974 of the United Nations Security Council as well as Resolution 3212 of the United Nations General Assembly of 1 November 1974 which requested all States to respect the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus."
"The Council of course expects all applicant countries to observe European values and establish good neighbourly relations with their neighbours."
"With regard to Cyprus, the process for resolving the Cypriot problem was launched under the auspices of the United Nations."
"The Council, which supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General, expects Turkey, and other countries, to contribute to the success of these negotiations in order to achieve a just and lasting resolution to the Cypriot question."
"I thank the Minister although, unfortunately, I do not consider his answer satisfactory."
"The Council refers constantly to the Cyprus problem, but what we are talking about here is the occupation of 40% of the territory of an independent Member State of the UN and candidate for accession to the European Union, which is being left to the mercy of a powerful occupying force."
"Encouraged by tolerance and compliance on the part of Europe and the United States, Turkey engaged the other day in a new act of aggressive provocation which could well have been the cause of war between two equally powerful countries."
"The Turkish occupying forces occupied another 200 metres of Cypriot soil and set up a roadblock next to the last British base, cutting off 10 Greek Cypriots who are now hostages."
"My question to the Council is this: does it intend to tolerate and again fail to react decisively to this aggression on Turkey's part?"
"Does it still not realise that Turkey has nothing but contempt for international law and is exposing the credibility of the UN, provoking the European Union and putting the Greek Government in a difficult position?"
"I would remind you that Greece lifted its veto against Turkish candidacy on the basis of promises by the other 14 Member States that Turkey would change its tune."
"Perhaps Turkey feels that its compliance is something akin to the Munich Agreement and that is why it is advancing?"
"I had understood the question perfectly."
"I simply wished to reiterate my previous answer while stressing that we could not claim that Turkey was being provoked in any way to adopt an aggressive position."
"Minister, I understand your unwillingness to give a clear, spontaneous reaction to Turkey's intolerable conduct in Cyprus."
"Your predecessors were equally unwilling to condemn Turkey's conduct in Cyprus outright and, I fear, your successors will take the same approach, now that the American-, but not just the American-inspired formula of two sets of rules for and two attitudes towards Turkey has been adopted, together with the convenient method of taking refuge in pretexts such as the supposedly clear prospect of settling the Cyprus question, which has lasted 26 years now, and the supposedly concomitant need to appease the puppet of Ankara, Mr Denktash."
"Nonetheless, allow me to risk another question, in the hope this time of receiving a satisfactory answer."
"Is the French Presidency ready and willing to stop acting like Pontius Pilate and to make it unconditionally clear to Turkey, on behalf of the European Union, that, first: Cyprus will become a full member of the European Union, irrespective of whether or not the Cyprus problem is solved first, given that no such solution will be possible due to Turkey's intransigence and, secondly: that Turkey will forever remain a candidate and only a candidate country if it continues to violate the fundamental principles of international law and the European ideal?"
"Question No 17 by (H-0569/00):"
"Subject: Milosevic Over the last few days, a number of media have carried reports that one Member State of the European Union is currently acting as a mediator in an effort to find a 'way out' from the serious situation in Serbia."
"Those media allege that, together with other members of the international community, that Member State is working on a scenario whereby Mr Milosevic and his family would be granted exile and protection, i.e. immunity from prosecution by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in exchange for his giving up power."
"Does not the Council feel that such a scenario, if it ever became reality, would constitute a complete U­turn in the policy pursued hitherto by the European Union against persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia?"
"Does it not also feel that a U-turn of this nature would have serious consequences for the credibility of the future International Criminal Court?"
"The indiscreet remarks to which Mr Dupuis refers, that were published by some sections of the international press and concerned confidential negotiations between some governments with the aim of guaranteeing President Milosevic and his family exile and protection, have been officially denied by all of the governments concerned."
"The European Union' s policy that aims to guarantee full and unconditional support to the International Criminal Court for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, and all initiatives undertaken to apprehend all persons accused of these crimes and subject them to international justice, remains - I assure you -absolutely and wholly unchanged."
") Minister, I am completely satisfied with your answer and I note your voice is failing you somewhat owing to the length of this session."
"I should like to thank you for your positive start and hope that the rest of the presidency continues well."
"I wish you every success."
"We also thank the Minister for being present, and we naturally hope that his cold will clear up."
"I am also suffering."
"These summer colds need a lot of attention."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed. Questions Nos 18, 21 and 24 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)."
"Draft supplementary and amending budgets (SAB) for 2000"
"Mr President, draft supplementary and amending budget no. 2/2000 contains appropriations for the Council and for Parliament."
"The Council' s budget is EUR 6.635 million."
"This is going towards the needs of a common foreign and security and defence policy."
"EUR 5.877 million are estimated to be required for renting, renovating and furnishing a new building."
"This building will be for the needs of the staff required to implement the policy."
"EU military staff will be posted there, for example, including military experts who have been transferred from Member States."
"They may be around 45 at first, but that number may later grow to 60 or even 90."
"Their pay will amount to EUR 758 000 by the end of the year."
"Under the old gentleman' s agreement, neither institution - neither the Council nor Parliament - has become involved in the other' s draft budget."
"The draft supplementary and amending budget for the European Parliament contains an appropriation of EUR 15 million for an additional prepayment for office space in Brussels."
"This will reduce annual interest by EUR 2.2 million over a ten-year period."
"This will leave a margin in the financial perspectives of EUR 69.1 million."
"The Committee on Budgets transferred EUR 38 million of unused funds this year by means of a C6/2000 to fund this office space, the Spinelli building."
"As the President has also been able to transfer funds for this purpose, altogether at this stage we can use around EUR 58 million for accelerated payments, which will lessen annual payments over the ten-year period by around EUR 8 to 9 million for Parliament, which is a great relief."
"It is only reasonable that the European Parliament should pay for its office space ahead of time."
"In that way interest payments are saved and, at the same time, we have a little room for manoeuvre in the budget for the years to come."
"We shall need this, as, with eastward enlargement, Parliament' s other expenses will increase."
"Parliament' s share of Category 5 expenses, or administrative expenses, in supplementary and amending budget no. 2/2000 will now rise to 20.41%, which is just over the 20% ceiling that Parliament itself set."
"Originally, when the budget was being drafted, the share of administrative expenses was to remain below 20%."
"As it is very likely that a considerable portion of the appropriations set aside for members' regulations, for example, (which amount to EUR 60 million), will remain unspent, and as more than half the year has now gone by, this ceiling may be reviewed at the end of the year."
"On the other hand we must realise that Parliament is saving money, as the investment it is making is a most prudent one."
"The Council' s budget is interesting, as there are appropriations in it for the first time for a common security and defence policy."
"Structures are being created for the Council for the defence dimension to be tied more tightly to the work of the EU, in accordance with the conclusions of the Helsinki Summit."
"This will be an extremely difficult issue for the small, non-aligned countries, such as Finland, for example."
"The scars left behind in Kosovo, after the crisis management operation, are frightening."
"How justified is humanitarian military action, and what are its limits?"
"A big problem will be future budget technology."
"Article 28 of the Treaty is unclear, particularly regarding a common security, defence and military policy."
"Administrative expenditure is part of the EU budget, but the Council has discretionary powers with regard to operational expenses."
"What then is to be the practice in future, and how much of this expenditure will we try to place under Category 4. External Action - which is already now overburdened?"
"In future talks, the classification of expenditure must be made clearer and executed more effectively, to comply with Parliament' s wishes."
"Before I give Mr Bourlanges the floor for five minutes, I should like to point out that we have an extremely long agenda today and I should therefore like to ask you to keep to the speaking time where possible, otherwise we shall be here until midnight."
"And no-one wants that."
"Mr President, I shall endeavour to act on your good advice."
"The supplementary and amending budget presented here should not pose any major problems for the simple reason that, if adopted - and it is good to see that Parliament has an opportunity to introduce several elements and budgetary choices that suit it and are to its liking, generally speaking, it is a draft that the Council will consider positive as well."
"In fact, as far as this draft budget is concerned, the Council is the outright winner and legitimately so; not by scoring a victory against us, rather it is a winner all round."
"This is because this budget is essentially designed to enable the Council to recover the surplus balances from last year, which amount to EUR 3.2 billion."
"It includes a lower contribution in terms of the British rebate and a greater yield in own resources, for example customs duties, all of which is deducted from the costs it has to bear."
"The draft presented here can therefore be considered positively by both the Council and Parliament."
"This is firstly because during the trialogue, we all agreed that the budget presented should not be limited to merely returning the balances to the Member States, but should also include expenditure and constitute a genuine supplementary and amending budget."
"For Parliament this represents a limited victory but a significant one nonetheless."
"In the second place, we have made several decisions that can be viewed in a positive light."
"First, we have introduced a special contribution for orphan drugs of up to EUR 1 million."
"Thanks to the legal basis that now exists we are able to fund these orphan drugs."
"This is considered a priority by the committee responsible, the Committee on Budgets and Parliament itself."
"Second - and this is the second major contribution to the issue - we have introduced extra resources, which total some EUR 11 million. Five million are to go to the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and six million to the United Nations interim mission in Kosovo to fund the interim civil administrations."
"Once again, the legal bases exist to make these possible."
"We have the resources, the needs are there, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are top priorities and we have chosen to finance them, but the question is how."
"This is to be achieved using commitment appropriations from the ECIP appropriations that no longer serve a purpose and, though they exist as appropriations, the absence of legal basis means that they cannot be used."
"It is therefore expenditure that has been secured by a sacrifice that barely costs us anything."
"The third significant element relates to the financing of the special aid for Montenegro."
"You will be aware that we were all against this aid being financed with resources from other foreign programmes, in particular the MEDA programme."
"We therefore decided to fund it using the margin which totals 21 million in this heading."
"We need 20 million."
"Budgetary history works in our favour in this case and by using almost this entire margin, this initiative can be financed without any reduction or transfer from other appropriations, which is highly satisfactory."
"Now - and I shall end on this point - the main question that remains to be answered is whether or not the Council will support us from a procedural point of view."
"We have had a first reading in the Council, this is our first reading, and we should very much like to conclude matters on the basis of this first reading."
"In other words, we hope that the Council' s second reading that takes place on 20 July will take up our first reading, if not we shall have to proceed to a second reading."
"I do not believe that it would be in the Council' s interest - and it is a pity that they are not present this evening - to do this."
"What is more, I should like to stress another important point in that if we proceed to a second reading, in order to adhere to the strict timetables set, we should have to attend a session in August in order to vote on this SAB at second reading, which is obviously out of the question."
"It has always been the rule in Parliament and the other institutions that August is excluded from the timetables set."
"I am sure that the Council will adhere to that rule as it is in their interests, our interests and both of our interests to agree on both the procedure to adopt as well as the substance of the budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, fellow members, it may only be July, but today, the European Union and the European Parliament come to the Member States bearing gifts in the form of a supplementary budget refunding EUR 3.2 billion to their original owners."
"In short, we are not handing out gifts; we are returning the money to its original owners, i.e. the Member States and, at the end of the day, the taxpayers."
"This shows that we are handling funds properly and the rapporteur, my friend Jean-Louis Bourlanges, has just set the facts of the matter out clearly for us."
"I should like to extend my warmest thanks to both him and Mr Virrankoski for the supplementary budget, which applies mainly to Parliament and the Council."
"We are spending funds economically, that is our main job."
"We are handling funds properly, and that too is our main job."
"This was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning."
"Allow me to make one comment to the Council."
"I hope now the building is finally ready that Mr Solana will at last be able to move in with his work and his top secret documents."
"We really do have more important things to worry about than how to hide papers from unwanted visitors."
"That was why I voted passionately in favour of this transfer of funds, so that these technical problems can be solved once and for all and nothing more can stand in the way of a successful European security and defence policy."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, we have used our supplementary budget to reduce interest payments still further."
"This gives us room for manoeuvre within the margin which we set for ourselves in category 5 and ensures that we can use the money reasonably and sustainably for parliamentary work and not for interest payments as part of our building policy, which is why the PPE will, of course, be voting in favour of both the Bourlanges and Virrankoski reports."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing much to add in principle to what has already been said."
"We too shall, of course, be voting in favour of the two reports."
"What I have to say refers to supplementary and amending budget 1 which, as Mr Ferber has just said, brings Christmas in July for the Council."
"The Council has the enviable task of being able to claw back and budget EUR 3.2 billion."
"If only we could attract the same intensive and intense attention and discussion when we discuss the fact that we are looking for 200 million in order to balance the budget next year and finance a task which has a huge effect on Europe, i.e. Kosovo or the Balkans as a whole."
"The figure under discussion at present is 3.2 billion, i.e. sixteen times that amount, and it will rightly be refunded, on that I have no doubt."
"The figure of 200 million will then probably be discussed elsewhere."
"We had this problem last year and we shall no doubt face a similar problem again this year."
"In terms of order of size, it may perhaps be a little more, but the principle is the same and it is a problem we have to solve."
"My request to the Council is: bear this in mind, including for the forthcoming negotiations."
"It would be wonderful of course if we did not have to give back all the money which we are now refunding, if there were an agreement between the Council and Parliament whereby we could retain some of the money for contingencies."
"That would, of course, enable us to change the whole modus operandi between us in the future."
"I admit it is a highly unusual proposal, but we should consider the possibility of a reserve for contingencies."
"I think that would help to defuse individual budget debates."
"I should like to address another two parts of the supplementary budget."
"The first is that, thanks to the excellent proposal by our rapporteur Mr Bourlanges, we have indeed managed to provide 20 million for Montenegro, where we have agreed to urgent procedure."
"However, we must find this 20 million by squeezing the margin dry."
"We cannot use the 3.2 billion; instead we must squeeze the margin dry."
"We do not need to be told, as the English say, to put our money where our mouth is, i.e. where it is needed; on the contrary, we are giving the money back and then looking around for spare change in order to perform our duties."
"I should like to ask the Council to be a little more circumspect in its announcements and promises in the future unless, at the same time, it intends to tell us what we should cross out elsewhere."
"I can only ask the Council in the present procedure - relating to supplementary budget 1 - not to cause any more problems by withholding its approval."
"It really would be most welcome for the forthcoming budgetary procedure if the Council could be accommodating here and vote with us."
"That would be a good sign and could shape the forthcoming budget debates."
"My request to the Council is: please proceed as I suggest; we shall be more than happy to acknowledge such a procedure."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has already explained the SAB is asking to approve two separate sums of money."
"I hope that these sums have been arrived at after taking good account of the principles of budgetary prudence and value for money."
"The political decision to approve the building for Mr Solana and the 45 military personnel had already been taken by the fifteen Member States at Helsinki."
"I would like to raise three issues about this."
"Firstly, it is not clear why the military personnel in the building should be counted as administrative expenditure."
"They would more appropriately come under the heading of operational expenditure."
"Secondly, I understand there is a gentlemen's agreement according to which the European Parliament and the Council agreed not to interfere with each other's budget."
"I believe this has been pushed to its limit."
"The Council's interpretation of the gentlemen's agreement is certainly imaginative."
"The agreement applies to buildings and Council staff but not necessarily to seconded military personnel, whose salary comes from their own Member State."
"However their overheads would be paid for by the EU in the future with no real monitoring or accountability role by any institution."
"Thirdly, I am not satisfied with the use of the SAB as an instrument for this because these extra needs were foreseen prior to the conclusion of the budgetary process last year and should have been incorporated in this year's budget."
"In accordance with the spirit of the gentlemen's agreement, I will not comment on the need for 45 military personnel in the building."
"That will surely be as safe as Fort Knox."
"The point I wish to raise here is that Council must apply the same sort of budgetary rigour to its administrative expenditure as it expects of other institutions."
"And I would like some reassurance in the future that this expenditure will be spent in the most efficient and economic way possible."
"On Parliament's request for the extra 15 million for the additional advance payment for the new building in Brussels, although it can be identified as a prudent step which will allow considerable savings in the future, I am concerned about the messages that this may convey."
"I believe it is crucial for Parliament to introduce activity-based budgeting as a matter of utmost urgency."
"I had in fact forgotten to mention the fourth amendment, which, as it does not refer to expenditure, may appear less relevant, but it would be wrong to assume this."
"I simply wanted to say that one of Parliament' s amendments included the creation, in B5-671N, of a line for financing a 'Rapid Reaction Facility' which is designed - pursuant to the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline - to make it possible, thanks to a token entry, to allocate sufficient resources when the regulation is finally adopted."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy considers this a priority and I regret not mentioning it earlier."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are, at the beginning of the second half of the year 2000, debating the first two proposed amendments to the current budget."
"The first proposed amending budget relates to the Commission's budget."
"The second relates to the Council's and Parliament's budget, in both cases on the question of building policy."
"While the extra 15 million granted by Parliament is to be used to pay off the buildings early, thereby saving interest in the future, the extra Council expenditure will give rise to further expenditure in the future because other buildings will be rented in Brussels to house sectors such as the security policy."
"As the Commissioner responsible for budgets, I naturally take a more kindly view of expenditure which saves money in the future - that is meant as a little dig at the Council, which is not yet here - although the Council's concerns are also well founded."
"If new tasks are to be adopted, then they need to be given staffing and administrative support."
"I only hope that the Council also grants the Commission the same courtesy and does not use one sauce for the goose and one for the gander."
"Supplementary and amending budget 1 contains important amendments on the income side - as has been stressed - and on the expenditure side of the Budget 2000. On the income side, the refund of the surplus EUR 3.2 billion from 1999, as already mentioned."
"A number of other important corrections have also been made, meaning that contributions for the year 2000 can now be finalised."
"On the expenditure side, the following amendments have been made: provision has been made in the budget for the planned Repatriation Fund for non-military intervention in crisis areas, as already mentioned by the rapporteur."
"The funding for the UNMIK high representative in Kosovo and Bosnia has been amended and EUR 11 million will now be provided."
"For Montenegro, additional aid of EUR 20 million is to be provided."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs and to tell the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, that the Commission has accepted all Parliament's proposed amendments, even where, for example in the case of Montenegro, the remaining margin is extremely tight, but that means we must be economical and that is what we intend to be."
"The Commission will do its best to ensure that the Council does not take this to a second reading, thereby postponing the resolution until September."
"Perhaps the reduction in payments will be incentive enough for the Council to follow Parliament's example in coming to a rapid decision, for which I should like once again to thank the House."
"Thank you, Commissioner. You belong to the progressive school in the Commission, which understands that, in evening sittings, the popularity of the speaker rises in direct proportion to the brevity of his or her intervention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Liberalisation of energy markets"
"The next item is the report (A5-0180/2000) by Mr Mombaur on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Commission's second report to the on the state of liberalisation of the energy markets Council [COM(1990) 198 - COM(1999) 164 - COM(1999) 612 - COM(2000) 297 - C5-0163/2000 - 2000/2097(COS)]."
"Mr President, the gas and electricity market is, without doubt, essential both to Europe's competitiveness and to environmental protection."
"We have drafted a report in response to four Commission documents, the basic aim of which is to make one overall market out of fifteen individual markets."
"As rapporteur for the committee, I should like to draw the House's attention to a number of points, Mr President, but perhaps you will allow me to stop for a moment because Madam Vice-president has just joined us."
"I repeat, the basic aim of our report is to respond to four Commission documents and to make one overall gas and electricity market out of fifteen individual markets."
"The committee has identified a number of points here, which I should like to list."
"First, the Union citizens' right to freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services has so far only been partially implemented."
"We advise that this implementation be accelerated."
"Secondly, we welcome the fact that suppliers are forming new structures and we call on the Commission in its capacity as the competition authority, in collaboration with the national mergers and monopolies commissions, to ensure that new monopolies do not emerge, that new suppliers have free access to the grid, that exchanges are set up and that consumers can change their supplier."
"Thirdly, we are concerned about security of supply and consider that great care should be taken to ensure that the Member States which so wish can impose so-called public-service obligations on the competitors involved."
"The Treaty contains rules on transparency and clarity in this respect but it also allows the Member States to make their own decision here."
"We want to ensure that this remains the case."
"My fourth point concerns regulators."
"Most, although not all Member States have introduced regulators."
"We note that, in the countries in which regulators have been introduced, not only large consumers, but also medium-sized and small consumers can take better part in the market and the conditions for using the grid are clearer."
"Perhaps we need to reconsider if the negotiated network access model is the right approach, because it makes life easy for large consumers but difficult for medium-sized consumers and may be an instrument which hampers the European market as a whole."
"Fifthly, the grids are the central market place for the markets."
"We therefore need free access, and that means that tariffs must give the market the right signal of non-discriminatory access for everyone and - and this is the purpose of the so-called Florence process - good cross-border tariffs must be set which allow cross-border trade."
"A model has been worked out here whereby the costs of cross-border trade are paid into funds."
"The money is paid in by the national grid operators and paid out to those providing through lines."
"Commissioner, Madam Vice-president, I have two comments to make on this. First, we feel that the costs calculated by the grid operators appear to have been plucked out of thin air."
"We need to examine these costings closely in order to ensure that they are not completely out of line."
"Secondly, the costs included in the tariffs must be sure to give the market the right incentive, i.e. they must cover all losses and encourage investment."
"That is an important point in this process."
"Sixthly: not all cross-border services have the necessary capacity."
"This needs to be calculated and, if necessary, rectified or allocated in accordance with the markets, perhaps by auction."
"Then there are two more points which I should like to address."
"We hope to discuss with the Commission in committee exactly how imports of gas and electricity from the Central and Eastern European countries are to be dealt with, because we do not want to damage our own gas and electricity market in Europe by accepting different safety standards or the wrong competition terms."
"Finally, in the case of electricity, transmission system operators have formed an association and it was with the help of this association that results were achieved in Florence."
"We call on the Commission to use its influence and to take its own action to form a similar association for gas transmission system operators so that results similar to those achieved in Florence can be achieved in Madrid in the parallel process for the gas sector."
"Energy, and electrical energy in particular, is of enormous importance to economic activity and social well-being, with a volume of business of some EUR 150 billion per year."
"Since the first directive on its liberalisation was adopted in 1996, and the second in 1998, there has been a significant fall in prices, especially in the countries in which those directives have been most strictly applied."
"I agree with the Commission, and with the rapporteur, on the need for liberalisation to be speeded up, so that the Community can fully benefit from a dynamic and competitive market."
"Nevertheless, despite the fact that the current regulations lay down the essential principles on the conditions, methods and pace of liberalisation, there are certain extremely important aspects which must be dealt with by means of additional measures and specific solutions."
"I am talking about the management of congestion, the cross-boundary aspects and the existing bottlenecks in the European transport networks, which hinder the balanced distribution of the benefits of these measures, which may facilitate the creation of a single market at Community level."
"On the other hand, there is still the practice of discriminatory prices for transfer between the Member States and the monopolies which own the networks, which hinders the genuine liberalisation of the sector."
"I believe that these practices, as well as the possible substitution of the well-known national monopolies by a European oligopoly, should be combated relentlessly by the services which come under the responsibility of the Commission."
"Although this issue is of concern to us and deserves much consideration, I would like to end by supporting the balanced report of the rapporteur and highlighting the need to realise the expectations of our citizens as soon as possible."
"Mr President, in his report Mr Mombaur has certainly given a comprehensive coverage of the implications of the liberalization of these markets."
"Energy, of course, is not just any good or service."
"It is very basic and very essential and has to be treated differently from normal goods."
"The two directives were very carefully calculated to ensure that there would not be huge and sudden job losses - approximately 250,000 jobs have been lost in this sector, with more to come - and secondly to allow those Member States which had invested heavily in, for example, nuclear energy to do some strategic planning and not leave them with too much in the way of stranded costs."
"For that reason they were not full speed ahead directives."
"Nevertheless they should have been implemented on time by every Member State and they were not."
"Those which delayed were wrong, especially those which at the same time took advantage of the opening of markets elsewhere and we have evidence that this also applies to countries outside the European Union."
"I have said that the job losses were very considerable."
"There has also been a great deal of upheaval and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies, something which must be combated."
"There has been a diminution in the amount of research and development and that is a shame."
"There is a lack of harmonization to date and Mr Mombaur is quite right to call for harmonization."
"I am fairly sceptical about allowing the regulators to do that through the Florence work."
"The question of public service obligations is mentioned several times in the report."
"The Socialist Group has put forward an amendment asking for a framework directive ensuring that in sectors like energy services of general interest are protected."
"I hope that will be supported."
"Although there are difficulties with the two directives and liberalization, it is part of creating Europe and lower prices do benefit people."
"However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously."
"The Lisbon Council asked the Commission to look at the possible need for an acceleration."
"I do not agree, however, with preaching to Member States and telling them what they should be doing."
"It is up to them to decide."
"I am very anxious that renewable energy is supported in a liberalised market."
"That is not easy to do and it is something the Parliament holds dear."
"I am very concerned about the threat to combined heat and power in the gas directive."
"That needs to be rectified very quickly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the great care he has taken over this report."
"Two major factors can be identified with regard to the liberalisation process of the energy market."
"First of all, the liberalisation process does not proceed at the same pace in all the Member States and secondly, there is also a difference in timing within the respective Member States."
"Moreover, it is also worth emphasising that the way energy markets are opened up depends greatly on the geographic location of the Member State in question."
"For the reasons set out above, it would be preferable to adopt a pragmatic rather than a theoretical approach."
"The pragmatic approach is also the way forward if we want to achieve Member-State-specific liberalisation, for, in our opinion, we should not speed up the directive' s implementation but rather carry it out gradually."
"Against this background, it is important for the amendment tabled by our group to be approved within the Commission. This aims to force Member States to set up independent regulatory bodies that will be authorised to encourage full competition."
"The same amendment also aims to promote the interests of the consumers within the liberalised energy market by guaranteeing universal service provision."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that our proposal on laying down a detailed schedule, in the course of which clearly defined goals would need to be accomplished, is important if we are eventually to achieve gradual, yet full, liberalisation of the energy market."
"Acceptance of this proposal within the plenary will put a stop to unfair competition which is currently affecting the electricity market and which is caused by liberalisation being applied in different ways within the Member States."
"Mr President, this report again demonstrates that liberalisation, the free market and competition are currently seen as the universal panacea to nearly every economic and other problem."
"Yes, I am aware of the few positive developments in European energy policy."
"Without doubt, electricity prices have fallen."
"However, the fact that the prices of some other forms of energy have spiralled is passed over in modest silence."
"Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania."
"On balance, I feel that a number of very serious problems and misdirected developments in EU energy policy have not been addressed."
"First, I would like a discussion on the current, completely non-liberal practice already referred to of massively subsidising nuclear and fossil-fuel energy in their many and varied forms."
"Secondly, the EU directive on the internal electricity market must be supplemented by an EU-wide supply directive which promotes an ecological and decentralised energy economy."
"Thirdly, a radical rethink of the EU's promotion policy is also needed so as to promote energy savings from renewable sources of energy and regionalised energy policies, rather than the construction of high-voltage lines for a centralised energy economy."
"Fourthly, I should like to warn against subverting local energy operations by liberalising right across the EU, as we are doing at present."
"Economic aspects and the democratic strength and power of local energy authorities to act, socially and otherwise, are at stake here and must not be sacrificed to liberalisation at any price."
"Mr President, I would like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur for this report."
"It is a very balanced piece of work covering quite a wide range of views."
"We should point to progress made so far in liberalising the electricity and the gas markets, in particular opening up electricity to more than 60% of the market so far, while also remembering that we need to keep up the pressure for more progress."
"It is hard to over-estimate the importance of this process to the competitiveness of our European economies in the widest sense."
"I know that in the short term it may be difficult to prove that but I am quite sure that in the long term this is a vital part of making our economies competitive in the wider world."
"I also believe that it is very important for us to distinguish between the processes of market efficiency that liberalization implies and other policy objectives that we may wish to achieve, such as the question of universal supply, such as the aims to reduce CO2 and it is very important to keep those two distinct and separate."
"I have to say that I share the regret of some colleagues that some countries have been rather backward in implementing these measures and it is ironic that at least one of those countries is that which seeks to accelerate the pace of integration in Europe."
"St Augustine 'make me more liberalised but not quite yet'."
"I would like to recognise that the fears of the pessimists that liberalization would lead to cuts in security of supply have been confounded."
"Private sector provision has delivered the goods."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mombaur' s report deals with the energy markets and, as everyone has understood, advocates speeding up the liberalisation of these markets."
"At this hour in the day and stage in the debate, I think it preferable and far more useful to get straight to the point with what I have to say."
"Personally, when I think in terms of 'energy' I think of security of supply in the long term, the guarantee of public service missions and the contribution to sustainable and environmentally friendly development."
"If I can, in addition, think in terms of competitiveness, then I certainly take the opportunity to do so, though, I have to admit, it is not my highest priority."
"That is why ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the rapporteur' s conclusions, or the vision and proposals put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein in 'Frontier-Free Europe' ."
"Those who are not in favour of accelerating the liberalisation of public utilities are not old fashioned."
"Those who defend public service do not use fear as an argument to defend their values, and those who are in favour of a universal service are not nostalgic, nervous nationalists, but Europeans."
"Mr Mombaur, unlike you, I do not have blind and absolute confidence in market mechanisms."
"I do not favour price reduction over security."
"I defend employment first and foremost and what is more, I never lose sight of the fact that public services constitute a unifying element and an element of the European social model that is so dear to your friend Mr Jacques Chirac. They are of course, also a prerequisite for balanced regional planning whose failure or inexistence would cost far more than the savings you hope to achieve."
"I would therefore have liked your report to have taken account of the Treaty provisions relating to general interest services and to have included proposals for measures designed to guarantee citizens' access to public services in energy."
"This is because, and this is something I should like to stress, public service in energy is a factor in social cohesion, the fight against exclusion, balanced regional development, respect for the environment, security and lastly a prerequisite for national and European independence."
"Rapporteur, I cannot deny that you have worked hard on this and even congratulate you on your efforts, but I cannot subscribe to the ideology that underpins your proposals."
"I hope that the amendments tabled by Mr Harlem Desir and other Members that also share my concerns will be adopted because I personally am not in a position to vote in favour of your report as it stands."
"I would also like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent job well done and make two points which have been mentioned by others before."
"Firstly, the value of strong regulatory authorities."
"It is quite clear from the experience in the fifteen still separate markets that strong regulatory bodies help market access for smaller players, protect the interests of consumers and force the pace of large monopoly-providers which might otherwise feel free to take a more leisurely pace."
"Secondly, the value of a timetable."
"It was a pity that the Lisbon conclusions did not call for a timetable."
"Experience in other areas such as telecom shows that Member States respond better to this incentive and I hope that the Commission will elaborate a specific timetable for liberalization in the months to come."
"Mr President, the report on the Commission' s second report to the Council and the European Parliament on progress in liberalising energy markets only takes account of two aspects, namely competition and the deepening of the internal energy market."
"In order to justify this strategy of the full liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, the report sings the praises of the supposed positive effects of competition, namely, reduced production costs, increased job opportunities and even goes as far as to praise its positive macroeconomic effects on the job market."
"By what mechanism does he hope this will be achieved, or rather by what mysterious means?"
"In fact, the liberalisation that has been carried out to date or is in progress has not generated employment and, in some public utilities, personnel levels have even dropped as a result."
"According to the trade unions in the ETUC, 300 000 jobs have already been lost and a further 200 000 are threatened."
"Everywhere you look employees rights are under threat."
"I take issue with another assertion made in the report concerning the reduction in energy prices."
"Who will benefit from this and how exactly?"
"It is commonly known that tariff reductions all too often only benefit large industrial users."
"As far as ordinary users are concerned, gas and electricity have become goods that one can either afford or not."
"Will users in the not too distant future be asked to pay for their electricity in advance, as is the case in Great Britain, and be forced to go without when their card runs out?"
"Energy is a basic need."
"Access to it must therefore be considered a fundamental right."
"In our view, only genuine public and democratic regulation would make it possible to rationalise both the production and use of energy while ensuring respect for the environment and basic equalisation."
"This would constitute the first step towards a European public service that met the needs of today' s users and employees."
"However, such concerns seem far removed from this report, which is why I cannot vote in favour of it as it stands."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Peter Mombaur, and congratulating him on his skilled reporting. And having heard the contributions made today by the honourable members, we really can say that the liberalisation of the energy markets has progressed faster and more efficiently than we expected in the last parliamentary term."
"That is the first thing."
"Mr Caudron, it is no longer possible to reverse this and that is how it should be."
"Secondly, the energy liberalisation sceptics have been impressively routed."
"The prices of gas and electricity have sunk as the result of competition, Mrs Vachetta, including to consumers."
"You insist on portraying the large undertakings as the winners here, but you are completely wrong, that is rubbish."
"Security of supply to consumers and to the economy has been maintained and the competitiveness of jobs has improved considerably, not deteriorated."
"It has improved thanks to international competition."
"We still have a whole series of problems to solve."
"Too little headway has been made liberalising the markets in individual Member States but we assume that the French presidency will make further progress here."
"Secondly, liberalisation must be controlled by the competition authorities and we have a European institution that can and does do that; otherwise private monopolies will replace state monopolies."
"Mr Mombaur pointed that out just now."
"Thirdly, we need the strict division between energy generation and grid management."
"Even the problem of charges and access conditions are, in my view, better solved by a regulatory authority than in voluntary agreements between major associations."
"Fourthly, regulated grid access with set prices, following the telecommunications example, is the best way of ensuring that small and medium-sized companies and smaller works departments receive equal treatment."
"Both mergers and state aid must be controlled and approved in the future."
"Professor Monti has announced this."
"I think that this is right in principle, but I think that his deadline of five years is too soon and I think that we need to extend the deadline to ten years, so that European industry has time to develop fully and invest with good prospects in this important future market."
"Mr President, it has emerged in the course of this discussion that, for some people, liberalisation is a goal in itself."
"I do not think that it, in fact, is."
"There must be some purpose to liberalisation, be it lower prices, security of supplies, increased competitiveness or sustainable technological development."
"Proceeding from that point of view and inspired, in fact, by the EU directives, we in Denmark have begun a complete liberalisation of the electricity sector."
"This entails major upheavals which are causing concern among employees."
"When you talk with them about liberalisation, they say, 'We are happy to have liberalisation, but it should be the same for everyone in Europe.'"
"That is just the problem with this issue."
"We have obtained liberalisation in 15 different markets and15 different countries, but we have not in that way obtained complete liberalisation."
"It may perhaps be concluded that what we have obtained is liberalisation for liberalisation' s sake."
"Employees in the sector shake their heads, and ordinary consumers do not obtain the intended benefits of liberalisation."
"It is therefore right to continue with the liberalisation that is under way and implement complete liberalisation."
"Of course we should have liberalisation, but it should be on equal terms."
"At the same time, it is important to remember that liberalisation ought not to be carried out in isolation."
"In future work on liberalising the energy market, we shall make sure that energy policy as a whole is involved."
"There is a wide range of considerations to be taken into account."
"I am thinking here of consumers, the environment, competitiveness, renewable energy sources and the employees."
"There are a good many more agendas we need to engage with, and not only that of complete liberalisation."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Mombaur, for an excellent report."
"The liberalisation of the energy markets is the only real way to safeguard consumers' rights and the credible viability of the Internal Market."
"The Commission must take care that the energy market is opened up in a genuine sense and in a spirit of fair play."
"Various apparent barriers to competition, such as the bottlenecks created by the power grid operators, must be straightened out without delay."
"In addition, the largest European ""energy players"" must fall into line."
"For example, France, whose energy sector is among the most progressive, stubbornly protects its own markets."
"What does such a competitive country have to fear in conditions of free competition?"
"The liberalisation of energy markets also means that the Commission will have to approach various forms of energy on an equal footing."
"I cannot help wondering about the statements made by the energy Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, which suggested that free-flowing water would not be on the list of renewable energy sources."
"The Commission must reconsider its position."
"Hydroelectric power in the Nordic countries is an environmentally friendly and natural energy source that can often be produced at a competitive price, as is the case at present, thanks to a good water supply."
"Hydroelectric energy can currently compete at a price that would even rival imported energy from Eastern Europe and Russia, so there is no call to label future imports of electric power from the east to the Nordic countries, at least, as dumping."
"Protectionism among the big energy players in Central Europe is the main reason why cheap hydroelectric power is only getting to the Central European markets with difficulty."
"Certification systems will guarantee that consumer choice is in direct relation to the pricing of electricity."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"The liberalisation of energy markets is an essential factor in the development of the economy."
"The objective of improving competition and lowering prices for all consumer groups, including the end consumer, must be pursued assiduously."
"The opening up of the market will lead to reorganisation on a European scale with common rules for all the countries."
"I hope that the Commission will submit comprehensive proposals to overcome the existing barriers to intraCommunity trade and ad hoc measures to deal with the Member States which do not apply the directives."
"We need to speed up the process of liberalisation in the energy and gas sectors by harmonising the Member States' energy policies."
"To support the liberalisation process it will be necessary to introduce a benchmarking process, as we have done in other sectors, with the publishing of a Commission half-yearly report on the final price of European Union gas and electricity."
"This will allow us to assess the impact of liberalising the energy markets on the consumer directly."
"Guidelines will also have to be drawn up for harmonising the price observation criteria and processing the data gathered so as to ensure that maximum care is taken in comparing the situations of the different Member States."
"I would support the rapporteur in stressing that competition does not prevent Member States from imposing public service obligations in the general interest on operators."
"Moreover, I would remind you that liberalisation does not just mean privatisation, where a company continues, in practice, to be managed in the same way as before: liberalisation must mean opening up, interchange and competitiveness."
"I do not consider that liberalisation will have negative implications for employment, for the lower cost of energy will allow companies more room for development and create a greater number of jobs than are lost with the end of the monopolies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mombaur' s report on the state of liberalisation of the energy, electricity and gas markets has the merit of summarising the various Commission communications on the issue."
"It also highlights some of the key facts in this matter, two of which I shall mention here."
"First, the Treaties provide for the creation of an internal market in the energy sector, which must be accomplished."
"Second, the achievement of this aim undoubtedly involves opening up the markets to competition, the process of liberalisation and division into separate activities relating to energy transmission, production and distribution."
"As the French Presidency gets underway, it must be noted - and as a French MEP this is not something I am terribly proud of - that France has taken a long time to transpose several European directives into its national law."
"In fact, it appears that France comes bottom of the class as far as this matter is concerned."
"The European directive on electricity was therefore adopted rather late by my country and only in its most basic form."
"More generally speaking, I, like the rapporteur, deplore the fact that there are other countries that wish to implement the directive only in its most basic form."
"And yet, as has already been mentioned -and I too should like to reiterate the point - full liberalisation, as carried out by other States in the area of electricity, has produced considerable benefits for the user: need we be reminded of the 25-33% price reduction in the United Kingdom or the almost 35% drop in Germany?"
"This is why I believe that we should support the Commission in its undertakings and, as Mr Mombaur' s report suggests, set a specific binding timetable for carrying out the full liberalisation of the energy markets in the applicant countries and of course, first and foremost in the Member States."
"The ambition shown by the latest presidency of the Union for the advancement of Europe cannot simply stop at the defence of acquired or past situations."
"The completion of the internal market cannot be restricted to the European Union alone, which is why it cannot be put off indefinitely."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Mombaur on his report, which I believe broadly coincides with the Commission' s position."
"Secondly, I would like to thank all the speakers, although I do not agree with everything that has been said."
"In any event, I would like to point out that I agree with Mr Mombaur when he says that the liberalisation of the electrical sector has led to a drop in prices, improvements for customers, for homes and also for large industry, which means job creation, increased competitivity of the European electrical industry, development and work, although it is true that some jobs have been lost in the electrical industry."
"However, the benefits have outweighed the problems encountered."
"It should also be pointed out that the Lisbon and Feira Summits have reiterated the need to move ahead with liberalisations."
"As regards what some have said, it is true that there is no timetable."
"This does not mean that there is not a strong will to move forward."
"In any event, the progress made so far - which is very considerable - still seems to me to be insufficient."
"We must not create fifteen separate liberalised markets, but one single European liberalised market."
"To this end, there are still issues to be dealt with, such as the level of openness of the market, the separation of the operators of transmission networks from the production systems, the guarantee of non-discriminatory access in the application of prices."
"In this context, I would like to thank Mr Mombaur for his resolution' s support for the importance of the separation of producers and operators of transmission networks."
"Furthermore, the efforts of the Florence Forum are invaluable and we must continue along that route."
"If they turn out to be insufficient, they will be supplemented with Commission initiatives."
"In that respect, there is a will to seek an establishment of tariffs which will lead to an increase in exchanges and clear access to the network."
"I must also point out that the Florence Forum - with regard to electricity - must be supplemented by the Madrid Forum on gas."
"Both of these reflect an original institutional approach, since representatives of Parliament participate in them."
"There is a physical aspect, the capacity for interconnection, which must also be developed and which currently lead to limitations in the development of this single market, both in the electrical sector and in the gas sector."
"If we are to continue to make progress with liberalisation, we cannot forget one key element: the public service role of electricity - and gas as well, although on a different level."
"This means that the supply must be guaranteed - as some of you have said - and there must be an adequate service for all citizens."
"This aspect will be included in the initiatives which I propose to present to the Council and Parliament at the end of this year, so that they may be ready in the Spring, for the European Council, in order to provide more impetus for liberalisation in the areas I have mentioned."
"I also wish to say that the aspects relating to safety standards must also be developed soon and I am going to propose to Parliament and the Council that we hold a debate, not on the nuclear sector, nor on the coal or renewable energy sector, but on the guarantees of the European Union' s energy supply as a whole, when we will be able to consider the different sources of energy and the problems relating to each of them, because nothing is free, everything has its price, its pros and cons."
"We need to hold a reasoned debate on the possibilities available to us, in terms of sources and the guarantees of supply, in the light of the Kyoto commitments."
"I consider water to be a form of renewable energy, of course."
"Hydro-electricity is a form of renewable energy."
"The problem is that the hydro-electrical industry as a whole is not taken into account when it comes to subsidies, which are another issue."
"We believe that we have to support renewable energy sources as much as possible."
"This is an extremely important European technology, with industrial possibilities beyond our European borders, which we must continue to support."
"The Directive excludes hydroelectricity from the consideration of subsidies, which means that it is not sustainable."
"We must continue to include it within the broad consideration of renewable energy resources."
"Mr President, I do not have time to expand further."
"I would like to thank Mr Mombaur once again for his magnificent report and point out that we are going to present proposals in order to continue the progress in the field of liberalisation. We are going to deal with the social aspects of the electricity sector and its public service element."
"The assessment is frankly positive and we must continue to make progress in accordance with what the Council has told us, at both the Lisbon and the Feira Summits."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Community railway undertakings"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"(A5-0173/2000) Recommendation for second reading by Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways [5386/1/2000 - C5-0178/2000 - 1998/0265(COD)];"
"(A5-0171/2000) Recommendation for second reading by Mr Swoboda on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on:"
"I. the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings [5387/1/2000 - C5-0176/2000 - 1998/0266(COD)];"
"II. the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity, the levying of charges for the use of the railway infrastructure and safety certification [5388/1/2000 - C5-0177/2000 - 1998/0267(COD)]."
"Before I set the signal for the railwaymen to green and because we have another new team here, I should like to make a brief comment."
"We still have a long debate ahead of us."
"I beg you to keep to the speaking times."
"As the two chief railwaymen starting the debate have unlimited speaking time, I leave it to their discretion to keep their speeches short."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes that plenary at last gradually but properly liberalise the railway market, with liberalisation to be completed by the year 2010."
"Only then will we achieve our common goal of shifting more freight from the roads on to the railways and, hence, of sustainable mobility within the European Union."
"First I must thank the Commission, especially the Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, and the Finnish Presidency, without whom there would have been no common positions in the Council in December 1999."
"We are most grateful for that."
"But Parliament will defend the view in the codecision procedure that the positions taken do not go far enough in order to safeguard the long-term future of the railways."
"The Council wants to move one small step at a time."
"We take the view that it is high time, eight years after the completion of the single market, to set signals and regulate conclusively so that the liberalisation of the railway sector can be completed by 2010."
"This also fits in with what was said at the Lisbon Summit, where the Heads of State and Government pressed for further liberalisation of the transport sector."
"So what are our most important proposed amendments?"
"First, we agree with the Council that, if the railway networks are to be used efficiently, only cross-border freight traffic need be liberalised for a special trans-European rail freight network."
"But we take the view that five years is long enough to show railways and their employees that they have nothing to fear from the liberalisation of the networks."
"We feel that railway undertakings should have access to the entire network of the fifteen Member States in five years' time, for both international and national freight traffic, and by 2010 for international and national passenger traffic."
"This gradual liberalisation plan would give us a real common network in the European Union by 2010."
"In order to ensure that railway undertakings in all Member States also have real access to local networks in other Member States, we feel that there must be a strict, compulsory division between the management of individual networks and the provision of transport services by individual national railway undertakings."
"Experience over the past 40 years shows that, if infrastructure and operations are not separated, the national railway undertaking always reserves the best lines for itself, thereby denying other railway undertakings effective, non-discriminatory access."
"We take the view that, if there is to be even greater use of the networks, legal entities other than railway undertakings, such as shippers and forwarding agents, should have the right to apply for and be granted licences to use lines throughout the Community."
"Liberalising the right to apply to use lines in all fifteen Member States by 2005 will do two things: first, it will take account of the role of shippers and forwarding agents, who need no encouragement to use the railways and, secondly, it will represent a further step towards the completion of the single market in the railway sector in that the railways' exclusive right to use the infrastructure will be somewhat mitigated."
"Another factor is the question of track charges."
"We take the view that track charges should be increased in the medium and long term in order to move towards the objective of covering costs."
"Only if the user pays, i.e. the railway undertakings also bear the cost of operating and maintaining the network, will it be possible to fund network operation and maintenance."
"Finally, the Committee on Transport voted by a large majority to abolish the derogations for Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Great Britain with respect to Northern Ireland."
"We feel that, first, legislation should be the same in all parts of the Union and, secondly, even in geographically remote areas, which we of course all value, the principles of accuracy and clarity of costs and open access to the network should apply."
"Allow me to close by stressing once again that we can use our vote in Parliament tomorrow to give a signal."
"If we adopt the recommendation by the Committee on Transport by a large majority, we will have a real chance of reaching a compromise with the Council during the conciliation procedure which is acceptable to both the Council and Parliament, which goes beyond the common positions and which enables a real move to be made towards liberalising the railway sector, because we all want to strengthen the railways."
"We want to shift more freight from the roads to the railways, which is why we need a clear compromise with the Council."
"And we shall only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one could be forgiven for thinking that the three reports under discussion today are in fact technical reports."
"But oh what emotions I witnessed when I reported on them in my group today, which is a good thing because a hugely important question is in fact at stake here: the question of how to ensure that the European railways gain in weight again in the future, not in the material sense, but as far as their importance is concerned, because what many people forget when they are busy opposing reforms is that, with the state the railways have got into, they are carrying less and less."
"Trains are still chugging round Europe, but there is less and less freight in their wagons and that is a state of affairs which we cannot tolerate."
"That is why I, why we all think, that a European railway sector needs to be developed and the Council resolution, the Council consensus, is really a minimum consensus; it does not satisfy us, even if we perhaps differ in our views on many aspects, such as how much further than the Council we should go."
"Of course, we have a lot of lost ground to make up, because in the past we have only had national railways."
"We talk about globalisation."
"All today's private-sector undertakings operate transnationally; only the railways seem not to have heard of this."
"So we need to liberalise and open up the markets and of course everyone has differing ideas as to how this should be done."
"Some think that the market is the invisible hand, the almost divine principle which should guide and control everything, while others think we should be very circumspect in liberalising the market and should only liberalise it where absolutely necessary."
"I think that our position, and my position, is that there is a middle way which will allow us to move forward, but it must be clearly defined; we must be clear as to how we are going to bring about the liberalisation of the market, whereby the railways must, of course, be given a chance to adapt to the new conditions one step at a time."
"For us, competition is a way of increasing services, i.e. we need to get more traffic on to the railways, especially freight traffic, which is the real sore point, if we are to prevent railway services from shrinking yet further."
"So it is a gradual process, but a clearer and faster process than that planned by the Council."
"First, the overwhelming majority of us takes the view that there should be a competition authority, a regulator as it were, in every country."
"That would give all railway undertakings, all interested parties, shipping agents, whoever, one authority in each country to which they can take recourse if clarity and transparency of competition are violated."
"It also means that there can be no derogations."
"We are building up a European railway, not one system for one country and a different system for another, which is why these derogations have to go."
"That does not mean that everything will be prescribed down to the last detail, it just means that the freedom which we are granting needs to be granted to all countries equally, not more for some and less for others."
"Secondly, we have differing views on the compulsory separation of infrastructures."
"We think that it must also be possible to trade fairly with integrated undertakings, provided of course that the balance sheet and certain basic conditions are kept separate."
"Our, or my proposal is that the Commission should present a report in a few years' time and report to Parliament on whether or not the principles of free, transparent competition have been contradicted and then we can take another decision."
"We take the view that liberalisation should apply first and foremost to freight traffic, both transnational and, in the end, national freight traffic."
"As far as passenger traffic is concerned, we feel that it is important and that it suffices, at least for the time being, to state clearly that cross-border passenger traffic will also need to be liberalised."
"As to whether passenger traffic between Stuttgart and Munich should be liberalised: this is a matter which, in my view, should be decided by the German government or the regional government in Bavaria and not necessarily at European level."
"We feel that the individual Member States should be given room to manoeuvre and take decisions here."
"The pricing system is an important issue."
"How much should be charged for the capacity allocated?"
"There are two schools of thought here."
"The first feels that only marginal costs should be charged, i.e. the costs incurred in running one more train."
"The second school feels that the complete costs of providing the route, tracks etc. should be covered."
"We feel that charging marginal costs make sense in the short term, in order to ensure that there is competition and that the railways can start running trains again. But in the long term, we will need some sort of complete cost-covering method, similar to the principle applied to the roads."
"Otherwise we shall never manage to get more freight back on to the railways because this is precisely the problem faced by certain railways, including the German railways, to quote just one example: when the complete cost-covering method is used in the present situation, many companies refuse to use the railways' services because they are simply too expensive."
"Which is why we need a gradual transition and similar conditions for both roads and railways."
"I should like to mention one last point. One criticism heard time and again is: has the whole idea of public-sector services gone to the dogs?"
"Is everything to be run on market principles, on private-sector principles?"
"We have therefore reinstated an original clause on public-sector services, and I am grateful for the support it has received because, unfortunately, the European Commission has not yet submitted any general proposals as to how public-sector services are to be dealt with."
"It will still be possible for a country to say that public-sector services must take priority at certain times and this priority can therefore be stipulated."
"I am sure that tomorrow's vote will set a conciliation procedure in motion."
"That does not present any particular problem."
"We, the two rapporteurs, and all the groups in the House are willing to reach a compromise."
"But the Council must also show willing."
"We have shown willing and, if the Council shows willing, we will be able to reach a compromise."
"I should like to close by thanking all those who worked with me, both in my group and in other groups here in Parliament, for all the effort which they invested in this, and of course the Commission, and I hope that tomorrow two or three very good reports will come out of this."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, who has taken over from Mr Pavlos Sarlis, our former fellow Member of the European Parliament who acted as rapporteur for the first reading, and Mr Swoboda, for their reports."
"Allow me to say that they both explained the technical aspects of their reports extremely well."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Transport, I should like to highlight two conclusions which I think we need to draw from this debate."
"The first conclusion concerns the liberalisation of the railways."
"This is something we have been hearing about for years, just as we have heard a great deal about the single market in the European Union for years."
"The time has come for action rather than words, on both counts."
"We need to accept that there will be no complete single market unless transport is fully liberalised and I think that liberalising the railways will be a decisive step in this direction and will make a decisive contribution towards the revival of the declining means of transport which we call the railways."
"The second message concerns the Council."
"The Council needs to take serious account of Parliament's views."
"Of course, we reached a compromise in Helsinki with Mrs de Palacio's help."
"This compromise is welcome but it is not enough; we need to go further and account needs to be taken of Parliament's position if we are to do so."
"The Council is wrong to believe that the discussion ended in Helsinki last December with the compromise at Council level."
"Parliament is here, it has its views, it supports them clearly and will, we believe, support them during tomorrow's vote which, I think, will confirm what was decided at the committee meeting during which the reports were adopted by a large majority."
"Mr President, for the railways the status quo is really not an option."
"They either have to change or die."
"Railways in Europe are in terminal decline, not least in the rail freight sector."
"New freight goes by road in Europe, not by rail."
"That must change, and I believe it will."
"That is why I broadly support the Council position which represents a small but important step towards railway liberalisation."
"The alternative to this modest step is no step at all."
"That is why tonight, regretfully I cannot agree with the tactics suggested by Mr Jarzembowski because it is a recipe for going nowhere at all, very quickly."
"We have to take into account national differences and indeed, social and employment concerns."
"Broadly, the Council position has struck the right balance on the charging, licensing, access and separation issues."
"They have struck a right balance between both extremes and I would advocate - to use Mr Swoboda's term - that ""third way"" should be applied to the railways in Europe."
"Labour MEPs have two particular concerns which I know are shared by many other Members: one is the issue of derogations."
"We believe that Greece, Ireland and Northern Ireland should have a limited derogation of five years because of their unique geographical and geopolitical circumstances."
"Secondly, we hope that the deletion of Article 12, led by the Liberals in committee, which could deprive citizens and consumers of network benefits and deprive disabled people of access, can be reinserted into the text."
"Those basic safeguards must be restored."
"The prize for us tonight is that for the first time in history we can achieve liberalisation of the international freight network."
"That is an achievable goal."
"Let us not throw it away."
"Mr President, I believe that the rapporteurs have done sterling work and the fruits of their labour, which we submitted under their guidance to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, are a coherent whole with a clearly defined objective."
"Mr Swoboda referred to this a moment ago: a vigorous railway sector within an internal market, which can be effective for the entire Union."
"The objective also sends a clear message to the Council, namely that Parliament wants to go further than the Commission."
"I do not really share Mr Watts' view."
"In my opinion, we need to go further than the Council stated in its common position."
"We must now set the scene for full liberalisation in the medium term, and the step we are now taking is the first step in this process."
"This step is also the step currently proposed by the Council."
"We must also take the next steps, namely implement full liberalisation with regard to the transport of goods by 2005 and take the same step for the transport of passengers nationally and internationally in the longer term, this time by 2010, a deadline which is ten years away."
"There are a number of points which are vital in this context, and I hope that a sufficient number of MEPs will be able to support those opinions tomorrow."
"First of all, it is vital that infrastructure and the provision of services be divided."
"After all, no one can be on both sides of the fence at the same time."
"Secondly, who can apply for a licence?"
"Not only railway undertakings, others too should be able to do this."
"I cannot see why, Mr Swoboda, this should be postponed until 2010."
"In my opinion, we should be able to bring this date forward to 2005."
"I should now like to comment on Article 12, which, I believe, is redundant, and a European licence should be subject to European requirements."
"That is not to say that consumers, railway workers' social rights or safety are deemed immaterial."
"In fact, safety should come first."
"European requirements should apply because a European railway system requires regulations at European level rather than additional regulations at national level, because the latter would enable Member States to carry out certain activities which they no longer have to do within a European market."
"If we pursue this line of attack, railway undertakings will need to put their customers and passengers first, rather than act out of self-interest."
"I would like to add a brief, technical comment."
"Amendment No 23 has been declared inadmissible by the services."
"I would dispute this on the basis of Rule 80, paragraph 2 (b), and Rule 80, paragraph 3, of our Rules of Procedure."
"I would invite the services to reconsider their view, because my amendment is also related to Amendment No 24 regarding Article 12, which was declared admissible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to admit that within my group there are two arguments being disputed in relation to the Community railways."
"Though we unanimously agree to finally and genuinely develop rail transport and, though we unanimously agree to make every effort to facilitate the transfer from road to rail, some think that that this will be achieved most speedily via liberalisation whereas others, including myself, believe that the maximum number of guarantees should be created before liberalisation goes ahead, particularly with regard to passenger transport."
"In my view, the present state of the railways in the various Member States does not make it viable to open them up to competition."
"They are all in need of considerable modernisation in order to offer identical conditions of competition."
"The reason for this is that in order to achieve genuine and equitable competition, the right conditions need to be created, they are not simply acquired and excesses must be avoided."
"Companies, particularly public companies, need to be granted enough time to modernise their networks before opening them up to competition."
"With regard to the guarantees, be they in relation to the harmonisation of working conditions or vital safety regulations, they are also something that cannot simply be acquired."
"The disaster in Great Britain is still fresh in our minds and continues to warrant examination of rail safety requirements."
"The compromise reached on 10 December by the Transport Council marked a step in the right direction."
"Let us therefore go ahead and set up the rail transport network."
"It is not a matter of going too far, too fast in terms of passenger transport, what we firstly need to achieve is a rail network that offers the public the chance to get around without causing pollution."
"Mr President, rail transport is very important in terms of citizens' mobility, the development of trade within Europe and in terms of the environment and regional planning."
"The European Parliament has already paved the way for the liberalisation of international freight transport at its first reading, by granting authorised applicants track access rights."
"This rail package was the subject of a Council compromise in December."
"The Council suggests that the choice of authorised applicants should be left to Member States' discretion, that the freight rail networks be opened up using a specific network called the ""Trans-European Rail Freight Network"" and, lastly, that the division into separate entities only take place progressively."
"I note, without any satisfaction, that the Council' s position also takes account of the various national situations and grants each State the right to determine their own choices and for example, to pursue cooperation commitments."
"However, we are faced with an ultraliberal proposition at this second reading."
"The amendments tabled sanction the overall fragmentation of the rail system, which would mark the end of subsidiarity for the authorised applicants in 5 years' time and mean that the separation of entities would not be achieved progressively."
"It would also mean the complete opening up of international and national freight transport and, by 2010, of passenger transport."
"Just a few moments ago we were speaking about electricity and on Thursday we shall address the issue of the single European sky."
"Throughout the public sector the same refrain is heard: liberalise, it' s magic!"
"In my view, rail transport would be left with an enormous bill."
"Rail companies would be forced into the role of service provider, which would create unfair competition."
"While the service providers benefit from the largest part of the commercial margin and are free to choose the most profitable sectors, the rail companies on the other hand are left to bear the high equipment and personnel costs."
"In opposition to the argument advanced regarding the increase in traffic, this system might cause the isolation and disastrous creaming off of the more profitable sectors."
"This same dogma is aimed solely at gaining profits through liberalisation, and users and employees do not get a say."
"No proper preliminary study was undertaken and what is more, I think that we should take time to study the impact of the decisions taken by the Council."
"It would also be useful to compare - in relation to the freight paths - the private and the public sector."
"If the proposals from this second reading are adopted, they would be considered as a real provocation by all involved in the sector."
"I can neither endorse them, nor the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group that suggest a need for further opening up on the path to liberalisation."
"Mr President, I understand the ideal contained in this report to complete the internal market in the railway sector, thereby allowing freight transport by rail to compete successfully with freight transportation by road."
"This is necessary for the long-term survival of the European railway sector and all Member States would be in agreement with this goal."
"It is our task to reach agreement on how best to achieve this, bearing in mind the difficulties involved for some Member States."
"I speak for my own country of Ireland."
"Both the Republic and the North of Ireland seek to continue the derogation agreed in December 1999, because of geographic and geopolitical reasons."
"It is a small country isolated from the European mainland."
"It cannot be accessed by rail operators elsewhere in the European Union."
"I have seen at first hand the continual bombings of the north-south railway lines over the past 30 years due to the Troubles."
"Only now is there a chance for them to develop and prosper."
"Implementation at this time of this rail liberalisation package will involve the setting up of a complex administrative structure without enjoying the subsequent benefits that other Member States would."
"I am sure that the Irish government has agreed to the broad principle of the separation of infrastructure and operation and has pledged to pursue the restructuring of Irish railways to achieve this goal."
"I ask that the present derogation be maintained to allow time to implement these changes remembering that, should an EU-rail operator wish to enter the Irish rail market, the derogation would immediately cease."
"Finally, it is my personal hope that while I support this derogation, I hope that it would in no way hinder the much-needed upgrading and extension of the Irish rail system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European transport situation can be summed up using several pertinent figures."
"Between 1990 and 1997 the volume of transport of goods increased by 21% whilst over the same period the proportion of freight transported by rail dropped by 7%."
"During the same period, passenger transport increased by 15% and rail transport by only 3%."
"In terms of both freight and passenger transport European integration has been a considerable factor of mobility, but the roads have been the major beneficiaries of this particularly, but not exclusively, due to the fact that they have been frontier free since the beginning of the 1990s."
"European railways therefore need to open up urgently and without fear."
"Their future lies largely in their own hands, however, it is also our job to give them every opportunity to achieve their aims."
"Railway workers must rise to the challenge of opening up international networks to trains from all countries in the European Union."
"The decision taken by the fifteen Ministers for Transport in December 1999 to set plans in motion for the creation of a Trans-European Freight Network that represents 94% of the international freight transport came as a direct response to this challenge."
"It is entirely logical to adapt national rail legislation to this new system that lays down rules governing access, pricing policy and standard and consistent management practices within the European Union."
"The Swoboda report contains commendable proposals regarding the need to adapt legislation to the various national situations."
"On the other hand, it is wholly unacceptable and, what is more, contradicts Parliament' s first reading, for us to take advantage of this second reading - as the Jarzembowski report suggests - to announce measures to open up all networks to competition and others designed for the widespread privatisation of such networks at national and local level, as that stems from a dogma, an untested belief in the superiority of a market model that has clearly demonstrated its limitations in the United Kingdom."
"Several moments ago, I stated that the future of rail transport also depended on us, and I should also like to point out the fact that the dogmatic approach that we appear to have adopted in this matter threatens its very success."
"Everyone here is aware that rail integration in Europe cannot be reduced to a theological debate on the comparative merits of controlled liberalisation and uncontrolled privatisation."
"Railways, which only receive 25% of the investment allocated to transport infrastructure in Europe, as opposed to the 65% allocated to roads, are in need of substantial investment in order to enhance interoperability, reduce bottlenecks, extend networks and integrated transport systems, etc. The United Kingdom has demonstrated to what extent privatisation can represent a step backwards."
"This is why we believe that our work should not threaten the delicate balance of the Council' s common position."
"Mr President, the proportion of freight transported by rail within the EU has almost halved over the last thirty years."
"It is vital, if we are to have a truly sustainable transport policy that this process is reversed."
"I congratulate Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski on their excellent reports which, if adopted, will make a major contribution to railway development."
"I share some of Mr Watts' concern, however, about Amendment No 1 in relation to the licensing of railway undertakings and the proposed deletion of the replacement Article 12."
"In any liberalisation process it is very important to ensure that certain standards are maintained, for example those relating to the safety of both workers and consumers."
"At the same time we need to prevent artificial barriers being put in the way of the opening up of markets."
"Fulfilling both of these objectives requires a delicate balance to be struck."
"I doubt both whether Amendment No 1 serves its intended legal purpose and whether it could have the effects that Mr Watts fears."
"I believe it could send out the wrong signals."
"Instead I seek support for Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which, taken together, should have the effect of securing the second of the two objectives without detracting from the first."
"- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could conceivably agree to the Europeanisation of railway transport that has been put forward in the directives we are now considering and, consequently, the liberalisation of the rail sector."
"I could also give my support to the legal separation of the management of railway infrastructures from the provision of transport services."
"In order to do so, however, I would have to see guarantees on certain fundamental issues, which are the criteria for the quality and efficiency of the enormously important political and economic measure that should result from these directives."
"We are all aware that many European countries were not able to take part in the industrial revolution of the 19th Century at the right time, precisely because they lacked adequate rail connections."
"Some of them are still waiting today for their railways to be modernised and, more specifically, for access to the European High Speed Network."
"The liberalisation of this sector must under no circumstances be an obstacle to this access."
"Rail networks must therefore continue to provide a guaranteed public service in all Europe' s regions, particularly the more remote ones."
"Furthermore, liberalisation must not lead to necessary lines being closed, to unemployment or to safety standards and the quality of service falling."
"Recent events have given us grounds to think that these are possible consequences, which must be prevented at all costs."
"We therefore harbour grave reservations about supporting these directives."
"Mr President, the rapporteur who drafted a report on the development of the Community' s railways has adopted the guiding principle that for the time being, the railway industry has largely lost the competitive battle to road transport and aviation but that despite this, it is preferable to hold on to the railway industry and strengthen it."
"I could not agree more."
"But this is about the only issue on which I see eye to eye with him."
"I believe Mr Jarzembowski is quite mistaken."
"What he wants to achieve requires a complete change of tack and what he proposes will lead to further regression."
"His proposals are in line with views held at the end of the twentieth century."
"In all areas, we are witnessing a neo-liberal attack on public services, Community undertakings and employers' organisations."
"This attack is mainly aimed at postal services, rail and the energy sector, companies which have the potential to demonstrate that we can organise our economy in a more democratic, environmentally-friendly and less profit-oriented manner."
"Unfortunately, these companies have for years been neglected by their owners, the democratically elected community which belongs to us all, and have been treated as private companies."
"The rapporteur considers the rail industry as an irritating state monopoly with difficult and demanding trade unions in tow."
"He wants to break this monopoly as quickly and radically as possible."
"Instead of focusing his attention on stepping up cooperation between the existing railway companies and enhancing the democratic say over these companies, so that benefits of the rail industry can be better enjoyed on a European scale and liabilities can be eliminated more effectively, he puts all his hope in competition and liberalisation."
"In his opinion, the form of organisation by means of which road transport and aviation have largely triumphed over rail, should also be applied to rail itself."
"We have now gained some experience in liberalisation thanks to the English and Dutch models."
"The English variant carved up the national railway industry into regional companies, some of which ended up in the hands of large foreign concerns."
"In other regions, they remained a monopoly."
"That country now invests less in innovation than any other country."
"Trains are shorter and overloaded, and the safety of railways has declined."
"According to the Dutch version, competitors can obtain licences for lines on which they want to compete with the existing railway company. This company was established in 1939 and is an amalgamation of old private railway companies which operated inefficiently."
"Following a propaganda war between a newcomer and the existing company, operating different rates and using different trains, this newcomer was first taken over by a large French water company and subsequently ceased all activity."
"It is evident that it is only profitable to operate lines over which you have complete control. This reality renders the proposals made by Jarzembowski unviable."
"Mr President, ten years ago, Mr Cornelissen found himself in exactly the same debate."
"If I were to read out his text, nobody would bat an eyelid."
"The train is at a standstill, and to stand still is to regress."
"Who in their right mind would take a train that moved backwards?"
"Thanks to the internal market and e-commerce, the flows of traffic and commodities within the European Union have increased by 70% over the past ten years."
"To accommodate this increase, we need all the types of transport we can think of, ranging from internal waterways, air, roads and trains, all of which should be just in time and clean."
"So far, trains have not contributed in any way."
"In percentage terms, the train has lost a considerable share in the transport market and it is difficult to detect any movement within European rail."
"At the same time, the train has proved the European Union right, namely that more competition keeps you on your toes and on the ball."
"Due to a lack of competition as a result of excessive protectionist behaviour on the part of the Member States, the train has been relegated to the second division in this century too."
"But from now on, the railways need to take down the barriers that are obstructing the cross-border transport of goods, by using each other' s infrastructure."
"They need to make their equipment considerably more hard-wearing because they are hopelessly lagging behind road transport in this respect."
"In the next phase, the following points will be particularly important, in my opinion."
"Honest, non-discriminatory access should be granted to the infrastructure."
"Transport companies should be separated from the management of the infrastructure."
"It is vital for these components not to be controlled by one and the same body."
"Safety takes absolute priority and cannot be monitored by the transport companies themselves."
"A second key element is the opening up of the railway infrastructure or, in other words, a liberalisation of the market, which is different from privatisation."
"This is vital if we want to breathe new life into the transport of goods. In this way, new operators are attracted who bring with them new insights and a new management culture."
"Liberalisation, as mentioned in the common position, is a good start but is not enough."
"Only when railway networks open up once and for all will railway undertakings and their employees have a chance."
"Liberalisation should, however, work both ways."
"Nobody should have to tolerate competitors on their infrastructure that refuse or are unable to grant the same access at home."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without doubt, the European railways need reviving and that is precisely what the legislative package under discussion is attempting to do."
"The congestion on the roads, the threat from which to transport and environmental safety increases daily, is so bad that we must now strengthen the railways."
"The common positions approved here by the Council obviously promote the required revival by dealing fairly and transparently with all railway undertakings, by defining a logical framework for distributing infrastructure capacity and user charges, by separating railway infrastructure management from the provision of transport services and by discussing how, to what extent and at what speed this separation should apply."
"Of course we are on the right track and of course we understand the problems facing certain Member States in directly, or almost directly adopting all the new measures proposed."
"First, the huge disparities between the networks in the various countries and, more importantly, the geographical situations of certain Member States or regions make it very hard for them to change the system quickly and, secondly, forcing the change, as it were, on these Member States would not result in any significant benefit either to the countries in question or the Community as a whole."
"We believe that a dogmatic, absolutist approach is risky and is unfair because, as we know full well, it does not apply in all sectors."
"Sometimes, the apparently contradictory, oxymoronic Ancient Greek proverb ""more haste, less speed"" is more efficient."
"Finally, I must in all honesty congratulate our two rapporteurs on their sterling work and ask for their understanding where special, objectively-identified circumstances exist."
"In this particular case, this applies to my country, Greece, which has shown that it is making quantum leaps, but only where they are really needed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our trans-European routes, our roads and motorways, are being clogged up daily by millions of lorries, buses and cars, which leads to wasted time, wasteful energy consumption and significant environmental damage, amongst other things."
"For all of these reasons the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance always defends the railway as an alternative means of transport - currently underexploited - which wastes fewer resources, and is cleaner and more respectful of the natural environment."
"Therefore, when amending and implementing the Community legislation on the liberalisation of the railway sector, we wish to argue not only that the railway should not be penalised in relation to other means of transport, but that there should actually be positive discrimination in its favour, so that we can counteract the delay we have caused in terms of investing in it."
"With regard to the taxes on the use of the infrastructures, which in the end will be paid by the users, we suggest that, in the short to medium term, these only reflect the marginal costs generated by the rail traffic itself and not those involving the recuperation of investment and maintenance, which should be covered by state budgets, as in the case of roads and motorways."
"That is the only way we will manage to make the railway a competitive means of transport which is used on a grand scale."
"Mr President, Commissioner, fellow members, when you receive a lot of letters from people you do not know, it may be for one of two reasons."
"Either you are very famous or your correspondents feel very strongly about the matter on which they write."
"Members of the European Parliament are not very famous."
"It must therefore be the matter at issue which has triggered the correspondence."
"We have all received a lot of letters, documents and requests for interviews over the last few days, nearly all from representatives of national railways and nearly all warning us, unisono against the compulsory separation of management and infrastructure called for in the proposals by the rapporteur Georg Jarzembowski."
"Mr Swoboda has also addressed this issue, although his argument was that we need to liberalise, but only one step at a time."
"Georg Jarzembowski submits that our systems in the past, with quasi-monopolistic national carriers, have not allowed optimum use to be made of the system."
"Who can argue with that?"
"The figures speak for themselves."
"Our present railway system is a far cry from what we desperately need in Europe, namely an efficient system which is also an acceptable system."
"Every example in related sectors confirms the argument."
"One step at a time gets you nowhere."
"Telecommunications traffic has demonstrated that, the electricity sector and numerous other sectors besides have demonstrated that."
"And we expect the same to happen with the railways."
"The main purpose of the railways is to serve their users and hence to serve a more efficient, improved European transport system."
"That is what we want, that is what we need and that is what we shall vote for."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the overall objective of the railway package under discussion here today is fast liberalisation of the European railways."
"As you know, we in the PPE are calling for this in all areas needed to complete the single market, wherever healthy competition can replace hand-me-down monopolies."
"Only comprehensive liberalisation will allow the necessary progress to be made so that the railway, as a carrier, has the qualitative and quantitative capacity to provide services and integrate with other carriers."
"The Commission texts on developing railway undertakings, on licensing railway undertakings and on allocating railway infrastructure capacity are a step in the right direction in this respect."
"My fellow member, Georg Jarzembowski, has earned my unstinting support for his efforts to bring about a self-contained railway package and would like to thank him for his work and his excellent report."
"What is important to me in all this is that, when management and infrastructure are separated, investments in the infrastructure are examined closely and duly compensated."
"Liberalisation will only be accepted if it results in real advantages and consumers need not fear for their safety."
"From this point of view, we must be sure to keep a firm hold on strict conditions when licensing railway undertakings."
"As far as the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity is concerned, we must ensure that there is non-discriminatory access."
"I do not deny that flexible regulations governing access to the grid have caused a number of problems in the energy sector."
"But I still think it is the best market economy approach and that also applies to the railways."
"We should not just talk about a common Europe, we should have the courage of our convictions and do something about it."
"Mr President, and those fellow Members who are still awake, I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda for their lucid reports, with reference to which we can at last try to revive the railways by opening them up to competition."
"It is fashionable these days to talk about the railways; it is politically correct."
"It often feels as if Parliament is a chamber where there is just one permitted truth."
"We all dash along in the same direction, like a flock of sheep, trying to convince one another that the railways will solve Europe' s transport problems."
"It is hard for us politicians to admit the facts."
"I have nothing at all against the railways; on the contrary, I greatly enjoy sitting in the buffet car, having a beer and admiring the landscape as it flits past."
"To be able to make reasonable decisions we have to identify the real importance of the railways for the economy and examine just how big a part the various modes of transport play."
"By far the biggest is road transport."
"The share of rail transport, measured in tons per kilometre, has fallen to below 15%, but even this way of measuring the figures gives too rosy a picture of the situation."
"From the economic point of view, transporting fifty computers a thousand kilometres is quite a different matter from transporting a hundred tons of grit ten kilometres, although the tonnage per kilometre is the same in both cases."
"It is also quite a different matter to transport raw textiles weighing tons as compared to an enormous load of silk neckties - I had one for myself, by the way."
"For this reason, any comparison must be made on the basis of the value of the consignments, and, if it is calculated this way, the share the railways have is just - surprise, surprise - 3%."
"I am not mathematically gifted, but I see a dramatic difference in favour of road transport, whose share is more than 95%."
"It is like comparing a fly with an ox, but it is not any wonder, because it is impossible to ignore the ease of transport, flexibility and door-to-door delivery service we associate with transportation by road."
"At present the real role of the railways in Europe' s economy is, unfortunately, marginal, although they receive a good deal of assistance from the taxpayer."
"But it is just because of this that we have to do all we can to revive rail transportation and support its gradual opening up to competition."
"We expect a constructive contribution from France when we set the clocks of European railway stations to the new millennium."
"Mr President, before going into the details of the various issues relating to the package of railway infrastructures, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the two rapporteurs, Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski, on the magnificent work they have done."
"I am delighted that Parliament is standing firmly by its convictions in this area, especially with regard to the full realisation of a railway transport market."
"Because what we are talking about, ladies and gentlemen, is not simply achieving fifteen juxtaposed national railway systems, but carrying out integration by means of a joint shared network throughout the length and breadth of Europe which will specifically allow the railway to function better."
"As has already been pointed out by the two rapporteurs - and also Mr Rack when he referred to the number of letters that he had received from different voters - although this involves some very technical issues, at the end of the day it is to a large extent a political issue."
"In this respect, it inspires passionate sentiments, as has been pointed out and as we have just heard a moment ago."
"I would like to say that what is clear to most of us is that things cannot continue as they are: with closed public systems, which are national, confined within national borders, which are leading to a situation where the railway, day after day, is losing its share of the market in goods transport and in the transportation of persons as well, with the exception of a very specific form of transport, that is, high speed trains and suburban trains."
"In this respect, we must make a change, we must propose solutions which will improve the quality of the service, because that is the important thing for consumers and users."
"We believe that, if our first aim is to create a situation where a train can reasonably travel from Hamburg to Lisbon, the first thing we have to do is to see to it that that train can belong to a German company, a French company, a Spanish company, a Portuguese company etc. These may be public or private, nobody is questioning that, but it is obvious that, if we integrate the network, this automatically leads to an opening up of our market."
"So let us forget dogma, examples of which I have heard here tonight."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to tell the two rapporteurs that I like their amendments very much."
"However, having said this, I will not be able to accept many of them, although I would have loved to have done so."
"I am going to tell you why, because I am one of those people who believe that the perfect is the enemy of the good, and that it is better to make progress than to reach an impasse."
"To accept the amendments of both Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda, the vast majority of which correspond much more to the Commission' s initial proposal and to my own opinions on the whole, would mean disregarding a compromise which was reached with great difficulty in the Council, as you know, after long arguments, after long periods of impasse and stalemate on this issue, which kept us talking into the early hours of the morning."
"I would therefore like to say that there is a margin, because Parliament is not being ignored - Parliament must participate in the creation of these directives - but there exists a fundamental compromise with the Council which I, of course, cannot disregard and you must understand this."
"That would be counterproductive in terms of what both you and I want to see, which is the promotion of improvements in the railways."
"I would like to say that next year I am prepared to present an additional step, a different initiative, which may be accepted or rejected, both by the Council or by Parliament, when the time comes, and modified in its various fields, and which will also deal with certain aspects, at least with regard to the transportation of persons or, possibly, the transport of goods internally within the different countries, but which will be separate from the current package, on which we have reached a fundamental compromise - I insist - with the Council."
"Before thanking the two rapporteurs on their work once again, which I know has been very complex - I fully appreciate this - but which I believe has been very important, and before commenting on all the amendments one by one, I would ask the rapporteurs and Parliament as a whole for a degree of flexibility, so that in the end we may achieve a conciliation - since I fear that we will have to go to conciliation, the way things are going - which will allow us to move forward with this package which has a key role to play in the future of the railway."
"Turning specifically to each of the reports, after these general comments, and perhaps in order to clarify and not to prolong this debate any further, I would like to refer to amendments relating to the Directive amending Directive 91/440/EEC, whose rapporteur is Mr Jarzembowski. We could accept Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21 and 24."
"On the other hand, I must reject - although I insist that I agree fully with many of them, but cannot accept them - Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26 and 27."
"Amendments Nos 6, 8, 9 and 11, which propose the separation of the operators of infrastructures from the providers of services, clarify the text enormously."
"I also consider it important to remove Article 6(4), which I believe could be a source of misunderstandings and, therefore, I particularly support Amendment No 8 and the corresponding corrections to the wording."
"As for the directives which are the subject of Mr Swoboda' s report, with regard to Directive 95/18/EC, we cannot accept Amendment No 1, since Article 12 serves as a reminder that, as well as European legislation, there are national rules which must be respected - there is an element of national regulation which in no way disappears as a result of this regulation - and, nevertheless, we do accept Amendment No 24."
"With regard to Directive 95/19/EC, there are key questions such as, for example - and Mr Swoboda and Mr Ortuondo have mentioned this - the issue of the establishment of tariffs on marginal costs or on total costs, in one case seeing it as a transitional period, in another, as a key element."
"I would like to say that, although I would perhaps have preferred other proposals, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 and 20; but we cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 21, 22 and 23."
"Mr President, I would once again like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work and ask for flexibility, from them and from Parliament, so that in the end we may achieve a result, which must also be supplemented by the other directive, which involves the interoperability of the systems themselves, which would be a great step forward."
"There are perhaps some who want more, and others who want a little less, but I am sure that reality will prove us right."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Recognition of professional qualifications"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0174/00) by Mr Wieland, on behalf of the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow members, this report deals with a very complex issue."
"One of the proposed amendments relates to considerations which, basically, deal prosaically with a matter of general concern to the House - if the large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is anything to go by -, namely the fact that the public seeking legal advice in the European Union is still not being provided with comprehensive legal texts as and when they are needed; and not just the public seeking legal advice, the specialist public or trained legal practitioners."
"One proposed amendment therefore calls in particular for the Commission to promptly provide suitably worded texts reflecting the latest developments in the legal world."
"What we are talking about here is, as it were, a ceterum censeo, which needs to be the subject of debate here in the House for all directives."
"Secondly, it is an issue which needs to be taken out of brackets, as it were."
"A derogation for Italian pharmacists has been extended although, contrary to the common position, the Committee on Legal Affairs proposes that a cut-off date be attached to the derogation."
"Anyone who began studying before October 1990 will be protected under this directive but must expect to complete their studies within a reasonable period of time."
"In addition to these general rules, we have also proposed amendments to the directives which apply to doctors."
"Doctors are a sensitive issue, human health is a very sensitive issue."
"If I have a car accident, I can quantify and repair the damage."
"I know of no-one from my law practice who, having received compensation for physical injury, would not gladly give the money back in return for restored health, which is why this issue requires special attention."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs therefore sets great store by the following conclusion: first, that specialists should also keep up with general practice while training as specialists."
"Differential diagnostics continue to change, which is why specialist training must also include general practice."
"Secondly: we are calling, by a large majority, for specialist training to be increased from at least two to at least three years in order to take account of a broad trend within the European Union."
"It is time for improvements here."
"Thirdly: the Committee on Legal Affairs is calling for greater focus on continuing training."
"We know and admit that this subject was not quite so urgent at first reading but there are now problems here for procedural reasons."
"An exception is made when Parliament is re-elected between the first and second readings."
"That applies here, which is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has introduced the concept of continuing training as one of the mainstays of this House and as one of the mainstays of the European Union."
"We believe that lifelong learning is not just the stuff of soap-box speeches; it should be standard and patients should be able to expect their doctors to complete further training, which is why Amendments Nos 1 to 11 are broadly supported by the committee and will surely be broadly supported by the House tomorrow."
"I should like to address one more point."
"Two other amendments have been proposed concerning Irish architects."
"The PPE-DE group - my group - intends to withdraw its amendment here."
"I would recommend that the House also reject the amendment along these lines proposed by the UEN."
"This is a national problem and must be solved at national level; it cannot, in any case, be solved at European level."
"If we introduce regulations here then others who are even less entitled to do so will surely table similar requests."
"The single market is one of the great achievements of the European Community."
"To have turned the distinct and fragmented markets of the Member States into a single European market is an extraordinary and revolutionary change."
"While it is true that the process has not yet been completed, it has been set on an irrevocable course."
"The mechanics needed to achieve this change are very extensive, as can be seen from even the most cursory examination of Lord Cockfield's 1992 programme, one of the most revolutionary, yet on the face of it unexciting programmes of the post-war world."
"Within that framework there is clearly a choice of instruments for putting the single market in place which can be described as the choice between harmonization and mutual recognition."
"Of these, harmonization is more seductive for the gung-ho politician who wants to be seen doing something, one of the scourges of the contemporary world."
"In my view systems of mutual recognition are more attractive. They are after all more subtle and sophisticated."
"The insensitive imposition of harmonization has caused untold political damage to the European political enterprise and had the single market been based more on mutual recognition and less on harmonization Europe's political condition would be much less febrile than it is today."
"One of the great difficulties in establishing a network of mutual recognition is the complexity of the procedures required to put it into place and to ensure the ongoing compatibility and appropriateness of the mutual recognition network."
"This requires ongoing monitoring and we very much welcome the revision of the series of directives which are the subject of this debate this evening."
"As the rapporteur, Mr Wieland, has pointed out in his excellent report, this directive is primarily about procedures as they relate to the recognition of diplomas."
"Finally, if I might conclude on a parochial note, as a United Kingdom MEP, we especially welcome the extension of the minimum length for specific training in general medical practice for doctors from two to three years."
"Secondly, we welcome the stipulation that Member States are to examine the qualifications already recognised in one Member State which have been obtained in a third country."
"Finally, and more generally, I would like to reiterate the rapporteur's general conclusion that this is all far too difficult and complicated for anyone other than an expert or a lawyer and every effort must be made to simplify the law and make it more user-friendly so that the single market is understood by all our citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anyone who takes Europe seriously wants to provide a good future for young people in the European Union."
"This includes, most importantly, ensuring that young people can develop their skills and talent in any place of their choice in any country in the Union, irrespective of where they are from and where they trained."
"Anyone who has learned something at one end of the Union should be able to pursue his or her career in a country in the middle or at the other end of the Union."
"The European Parliament takes this aspect of the future of young people very seriously, which is why we keep pressing to have equivalent qualifications recognised in all Member States."
"We want to ensure that there are no bureaucratic hurdles to hamper citizens' rights of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment."
"But we also want to guarantee high training standards; high standards guarantee progress and are in the interests of all our citizens."
"Thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur, Mr Wieland, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has had no trouble highlighting a few important points in the directive before us today."
"I hope that plenary shares its views and will vote in favour by a large majority."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists will, in all events, be voting in favour of all, I repeat all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"It is most important both to me personally and to my group that the need for lifelong learning has been highlighted, thereby ensuring that doctors, who are the focus of this directive, have a high standard of future-orientated professional qualifications."
"The need for professional qualifications acquired in individual Member States to be seen as equivalent also cut clear across the political divide."
"That is as important for patients and, in the final analysis, for all citizens, as it is for the medical profession itself."
"For this reason alone, it is important for the Council to follow the European Parliament's lead and not to take refuge in the conciliation procedure, which may allow it to gain time, but not recognition."
"Thank you for listening."
"Mr President, my task is also on behalf of my group, to welcome Amendments Nos 1 to 11 and the spirit in which they were moved by my friend, Mr Wieland."
"These are important points although they are not controversial among us."
"We welcome in particular the extension of training for general practitioners to three years, together with the amendment originally moved by Mrs Gebhardt for lifelong learning for general practitioners."
"This is extremely important."
"The medical associations have been pressing us upon this point and I fully agree with them."
"It is also important as a purely linguistic matter to make sure that gleichwertig is translated as ""equivalent"" and its equivalent words in other European languages."
"I conclude by taking up the point that nothing is more important than that the laws of the European Union should be understandable to its citizens."
"Without that our Community and our Union lack the clarity of purpose which will make them not merely acceptable to, but embraced by, the citizens."
"Therefore all projects of consolidation of law that tend to making the law more readily understood by the citizen and its purposes more lucid to her or him are projects to which we should give our greatest support."
"I am very happy to support this report."
"I once again congratulate my friend, Mr Wieland, on the spirit in which he moved it."
"Mr President, after years of confusion, it is time to clarify the system for recognising professional qualifications and diplomas, precisely in order to provide the European citizens with clear, transparent, and, most importantly, universally accessible laws."
"This is clearly a somewhat difficult undertaking for, apart from anything else, there are 14 directives in existence on the subject and each one has been amended several times."
"Moreover, the failures and delays of the Member States in complying with European legislation have all too often been justified by its complexity or by the difficulty of gaining access to information at European level."
"As the rapporteur points out, even lawyers have trouble."
"However, at the end of the day, the only people to pay the price for this situation are the citizens, especially young people who may well have invested time and energy in the certainty of obtaining results and official recognition and feel betrayed by the institutions."
"And the situation is all the more serious if we consider the unemployment levels in Europe."
"I belong to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport which, once again, has not been asked to speak on an issue which not only involves legal questions, but should also be subject to consensus in other respects."
"The complexity which exists in Europe in relation to the recognition of qualifications gives rise to documents such as this, which, despite the efforts of Parliament and the Commission itself, is a real 'collage' ."
"This document is a 'collage' in the sense that, although it tries to remedy situations which are unjust, those people with most power, such as the doctors' 'lobby' , which has been very active, have managed to resolve their situation."
"Many other people, however, have travelled, have acquired academic qualifications, have trained professionally and have still not had their qualifications recognised and therefore have no rights."
"I believe, and in this respect I am sorry to disagree with Mr Wieland, despite the fact that he has done such good work, that this is a very simple problem when looked at from the point of view of Roman law and its notion of the right of individuals."
"All individuals have the right for their studies to be recognised."
"These days we are always talking about mobility. We give grants so that people may have mobility, but then we do not recognise what has been studied with those grants."
"We talk of the Europe of research and a Europe of knowledge and then we do not recognise, out of pure fear or pure vested interests, anything that people do outside of their own countries."
"Therefore, I wish now to ask that we question this directive, so that the recognition of the medical qualifications may be extended to many other qualifications, because it seems to me to be truly unjust that this is not the case, and that a country is unable to pass on what it knows to another country."
"The result is that a lot of knowledge is confined to certain areas, in certain universities and in certain companies."
"If recognition were to be extended, Europe could enjoy the full right to the transfer of knowledge and that would be a real innovation."
"Therefore, as representative of the Culture Committee in this case, I ask that this recognition be extended and that the road be opened to greater recognition of equivalence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I generally welcome any measure or any directive to improve the mutual recognition of professional or academic qualifications."
"Every member who, like me, lives in a border region, knows the problems encountered by citizens who work or wish to establish in a nearby Member State."
"The EU Treaty clearly regulates the freedom of movement and the freedom to establish of people in the EU."
"But the devil is in the detail."
"We now realise that in fact every job description needs to be regulated."
"But people no longer understand this."
"Is this a citizens' Europe?"
"Is this a common market?"
"These are the questions."
"The difficulties are clear from the number of current directives alone - there are ""only"" fourteen on today's subject."
"We must reduce and harmonise the huge administrative costs, including within the Member States, which is why the Commission proposal to simplify the procedure is most welcome."
"Individual job descriptions, training courses and pre-requisites vary enormously within the EU."
"We need to start by finding similarities in training and curricula."
"In the long run, uniform training courses and uniform curricula would be a great help and we must work towards that."
"Until then, the Member States must consider very carefully how and where additional demands and improvements are needed and what sort of subsequent examination then needs to be demanded."
"The deadline provided for by the Commission - which says that a decision on recognition must be made within three months - is an excellent move."
"Procedures for recognising diplomas acquired in third countries must also be simplified."
"We must cut the red tape within the EU, so that our citizens are able to put their skills to good use in every Member State."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening I should simply like to welcome the initiative aimed at simplifying and clarifying the directives relating to the recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Weiland, and point out that I agree with what Evelyne Gebhardt said before me."
"As an MEP from a border region I am frequently questioned by students that have come up against a system that was implemented in 1989 and 1992, and I am not exaggerating when I say that urgent changes are needed as current mechanisms are far from transparent."
"Too many students come up against brick walls in their attempt to have their qualifications validated by the authorities in the various Member States."
"All too often they are unjustly denied recognition, which places them in an intolerable position."
"As far as principles are concerned, this is a violation of the right to the freedom of movement and, from a more human point of view, it creates an often devastating situation for students who have sought to better their qualifications but then cannot find a relevant job at the end of it."
"The cost of the validation process also warrants discussion."
"I am personally therefore very pleased to see that measures are finally being taken to apply the principles of free movement in practical terms."
"More specifically, the proposal for a directive contains some interesting provisions with regard to clarification."
"It provides that the host Member State must take account of all of the experience a person has gained since completing the qualification and can no longer demand countervailing measures."
"We clearly could have taken things a stage further, as will undoubtedly be inevitable for other jobs, and I hope that progress can be achieved with the assistance of a Council that is far less cautious in future."
"We shall no doubt discuss this issue again, but I hope that this evening' s debate will be welcomed as a step forward in the issue."
"Mr President, may I start by thanking the members of your House for the interest they have shown in the proposal and for the work carried out by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and Mr Wieland, in particular?"
"A number of amendments proposed by Parliament aim to further improve the text of the Council' s common position by illuminating certain points that could otherwise be open to different interpretations."
"This is the case for Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6 and 11, amendments which the Commission welcomes."
"Moreover, the Commission has taken note of the requests made in Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to codify the directive on ""recognition of professional qualifications"" and to re-examine the problem of recognition of formal qualifications acquired in third countries."
"In principle, the Commission does not object to these requests, but I would remind you once again that these requests do not belong in the preamble to the directive, especially since they are completely unrelated to the content of the directive."
"Their approval would contravene the rules governing technical legislation and the interinstitutional agreement that exists in this context."
"Regarding medical training, which forms the subject of Amendments Nos 3 and 7 to 10, the Commission shares Parliament' s view that on the one hand, this is a matter of great importance which requires further attention but on the other hand, these amendments only contain a few isolated proposals which require a more general analysis before they can be examined and approved."
"Community legislation cannot be altered without a truly global analysis of the role of the GP, the role of the specialist doctor and the respective significance of basic training, specialist training and continuing training."
"This is why the Commission believes that it is far too early to adopt Amendments Nos 3 and 7 to 10."
"Moreover, it is said that these amendments will considerably delay the final adoption of the proposal, which would not just be terribly unfortunate, it would also be out of all proportion to the many benefits which we stand to gain from this draft directive."
"Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are, in fact, not new."
"They contain the amendment already adopted at first reading, which was intended to regulate the situation of certain architects from Ireland."
"The Council and Commission have already explained why this amendment cannot be adopted, namely because this issue is a purely internal affair."
"This concludes my response."
"I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to expand on this matter."
"Commissioner, allow me to thank you for being both brief and to the point."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
". (EL) Mr President, I see from the Minutes that the question and answer exchange during question time with Minister Moscovici has been wrongly recorded."
"The Minutes state, on page 14, in the Greek version at least: ""Question 16 by Mr Ìarinos: Violations of Cypriot airspace by Turkish fighter-planes."
"Mr Moscovici replied to the question and to Mr Marino's supplementary question and Mr Zacharakis then intervened"" ."
"I should like to point out that in the morning the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, gave the impression, by appearing here in person and from what he said in his speech, that under the French presidency there would be closer, more systematic cooperation between the European Parliament and the presidency; however, in the afternoon, the first minister of the presidency to appear and work with us, the former MEP Mr Moscovici, did exactly the opposite."
"Apart from the fact that he was curt with us, he gave I think almost all my fellow members more or less one-word replies or claimed that he had replied, although he did indeed reply to the written question which I had submitted."
"But when I then submitted a second question as a result of yesterday morning's debate on the incursion of the Turkish occupying army into another part of Cyprus, instead of replying on the issue which I had put to him, he said ""I have already replied"" ."
"Mr Zacharakis then intervened with two questions and Mr Moscovici barely bothered to stand up and did not bother to reply."
"I should like to ask, first, if a minister or commissioner questioned here is able not only to refuse to reply but to do so in a completely disdainful manner and if we are supposed to take ""I have already replied"" as an answer, when they have not done so."
"The same happened to other fellow members who, if they are present here, can confirm this."
"I should like a reply on this and I should like the Minutes to be corrected."
"Mr Marinos, we have taken note of your view here and it will also be included in the Minutes."
"It is true that it would be opportune to review the Question Time procedures from time to time."
"I shall look into this."
"I too should like to request that the Minutes be corrected because, as they stand, they are not an accurate record of what happened during the sitting."
"I should like the Minutes to record that I submitted two specific questions to Mr Moscovici and that he did not reply."
"Of course, following on from what Mr Ìarinos said and over and above the disdainful manner adopted by Mr Moscovici, who failed to honour traditional French courtesy, even though Parliament is sitting on French territory, what I note and conclude from his silence, and it would be a good idea to bring this to the attention of the Greek Government, is that the French Government secretly intends to oppose the accession of Cyprus to the European Union and to promote the accession of Turkey, even if it does violate human rights and the basic principles of international law."
"Mr Zacharakis, we will not be holding the political debate on this issue here."
"Mr Moscovici took the floor yesterday and we will check whether this was included correctly in the Minutes."
"Mr President, I wish to raise once again the point I raised on Monday and again yesterday with regard to Mr Helmer's comments in this House."
"Can I say that I am surprised that on two occasions now I have asked Mr Helmer to comment on the item about the Queen of the United Kingdom supporting the euro, and so far he has failed to do."
"Can I say to this House that I understand this must be the first time that Mr Helmer has been speechless."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, according to our information, Mrs Stauner withdrew the explanatory statement in the relevant committee yesterday, but despite that, it has been distributed today."
"I would just like to ask you, Mr President, to establish if this statement was withdrawn by the rapporteur or not."
"If it was, then it should not be distributed as an official document."
"I shall enquire at the services into the exact course of events."
"The fact of the matter is that yesterday evening, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I withdrew this explanatory statement."
"I asked the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control to draft a letter to that effect."
"Because we were sitting in the evening, that was no longer possible."
"I assume that if I go to my office now, I will find the letter there and can sign it so that we can proceed accordingly."
"Mr President, I wanted to bring up an issue which should be of great concern to this Parliament, and in particular to Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"A serious abuse of European law and the Statute of the European Investment Bank is taking place in my own country."
"Member States are not authorised under EC law to propose or nominate their own nationals directly to the Board of Governors for the position of Vice-President of the EIB, and to do so is a clear violation of the Statute of the European Investment Bank."
"The task of making the nominations and appointment is reserved exclusively to a Board of Directors of the Bank, which is a quite separate body."
"The situation in Ireland is quite contrary to this principle."
"The Irish government have, in contravention of the law, nominated a person who not only has no experience of economic or financial affairs, but is furthermore a disgraced supreme court judge who was forced to resign before he was impeached by the Irish parliament."
"This issue is now before the courts in Ireland."
"This is an extremely important matter for this Parliament, which is concerned because the European Union provides Guarantee Funds to the EIB."
"Parliament must take notice of this, because if we allow Member States to contravene the law in this way it has serious implications for the European Union as a whole."
"I would ask the President if he could instruct the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control to look into this issue, because it should be dealt with very quickly."
"It could set a very bad precedent for the future for other Member States and for nominations to this body."
"Mrs McKenna, I agree that it would be beneficial if you, should you so wish, instructed the relevant Committee."
"Mr President, I would like to put a question to Parliament."
"Yesterday, further hundreds of acres of forest were destroyed by fire in Italy, endangering the outskirts of Rome and the lives of European citizens as well."
"A similar incident occurred a few days ago in France, on the Italian border."
"These acts of arson, which endanger and destroy hundreds upon hundreds of acres of European forest, occur frequently during the summer in the Mediterranean European countries, with harmful repercussions for the economy and the tourist industry."
"It is vital that Parliament intervenes, but a decisive intervention on the part of the Commission and the Council is also essential when we consider that the possibility of setting up a European civil protection service was even discussed at the Feira Council."
"These fires represent a considerable hazard, damaging the forest stand and the environment throughout the European Union, but, most importantly, the economic effect on our endeavours to boost employment in the tourism industry in all the countries of the Mediterranean area will be extremely serious."
"Mr Tajani, these are indeed recurring themes unfortunately, and are a constant concern within Parliament. They are very sad happenings indeed."
"ECB annual report"
"The next item is the report by Mr Radwan (A5-0169/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 1999 Annual Report of the European Central Bank [C5-0195/2000 - 2000/2118(COS)]."
"Mr President, one and a half years have passed since the euro came into existence and the ECB took over the responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy."
"During this period the euro system, that is the 11 national central banks and the ECB, had to prove its ability to implement the conceptual framework that had been thoroughly prepared during the previous years."
"It has also had to prove its ability to achieve the goals conferred upon it by the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"Looking back, these challenges have been met from both a policy and an operational point of view."
"Therefore I have great pleasure today in presenting the Second Annual Report of the ECB."
"It gives an account of the activities of the euro system during 1999 and at the beginning of this year."
"I consider today's presentation to be an important demonstration of the ECB's accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament, supplementing the exchanges of views held in your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in which I participate on a quarterly basis."
"In addition to this regular dialogue, other members of the Executive Board of the ECB have attended committee meetings on several occasions in order to present a report drawn up under the responsibility of the ECB and to participate in exchanges of views on various issues."
"In view of the large range of topics included in the Annual Report it will clearly be impossible to address all of them at our meeting today."
"Therefore I shall concentrate on some of the most pertinent issues, which have also been raised in the resolution drafted by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Reviewing the first year of the existence of the single currency, I should like to start by reporting that the primary objective of the ECB, that is the maintenance of price stability, has been achieved."
"Indeed, with consumer prices in the euro area increasing by just 1.1% in 1999, inflation has reached one of the lowest levels in the past 50 years."
"In line with its mandate, the ECB remains vigilant regarding risks to price stability, as evidenced by its monetary policy decisions in order to nip inflationary pressures in the bud before they materialise rather than to react once price stability is already in jeopardy."
"The euro system will continue to pursue this forward-looking strategy in order to maintain an environment of stable prices, which is also conducive to sustained economic growth and job creation in the euro area."
"I share the analysis of your motion for a resolution that governments should take advantage of the favourable economic environment in order to step up the efforts directed towards consolidating budgets and reducing public debt and go beyond the objectives laid down in the stability programmes."
"At the same time, structural reforms in the labour product and capital markets should be pursued vigorously."
"The comprehensive implementation of this policy agenda will contribute to subduing inflationary pressures and thereby support the ECB in accomplishing its tasks."
"In your motion for a resolution, you also briefly address the potential implications of a 'new economy' ."
"I should therefore like to comment on the possible emergence of a new economy in the euro area."
"Let me start by noting that there are various definitions of the new economy."
"In my view, the most useful definition is that which characterises the new economy as a phenomenon which increases the growth rate of productivity over an extended period of time."
"There is some evidence, although this is not uncontroversial, that a new economy is emerging in the United States."
"By contrast, it is difficult as yet to find clear evidence of a new economy in the euro area."
"Of course, there is a need to monitor developments further, with the emphasis on identifying new economic trends and potential structural breaks in traditional economic relationships as early as possible."
"In any case it is important to stress that for the euro area the achievement of more flexible markets is a prerequisite if the potential gains from new technologies are to be realised in the form of substantially higher productivity growth."
"We recognise that a crucial feature of the potential emergence of a new economy is increased uncertainty, particularly as regards the evolution of the production potential and the reliability of indicators which are derived from it, such as estimates of the output gap."
"In this respect, the euro systems monetary policy framework is well equipped to cope with such uncertainties."
"It provides the flexibility necessary to address changes in the economic structure with the aim of maintaining price stability over the medium term."
"By relying on two pillars, the ECB strategy explicitly acknowledges uncertainty regarding the structure of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy within the economy."
"In the context of this discussion, some observers have urged the ECB to keep interest rates low in view of the new economy."
"In response, let me emphasise the following point: the new economy is primarily a supply side story."
"An inappropriately lax monetary policy would not create better conditions for the emergence of a new economy."
"On the contrary, by jeopardising the maintenance of price stability, such a policy could seriously endanger the current ability of the ECB."
"It would thereby undermine confidence, raise risk premia in interest rates and damage the prospects for economic growth and job creation."
"It is for precisely this reason that the ECB will, in line with its mandate, continue to preserve price stability in the euro area."
"This ensures that monetary policy makes its full contribution to overall economic welfare while also providing an environment in which the new economy, should one emerge, will be able to flourish."
"I should now like to turn to another issue, which has been frequently discussed within the framework of our regular dialogue, namely the issue of transparency."
"I have already referred to the regular dialogue between European Parliament and the ECB, the transcripts of which are published on the websites of our institutions."
"Moreover, at the press conferences held after the first meeting of the governing council every month, I present the ECB's assessment of the economic environment underpinning our monetary policy decisions."
"You will also be aware of the broad variety of ECB publications, in particular our monthly bulletin, and numerous press releases issued and speeches made by members of the executive board of the ECB."
"These are also as a rule made available to the public via the ECB's website."
"This wide range of communication tools, in which the arguments both for and against a decision are presented, is in substance similar to summary minutes."
"It should also be borne in mind that through regular press conferences and the rapid publication of the transcripts of the questions and answers on the ECB website detailed information about the governing council's reasoning is made available very shortly after the meetings."
"We therefore avoid the delays that are inherent in the publication of all forms of official minutes."
"We always take our decisions from a euro area-wide perspective."
"This is fundamental to the conduct of a truly single monetary policy."
"The publication of ECB reports on the economic developments of individual euro area Member States, as is suggested in your motion for a resolution, has to be considered against this background."
"We clearly do not want to blur the ECB's focus on the euro area as a whole."
"The resolution also calls for the publication of macroeconomic forecasts by the ECB."
"Let me reassure you that preparations for publication continue in earnest."
"I still envisage that publication of forecasts will commence towards the end of 2000, in line with the statement I made last September at the European Parliament's plenary session on the previous ECB annual report."
"I should like, however, to sound a note of caution."
"Forecasts are only one input into the decisions of the governing council."
"Forecast publication by the ECB should not be viewed as a panacea which will meet all the communication challenges faced by the ECB as a new institution in a testing multilingual and multinational environment."
"Forecasts themselves have important shortcomings."
"For example they are surrounded by considerable uncertainty and they may quickly become outdated if the external environment changes."
"We are aware of these shortcomings."
"Therefore, as is made clear in the ECB's monetary policy strategy, monetary policy decisions cannot be made only on the basis of a central inflation forecast."
"It is the comprehensive analysis of the monetary and macroeconomic situation and the economic disturbances affecting the euro area economy which is the relevant input to forward-looking policy decisions."
"The ECB's approach to communication has always placed a premium on honesty."
"To continue in this vein it is my view that we must publish forecasts in a manner which accurately reflects their limited role in policy decisions and their inherent uncertainties."
"Any other approach would not be transparent and would therefore be potentially misleading."
"I now turn to a related issue, namely the publication of the ECB's economic and econometric models."
"I should make it clear that the ECB does not rely on a single econometric model but uses an extensive set of models."
"The results obtained from the models are critically evaluated, using expert judgement."
"Policy-makers use analysis undertaken using models developed by the ECB staff, in some cases with input from staff of national central banks, as one input among others into their policy assessments and decisions."
"The ECB has established a working paper series where technical economic research, produced inter alia under the responsibility of ECB staff, can be reviewed and assessed by the public and external professional experts."
"The respective authors are responsible for the content of these papers."
"Therefore they do not necessarily reflect the view of the ECB or of the Eurosystem."
"Through this and other channels there is a professional dialogue and exchange of views between ECB staff and many outside experts, which is of mutual benefit."
"Several econometric models have already been published in the working paper series of the ECB."
"For example, an econometric study of the demand for M3 in the euro area, conducted by ECB staff, was published in September 1999."
"Other models will be published in the near future."
"An area-wide model used at the ECB, which models the aggregate behaviour of the euro area economy, will be published in this working paper series by ECB staff, probably at the end of this year or early next year."
"I should now like to turn to the contribution of the ESCB, the European System of Central Banks, to the maintenance of financial stability and to prudential supervision."
"In this regard I should like to mention the Banking Supervision Committee which is promoting cooperation between the ECB, the national central banks and the supervisory authorities of the 15 Member States."
"The main focus of activity of the Banking Supervision Committee is the analysis of structural developments and the monitoring of potential vulnerabilities in the banking sector."
"The Banking Supervision Committee also provides the forum for the exchange of relevant information between the euro system and the supervisory authorities."
"Finally, this committee may also act as a forum for supervisory cooperation not related to the tasks of the Eurosystem."
"The need for multilateral cooperation amongst banking supervisors has increased since the establishment of Economic and Monetary Union, for two reasons."
"Firstly, EMU has introduced an unprecedented geographical separation between the area of jurisdiction of monetary policy and that of prudential supervision."
"Secondly, the introduction of the euro itself has fostered further integration of the banking and financial sector."
"Against this background I perceive the Banking Supervision Committee as the main forum in which multilateral cooperation amongst banking supervisors can be enhanced."
"Regarding the issue of cross-border retail payments, which has been raised by the European Parliament on various occasions, I recall that in September 1999 the ECB published a report entitled Improving Retail Cross-border Payment Systems - the Eurosystem's View."
"The report called on the banking sector to provide substantially improved services by 2002."
"Since the publication of that report the banking sector has subscribed to the Eurosystem's objectives in principle."
"It has begun to cooperate closely with the Eurosystem in order to identify the practical impediments to the achievement of these objectives and in order to investigate and, where possible, agree on effective solutions."
"I fully share the European Parliament's concern that very little progress has been visible to customers."
"However, there are strong indications that banks are making considerable efforts to prepare the ground for a more efficient handling of cross-border credit transfers."
"In particular, progress is under way in the areas of standardisation and simplification of the balance of payments reporting requirements."
"The ECB will prepare a further progress report by this autumn in which it will update its assessment."
"The Eurosystem would prefer to maintain its present stance of cooperation but will if necessary step up the pressure on the banking sector."
"However, it would be unrealistic to expect the service level for cross-border payments to reach that of domestic payments in all respects by 2002."
"I emphasise again that the introduction of the euro has indeed been a milestone in the ongoing process of European integration."
"The ECB, as the guardian of the single currency, will continue to pursue its stability-oriented monetary policy in order to fulfil its mandate and to deliver the policy results that European citizens rightly expect."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, the 1999 report before us from the ECB is both the first ECB report for a full year and also the first report since the introduction of the euro."
"As has already been mentioned, the stage we are now at is that the euro has already been introduced, but the public will only have the bank notes in their hands on 1 January 2002."
"Mr Karas will be dealing with that point in detail later on."
"However, it is important for us to win the confidence of the public by the time the euro notes are introduced."
"The increase in consumer prices over the last year of just over 1%, that is well within the ECB target of 2%, provides a good foundation for this."
"Mr Duisenberg, I would like to sincerely congratulate both the ECB and you personally on that."
"Because of your stability-oriented policy, the countries in the euro area can boast a historically low level of price inflation."
"If the policies of the ECB are to be successful, it must be politically independent."
"This does not mean that there is no accountability, but rather that a high level of information and transparency is required."
"I would like to sound a positive note by mentioning the European Central Bank' s regular reports to Parliament' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as well as the information published on the Internet, which you have already been referred to."
"But a young institution like the ECB has to win the confidence not only of the financial markets but also of the public."
"I therefore very much welcomed the fact that you addressed the public direct in May, and I think that should happen more regularly."
"The public is being flooded with information about the euro and I think that the information is not always eye-catching and informative."
"We need to counter that trend here today."
"The policy needs to be presented so it can be easily understood, and that would help to win people over to the euro."
"At the same time, a low inflation rate is a policy for the economically disadvantaged in our society."
"That is why it is important for the ECB to tailor its decisions to primary objectives."
"For example, as I see it, we cannot accept an inflation rate of over 3.3% simply because it makes it easier to achieve secondary objectives such as economic growth and employment policy."
"Those who are disadvantaged suffer particularly from creeping inflation, which I therefore regard as being socially unacceptable."
"The areas of economic growth and employment are primarily a matter for the Member States."
"This is exactly the reason for part of the weak external value of the euro."
"We need to make greater progress with reforms such as flexible labour markets, restructuring social security systems and liberalising financial markets if we are also to make the euro area more attractive as a financial centre and as a centre for investment."
"Mere declarations that we want to become number one in the world economy, like the one made at the Lisbon Summit, are not enough."
"The Member States have got to take action themselves here."
"That is why the objective of debt reduction and balanced budgets needs to be achieved as quickly as possible."
"But it is also important for the European Central Bank not to completely forget about the external value of the euro."
"On the one hand there is a risk of higher prices, of importing inflation, which is at present being aggravated by higher oil prices of course."
"On the other hand, and this brings me back to the subject of 'information and the citizen' , many people see the external value of the euro as an indicator of how stable it is."
"With this in mind we must make sure that this factor alone, external value, does not weaken confidence in the euro."
"I accordingly welcome the most recent correction in interest rates, that is the increase by 50 base points, as a step towards a medium-term monetary policy with a view to creating confidence and calm both in the financial markets and amongst the public."
"Another sign in the eyes of the public that the euro is a good thing would be a marked reduction in charges for cross-border payment transactions, which you have already mentioned."
"In this case I believe it is important for the banks to set their sights far higher and make more rapid progress."
"For banks simply to refer to the standardisation of systems is not enough here."
"The introduction of the euro did not come overnight and it was not a surprise."
"I myself come from the world of information and communications technology."
"I know that if you put a subject right at the top of your agenda and really put some pressure on, you can get something done more quickly."
"I therefore call on you to get the European Central Bank to add to this pressure, so that our banks make greater efforts in this field."
"Lastly, I would like to talk about the imminent eastward enlargement of the European Union."
"First, I would like to make it clear that I am not talking about a treaty amendment, as was now and again suggested during the debate."
"What I have in mind is to examine the process ahead of us."
"No one is disputing that there is a three-stage process, from EU membership, to participation in the exchange-rate mechanism, and finally to full membership."
"However, a minimum level of economic convergence is needed to achieve this, and also to create a level playing field for the applicant countries and the present EU Member States."
"It is important not only to observe the criteria, but also to allow some leeway with regard to this compliance with the criteria."
"We cannot allow decisions that we have made in the past to keep tying our hands when it comes to the present and future process, over a period of five to ten years."
"We must maintain this process - this scope for interpretation."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank all my colleagues and the committee secretariat very sincerely for their support with this report."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Radwan, on the excellent report he has presented here."
"And I would like to thank you, Mr Duisenberg, very sincerely for your report as President of the European Central Bank."
"The thing that has particularly agitated the public during the first 18 months of the euro' s existence has been the exchange rate against the dollar."
"The ECB itself eventually had to pay some attention to this question, because there started to be a risk that imported inflation would become a reality here in Europe."
"What caused this initial drop in the exchange rate?"
"We have to recognise that the international financial markets noticed that we in Europe have been slow in tackling some of the structural reforms needed."
"Secondly, the euro is a new currency."
"A new currency has to win the confidence that other currencies already enjoy."
"Thirdly, there was a not inconsiderable gap between our interest rates and those in the United States, which meant that investors felt more inclined to invest in the United States than in Europe."
"It also has to be recognised that the ECB' s policy has very consistently been different from that of the US Federal Reserve Bank."
"In this case, the guidelines Mr Duisenberg has been operating under are not the same as Mr Greenspan' s."
"For example, in the United States the inflation rate has topped 3% in recent months, without the Federal Reserve Bank taking any special countermeasures."
"Over here, the upper limit is set at 2%, and for very good reasons."
"I would like to congratulate you, Mr Duisenberg, on having pursued a very consistent stability policy, and on having given a very clear signal when the ECB made its most recent decision on interest rates."
"You spoke just now about new technology, about the new economy."
"The objective of the European Central Bank will remain the same, even with the new economy, and that is to maintain price stability."
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, President Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to deal swiftly with various questions in relation to the work of the European Central Bank."
"First, the 1999 annual report."
"I think we need to acknowledge that the Central Bank did a good job in 1999: inflation remained very low, providing the euro with a high degree of stability, and our citizens' purchasing power remained the same."
"We should also, I think, congratulate President Duisenberg and his team for the smooth introduction of the euro as bank money."
"I think that was an achievement which deserves to be highlighted."
"As far as the current year is concerned, the figures are not quite as pleasing."
"Inflation has risen again, driven by the increase in oil prices."
"The Central Bank has responded by tightening credit terms, not that rates are currently overly high in Europe."
"Nonetheless, the Central Bank's strategy has not always been completely clear or highly legible."
"In fact, there have been a lot of copycat decisions between the European Central Bank and its big sister, the Federal Reserve in the United States."
"When the Federal Reserve hikes its base rate by 25 points, the European Central Bank follows suit; when the Federal Reserve adds 50 points, the Central Bank does likewise a few weeks later."
"But the situation in the United States is quite different from the situation in Europe and sometimes I get the impression that the European Central Bank is giving in slightly to market expectations and appeasing the markets with increases of 25 or 50 points and I worry somewhat when I read reports by financial analysts predicting increases of over 100 points by the end of the year."
"Inflation is there, sure enough, Mr Duisenberg!"
"But I note that it is falling and I do not therefore think that waiting for the markets is the right approach."
"You are there, Mr Duisenberg, to serve the entire European economy, not to serve the financial markets, and I must say that the European Central Bank has been most discreet so far on the subject of the blatant irrationality and permanent casino atmosphere of the financial markets."
"I have just listened to a statement by Mr Issing, criticising the sheep-like behaviour of the financial markets, especially in connection with the relative weakness of the euro."
"I think that this weakness is, indeed, completely relative and that we should not read too much into these fluctuations, even if they do relate to our economy."
"I hope to see better coordination between European policies."
"I want a stronger European economy, not in opposition to, but in cooperation with the Monetary Fund, on the understanding that each of them retains its freedom of decision and action."
"Mr President, unfortunately I have run out of time and I would like to have said a great deal more, especially on enlargement."
"Allow me to say just two words on Mr Radwan's comments."
"Every country which is to join the European Union should be a member of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"We want to apply the Treaty, but the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty."
"My final word, Mr President, is this: if I had to write a report for Mr Duisenberg, it would say 'good, but could do better' ."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Duisenberg on a successful year in running euro monetary policy."
"Clearly what matters is internal price stability, and the external value of the euro is of much less significance."
"Indeed that was one of the reasons for creating the euro in the first place: it was precisely to protect the European economy from the volatility of the foreign exchanges to which Mr Goebbels has just referred."
"I am particularly pleased, too, that Mr Duisenberg has reiterated his promise to publish forecasts and econometric models, and I entirely understand his caveats."
"I hope that when he publishes the macroeconometric model he will do so in a form which makes it available and easily usable by outside researchers, perhaps on CD-ROM."
"However, in connection with Parliament's view of last year I would urge Mr Duisenberg to reconsider a formal framework for the publication of summary minutes."
"As he said, much of the debate which happens within the Council is filtering out in the form of discussion within the monthly bulletin, but this is not the same as a regular report with a formal framework in which it is discussed."
"That would help anchor expectations within the market, as well as fulfilling the important accountability mandate of the ECB."
"It is also clearly crucial the ECB should look only at the euro zone as a whole in terms of its inflation and price stability objective."
"It is essential to point out that different growth trends exist within the different national components of the euro zone economy, and that this implies different sustainable wage growth rates over time."
"That is why it is important that there should be an overall discussion of what potential sustainable growth rates of wages are in each of the component parts of the euro zone economy, and why this will actually help deliver low inflation combined with low unemployment."
"Those are the main points I would like to make."
"I would also very much like to back Mr Goebbels' remarks about the importance of enlargement, namely that we should not have two standards - one for us and one for them."
"I very much hope that we will continue to apply the criteria of the Treaty, no more and no less."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not intend to re-open with Mr Duisenberg the debate which we held in committee a while back."
"The Group of the Greens totally disagrees with the policy of raising interest rates, which has been applied since the end of 1999."
"We are as displeased by the second period of management by the Bank, starting in the last quarter of 1999, as we were satisfied with the first, not because the Bank overestimates the importance of variations in exchange rates against the dollar - it does in our view, but that is by the by - but because the debate on exchange rates obviously masks the Central Bank's aversion to growth and its serious underestimation of the potential rate of growth of the European Union."
"Yes, there are difficulties with a rate of growth of 3% but these difficulties imply that there should be more, not less investment and, hence, lower not higher interest rates."
"What I would like to stress today is the scandal that is the second part of paragraph 11 of the Radwan report."
"To dare to say that the French 35-hour law is responsible for the fall in the euro because it has weakened European competitiveness overall is an intellectual lie, pure and simple."
"It was after this law was announced that the Toyota factory - and many others - decided to open in France."
"If the MEPs consider that the Toyota factory does not know what it is doing, that is their right; that these MEPs claim to suggest such absurd rules to national governments and European social policy, frankly, seems to us..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the European Central Bank report under discussion covers 1999, its first year in operation following the start of the third stage of EMU and, for this very reason, the European Parliament's criticism of the European Central Bank's annual report should be even stricter and even more demanding."
"The European Parliament is the only institution in the Community which is entitled to exercise any, albeit ex-post, control over the European Central Bank and its policy."
"From this point of view, the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs does not meet the expectations of the citizens of Europe, in that it fully supports the policy of the European System of Central Banks and, on several counts, is going beyond that policy by calling for even greater liberalisation."
"The claim that the international standing of the euro and its weakness against the dollar are due to delays in making the necessary structural changes at the expense of the job, goods and services markets and to delays in advancing on the public sector of the economy, dismantling employment relations and abolishing the labour, social and insurance rights of workers has caused a public outrage."
"In its quest for much-vaunted monetary stability, which I consider to be its only duty, the policy of the European Central Bank has been highly contradictory; in pursuing a single objective, i.e. to control inflationary pressures, it has swung like a pendulum from one extreme to the other, with successive reductions and increases in the interest rate which, in the final analysis, have had acutely negative repercussions on growth in productivity and employment."
"The workers paying the price for this seriously negative neo-liberal policy have no confidence in it, nor do they share the European Central Bank's ambition or the support given to its policy by the European Parliament, the other institutions of the European Union and the governments of the Member States."
"The much-vaunted new economy will certainly not serve the interests of the workers."
"In this sense, we oppose both the policy of the Bank and the support given to it by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Radwan for the quality of his report on the first financial year of the Central Bank since the introduction of the euro."
"His efforts are commendable."
"One senses a diffuse anxiety seeping through his report which contrasts happily with the steadfast optimism of the various advocates of the euro, together with reaffirmation - somewhat timid but reaffirmation nonetheless - of a few basic principles, all of which are superfluous."
"Mr Radwan will go down in history for having reminded us that the independence of the Central Bank is not to be equated with accountability but, on the contrary, implies maximum transparency, mainly in order to make up, he should have added, for its lack of legitimacy."
"Alas, Mr Radwan, you see all the symptoms, but you cannot bring yourself to name the genetic disease afflicting the euro and provoking the scepticism of the markets, which have devalued it by 20%, indifference on the part of the economic players, who have yet to adopt it, the distrust of the citizens: in the last survey, 41% of Europeans already thought that the euro was a bad thing for them and, admit it, there were signs of panic among the euro supervisory authorities, 18 months before the planned withdrawal of the national currencies."
"Add to that the increasing hostility of the British and the persistent distrust of the Danes, which I hope to see confirmed on 28 September."
"The initial cause of the punishment currently being inflicted on the European currency stems, of course, from the conditions in which it was born."
"Conceived in haste by France and Germany following German reunification, followed by nine other countries, the so-called single currency was immediately put out for adoption by the political authorities to an independent bank, poor little Cosette sent to the Ténardiers in Frankfurt!"
"One can understand why the child is sickly, under the circumstances."
"According to the Cardinal of Retz, in politics, you often end up with the opposite of what you were seeking."
"It is the independence of the ECB, advocated in order to reassure the markets, which is worrying them."
"The Federal Reserve was born when the United States was over a century old and after the American Civil War and it acts not totally, but relatively independently within what I would call a single pool of feelings, i.e. within a single country."
"With no such foundation, the Central Bank is not independent, it is isolated. Its message is doomed to failure."
"It can only speak the language of the markets, what one French journalist calls eurodosh, not the language of the people, as a result of which the euro is merely a currency of loans which has become the toy of the markets instead of being the business of the Europeans."
"Perhaps your euro will rally, Mr Duisenberg, but it will not be thanks to you."
"It will be because the dollar has fallen."
"So, for pity's sake, between now and then, do not out of wounded pride throttle a European economy which has already paid a heavy price in the chase for the euro in terms of growth and employment throughout the 1990s and which does not want to pay a second, equally heavy price in the chase for a strong euro."
"If you do, then do not complain if governments come running back and fight you for your premature independence and illusory sovereignty or, in other words, if Jean Valjean finally comes and takes Cosette away from you."
"Mr President, President of the European Central Bank, Commissioner Solbes, on behalf of the Italian Radicals of the Technical Group of Independent Members, I believe that the objective which the European Central Bank set itself - which is the objective enshrined in the Treaty and in the best economic doctrine, that is to curb inflation - has in actual fact been achieved. This can only be reason to applaud the activity of the Central Bank itself as well."
"However, we cannot allow this result to distract us from the many storm clouds gathering overhead."
"The first issue is public finances: improvement in the relationship between public deficit and GDP, which, in the space of a few years, has fallen to below 2% in the euro area, disguises the fact that, in many countries, in many instances, this result is due purely to favourable interest rates and to the fact that taxation has risen instead of fallen."
"The long-term structural reductions in public spending are of secondary importance and, moreover, the national budgets of many countries remain at around 50%, which is too high a level to control without risk of adding to the deficit in the event of crises or shocks."
"In particular, the question of the hidden debt must be raised urgently - and in this regard the Central Bank could and should make a far greater contribution than it does at the moment. This debt arises from the public pension systems in many countries, particularly but not exclusively in Italy."
"The demagogic generosity of these systems has a very high cost which someone is going to have to pay very soon, and its effects will soon make themselves felt on the stability of the euro."
"There is the problem of transparency in European Central Bank decisions: something has been done about it but not enough, in my opinion, and on this matter I refer to the words of Mr Huhne, with whom I am in complete agreement."
"President Duisenberg stated - and I agree with him - that the problem of the new economy, the late arrival of the new economy in Europe and of the productivity of labour in Europe is not, cannot and must not be treated as an interest rates issue."
"It is a question of structural reforms and must be dealt with as such."
"There is a problem of privatisation and liberalisation in many sectors."
"There are countries such as France - large countries therefore - which have put the brakes on with regard to the liberalisation and privatisation chiefly - but not exclusively - of the telecommunications sector."
"There is the problem of the flexibility of the labour market."
"Mandel, one of the forces behind the euro, when speaking of Europe a few months ago, said that the governments are making the market too rigid."
"Hiring and firing must be liberalised, for the simple reason that controlling dismissals only serves to limit the possibility of hiring new staff."
"Instead of expecting Central Bank policy or taxation policy to resolve some of the problems of the European economy, European policy should resolve the issues it is able to, such as the issue of restructuring and flexibility in the economy and in the labour market, immediately."
"I will end by thanking Mr Radwan for this excellent report and say that I agree with the greater part of its content."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, Mr Solbes, I share the satisfaction Mr Radwan expressed in his report regarding the importance of the objective of maintaining price stability, which the Central Bank achieved by bringing the rate of inflation in the euro area down to minimal levels."
"Furthermore, I share the rapporteur' s satisfaction in noting that the ECB has stood by its commitment to publish information regularly on the financial variables in its possession, the economic forecasts and the econometric models used as the theoretical basis for the monetary policy it has implemented."
"It is important that the principle of transparency is affirmed and it is a good thing that the ECB has set communication standards which could be an excellent point of reference for the activity of the central banks of the individual countries."
"However, let us guard against interpreting the principle expressed in Article 105 of the Treaty too freely, for Article 108 reads: ""When exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, ... or from any other body."""
"The monetary policy is certainly a lever which is capable of determining a country' s economic performance, for better or for worse, but it is for this very reason that we must not give the ECB responsibilities which cannot fall within its remit, either under the Treaty or in the light of the basic rules of economic policy."
"The poor development of the macroeconomic variables in some of the countries of the euro area has been linked, very superficially but incorrectly, to the creation of the single currency: imbalances and unfavourable trends in some countries cannot be blamed upon the euro and still less upon the Central Bank' s monetary policy, but they can be attributed to the absence of an unambiguous economic policy in Euroland and the lack of structural reforms at the level of the individual national systems."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is ten years now since the inception of monetary union."
"Today we are reviewing an annual report based on a successful monetary policy."
"In institutional, organisational and monetary policy terms, the European Central Bank has acted prudently while showing the way forward, even if not everyone would agree with all the decisions made by the ECB."
"However, more could be done to improve the transparency of monetary policy."
"This is not just a question of improving communication, it is also a matter of providing clearer explanations."
"That is why I am pleased, Mr Duisenberg, that you have today promised once again that we will get inflation forecasts and that progress will be made with publishing the econometric models."
"And of course I would still like us to see the summary minutes of meetings, so that we can follow all the arguments."
"The annual report states very clearly that the euro has made its mark at international level and is already the second most important currency in the world."
"The report also clearly emphasises that the European Central Bank has achieved its priority objective of ensuring price stability."
"However, it seems to me that the ECB' s secondary objective is not yet totally clear to everyone."
"After all, the rate of inflation is low and under control despite the increase in oil prices."
"This is very different to the situation prevailing at the time of the oil crisis in the 1970s."
"The ECB must therefore finally make it clear how and subject to what conditions it intends to support the Union' s economic policy and the objectives of achieving economic growth and employment."
"After all, money exists to serve people, and not the other way round."
"For that reason support is needed for the macroeconomic framework, and the ECB has a role to play here."
"As yet, the ECB has still not provided an explanation as to why price stability is more strictly defined in the euro area than in the US, and why it does not provide greater protection for the fledgling European growth process."
"Europe needs a sustained period of high growth if we are to successfully combat unemployment."
"After all, full employment is once again a possibility at last."
"An ECB stability-oriented monetary policy has every chance of giving an impulse to investment and growth, and thus making a real contribution to achieving an appropriate and properly balanced policy mix."
"What contribution can the ECB make, and does it intend to make?"
"Why does it not follow the example set by the US Federal Reserve Bank in supporting the upturn in the economy?"
"Or could it be - and I would like an answer to this - that the European Central Bank is opposed to growth rates of over 3% because it thinks they could jeopardise its stability policy?"
"Mr President, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Radwan for a splendid report."
"Pages 60 and 61 of the ECB' s annual report contain a discussion of the situation in Denmark in 1999."
"It is pointed out that, in 1999, the Danish krone was stable and marginally stronger than the central rate in ERM 2."
"This situation has, unfortunately, changed because there has been pressure on the Danish krone in recent months."
"Speculation against the Danish krone is occurring primarily because Danish opinion polls suggest that there may be a 'no' vote in the forthcoming referendum on 28 September."
"If there is, in fact, a 'no' vote in this referendum - and I very much disagree with my French colleague who has just spoken and who, if I understood him correctly, is hoping for just such a vote - then speculation against the krone may be expected to increase, in which case Denmark will have need of that ECB support in defence of the krone which is provided for in the ERM 2 agreement."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr Duisenberg, to clarify what the limits will be for the Danish ERM 2 agreement and to answer the following questions."
"Firstly, what conditions must Denmark fulfil before the ECB will intervene in support of the krone?"
"Secondly, how much in the way of foreign reserves will the ECB, in practice, spend on buying up kroner in order to support and defend the Danish currency?"
"Thirdly, for how long a period will the ECB be prepared to support the krone?"
"And fourthly and finally, can you tell us whether the ERM 2 agreement is to be in force for an unlimited period of time?"
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the Radwan report is particularly important, because it cannot be read in isolation from the next item about the euro information campaign."
"I am glad that 11 of my 12 amendments were accepted in committee."
"I had three principal aims in mind with those amendments."
"Firstly, to enhance and underscore the independence of the European Central Bank."
"To my mind, this independence also implies freedom from instructions, and this is justified because the ECB has a clear remit, which is to maintain price stability."
"My second aim is to call on the ECB, through this House, to continue to pursue its stability policy so as to ward off the increasing risk of inflation."
"My third aim is to give a signal to all the applicant countries that membership of EMU is conditional not on political concessions, but on meeting the convergence criteria."
"So this report is also important as regards the information campaign, as I have already said, because the media' s overemphasis on the euro' s external value, which has a psychological impact on public confidence in the single currency, needs to be countered to a greater extent by the demonstrable success of economic and monetary union, to which everyone must give greater prominence."
"We must not allow information on the technical changeover to be overshadowed by information about the political objectives and the successes achieved so far."
"By way of conclusion, I would therefore like to say that the euro, as this report demonstrates, is a project for growth and employment, for a successful single market and for enhancing Europe' s identity."
"The euro is a project for price stability and lower inflation rates, for increasing competitiveness and improving public finances, so that we finally put a stop to the process of selling out our future for budget policy reasons."
"Mr President, the first annual report by the European Central Bank gives us a chance to thank the executive board of the European Central Bank for its hard work and to congratulate it on its successful administration in connection with the introduction of the euro."
"Theirs was no easy task."
"These people worked extremely hard to attain our common objectives and we should acknowledge that, even if we disagree with them on certain crucial points of the monetary policy which they have applied over the year in question."
"The points on which we disagree, and which the rapporteur has glossed over or failed to mention in his report, do not, in my book, include the criticism which has been voiced on account of the fall in the exchange rate of the euro."
"The rapporteur quite rightly reminds us here that the fluctuations in the euro's predecessor currencies were far greater than those recorded so far for the euro, so there has been no deterioration there."
"The rapporteur ascribes the fall in the exchange rate to a lack of dynamism within the European economy and he is probably right."
"However, his comment raises the question of the extent to which the monetary policy applied for a year or more is the right policy for restoring the dynamism which we all agree the economy needs."
"Unlike the rapporteur, who fully endorses the arguments of the Central Bank, many of us believe that its monetary policy has been dogmatic, excessively conservative and prone to inflationary risks."
"We could even forgive it all that, because conservatism and perhaps even a little dogmatism go with the job of central banking."
"But the Central Bank has no right to publicly present the fight against inflation, which is its obligation under the Treaty, when it itself is free to define inflation as it pleases."
"The Bank cannot tell us, 'We have put an end to inflation and inflation is what we say it is, what we judge it to be, and we judge it in a subjective and arbitrary manner, in isolation from the rest of the economy and, more importantly, in isolation from support for employment, which is also the obligation of the European Central Bank' ."
"This attitude towards economic policy verges on the dangerous, especially nowadays."
"Economic recovery in Europe has mopped up all our spare productive potential and needs new investments if it is to continue."
"Is the recent increase in interest rates on the pretext of the risk of inflation the most suitable policy for encouraging investment?"
"Can the inflation target of 0% to 2% be reconciled with the need to extend the investment economy or should the twelve countries in the euro zone be considering a political revision of the inflation target, in which case the Bank will be able to pursue a target independently, but the target will be set by and will be the political responsibility of the European governments?"
"Mr President, whatever the value of the euro, the primary objective of the European Central Bank, as you have reminded us, Mr Duisenberg, is to maintain price stability without worrying about the economic and social consequences which come in the wake of these decisions."
"That is why the ECB can increase its interest rates, at the risk of slowing down investment and dampening growth."
"This hike follows on from the increase in American rates."
"The persistent weakness of the euro against the dollar is also the result of the huge drain on capital leaving the European Union."
"According to experts, nearly 950 billion French francs net poured out of the euro zone in 1999 in the form of direct investments abroad, i.e. 43% more than in 1998."
"In short, the euro is used mainly for borrowing in order to finance speculative projects, even as far away as the United States."
"The decision to compete with the United States by promoting the financial markets leads up a blind alley. It needs a boom in employment, training, research and salaries to enable us to develop a resolutely modern European social model."
"To do so, social and monetary sides must join forces."
"But the ECB is the only master on board when it comes to monetary policy."
"In the name of the fight against inflation and strict compliance with the Stability Pact, it even goes so far as to call the governments of the Member States to order, but never has a word to say in criticism of the speculation sweeping the financial markets."
"It advocates wage restraint, flexibility and job insecurity."
"It fans the flames of privatisation in order to boost competitiveness and the return on capital."
"It also advocates 'modernising' social protection and reducing unemployment costs, thus applying the same logic as the agreement in France between employers and two trades union, an agreement which punishes the unemployed and makes them feel guilty."
"We must re-open the debate on the remit of the European Central Bank in order to find a new credit policy which takes account of employment criteria."
"We cannot merely tack a social chapter on to neo-liberal economic policy."
"The alternative in a truly social Europe would be to substitute a growth, employment and training pact for the stability pact."
"And if we are to implement this approach, it is vital that we strengthen control of the ECB by the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Mr President, when it adopted the Radwan report, the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs missed a rare and valuable opportunity to draw attention to reasons for the weakness of the euro that cannot be laid at the door of the European Central Bank."
"The sheer nonsense that we have heard here demonstrates how important the ECB' s independence is."
"The argument that the euro' s weakness is also a consequence of Euroland' s enormous bureaucracy, which - in the words of acknowledged experts - has a Socialist tendency and limits individuals' freedoms, was rejected by a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for clearly ideological reasons."
"The same fate was suffered by other amendments to the effect that the euro area is totally overloaded with heavy taxes, thus penalising entrepreneurialism."
"Rigid structures, the slow pace of liberalisation in important sectors of the economy and differences between inflation rates in individual euro Member States, which are already a cause for concern, are the reason why the improvement in public finances in many Member States is not the result of a sustained reduction in public expenditure and structural reforms, but rather a consequence of low interest rates and a heavier tax burden, which represent a threat to the Stability Pact."
"I would like to have seen all these points included in the report."
"It would also have been a good thing for this Parliament if it had had the courage to recognise in this particular report that the present weakness in the single European currency is chiefly due to a lack of economic flexibility. Nevertheless, I am glad that at least some reservations have been voiced about certain decisions taken recently in the euro countries, for example on working hours, which instead of making the labour market flexible have made it rigid, and are also contributing to the euro' s weakness."
"I do not mind saying this, even if Mr Brie, the chief ideologist of Germany' s old communists, whose party wrecked a whole state and who would do better to keep quiet here, does not like it."
"This is an unequivocal signal to voters in the euro area to give the all too numerous Red-Green governments their marching orders, if they..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Central Bank, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot resist the temptation of replying to Astrid Lulling."
"Independence, yes, but independence in relation to what?"
"If you think that the reduction in working hours might explain the fall in the euro, then that is your business, but it seems to be the result of ideological prejudice rather than objective observation of the state of the French economy."
"Mr President of the European Central Bank, as you know, the recent 50-point increase in the base rate which you introduced, following hard on the heels of the increase at the end of April, has incited widespread debate in numerous Member States in which growth has resumed; it is feared that this increase in the base rate will upset this trend, which is essential if we want to resolve the problems facing our fellow citizens."
"However, we are delighted at the prospect of a revision in the reference value which allows growth in the money supply to be evaluated."
"This revision would appear to be overdue."
"As for the deterioration in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar, not everyone sees it as a drawback, but many wonder as to the causes."
"Allow me to share my conviction with you."
"The lack of any real coordination between our economic policies is the main cause."
"If we want to rectify this situation, we need greater coordination between our economic policies and we will not achieve it unless we strengthen euro 11, or rather euro 12."
"It is within this framework that you will manage to strengthen the mutual confidence between governments which is needed if progress is to be made in this direction."
"I hope that the French presidency will succeed in pushing this issue forward."
"I also hope that the Central Bank will help it to do so in a positive spirit."
"Progress has been made as regards transparency and we are delighted about that."
"You know that this Parliament imagines that we can go further still."
"And then, Mr President, allow me to question you on one final point."
"You have called on the trade unions for wage restraint, as is your right."
"But should you not also question the inflationary trends triggered by the huge profits made on the share markets?"
"We think that there is also a global vision of the economy which you would do well to take into account."
"Finally, as far as Mr Radwan's report is concerned, I cannot concur with the idea that speeding up structural reforms would bring about a fall in the euro when it comes to reducing working time."
"Once again, the figures speak for themselves: as a result of the reduction in working hours, there has been an increase in growth and jobs in the French economy."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the European Central Bank is just a cog, albeit a highly symbolic cog, in the wheel of policy of all the Member States of the Union, a policy which promotes the profits of big business, while at the same time imposing what the report euphemistically refers to as a moderate wage policy."
"The Central Bank, which has set itself up as the supreme guardian of this policy, claims to be acting to prevent budgetary deficit and indebtedness in the Member States."
"But what it does not mention, any more than the Member States themselves, is the fact that those responsible for and those who benefit from the deficit are not those who are required to make sacrifices in order to reduce it."
"It is the subsidies, tax relief and various forms of aid granted to big business which empty state coffers everywhere."
"But it is to labour and public-sector wages that every government runs when it comes to reducing its deficit."
"The elected members of Lutte Ouvrière will be voting against this report."
"We affirm the need for a policy to put an end to all direct or indirect subsidies to employers and a consequent increase in taxes on profits, private wealth and high incomes."
"We affirm the need to force Member States to use the funds that are recouped in order to create jobs, which are cruelly lacking today in health, education and public transport, and to lift the public services out of their present state of disrepair."
"Mr President, having listened to Mrs Berès and Mrs Bordes I am more worried than ever that the fine talk at Lisbon is actually being realised."
"There does not seem to be any understanding among the communists and socialists of the concern Mrs Lulling and the EPP Group have regarding how European competitiveness and dynamism can be realised."
"I wish that France and the French Members of Parliament were as active, for example, in the implementation of the action programme relating to financial services, as they are in promoting the Social Agenda."
"President Chirac yesterday emphasised with eloquence the importance of finding the right balance between these two objectives, and I wish you would listen to your President."
"Mr Duisenberg, I remember last year' s discussion on the 1998 annual report very clearly."
"Then I pointed out Parliament' s wish to see a strong and independent European Central Bank in the future, one that was well established and had gained the confidence of the market."
"The report we are now dealing with also shows that progress was clearly made in this direction last year."
"It is to be welcomed that the ECB is committed to regularly releasing its economic forecasts and details of its econometric models of the Euroland economy."
"There has to be more transparency, however."
"Mr Duisenberg, the fact that there are many econometric models does not prevent their all being published and made known to Parliament also."
"It is important that these models, on which we try to decide money policy in a new economy, with all the circumstances of a new economy, are published openly in order for economists and politicians to discuss them."
"I agree with Mrs Riis-Jørgensen that the ECB should explain its policy of intervention."
"This morning on the CNN news channel they presented some results of research regarding various intervention policies by the ECB, and the ECB came across as a good intervention-focused bank."
"Could you comment on that later on in your reply?"
"Mr President, the Radwan report has addressed honestly many of the issues which relate to the functioning of the Central Bank, ranging from prudential banking supervision and the cost of international money transfers on the one hand, to convergence requirements for applicant countries and the role of this Parliament in providing the framework for the accountability of the ECB on the other."
"I welcome the calls for greater transparency which I consider is the bank's best defence against calls to amend the Treaty to reduce its operational independence, and Mr Duisenberg has undertaken to publish the econometric models, for which he should be congratulated."
"I would also urge publishing the minutes and the voting patterns of the Governing Council, as winning the trust and the confidence of the markets is vital, especially for such a young institution."
"The report welcomes the fact the ECB does not interpret its responsibility for stability policy one-sidedly, but that, in addition to inflation, it also monitors deflationary tendencies."
"This is also important."
"We all value economic and price stability, and the new paradigm in the United States gives us hope that such stability, including a balanced budget over the economic cycle, is consistent with growth and the steady reduction in unemployment."
"The report, however, does not examine the markets' lack of confidence in the euro and the huge capital outflows from Europe over the past year."
"I believe this is due to the lack of faith in the core Euroland countries' ability to govern and deliver fundamental structural reforms under their current governments, which Otmar Issing, the bank's chief economist, has referred to as the serious structural rigidities in Europe's labour markets and pensions systems."
"Lastly, as a British member, I do not think it is fair that candidate countries should be subject to any stricter application of the Maastricht convergence criteria for joining EMU than the existing members and, as an out-country member, I urge the Commission to consider the flexible European model that we British Conservatives have adopted, allowing these countries to opt out of EMU in future if they so wish after joining."
"Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, good work!"
"I believe that you have achieved the main objective of the European Central Bank: to maintain price stability."
"I will go further. If necessary, if you believe it appropriate to raise interest rates, if the objective is price stability, if the inflation objective is in jeopardy, do not be nervous, raise interest rates."
"However, I would like to add something."
"It is not in this area that the European Central Bank deserves most credit, but rather it is in the debate on the external value of the euro that the European Central Bank has remained steadfast, has endured and resisted attacks and pressure from different fronts."
"The real reason for the external value of our currency is not, from any point of view, the policy of the European Central Bank. It is the attitude and resistance of certain governments - such as, for example, the one which has been mentioned here several times over the last 35 hours -, which are ideologically allergic to the economic reforms needed for the European Union to follow the path marked out at the Lisbon Summit."
"I would also like to congratulate you on the change of method of adjudication, since the new variable rate system allows more direct control of the monetary aggregate as a result of greater knowledge of the market' s demand curve and, furthermore, allows for certain signals to be sent to the markets on monetary policy."
"For all of these reasons, Mr President of the European Central Bank, I would like to congratulate you and show you my support."
"Mr President, in many ways it has been a rather grim year for the euro."
"I take a rather more pessimistic view than the previous speaker."
"We have seen the external value of the euro plummet."
"The interesting issue is to look at why that fall has happened."
"There are many reasons which have been explored today, but a big reason is that the markets do not believe in a currency without a country."
"They do not believe in a currency which is not backed by a political institution or a government."
"This is a very good illustration of the inherent link between economic and monetary union and political union."
"The one follows almost inevitably from the other."
"That is one of the many reasons why the United Kingdom should stay out of the euro."
"But what is vital is that the people across Europe have a debate about the future, a debate about political union."
"Too often in the past they have been told that changes in Europe are technical. Particularly the idea that a move to the euro was merely an economic choice is, quite frankly, a lie."
"Every time Mr Blair and Mr Brown say that it is a matter of economics whether the UK joins or not, they are deceiving the British public or they are deeply deluded about the future of Europe."
"It is only right that in Denmark we are seeing a debate on political union at the moment, as the Danes decide whether to join the euro or not."
"That is the decision that they are making and that is the decision that is faced by the United Kingdom."
"I trust that both of those countries will say no to political union and consequently no to economic union as well."
"It is about time that the European Union stopped intervening and spending taxpayers' money on one side of this type of political debate."
"It is unacceptable, in my view, for taxpayers' money - for public funds - to be spent promoting the euro in the 'out' countries, because they are engaged in a very important political process."
"To use government funding on one side of the debate would be an interference in this democratic process."
"I trust that we will vote in accordance with that in the Karas report at noon today."
"Mr President, the introduction of a single currency in Europe was never going to be a simple task, but with 11 countries within the Union covering a population of 300 million, I fully support the single currency."
"There has been much debate in recent months about the strength or otherwise of the currency and I would like to pose a very simple question to the detractors of EMU."
"If the single currency is not working, why are so many countries seeking to join the new structure?"
"I welcome the decision to allow Greece full participation within the single currency."
"In the Scandinavian countries support for the single currency is rising."
"Of course we are waiting anxiously for the decision of the Danish people."
"In the longer term, Eastern and Central European countries seeking to join the European Union will want to participate in the single European currency system."
"1 January 2002, which is not far away, is the key date for the circulation of euro notes and coins within the territories of all the EMU participating countries."
"Business and retailers must gear up their preparation for this date to ensure that the changeover goes smoothly."
"From an Irish perspective, I believe that our cash changeover plan is moving very well."
"Fortunately we can draw on our experience of a change of currency in 1972, when we broke with sterling."
"We want to ensure that the mistakes that were made then are not made again."
"I have had so many congratulations and compliments that I would simply say I thank the European Parliament for the way in which they have received our annual report and I can see the debate here expresses great support for continuation of the policies that we have pursued so far."
"There are a few points I would like to comment on."
"The question raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mr Katiforis and Mr Goebbels all boils down to whether the ECB has too high a growth rate, which has the effect of increasing interest rates."
"Mrs Berès has asked a very precise question, about which I would like to say the following."
"I do not understand the pessimism which permeates this aspect of the debate."
"In the past twenty-five years the average growth rate for real GDP in the euro area has been between 2 and 2.5% per year."
"This year and next year growth in the euro area will be in excess, even considerably in excess, of 3% per year and we expect inflation to be close to 2%."
"Due to the volatility of oil prices it might even be more than 2% in some months but the average will be 2%."
"There will be upside risks, but what we do about this depends on how the situation develops."
"In reply to Mrs Randzio-Plath's question if the ECB is against growth rates of over 3%, my unequivocal answer is that we are certainly not against growth rates of 3%, which we expect now."
"We would be against increased inflation, but that is not yet on the cards although, as I say, the risks will be upside."
"We are now entering the best period that Europe has had in a long time, in decades, I might say."
"Unemployment will fall over the next two years."
"Not by very much, admittedly - there is nothing monetary policy can do to accelerate the process - but unemployment is coming down very gradually and will continue to do so."
"If, as well all expect and hope, Greece joins EMU on 1 January next year, only Denmark will be a member of the ERM."
"The question was asked what will the ECB do if that creates problems for Denmark?"
"The ECB will do everything in its power to keep Denmark in the ERM and there is no date scheduled for the exchange rate mechanism ending so it will be for an indefinite period."
"So far Denmark has been remarkably successful as a member of the ERM with smaller exchange rate margins than were permitted within the ERM, and I expect it to remain that way, although I would hope that Denmark will decide to join EMU."
"But I can assure Mrs Riis-Jørgensen that the cooperation between the European Central Bank and the Danish National Bank is exemplary."
"I have already alluded in my introduction to the question of transparency and the summary minutes asked for in the motion for a resolution."
"The introduction to the monthly press conference refers to the debate in the governing council that has just taken place."
"The statement is carefully prepared by the whole governing council; it is not a spur of the moment statement."
"A week later the entire statement is produced again in a more final form."
"The editorial in the monthly bulletin gives all the information that could be found in summary minutes of the meeting."
"Thank you, Mr Duisenberg."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Implementation of EMU"
"The next item is the report (A5-0170/2000) by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on communications strategy in the last phases of the completion of EMU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 500 days from now euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation."
"This will be the final stage of the first currency changeover on this scale in the history of our continent."
"EMU citizens, every citizen of the Member States of the European Union and of the applicant countries and beyond will be indirectly or directly affected."
"Every single consumer, including both our own citizens and tourists visiting Europe, and the whole world economy will have to learn to recognise the new money, to become familiar with prices and values in euros and to handle the new money."
"Both large and small companies will have to adapt and change over their accounts and computer systems to the new currency, which will involve substantial preparatory work."
"We have talked a lot about the advantages of the euro and of economic and monetary union."
"But there still remains a very great deal to be done."
"According to opinion polls, not enough companies or private individuals are using the euro, and awareness of it is still too low."
"30% of companies do not yet see any need to make preparations well in advance and in some cases even think that they do not need to complete the changeover until 2002."
"Most members of the public do not have a euro account and rarely carry out financial transactions in euros."
"There is an enormous need for information and awareness-raising measures going beyond merely technical information on the changeover."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has not simply commented on the Commission report - we welcome the priorities and measures put forward in it."
"We have attempted to put the report in concrete terms, to strengthen in it, and, where we thought it was necessary, to supplement it."
"Considering that around EUR 80 million will be spent on this information campaign in the three years 1999-2002, plus a further EUR 80 million from the ECB, it is absolutely vital for us to have the closest possible coordination between all the institutions, associations and states affected, for us to identify priorities and to encourage agreement on key messages, for us to monitor the process, and in that case I would suggest using the European Parliament and European Commission interinstitutional working group. It is also important for us to implement the political guidelines, also in the context of contracts with Member States, and for us to demonstrate a high degree of professionalism in doing all this."
"I would like to use my last one and a half minutes to say something about priorities."
"Over half of all SMEs do not yet have an action plan for the changeover."
"SMEs need to tackle their technical changeover as quickly as possible, and in doing so also to give some thought to the strategic consequences of a market notable for price transparency and increased competition."
"So SMEs are the priority for autumn 2000."
"Secondly, there is the public at large, which includes all the target groups and more besides."
"The public needs to be made to feel secure about this."
"In this area, public administration needs to act as a role model, just as NGOs and foundations need to be involved in the information campaign and act as intermediaries."
"Thirdly, we have schools, schoolchildren and other young people."
"We have a very specific proposal, which is not only to change over all school books as soon as possible, but also to organise painting, drawing, essay-writing and public speaking competitions on the subject of 'Changing to the euro' , which is a defining topic for Europe' s identity."
"The third area is this: the banks have run world savings week throughout Europe, and in this context we should also introduce 'euro savings days' , to encourage more people to open a euro savings account before the changeover stage."
"We need to increase the involvement of elected representatives, by which I mean not just Members of the European Parliament, but also all representatives elected by the public from municipal level to European level."
"In addition to the need to have sufficient staff in the Commission' s directorates-general to cope with the change, coordination is also a key area if we are to send a clear message to the public through a wide-ranging communications strategy with adequate financial resources and an appropriate time frame."
"We are therefore proposing that the campaign should be extended to 2002."
"In that case, the success story of the euro will not come to an end at that point, but, with the support of the public, it will go on to greater things."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European public' s need for information is still very great, although monetary union is already in place and euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation before too very long."
"There are less than 75 weeks to go in fact."
"The Committee on Budgets, in common with all Members of this House, is very much in agreement with the objectives described in the Commission communication on the communication strategy covering the final stages of the completion of EMU."
"We also believe that there should be incentives and support for companies, especially SMEs, to enable them to carry out the work needed to change over to the euro."
"Furthermore, enhanced preparation is just as desirable and important for all our citizens and for all consumers."
"We all need to change over to the euro in our daily lives."
"It was not of course for the Committee on Budgets to assess the content of the Commission communication in detail: we limited ourselves to budgetary aspects."
"We wish to point out once again that in the interinstitutional agreement it was stipulated that information policy is an autonomous action which does not require a separate legal basis."
"For the reason mentioned, this particularly needs to be brought to the attention of the Council again."
"However, I would particularly like to remind you that the Prince programme was initiated by Parliament through budgetary intervention in 1996 with the clear aim of financing information campaigns on priority issues for the EU. This was to take place at interinstitutional level, as at that time we were convinced, as we are now, that this would ensure that the available funding would be spent as effectively as possible."
"We therefore wish to stress once again that the decision on the breakdown of appropriations and the guidelines for implementation, including joint actions, is taken on the basis of the opinion given by the interinstitutional working group."
"This working group was specifically referred to in the budgetary remarks, and that is how it should stay - and that comment is particularly for the ears of the Commission!"
"For that reason we wish to reinsert the relevant remark on budget headings B3-300 and B3-306, which the Commission evidently 'forgot' to include in its preliminary draft budget for 2001."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee responsible for including our remarks on this in the conclusions."
"Mr President, information on the euro is for the public and is meant to satisfy their need for information in particular."
"The information must come in cooperation with the Member States, but what, in my opinion, is of most importance is that NGOs are kept fully aware of what is happening."
"We have to reach grassroots level as swiftly as we can, in a language that is perfectly clear."
"The so-called two-stage information strategy, where peer groups keep each other' s members informed, has turned out to be the best of all options, and this should be put to good use too in dealing with this information issue."
"I fear those information campaigns that are led by the Commission."
"They are often sweet as candy and very beautifully contrived."
"The fact that this information campaign is being made with the support of NGOs and via them will hopefully prevent a repeat of that."
"The arrival of the euro will also entail a lot of practical questions for consumers."
"Above all we have to take care that prices do not trail upwards when the currencies are finally changed over."
"In this the consumer organisations have a very big and important job, and women' s organisations must also be taken into account, as women need information on this."
"It is absolutely essential that cross-border giros and payment transactions are in accordance with the principles of the Internal Market."
"I am glad that the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Duisenberg, also paid attention to this and promised that the ECB would produce a report on the subject."
"I genuinely hope that these practical matters, which are a thorny subject for consumers, are attended to before the euro comes into proper circulation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mr Karas on his excellent report, but at the same time to say that we are not at present satisfied with the European Commission' s information policy."
"We wish to remind the House that the euro information programme is also, as defined in the budget, a joint European Commission and European Parliament programme."
"During the last parliamentary term there was a committee led by Mr Anastassopoulos which laid down the essential features of information policy in this area."
"It was very successful at that point."
"We also managed at that time to secure a full and key role for Members of the European Parliament in this information campaign, via the political foundations."
"This has not happened during this new parliamentary term."
"This body, which consisted of the Commissioner responsible and the relevant committee chairs, has not yet been convened."
"Some of the procedures dating from the last parliamentary term have still not been discharged to this day."
"We therefore have to ask in the clearest possible terms what should happen next."
"For this reason, my first request is that a meeting of this body should be called as quickly as possible."
"That is my first point."
"The second point that I would briefly like to touch upon relates to an observation regarding the substance of the information campaign."
"If you compare prices in the Eleven, that is in Euroland, with prices in other countries which have remained outside the Eleven, including the United Kingdom but also Switzerland and Norway, where this is particularly apparent, you will see that price levels in Euroland, even in the 'rich' countries, are generally speaking lower than in the other countries."
"This means that the European single currency is already leading to greater competition in this area, and that in turn this competition is leading to the public getting goods and services on more favourable terms."
"A study should be carried out on this, something which is also called for in the Karas report."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that we support the report, just as we welcome the positive tone of the Commission' s communication."
"It is high time that we had a more efficient communications strategy and that cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States was improved in this new parliamentary term."
"The European public not only feels inadequately prepared for the euro, it also genuinely is inadequately prepared for it, both objectively and subjectively speaking."
"The fact is that the long transitional period has not led to more intensive and careful preparations being made for the introduction of the euro, quite the contrary - it has led to more disinformation and also to preparations being postponed, in some people' s minds even to June 2002."
"Unfortunately, this seems to apply not only to the public, but also to business."
"Although 80% of businesses say that they are preparing for the euro and its introduction, objectively speaking at most 25% are making concrete preparations."
"A sign of this is of course that only 1% of banknotes within the European Union have been converted to date."
"If we do not tackle this now, fears that we will end up with the dreaded 'big bang' , which none of the governments wanted, will be totally justified."
"The governments themselves really must do some advance work, however, and demonstrate greater commitment."
"I believe that you cannot shift all the responsibility to the European institutions."
"After all, it is the EU Member States that have a duty to provide political information and education according to the principle of subsidiarity."
"We really must call on the Member States of the European Union to invest money, time and human resources in ensuring that the euro is a success."
"It is a matter of regret that up to now public administrations have not led the way as they should have done."
"I think it is also important, and the rapporteur has quite rightly drawn attention to this, for schools, teachers and places of education to prepare people for the euro."
"The euro must become part of education across the board."
"It is not enough to have a few successful but extremely modest Socrates projects about the euro in Europe' s schools."
"No, this is really a job that needs to be successfully handled at local level."
"I think it would be wonderful if the schools, Europe' s young people, welcomed the euro as a tangible sign of Europe, and if everyone used their own preparations to communicate with others."
"This is also something that the older generation, who are generally so sceptical about the euro, could do."
"Why should older people in the European Union not use their experience, their knowledge and also the time that they have available in order to make the euro a success?"
"Maybe this is an area where we could have a kind of new pact between the generations that would help the euro project to succeed."
"The Commission certainly needs to work even more closely with us and to step up the pace of its involvement."
"But we should not forget that the resources for the information campaign are extremely slight and have to be shared out between the Member States."
"No company introducing an important product would rely on such modest resources to ensure that a product was a success."
"A powerful argument in favour of the euro is the initial positive experience with monetary union, which has in fact provided protection against turbulent currency markets in recent times."
"But it is also a matter of turning information into education, because at the end of the day we need to acquire a totally new way of looking at prices, making calculations and judging values."
"We should not be deceived by the painless transition on 1 January 1999."
"Nor should we be deceived by the almost automatic transition to the new millennium."
"We also need to prepare for the euro psychologically."
"We must all do this together, at all levels of the European Union!"
"Firstly, I would like to say that our Group, as it did in committee, supports the Karas report."
"We believe that it is a very good report and it makes a very positive contribution to an issue of fundamental importance in the process of introducing the euro into the lives of our citizens."
"It is clear that the euro is not purely a macroeconomic and financial issue. It is an issue which will reach every European citizen, it is a European distinguishing mark and, therefore, it is of the greatest importance in the process of European construction."
"To this end, it is very important that a campaign be implemented - and a very good campaign - so that in 2002 the euro may enjoy the degree of confidence and acceptance which we all want."
"Furthermore, as has been said, there is a great delay in terms of the number of countries and companies prepared for its use and in terms of our citizens' level of knowledge."
"In this respect I would like very briefly to highlight three dimensions. The first is decentralisation."
"The participation of regional and local authorities is very important. Many of them have very significant responsibilities and are better prepared than the Member States themselves to reach the citizen."
"This is an aspect that the European Central Bank and the Commission should bear in mind."
"I would like to know Commissioner Solbes' opinion with regard to participation at this level, which Mr von Wogau has also requested."
"We must ensure that these administrations play a significant role. It falls to them to do so, since they are best prepared to reach the citizens."
"Secondly, this decentralisation must also take place at company and industry level and not be limited to the headquarters of managerial or union organisations."
"Thirdly, I recommend that you read the conclusions of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which introduce a cultural dimension, which is very important to the success of this information campaign."
"Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to give a view from the outside, from Scotland, for the time being part of the UK, where our diet of information about the euro is dominated by a rather lukewarm and unconvincing approach on the part of the Labour government and an almost hysterically anti-euro rhetoric on the part of the Conservatives."
"In contrast my party - the Scottish National Party - recently reaffirmed our position of support in principle for entry to the euro currency and we are not afraid to promote that view."
"Scotland's traders, from fish processors to farmers, from manufacturers to the tourism sector, are being forced to compete with one hand tied behind their backs."
"Mr Karas acknowledges a high level of support for the euro but also some shortcomings in the provision of information within the euro zone and I support his ideas for addressing that problem."
"But in particular I welcome the fact that this strategy also addresses those Member States not yet taking part in monetary union, since of course we will be affected whether we join in or remain out."
"I call on the UK and Scottish governments to play a full part in that campaign."
"Mr President, there are three countries outside EMU."
"In these countries, referenda will be held before the governments concerned make the decision concerning the introduction of the euro."
"Two of these countries, England and Denmark, have had the good sense not to take part in the euro information campaign."
"They have said no in view of the fact that the discussion is not yet concluded and with the forthcoming referenda in mind."
"The third country that remains outside EMU, Sweden, has, however, decided to take part in the campaign, despite the fact that it will take place before the referendum and before it is decided whether Sweden will introduce the euro."
"This means that the euro information campaign will not be a normal information campaign as it is in other countries, but a sort of persuasion campaign and the beginning of the fight between those that are for and those that are against in the referendum."
"It is, of course, difficult to imagine that the euro information campaign would produce any particularly critical information on the euro, as the object of the campaign is to increase confidence in the euro and the euro reform."
"This means, in actual fact, that the euro information campaign will serve the political purpose of the Swedish government, which is, of course, to persuade the Swedish people to vote in favour of the euro in the referendum."
"Fifty percent of the euro information campaign is financed from EU funds and is to be conducted throughout society, even in schools where it is not usual to carry on one-sided political campaigns, which is what this is."
"I think that it would be disgraceful if the Swedish government were allowed to exploit the euro information campaign in this way."
"It would be both compromising and embarrassing for the EU if the campaign were allowed to be carried out as planned."
"Therefore, I want to appeal to the Commission to take steps to ensure that the agreement concerning the Swedish euro information campaign is torn up or amended in such a way that it may only be implemented once the Swedish people have expressed their opinion in a referendum."
"I also want to appeal to my fellow MEPs here in the House to support Amendments 7 and 12 in the vote tomorrow, as the text of these amendments recommends that the campaign not be conducted in countries that have not decided if they are to be a part of EMU."
"Mr President, I should like to continue where the previous speaker left off."
"I am glad that no money from the campaign is formally being used for propaganda in the Danish debate."
"This report is one of the most interesting documents I have read for a long time."
"It could form part of a handbook for democrats or perhaps, rather, be used as an object lesson in anti-democratic manipulation."
"I read here that the euro is an 'essential, identity-building factor in the process of European integration' ."
"It is also noted that there is no overwhelming support for the euro in the euro area and certainly not in the countries surrounding this area. As the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport very clearly puts it, the Commission is therefore urged, ""when carrying out the advertising and information campaign, to take account of the fact that large parts of the population continue to be sceptical about the common currency"" ."
"Or, to put it another way: the objective, as stated in the report itself, is that ""the right means of communication can be used to respond to the European public' s national and cultural features"" ."
"Or, in a nutshell, manipulation."
"The situation is that, in this programme, more than EUR 100 million has been used to influence the people of Europe."
"That is to say, the Commission is using Europeans' money to manipulate Europeans."
"As I see it, that is the very opposite of how we really visualise this project."
"Democracy depends upon decision-making by the people, not upon manipulation by the institutional machine."
"If I say this, it is because, as is well known, we are holding a referendum in Denmark on 28 September on joining the euro, and it goes without saying that it is the public debate which forms the basis for this."
"We will not be manipulated."
"Such tellingly described manipulation has not been seen since the totalitarian regimes collapsed years ago."
"This is a most deplorable report."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this highly informative report."
"One positive point is that small and medium-sized enterprises have been identified as a very important target group, as this group is one where there could be considerable problems at the changeover stage."
"What is more, we should also support any initiative and also call upon the Commission in the clearest terms to introduce measures without delay to counter excessive bank charges for intra-Community money transactions."
"We must demonstrate to the European public that the euro will cut administrative costs, to their advantage."
"We should not just talk about the euro and provide information about it, but the information we provide must also convince the public that the euro will bring tangible advantages for them."
"The excessive bank charges in force at present are giving precisely the opposite signal."
"Mr President, for most Europeans, the era of the euro will not actually begin until they are required to use euro coins and notes in the shops."
"Out of respect for all our European citizens, it is important not to underestimate the political significance of the changeover, and for this changeover to occur without any hitches."
"With this in mind, it is necessary to organise the practical dimension of the changeover well as a matter of priority."
"It is, in this context, extremely useful that, after extended pleas, also on the part of this House, frontloading has become possible."
"In addition, people need to have faith in the process as a whole."
"In order to instil this feeling, we must provide them with information as a matter of priority."
"We endorse the plans of the Commission, which set out to achieve this for each target group and by mobilising the organised midfield."
"After all, the hallmark of sound information is that it is tailored to the specific circumstances of those involved, and people and companies have a great deal more faith in their own associations and organisations than they do in public institutions."
"But not until we manage to reduce the costs of cross-border payments and exchange rates within the euro-zone will people and companies have a sufficient level of confidence, and this confidence is crucial."
"It is a prerequisite for motivating people to make the necessary efforts, efforts which are needed to adapt to the new situation."
"Let us not delude people into thinking they will not need to make any sacrifices."
"The changeover will require an effort."
"Everyone will need to adjust, everyone will need to make an effort."
"If we can help them in this and guide them in the right direction from the outset, we will have succeeded in our task of providing information."
"Mr President, Mr Karas' report was approved by a large majority within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"This is only right, because it is a sound report, on which I would like to congratulate him."
"- (PT) Mr President, it seems that since the launch of the euro in January 1999, the European public, far from becoming more interested in it, has in fact been losing interest, as if the extremely long period of three years without notes and coins has turned the euro into a kind of virtual reality."
"Although we have repeatedly stated that the euro has, since January 1999, been the official currency of 11 EU Member States, which Greece and possibly Denmark will join at the start of next year, and that the national currencies are just multiples and fractions of the euro, the fact of the matter is that the majority of Europeans do not believe that escudos, pesetas, francs and marks are not still their official currency, because that is what they have in their pockets."
"While water, electricity, telephone and supermarket bills are also shown in euros, I regard that as a mathematical exercise of limited usefulness."
"Yet in 18 months' time our national notes and coins will disappear and it is high time that we were totally familiar with the new money, developed a sense of its value and recognised its implications for our lives and for the development of our economies and societies."
"As I see it, information campaigns on the euro need to focus on precisely these two aspects: first, the value of the euro, its appearance and the way we use it as a currency, and, second, its potential and effectiveness in terms of monetary stability in the European Union, the level of growth achieved - the highest in recent decades - and in terms of controlling inflation and creating employment."
"If these campaigns are to deliver the desired results, however, it is vital for the various actions to be coordinated."
"It is no good having one campaign by the European Central Bank and another one by the Commission or by Parliament, not to mention all the other campaigns organised by the Members States involved."
"It is essential to effectively coordinate the resources available so as to reach the target groups, and for us to be certain that there are no errors of the kind already identified in documents which the Commission has widely distributed in Portuguese schools."
"Schools are nerve centres for information and have a multiplier effect, so they must be used in the most appropriate, simple and effective way possible."
"This means that the key words in these campaigns have to be coordination of effort, involvement, and human, technical and financial resources."
"Whereas it seems that up to now the right hand has not known what the left is doing, and vice versa, and it is important to get past this stage as soon as possible."
"2001 should be the year in which the euro takes over the key role of national currencies in setting prices, in company accounting and in cross-border transactions."
"We need to call a halt to the scandalous cross-border costs within the euro area, which do not involve any risk for the banks."
"The practice of charging a percentage on credit card transactions and on bank debits and transfers is one of the causes of the poor light in which the European public views the euro, and only action by the Commission to outlaw the real cartels that have been created can put an end to this and help to restore confidence."
"And this is what the citizens of Europe are waiting for."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I should like to express our surprise at the fact that a particularly extensive and sometimes even extremely complex resolution should have ensued from a relatively simple matter."
"The European Parliament is bringing many problems on itself in this respect. This is mainly due to the fact that, in this resolution, the concept of government information has been taken to mean government propaganda."
"During a previous debate on the information strategy to be pursued, I was already bound to make some critical observations with regard to the highly peculiar wishes of some of my fellow delegates."
"Unfortunately, I cannot escape this here, either."
"Anyone who uses the euro as a vehicle to sell the so-called European idea is committing a very grave logical error."
"It is extremely regrettable that this enormous political error is detected to a far lesser extent by this House than the errors of liability on the part of commercial banks in the course of foreign exchange transactions."
"If the cap fits, wear it."
"Mr President, the question troubling me over Mr Karas' report is whether we are actually asked to endorse an information campaign on the practical implications of the introduction of the euro, or a propaganda campaign in favour of it."
"Surely no-one could challenge the need for information."
"True, some British newspapers declare that we already know all the facts, but the recent announcement of the merger between the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges left many British newspaper editors spectacularly exposed on the simple issue of which currency would be used for the exchange denomination."
"More than two-thirds of UK businesses are unaware of the practical implications of the introduction of the euro, even for those countries outside the euro zone."
"If there is funding available for the many seminars and conferences which UK trade associations, lawyers and accountants are holding, then as a UK lawyer let me declare my interest in ensuring that we get our share of it."
"But there is reason to believe that this campaign goes well beyond the provision of practical information."
"After all, the European Central Bank is holding its own information campaign, so why should we be duplicating the effort?"
"Perhaps we see the answer in the evangelical tone of Mr Karas' report and his remarkable declaration that the euro information campaign must help to perpetuate the successful history of the euro."
"I certainly wish the euro well."
"Currency instability is bad for all of us, whether we are in or out of the euro zone."
"But I personally fail to recognise this historic success over the last six months, and the astonishing suggestion that the euro has proved a stabilising factor in the face of international monetary crises."
"Whether in or out of the euro zone it should be: information, 'yes' , but propaganda, 'no' ."
"The debate is suspended."
"We shall now proceed to the votes."
"The debate will be resumed this afternoon."
"Vote"
"Färm (PSE), rapporteur."
"(SV) Mr President, at the Commission's suggestion, in this hastily inserted item, the Committee on Budgets is now recommending that Parliament approve a donation of EUR 22 million to a fund within the Danube Commission."
"The reason for this is that the Danube river at Novi Sad is blocked by the remains of bridges destroyed by NATO's bombing last year."
"This, as well as the fact that the river bed is now lined with unexploded mines and bombs, is threatening both economic and humanitarian development in the Balkans."
"The task is to clear the river of three collapsed bridges and unexploded mines and bombs along a five kilometre stretch of Serbian territory."
"The help of the EU is required for this."
"It is important for this clearing work to be started before the summer."
"We should have preferred it if it had been possible for this to be a part of the Supplementary and Amending Budget that we have just debated, but for reasons of time this has not been possible."
"Therefore, the Committee on Budgets is nevertheless lending its support for funds to be freed up so that the Danube Commission can begin its work as soon as possible."
"One problem is that part of the work will be carried out on Serbian territory, once we have satisfied ourselves that the sanctions against Yugoslavia will be respected."
"As far as carrying out the work, the legal basis and the financing of the project are concerned, we have been in contact with the Commission and our queries have been resolved."
"As regards the provision of this EUR 22 million, the Commission has suggested that 7.5 million be taken from Phare, 7.5 million from ISPA and 7 million from Obnova."
"I should just like the Commission to confirm the following, and that is that the Commission will contact the Committee on Budgets if any problems should arise with the financing of this project."
"If there is any change to the amount or distribution proposed in the proposal for a Council decision, both the Council and Parliament will be reconsulted."
"So my reply is 'yes' ."
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"
"Proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of an agreement between the Community and Cyprus establishing cooperation in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises within the framework of the third multiannual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in the European Union (1997-2000) (COM(2000) 242 - C5-0324/2000 - 2000/0099(CNS)) (Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal presented by the Council here is one which has our support, although it has one serious flaw."
"According to Article 14 of this proposal, and this was also discussed in the committee responsible, the documents are to be available in all 11 official languages of the European Union, but not the second official language of the Republic of Cyprus, that is Turkish."
"We request that this agreement should also be translated into Turkish, as an official language of the Republic of Cyprus - not only into Finnish, Swedish, Danish, German and so forth, but also into Turkish."
"The Council should take this into account in future in negotiations of this kind, if it wants to secure our agreement under a simplified procedure!"
"Madam President, my reply is that these sorts of agreements are always translated into the languages of the Community."
"This has also been the case this time."
"I also have a longer version of the declaration if the President would like to see it."
"Madam President, I just wanted to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether Cyprus will be treated in exactly the same way as all the other applicant countries."
"Yes or no?"
"As I see it, that is the vital question."
". (FR) My answer is yes."
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"

"Before the vote:"
"Referring to the report prepared by Mr Jarzembowski on the draft directive modifying Directive 91/440, I should like to state that the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27, while it welcomes Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21, and 24."

"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Framework agreement (C5-0349/2000) on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission"
"Before the vote:"
"Madam President, the framework agreement constitutes a degree of progress, but it is also in danger of being a clear retrograde step when it comes to MEPs' access to information from the Commission."
"My political Group and the intergroup SOS Democracy therefore recommend that we postpone the vote and give the agreement a proper reading in all committees, especially in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We agree with the criticism from the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, that the agreement directly contravenes Article 276 of the Treaty, which guarantees us access to information as part of the discharge procedure."
"Now, the Commission is being given the opportunity to decide what it will hand over for inspection."
"It is the same procedure as applies in connection with the ombudsman."
"The framework agreement also contravenes our own rules of procedure."
"Article 64 requires express equality between the Council and Parliament in the legislative procedure when the Commission transfers documents."
"Now, it is only the President of the Parliament and the committee chairmen who are entitled to see different types of non-public documents."
"The rapporteurs cannot demand them, and MEPs certainly cannot."
"As MEPs, we ought to be legally entitled to have documents made available to us whenever they have been issued to others by the Commission."
"That was something all the group chairmen agreed about when we began negotiations with the Commission."
"Now, a compromise is being proposed whereby those who are to be inspected can decided what they will have inspected."
"This compromise does not correspond with Mr Prodi' s pledges."
"I would therefore urge that we reject the proposal today and arrange for it to be improved so that we can vote for an improved version next time."
"Mr Bonde is asking for the vote to be postponed."
"Madam President, my Group supports Mr Bonde' s proposal for deferment, although this agreement undeniably contains some very worthwhile improvements to Parliament' s rights regarding, for example, talks on international agreements and its participation in the intergovernmental conference."
"However, we cannot accept the way in which the Council has interfered in relations between the Commission and Parliament now that the talks are over."
"The Council asked, pressed, and actually forced the Commission to remove from the agreement the text that would have required that Member States, the institutions and international organisations would, under this agreement, have had to explain their unwillingness to release some confidential information."
"In our opinion, this is absolutely intolerable."
"Madam President, I have reason to suspect that this is the direct consequence of the Feira summit."
"There it was decided that NATO would release secret information for the purpose of making joint military plans, which would appear to be a clear attempt to exclude both the Commission and Parliament from a common security and defence policy. We thus need a clear explanation from the Council as to why this is happening."
"In addition, Madam President, we have to improve the rights of rapporteurs to acquire confidential information, and perhaps a deferment would also provide the opportunity to establish this aspect of the matter."
"We thus do not support this text such as it is now since the last changes were made to it, and it would be wisest if we were to take a little extra time over the issue."
"Madam President, I will have the opportunity later to speak on behalf of my Group."
"I will allude to a number of my Group's concerns and criticisms about this project, but in substance, taking the totality of the work that has been done, the significant progress that has been made, and the prospect that in my view we are unlikely through a delay to significantly enhance the document, I would commend to the House that we should vote to proceed with our discussion and the adoption or rejection of the document, because that choice is there, and we have to hear the debate on it."
"At any rate, now is the moment to seize our opportunity to try to draw this prolonged matter to a close, to move on, and to build on our interinstitutional relations in a positive way."
"(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)"
"President."
"As requested, each group will now have two minutes to explain its position briefly."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this framework agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission represents a great step forward in relations between our two institutions."
"My Group called for this framework agreement, and it is very much committed to it."
"Relations between the Commission and the European Parliament will be put on a very firm and clear footing, and it is our common goal to support the building of Europe."
"The Commission is the executive, we together with the Council are the legislative, and this framework agreement will create means for the European Parliament to exercise its parliamentary control function more effectively."
"It goes without saying that future regulations which become Community law in the European Union will not be affected by this framework agreement."
"As legislators we are of course free to set these in train."
"This framework agreement is based on the principles of parliamentarism, democracy and transparency."
"The Commission has once again incorporated in this agreement, in a legally binding way, the concessions that it made to the European Parliament last September before it was elected - the 'five points' ."
"These items relate to the annexes on the legislative procedure, and the involvement of and provision of information to Parliament regarding agreements and on enlargement issues. They also concern the passing on of confidential information."
"Of course not everyone' s requirements have been met, including some of our own, but it is not always possible to achieve everything."
"However, taken as a whole, this agreement does represent progress, and I would sincerely like to thank everyone involved in it - you, Madam President, Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and also the political group leaders, who showed great commitment in their work on it."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats will be unanimously voting for this agreement."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, our favourable view of the approval of this framework agreement, on the basis of the principles debated this very week - yesterday, in fact - when we took the view that we were carrying out European construction amongst all of us and fundamentally, as far as we are concerned, with the Commission, based on the principles of democracy, transparency and responsibility."
"This is the justification for the fact that the code of conduct - whose negotiation it fell to me to initiate in 1990, when Parliament was much weaker, which President Hänsch continued and which was concluded under his presidency - has been given a greater dimension, since the correlation of forces has changed."
"Parliament is more powerful and must therefore act more responsibly."
"In this respect, we believe that we have taken an important step."
"The negotiation has been very long."
"It was expected that the framework agreement would be concluded in December of last year."
"There has been a very intense tug-of-war with the Commission, which led us to urge two of Parliament' s committee chairpersons, whose work I am grateful for, Mr Napolitano, of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and Mrs Theato, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to make progress in the negotiation, especially in relation to the third Annex."
"Madam President, it falls to you to conclude."
"I believe that thanks are due firstly to you, Madam President, and to the chairpersons of the committees I mentioned, to President Prodi and the Vice-President, Mrs De Palacio, for the fact that today we have this code of conduct."
"What we now have to do is adapt our internal regulations to this new reality."
"I would like to end by making a last observation to the Council, which has not taken part in this negotiation. It would perhaps be a good thing if the Council were also in a position and willing to adopt a standard of good conduct with Parliament in the budgetary field and in the political field."
"Madam President, that would be a step forward."
"Madam President, I believe the document that is before us today is a very significant document."
"I have taken steps to try to inform myself as to the equivalence that exists among governments and among national parliaments."
"Exceptionally, there may be one state of the 15 where more things that are conceded by way of openness to its parliament than in other states."
"But in the large majority of cases, there is no near equivalent and that is a significant element in this document."
"Secondly, we had a major debate in this House last year that centred among other things on the question of commissioners accepting individual and personal responsibility for the exercise of their high office."
"In this document there are significant clauses interpreting the mutual relationship between our institutions that also constitute significant progress."
"There are two points of criticism that my colleagues and my Group have asked to seek clarification on today."
"Article 1.4 in annex 3 regulates which persons or bodies within this House may request of the Commission access to confidential documents."
"Many of my colleagues are upset that no explicit reference is made to the rights of rapporteurs."
"We have brought the document as far as we can with the Commission, but I would say that, if we vote for it today, you must immediately instruct our Committee on Constitutional Affairs to take up the question of delineating the rules in the House that will make it easier for rapporteurs to make requests either of their chairmen or of the other bodies named in this document."
"If we include this, then many of my colleagues who have reservations, will vote yes."
"One final comment: this House has now begun its work on the question of transparency and the regulation on access to documents."
"Many of my colleagues have said to me - without anticipating the outcome of that work - that, should we ultimately need to review our framework in the light of any emerging trends in this regulation, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, should declare on the record, before the vote, that the Commission will be open to the idea of reviewing the document in the light of any evolving policy on transparency."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Commission Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, for having genuinely embarked on closer cooperation with Parliament in many respects."
"This spirit of co-operation is depicted very well in the agreement in those points which concern, for example, the right of Parliament to be involved when international agreements are being discussed, not only with regard to the end result, but at every stage of such talks."
"This we regard as a genuine step forward, and the same is true of the fact that the Commission is promising to do its best to keep the European Parliament informed on the intergovernmental conference."
"This symbolises the new spirit we are now creating with the Commission, and it is very important that the Commission and Parliament have mutual agreement."
"Unfortunately, however, Madam President, the Council has not approved of the process whereby these relations have come closer."
"My Group is very concerned about the developments that are under way in the Council."
"We hope and demand that the Council gives a public and open explanation about whether in future it intends to respect relations between Parliament and the Commission, or whether it intends to interfere in them in the future."
"The Council particularly seems to be aiming for secrecy in the matter of security and defence policy, and it would appear that not just the European Parliament - and via it, the public - will suffer from this attempt at secrecy, which entered the arena after these talks on agreements, when there was a call to amend the text, but also the European Commission will suffer as a result."
"We must support a strong Commission, and we must support the idea that in future the Commission will have a fixed role to play in the development of a common security and defence dimension, as these days no one area can remain exempt from the demand for transparency, and that includes a security and defence policy."
"Madam President, a majority of my Group will be voting for the framework agreement before us, even, and I would like to make this very clear, if we are not satisfied with all the points in this agreement."
"However, we assume that this agreement will serve to strengthen the relationship between the Commission and the Parliament, a relationship based on trust."
"You may be sure that if this House approves the framework agreement, Members in my Group will watch very closely to ensure that it is actually adhered to."
"I would like to make two critical comments and I am in agreement with the other members of my Group here."
"Firstly, the issue of openness and transparency as regards documents and information is extremely important for my Group."
"We assume that the agreement stipulated in point 13 will be strictly adhered to, in accordance with which the Members of this House will, as the only institution which has democratic legitimacy, be the first to be provided with information - and I mean all information - as only in that way can we exercise our mandate as the public expects of us."
"I therefore hope that this point 18, which relates to the exceptional provision of point 13, will never need to be applied."
"Secondly, we too have a comment for the Council."
"We were astonished by the Council' s intervention."
"I think that this really amounted to a very dubious form of interference in an agreement between the Commission and the Parliament, and, at that, by an institution that has quite rightly attracted criticism itself for meeting behind closed doors."
"Furthermore, given that the common security and defence policy is referred to here, at a time when we are aware that Europe is involved in establishing emergency armed forces for military intervention, this really does not bode well."
"One final comment: we all heard President Chirac address this House yesterday."
"He promised that the Council' s modus operandi would change in future."
"I believe that we will all be paying very close attention to what happens during the French Presidency and to whether the Council operates in a more transparent and democratic way in future."
"President, it is appropriate to reflect for a moment on how this interinstitutional agreement comes to be before us today for debate."
"It is very important that all the EU institutions operate effectively and efficiently and the 370 million citizens of the European Union must support and have confidence in the Union's internal legislative processes."
"One of the key legislative organs is the European Commission, which has the power to initiate the enactment of directives and regulations."
"The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers."
"Parliament is a democratically elected legislative body which has the overriding power of supervision over other key institutions."
"If the European Union is to operate more effectively then it is very important that the relationship between the Commission and Parliament is well defined and that is why the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament is being put in place."
"The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous."
"It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward."
"It is more exacting than the agreement that has existed between the two institutions over the past five years."
"I would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement."
"The two institutions will now agree to extend constructive dialogue and political cooperation, to improve the flow of information and to consult and inform Parliament on administrative reform within the Commission."
"There is also agreement, albeit not very extensive, on the EU legislative process, international agreements and the enlargement negotiations and procedures are put in place for the transmission of confidential Commission documents and information."
"One could argue that much of this framework agreement only clarifies existing provisions under the present EU Treaties."
"For example, I know that the Commission is required to keep Parliament informed of the enlargement negotiations to enable it to express its views in good time through appropriate parliamentary procedures."
"That is right and proper, in view of the fact that the European Parliament has to approve the right of any Member State to accede to the Union as a new and full Member."
"The Parliament also has the final say as to whether or not international agreements such as the WTO talks are approved."
"Parliament cannot be expected to make important decisions on such matters unless the necessary and appropriate information has been forwarded to the Members for their consideration."
"That is why the Commission must set in train open procedures to transmit up-to-date information on the whole range of regulations, directives and international accords being discussed and enacted by the Union."
"Finally, I am satisfied there is always a need to clarify the procedures for the transmission of confidential information."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I would like to stress that the framework agreement strikes an important balance in relations between our two institutions."
"It was difficult to achieve this compromise, and the Council' s last minute attempts to water down the agreement are evidence of how ambitious it is and of the way it places Parliament and the Commission in a relationship of cooperation, where Parliament performs a monitoring function in line with its prerogatives while the Commission has a range of tasks to add to its primary role of guardian of the Treaties and proposer of initiatives."
"I am certain that the right balance has been found."
"In my opinion, which, I know, differs from that of the Members who criticised the agreement, this was the best agreement that could have been achieved, including in terms of the transmission of documents, and I regret the fact that a slight excess on the part of some Members may well have prevented us from taking the mechanism regulating the transmission of documents further."
"However, I feel that this is a great step forward, and we look forward to the adoption and signing of this framework agreement in a few minutes' time."
"Madam President, my Group is to vote against the framework agreement."
"We are certain that a proper reading in the committees and further negotiation with Mr Prodi himself will produce a better result which we shall be able to vote in favour of."
"I should like to begin by correcting a misunderstanding."
"We do not want to prevent the Commission from being able to deliberate in confidence."
"It is important for every authority to have an internal phase of its proceedings in which any ideas may be discussed and any proposals appear on the table, without its being obliged to make them public."
"The Commission should also be entitled to have confidential drafts on the table throughout the preparative phase."
"Our demand to exercise supervision applies from the time when the Commission sends documents out or in the case of their being leaked, as happens not infrequently."
"If a proposal is no longer within the confines of the Commission, then the latter ought not to be able to refuse to let us see it."
"In that way, there would be equality for all, and that is not the case with the framework agreement."
"There are two humiliating situations in particular which we should like to avoid."
"In the legislation process, we sit, as we all know, in committees and debate draft bills."
"Behind us sit students, interns and people from the Permanent Representations with the confidential drafts marked 'restrained' , while we MEPs cannot obtain them."
"The lobbyists, who sit behind, also have them, but we elected representatives cannot obtain them."
"It also often happens that we read in the newspaper about a leaked Commission proposal."
"We are asked to comment on it, but we cannot obtain a copy."
"It is a humiliating situation which is completely unacceptable."
"When he took up his post, Mr Prodi promised to bring this situation to an end."
"We should be legally entitled to obtain documents when they are no longer within the confines of the Commission."
"And it is as individual MEPs and rapporteurs that we should have this legal entitlement and not by going down on our knees before the President."
"What is more, a President might come along to whom one preferred not to kowtow."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I am very concerned indeed about the reports that have appeared in the press, both in France and elsewhere, in the last few days about the opening of an investigation in France by the public prosecutor's office in relation to Echelon as well as, apparently, a parallel investigation into Echelon by the French secret service, the DST."
"The European Parliament is an important body."
"I am therefore very concerned that these two different inquiries, which may proceed as a result of any votes taken here today, will cause confusion, difficulty and may indeed prejudice the position of the European Parliament."
"We shall certainly support the Conference of Presidents' proposal, but in view of my earlier remarks we should now reconsider this position, or at least be given some assurances about the French authorities' actions on this matter."
"Madam President, we have just spoken at length about transparency in relations between the Commission and Parliament."
"I think that we also need transparency in our debates."
"Consequently, before an important vote such as that which are about to take, we must not be under any illusions as to what is at stake."
"I should like, if you will allow me, to make two basic comments."
"First, the Echelon system was treated somewhat tritely in a number of parallel discussions, including at the Conference of Presidents."
"It was said that surveillance took place anyway, it was even added, some even said that it was important to have surveillance systems in order to track down serious criminals."
"This is undoubtedly true, but surveillance must take place within a legal framework first of all, which is not the case with Echelon."
"Finally, an important distinction needs to be made: Echelon is, in fact, a surveillance system which targets not specific communications but all communications and data transfers."
"Consequently, all communications are intercepted and then analysed by super-computers and classified on the basis of a lexicon of key words."
"This global bugging strategy clearly infringes the confidentiality of private communications and, as such, violates the Treaty and directives ..."
"Mr Lannoye, we cannot open a debate now."
"My second comment, Madam President, I am sorry, but we have not had a debate in this House."
"I think that we also need to make a clear distinction ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Everyone in this House is well aware of the difference between a committee of inquiry and a temporary committee."
"Madam President, my motion is that we hold a vote on this matter."
"The committee which I have the honour to chair examined the STOA report."
"We know quite clearly what the position of the different Members of the House is on this, and the Conference of Presidents has quite rightly presented proposals to us."
"There is only one question which arises: whether we should look at one particular system which might be an invasion of privacy, or at all potential systems that might be an invasion of privacy."
"There are clear amendments on our order paper today which deal with that point."
"I move that we now hold a vote on this matter."
"Madam President, I have no intention of opening a debate."
"It is just that a new point raised responds to the main objection lodged against the proposal for a committee of inquiry, i.e. that we cannot investigate the activities of the secret services."
"Today a Member State, France, is in fact launching an official investigation into what the Echelon system was, is and may yet be."
"I therefore think that the main objection to a committee of inquiry has been removed and this is a new point which needs to be taken into account when we vote."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Proposal for a decision (B5-0593/2000), by the Conference of Presidents, setting up a temporary committee on the 'Echelon' interception system"
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Report (A5-0175/2000) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering (COM(1999) 352 - C5-0065/1999 - 1999/0152(COD))"
"Before the vote on Amendment No 26:Lehne (PPE-DE)."
"(DE) Madam President, this is exactly the point I am seeking to have corrected."
"I had already brought this to the attention of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"This amendment relates to Article 6(3) of the 1991 directive which is to be amended and to Article 1(5) of the present directive, which is to amend the old directive."
"In the middle of the second subparagraph, the German version correctly reads: ""... for the purposes of representation in legal proceedings or in the context of legal advice"" ."
"The German version is the authoritative version as far as our consultation is concerned, as German is the rapporteur' s language."
"The English version is incorrect and simply reads ""in order to be able to represent him in legal proceedings"" ."
"The ""legal advice"" aspect is missing from the English version."
"I pointed this out during the discussions in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, but for some reason this error of translation has still not been rectified."
"This is of particularly critical importance, because the Council conducts its proceedings on the basis of the English text."
"I would ask you to instruct the officials to rectify this and to correct the English text by basing it on an accurate translation of the German text."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0179/2000) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (COM(2000) 27 - C5-0166/2000 - 2000/0030(CNS))"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, we voted in favour of this proposal solely so that the people of Yugoslavia, who have paid dearly for the crimes committed by its dictator, Milosevic, by suffering the NATO bombings and the subsequent boycott imposed on them, do not keep paying."
"However, we reaffirm that it should be up to the powers responsible for destroying the bridges and, consequently, obstructing the Danube, to pay the costs."
"Agreement between the European Union and Cyprus (C5-0324/2000)"
"According to the agreement between the European Union and Cyprus, the cost of participation in the programme by Cypriot undertakings will be covered in full by the Republic of Cyprus."
"However, the equivalent cost for candidate countries in central Europe is covered out of Community funds."
"Although the sum provided for in the agreement is small, this is not a question of quantity but of principle."
"In addition, Cyprus also covers the cost of its participation in other programmes."
"The people of Cyprus are clearly being wronged here."
"I should also like to point out that the total cost of adapting Cyprus to Community acquis is put at between 500 and 900 million Cyprus pounds, i.e. between EUR 1 and 1.8 billion, while the funding received by the Republic of Cyprus from the European Union is minute."
"Obviously economic relations between Cyprus and the European Union are unfairly stacked against the Republic of Cyprus and the people of Cyprus have nothing to gain from accession, which is why the members of the Communist Party of Greece abstained rather than vote in favour."
"- (EL) I should like to use the vote on the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus on small and medium-sized enterprises to raise the issue of the new provocative action by the Denktash regime in Strovilia, where the occupying forces have advanced their position on the green line in an arbitrary act of aggression just a few days before proximity talks are due to start in Geneva."
"The Council of Ministers, and the French presidency in particular, must react, especially in the direction of Turkey, whose forces now occupy almost half the Republic of Cyprus."
"At the same time, the European Union should raise the issue of when the occupying forces are due to start withdrawing during the debate on partnership between the European Union and Turkey as a condition for continuing negotiations between the EU and Turkey."
"Schmid report (A5-0176/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Schmid report, which is intended to prevent forgery of credit cards and other means of payment which do not involve filthy lucre."
"I voted for the motion partly because pensioners and the elderly are among the most frequent victims of this type of forgery - as always the prime targets - in the hope that, when we return to the issue, a decision will, at last, be taken to acknowledge that when a citizen is the victim of a crime the State is liable, albeit indirectly, in the same way as it is at football matches."
"I therefore hope that a decision will soon be taken to oblige the State to pay compensation to victims of common crimes, and therefore also to provide compensation for citizens who have been the victims of fraud."
"Lienemann report (A5-0172/2000)"
"Mr President, of course I voted for the motion."
"Article 3 of this measure sets aside EUR 300 million to be spent between 2000 and 2004 on the protection of birds in general and certain important species of bird in particular."
"Of course I am in favour of this measure, for I love birds."
"Before I set off for Parliament, I saw Lulù, my pussycat, carrying a bird in her mouth."
"I distracted her with some cat food - we all love cats - I distracted her, picked up the bird and took it into the house, where it was lovingly looked after."
"I am thus in favour of protecting birds, but I would like the Greens, who are the most prominent party in the field, to attend to the poor old pensioners and elderly people who have nothing to eat as well, and all to come straight over - the Greens I mean - and join the Pensioners' Party."
". (PT) I welcome the fact that the conciliation procedure on the proposal for a regulation on the financial instrument for the third stage of the LIFE Programme (2000-2004) has been completed, thus allowing further projects to be financed under the new programme in the second half of this year."
"I also welcome the fact that the amendments relating to the objectives of the programme have been approved, as has the compromise proposal for a new programme."
"Nevertheless, given that LIFE is the only instrument for directly promoting the European Union' s environmental policy, and has achieved substantial results, it is bound to be a matter for regret that the reference budget for LIFE-III has been set at EUR 640 million, that is only EUR 27 million more than in the common position of the Commission and the Council. This is a long way from the EUR 850 million proposed by the European Parliament at first and second reading."
"- (FR) Here we are, engaged in a trial of strength with the Council, to defend the budgetary line for the environment within the European Union."
"It is with regret that we have supported the compromise reached during the conciliation procedure with the Council."
"I say with regret, because Parliament was expected to be satisfied with the few crumbs thrown at us by the Council."
"The bonus granted out of the EUR 850 million demanded is roughly the equivalent of about twenty kilometres of motorway in France!"
"I only hope that the size of this budgetary line is not a pale reflection of the Union's environmental policy, not that I am questioning the considerable work carried out by the directorate-general for the environment or the Commissioner, who do the best they can with the means at their disposal."
"But we shall continue to repeat until we are blue in the face that a real European environmental policy can only be applied, or even constructed, with the necessary funds."
"The environment will never be taken seriously with a budgetary line of this size, compared with the budgets for agriculture or the Structural Funds which still often have an adverse impact on the environment."
"LIFE is just a drop in the ocean of European policy."
"That aside, is the environment not the only European sector to have shown no real improvement?"
"With the explosion in road transport within the Union, we are also seeing an explosion of all sorts of pollution and emissions, especially of greenhouse gases."
"How much longer will we need to repeat this point before anything is done?"
"When the Council and the Commission start taking environmental policy seriously, the budgetary line which they propose in the general budget will be commensurate with the challenges we have to face."
"This applies both to environmental policy projects and to the human resources which the DG for the environment needs in order to implement them."
"Jarzembowski report (A5-0173/2000)"
"Mr President, the three key factors which typify the transport of people and goods in terms of competition are price, reliability and speed."
"It is possible that the railway industry has not been quite up to scratch because, for the time being, it has largely lost the competitive battle to road transport and aviation."
"This is why it is sensible to find out how the railway industry could function better and how its market share in Europe can grow."
"I can think of different ways to achieve this."
"French rail is currently expanding considerably, with growing employment, by doing the exact opposite of what Mr Jarzembowski proposes in his report."
"Accordingly, the root of the problem is different from how the rapporteur sees it."
"The real problem is that politicians have for years neglected the railway industry, mainly because they considered it to be a crumbling vestige of the 19th century which would not make it into the 21st century anyway."
"All new investments were poured into a dense network of motorways and increasingly large airports."
"Only when the environmental consequences of this policy became apparent did attention shift back to the railways."
"But at that time, the concept that freedom for the economy was more important than democratic input in politics had already taken hold."
"Politicians no longer wanted that input in public enterprises and, with it, shirked the responsibility of acting as inspector on behalf of the consumer and as guardian of employment."
"Public enterprises started to shape up as private companies, increasingly so, where growth, profit and market value were considered more important than the social consequences of their actions."
"Taking care of public transport and the environment should be of concern to all of us, including therefore our democratically elected government."
"Whether or not it is judicious to separate infrastructure from the operation of the railway industry is to be decided by the national or regional governments and is not a task of the European Union."
"And it is certainly not up to the European Union to implement forced privatisation of urban or regional transport companies, as is in danger of happening in the short term."
"For my Group, these considerations are sufficient to reject Mr Jarzembowski' s proposals out of hand and to express the hope that they could never be translated into policy."
"I voted for Mr Jarzembowski' s excellent report with pleasure, for there is nothing more relevant to Europe and to bringing together its citizens than the railways."
"Free competition in the railway sector can only improve the condition of both goods and passenger railway transport, and, in my mind' s eye, I can already see pensioners and elderly people who are, at last, able to spend their time travelling around Europe in sleeper and restaurant cars - comfortable carriages which are absolutely essential for them precisely because of their age."
"I look forward to the day when, thanks to this and future measures, it will be possible to travel here to Strasbourg by rail to visit the European Parliament from anywhere in Europe."
"Mr President, complete liberalisation would lead to an increase in competition in the rail sector and enhance the competitiveness of railways as compared with road transport."
"There is no point in talking about projects to extend the European rail network until complete liberalisation has taken place."
"This is therefore a matter of urgency."
"Projects such as the Brenner base tunnel can only compete if freight transport can be offered at competitive rates."
"Adopting this directive would give a clear signal about liberalising rail transport."
"If a clear split is not made between the trains operated by the railway companies on the one hand and the management of railway infrastructure on the other, the objective of this directive will be seriously undermined."
"I have therefore rejected the solution opted for in Article 6(4) of the common position."
"Mr President, as we were at second reading, I was unable to register my opposition to the Swoboda and, more importantly, the Jarzembowski report."
"The Council and the Commission had struck a certain balance by taking account of the specific situation of small networks and remote islands."
"Parliament, in its perennial quest to go one step further and faster than the Commission and the Council, has wheeled out its regulating steamroller and wants to put all the networks in one basket."
"We have been told that liberalising rail transport will give us far more services."
"Everyone knows this will only apply to main lines with a heavy volume of traffic and that competition for public services will concentrate on profitable lines; the rest will have to provide public services under conditions which are sometimes less than favourable."
"I am against this ultra-liberal logic and was anxious to register my opposition."
"- (FR) There is no point in beating about the bush; I refuse to subscribe to the ultra-liberal vision set before us in the Jarzembowski report."
"He goes far beyond what is proposed in the common position presented by the Council."
"He advocates radical liberalisation of the Community's railways and refuses to grant any derogations, despite the fact that they are essential if we are to adapt gradually to new regulations."
"He proposes a transitional period of 5 years for the liberalisation of international freight services, adding that the Member States must have liberalised the entire national and international network for freight 5 years after the entry into force of the directive."
"And to crown it all, by 2010, he hopes that the entire network will have been liberalised for both freight and passenger services!"
"At no point does Mr Jarzembowski worry about public service obligations, which continue to be of prime importance in this sector."
"At no point does he refer to the risks which radical liberalisation might have in terms of safety."
"That is why I have not voted in favour of any of his proposed amendments."
"- (FR) Rail transport today stands at the heart of the public service deregulation and liberalisation projects being implemented by the European Union."
"According to the conclusions of the Jarzembowski report, the revision of Directive 91/440 throws the door to privatisation wide open by proposing that infrastructure management and the provision of transport services be separated and that every undertaking be given access to infrastructure in the medium term, the objective being to open up all freight and passenger transport to the markets and to competition."
"The approach taken in the Jarzembowski report is to bring the management of railway undertakings into line with private sector management as much as possible and to introduce the pressure of competition."
"It uses shortcomings in the operation of the public service as a pretext and highlights the superior performance of the private sector on the basis of imperfect comparisons which fail to take account of all the factors and all the missions that have been accomplished."
"The logic behind the Jarzembowski report will inevitably lead to a deterioration in safety standards, poorer quality services, a reduction in services to customers and a loss of social rights for employees."
"This report turns its back on what the European public really needs: a public service that is coordinated and harmonised at European level, which could guarantee a high standard of efficiency, safety and equity for employees and users alike, right away."
"This is why, unable as I am to accept either the status quo or the forward march of liberalisation, however progressive and well-planned, I have voted against the Jarzembowski report."
"- We all applaud the coming of the second age of railways, and acknowledge that market liberalisation can continue with economic opportunity and public service needs to bring it about."
"The UK invented railways, developed them and was the first to privatise them."
"As a member of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union in Britain my view is guided by the balance we strike in railway development."
"We should have acknowledged here that European railway systems are all different, and their diversity merits the derogations proposed."
"We should have placed greater emphasis on the introduction of rail regulators, as the UK now has, and less on the ideology of physical separation of infrastructure and operating services."
"And we need to be absolutely certain that we have licensing systems which carry obligations, and network benefits for passengers."
"No one should have ignored these issues in the vote we cast today."
"Swoboda report (A5-0171/2000)"
"Mr President, everyone is agreed that something needs to change within the railway industry."
"It needs to operate within a large-scale European network instead of just within the individual Member State borders."
"Long waiting and transfer times at borders and the fact that direct international connections have ceased to exist are a cause of frustration."
"We would all like to see ineffective, conservative and bureaucratic procedures brought to an end. Indeed, they cause frustration amongst users and unnecessarily drive freight and passengers onto other types of transport."
"I indicated yesterday as well as during previous debates that cooperation between the railway companies of the different Member States should be stepped up, so as to offer joint solutions for cross-border traffic."
"This cooperation should have been sought a long time ago."
"If this had been the case, there would have been fewer opportunities for those intending to elbow out existing railway companies by introducing newcomers onto the market which offer price reductions to the detriment of the working environment, working conditions and the environment in general."
"Mr Swoboda is right in stating that years of lack of investment in capacity, infrastructure and technology must now be rectified."
"He entertains the possibility of authorities offering financial compensation in order to make the use of railways safe for public transport and does not rule out a role for public companies in future."
"On the other hand, however, his statement that, in this line of industry, rights must be available to all to an equal extent, makes him a hostage to liberal ideas."
"This is borne out in his ideas that we should aim for full recovery of costs rather than expect extra charges for each additional train."
"One unintended consequence could be that passengers and freight are forced to use alternatives which, can, on this basis, compete structurally at lower prices."
"These are cheaper for the consumer, but cost society as a whole more dearly because these alternatives cannot afford to care as much about workers and the environment."
"In addition, Mr Swoboda has deleted the exemption rules for islands and Member States which do not have cross-border railway connections, as formulated in the Council' s common position."
"In his opinion, everyone should be affected by liberalisation to the same degree."
"In our view, this deletion does not constitute an improvement on the Council' s position."
"Mr President, I voted for the Swoboda report as well."
"I totally disagree with the previous speaker, for I consider that the liberalisation of public services may work to the advantage of the citizens, particularly in that the Swoboda report provides for an appropriate public-benefit transport service eligible for State compensation."
"In voting for the motion, I call upon the States to decide to allow the least well-off citizens, those who have nothing, and that includes pensioners and the elderly, whose pensions are not even sufficient to allow them to live properly, to travel free of charge."
"The States of Europe must assist the least well-off citizens by providing them with free services."
"The Railway Infrastructure Package agreed by the Transport Council last December was the result of some very difficult negotiations."
"The common position represents a delicate balance which supports the principles of liberalisation of the industry while giving due consideration to the particularities of individual Member States."
"Part of this common position includes a complex derogation in respect of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Greece as well as further considerations for Luxembourg."
"In the case of Greece and of both parts of the island of Ireland there are obvious geographical obstacles to full participation in a single rail market."
"In these circumstances, full implementation of the Rail Package would result in a considerable burden on the administrations of these Member States without any of the benefits to consumers that the Package is designed to bring about."
"The amendments which I tabled to Mr Jarzembowski' s and Mr Swoboda' s reports aimed at restoring the equilibrium established by the common position."
"The Council position is, I believe, in the best interests of both the rail industry and the consumer."
"I would further like to point out that the derogation for Ireland, Northern Ireland, Greece and Luxembourg only covers those elements of the package where implementation would serve no real and practical purpose."
"Furthermore, there are even in-built safeguard clauses in this derogation which would cause the whole derogation to lapse should any new entrant to the rail markets of Ireland or Greece appear."
"In summary, colleagues, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism I recognise the desirability of developing a single market in rail-service provision and the potential benefits for the consumer."
"The granting of a derogation to the geographically-separated rail networks of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Greece does not in any way undermine this principle."
"On the other hand, removal of the derogation would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and costs in these Member States without bringing any visible benefits to anyone concerned."
"- I wish to place on record my serious concern at the decision of the EP to seek the deletion of the Irish (including Northern Ireland and Greece) derogation from the full effects of this directive."
"The European Parliament's position is based on the mistaken view that it is possible to have a 'one size fits all' approach to Europe's railways."
"There are clearly circumstances relating to the island of Ireland and the isolated position of Greece as far as railways are concerned which require to be taken into account."
"- (FR) Mr Jarzembowski feels that the European Union should do the impossible in order to complete the internal market in the railway sector by 2005, with a view to giving railway undertakings a chance to regain part of the road transport market."
"We can only welcome such an objective, which is doubly desirable, both from the economic and the ecological point of view."
"However, we are against total liberalisation of the railways in the form recommended."
"We do not want to have a single model imposed on us!"
"Railway transport in France is a precious public service, a real tool for regional planning in the broad sense of the term, above all, from the rural point of view."
"The model of the French railways is also a factor in social cohesion."
"In fact, it is perfectly normal to maintain services to unprofitable stations by funding them from much more profitable stations."
"That is why, as a French member of the EDD Group, I feel it is important to defend the notion of a public service in this procedure."
"Furthermore, absolute and compulsory liberalisation of the railway infrastructure might hamper the development of the Community railways as a result, for example, of the instability and uncertainty which it would introduce into a market which needs a high level of technical expertise and investment both for the railway undertakings and the local authorities."
"To conclude, I would remind you that, as a Member for the EDD Group, I support maintaining employment and social cohesion, especially in rural areas, in order to safeguard activities."
"It is even more important to ensure that the public services provided in our villages do not disappear."
"If the railways are liberalised, we can kiss rural life goodbye, which is why we are opposed to this blind liberalisation and its consequences."
"- (SV) The present increase in haulage in Europe is untenable in the long term."
"The heavy goods traffic on the roads creates problems in the form of congestion, noise and emissions of environmentally harmful substances."
"In order to curb this development, goods transported by road ought to be transferred to the railways."
"However, the system that we have in Europe today with fifteen separate railway systems makes it impossible for railway traffic to compete on the same terms as road traffic."
"Therefore, the railways in the EU need to be liberalised and the market for the transportation of goods by rail needs to be opened up."
"The members of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Pierre Schori, Anneli Hulthén, Jan Andersson, Maj-Britt Theorin, Göran Färm and Ewa Hedkvist Petersen would like to stress the following points of view in connection with the consideration of Mr Jarzembowski's and Mr Swoboda's draft recommendations for second reading."
"One of the most important measures for reducing the competitive disadvantages faced by the railways is to separate those responsible for the infrastructure from the transport firms."
"Such a separation must be effected as quickly as possible, as it is a prerequisite for different transport firms being able to compete with each other on the same terms as apply within other forms of transport."
"Fair competition also requires rail fees to be based on the principal of marginal costs."
"The fees must be based on the traffic-related costs arising during transportation in connection with, for example, noise, effects on the environment, risks of accidents etc."
"The aim is to create a system of fees that is neutral with regard to competition and does not discriminate against any form of transport."
"Wieland report (A5-0174/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Wieland report because there needs to be an increase in professional requirements in the European Union. I am referring in particular to the skills of nurses and doctors."
"This report rightly increases the minimum length of training required to become a general practitioner from two to three years and I support this step."
"However, in voting for the motion, I am also expressing a desire for further measures. Although it is a good thing to have skilled doctors to treat patients, it is also a good thing if citizens who are ill in the European Union are able to treat themselves."
"Sadly, the poor, the elderly and a great many pensioners hardly have enough money to live on and can only afford one meal a day."
"These people cannot afford to buy medicine."
"In voting for the motion, I therefore call for medical assistance to be provided for the citizens who are least well-off as well."
"- (FR) We have voted in favour of all the amendments which foster recognition throughout the European Union of diplomas and qualifications obtained in one state."
"We support anything which helps unify the conditions of workers and facilitate an awareness of their identity and interests beyond frontiers."
"We have also voted in favour of all the amendments that aim to foster the wider recognition of qualifications as well as exchanges of information between countries, despite the fact that many of these amendments are somewhat vague."
"But we have noted a degree of hypocrisy as regards doctors from third countries, whose qualifications and diplomas are not recognised."
"The report states that there are no reliable studies of the problem."
"But in numerous countries, and in France at least, hundreds of foreign doctors working in hospitals are underpaid because their diplomas are not recognised."
"We therefore need to take action quickly so that their qualifications are recognised."
"Shortcomings in the health sector, unequal access to quality care from competent professionals, inequalities between regions and, more importantly, between social classes, do not result from the inadequate harmonisation of regulations."
"They result from the lack of funds provided to public health services."
"More generally, they result from the fact that a society marked by inequality inevitably ends up with multiple track medical services."
"- (FR) I welcome this initiative to simplify and clarify the directives on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications."
"In fact, having been contacted regularly by students who have come up against the recognition system introduced in the 1989 and 1992 directives, I would say without exaggeration that the situation is desperate."
"We do not realise just how obscure the mechanisms are."
"Total legal insecurity is the overriding feature in this area."
"Too many students come up against a brick wall when they apply to administrations in the Member States to obtain validation, precious validation, of their qualifications."
"This is mainly because it is difficult to identify which department they need to address, but it is also because the staff in these departments have insufficient training to meet their demands."
"As a result, they are sent from one department to another, which of course slows down the whole procedure."
"All too often they meet unsubstantiated refusal, putting them in an absolutely intolerable situation which prevents them from accessing the job market in another Member State."
"As a matter of principle, this is a flagrant violation of their freedom of movement."
"In human terms, these people are denied the right to exercise their profession, thereby negating all the effort which they have put into obtaining their professional qualifications in the first place."
"Then there is the problem of the cost of the recognition procedure, which appears to me to be far too high."
"I am therefore delighted that steps are finally being taken which will allow the theoretical freedom of movement of persons to be translated into practice, albeit still far from perfect practice!"
"Specifically, the proposal for a directive contains a number of welcome provisions clarifying existing legislation."
"For example, provision is made for host states to take account of experience acquired by interested parties after they obtained their diploma and they can no longer demand compensatory measures (aptitude test) as a matter of course."
"A new provision also allows the required two years professional experience to be avoided."
"What is also needed is to provide legal security with regard to the recognition of training obtained by Community nationals in third countries."
"The European Parliament proposed numerous other provisions at first reading, mainly seeking to extend the information requirements of the Member States."
"The Council rejected all our proposed amendments."
"That demonstrates and says a lot about the lack of political will in this area."
"- I wish to place on record my satisfaction that current directives governing architects' qualifications are adequate to enable those who are not currently registered as architects in Ireland to become registered as such."
"This obviously requires negotiation and agreement between various architects' representative bodies in Ireland on a registration process."
"Framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission (C5-0349/2000)"
"Mr President, the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, as has been presented to us today, is diametrically opposed to the prospect held out by President Prodi of making European documents as widely available to the public as they are in those Member States which have moved furthest in the direction of transparency."
"The agreement bears out existing practice and even limits public access to a certain extent."
"A right which all MEPs still have at present would, on the basis of this decision, soon be limited to a chosen few, whilst at the same time, the list of documents which can only be supplied with the permission of third parties would be extended to include international organisations such as the WTO and the World Bank."
"Parliament has not even had the opportunity to discuss or amend this agreement."
"A government which keeps information from its citizens is unreliable but a government which does not even take its own parliamentarians seriously is not ready for democracy yet."
"Fortunately, a number of Member States, including the Netherlands, have enjoyed better practices for many years now."
"This framework agreement illustrates how backward the European Union still is, and this promises little in the way of the possibility of involving the electorate in a democratic way."
"This is why I have naturally voted against."
"Mr President, I have both spoken and voted against the framework agreement, because I think it is an insult both to freely elected Members of this House and to the electorate."
"I cannot understand why we are being given a two-class system of rights, why ordinary Members and even rapporteurs are not being trusted to see confidential information."
"This is a fundamental requirement if we are really to take our job of scrutinising the Commission' s actions seriously."
"I fear that this framework agreement will basically perpetuate the policy of inadequate transparency that we have seen in recent years, instead of seizing a genuine opportunity and finally attempting to do justice to our remit by ensuring greater transparency and preventing the Commission from continuing to take refuge behind confidential documents."
"I would have liked to have seen all Members being treated equally and no one having more or less rights - that should have been the starting point!"
"- (FR) The framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission contains numerous useful clarifications, especially on the flow of information."
"Nevertheless, like 145 other Members, especially those who are members of the SOS Democracy intergroup, I did not vote, for two reasons."
"First, Annex 3, which restricts the transmission of confidential information to the European Parliament, represents a step backwards in comparison with the current situation."
"It is true that the European Parliament cannot always be relied on when it comes to questions of confidentiality."
"But, conversely, the Commission may use these provisions to cloud delicate questions relating to it."
"Secondly, and more importantly, the framework agreement makes absolutely no mention of the fundamental issue of the policy governing relations between the Commission and journalists of its liking."
"Documents should not normally be given to the press before being sent to the Council and Parliament."
"But this is a far cry from what actually happens."
"We frequently read in the newspapers about Commission proposals which, officially, are still confidential."
"This puts Members in the ridiculous position of having to comment on texts which they know nothing about."
"These incidents are no accident."
"This is a deliberate policy on the part of the Commission to win journalists' favour by leaking texts to those who qualify as friends, so that they can benefit from them."
"Anyone not on the list of friends goes to press a week later and therefore appears not to be at the cutting edge, which is obviously very bad for them."
"So, logically, everyone tries to please the Commission in order to get on its list of friends."
"This is one of the ways in which the Commission keeps everyone under control."
"Consequently, a framework agreement which wanted a minimum code of conduct would have needed to clearly prohibit the Commission from leaking documents to journalists before sending them to members and would have needed to make provision for officials guilty of infringing this rule to be punished."
"With no such provisions, we feel that the Commission's good resolutions on transparency are seriously misleading."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have voted against the framework agreement because it does not, in its current form, fulfil the conditions for an open and transparent exchange of information between Parliament and the Commission."
"Article 276 of the Treaty states that the Commission should submit all the necessary information to Parliament in connection with the discharge procedure."
"The framework agreement restricts this provision."
"According to the framework agreement, it is only the Conference of Presidents, Parliament' s President and the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control who can ask the Commission for information."
"Rapporteurs and 'ordinary' MEPs can therefore be denied access to information."
"From a political point of view, it is unacceptable that the chairman of the Committee should be able to decide which information can be passed on."
"It is also problematic from a legal point of view because, according to Parliament' s Rules of Procedure, liability is delegated to the rapporteur."
"From a practical point of view, it will lengthen the discharge procedure."
"According to the framework agreement, Parliament and the Commission are to come to an agreement as to which documents are to be handed over."
"It is unreasonable, however, that the Commission (which is to be supervised) should be involved in deciding which information is to be made available."
"Moreover, the procedures governing confidential documents are very protracted and may be misused by the Commission to avoid making information available."
"We hope that a better agreement will successfully be reached regarding the provision of information as an integral part of the discharge procedure."
"In its present form, the agreement constitutes a restriction on Parliament' s right to information, as guaranteed under the Treaty."
"- (SV) Parliament is responsible for granting discharge from liability and for monitoring how the Commission has utilised the Union's funds."
"In order to be able to make a well-founded decision, Parliament needs the information that it considers to be necessary."
"The way the framework agreement, and in particular Annex 3, is worded, it gives the Commission the final decision in any dispute as to whether a document shall be handed over to Parliament or not."
"It is completely unacceptable that the body that is to be inspected should make its own decision as to what information the inspector is to have."
"We consider this agreement to contravene Article 276 of the Treaty which clearly stipulates that Parliament shall have access to the information it requires."
"The agreement also applies to other areas of cooperation with the Commission, and in these areas, too, there are retrograde steps in relation to promises that were previously made."
"As regards information on international agreements, there had been a step forward in this area before the governments of the Member States intervened and changed the text for the worse."
"Even the Nordic governments have supported a change for the worse that has now resulted in Member States not even needing to give reasons why they do not want the Commission to pass on documents that they themselves have given to the Commission."
"On 8 June 2000, the Conference of Presidents of Parliament adopted the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission."
"The vote on this issue will be held during the July part-session, but Members of Parliament will not be given the opportunity to discuss it or to table any amendments."
"Without any more detailed examination or discussion within the groups, the group chairmen have adopted this framework agreement which transfers the power of decision over which documents Parliament shall have access to the Commission."
"This means that the elected representatives will not obtain any real insight into the legislative proceedings, but will be left in the background or on the sidelines."
"The group chairmen unanimously requested the Commission to grant the Members of Parliament the legal right of access to the documents which are issued in other connections."
"On 8 June, however, they accepted that Mr Prodi would not fulfil all the promises he made when he took office."
"As Members of Parliament, we ought to have the legal right to complete information."
"Of course, there may be justifiable exceptions that must be respected."
"There is no doubt that the Commission, as an executive body, is fully within its rights to investigate different points of view and prepare drafts in the form of internal working documents without the obligation to publish them."
"However, it ought to be beyond all doubt that, at the same time as a document is given to someone outside the Commission, Parliament should have the right to the same information."
"If a newspaper publishes material from documents that have been leaked, Members of Parliament cannot get access to the documents in question."
"Trainees at the Council of Ministers or at the offices of the Permanent Representations of the Member States have access to documents which Members of Parliament have no opportunity to consult, not even the committee and group chairmen or the rapporteurs."
"When Romano Prodi visited Parliament last spring to introduce himself before the present Commission was installed in office, he promised that Members of Parliament would have access to documents if they were passed on to authorities or organisations outside the Commission or leaked to the media."
"Because the framework agreement involves certain improvements upon current practice, it should not be rejected in its entirety."
"It should, however, at least contain the promises Mr Prodi made on behalf of the Commission."
"The closed door policy is unacceptable to the public, the elected representatives and journalists alike."
"Members of Parliament must fight for their rights as elected representatives."
". (NL) The framework agreement undeniably contains a number of interesting ideas for increased transparency in the relations between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"But I cannot endorse the proposed regulation with regard to confidential documents."
"The fact that an application to peruse confidential documents has to go through committee chairmen or the President of the European Parliament is unacceptable to me."
"Furthermore, it is not up to one institution to decide on what is confidential and what is not."
"This is why I have abstained from the vote."
"The 'Echelon' System (B5-0593 and 0594/2000)"
"Mr President, the European Parliament has brought disgrace upon itself today and seriously undermined its own credibility."
"It has just refused to set up a committee of inquiry into the 'Echelon' surveillance system set up by the United States, a worldwide system which violates civil liberties, distorts economic competition and attacks the basic interests of the countries of Europe."
"In return, Parliament has appeased its conscience by adopting a greatly watered down procedure, a temporary committee which, under the terms of our Rules of Procedure, will have far fewer investigative powers than a committee of inquiry."
"And, in order to be really sure that it will be ineffectual, Parliament has drowned its mandate in vast questions such as risks from secret services in general to individual rights or the value of the protection offered by coding to the private lives of our citizens."
"And yet, 172 Members - including us - took the initiative and called for a vote in favour of a committee of inquiry; however, the Conference of Presidents, under the influence of the Socialists and Christian Democrats, is taking its orders from someone - I certainly do not know who - who has managed to run this procedure off the pitch."
"This attitude contrasts with that of the French public prosecutor, who recently and courageously instructed our security service to investigate the Echelon network."
"For us, this illustrates the fact that, despite its proclamations, the European Parliament, cut off as it is from the people, is the weak link in the chain of civil protection and bends too easily under pressure from foreign interests."
"To close, I should like to reiterate what I called for in my intervention on 30 March, i.e. that the 'Echelon' network should be neutralised or, if it is felt that it has a part to play in the fight against organised crime, its remit should be divided between the countries or entrusted to a properly controlled international organisation."
"."
"(EL) According to the hearing of the parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Echelon system has been upgraded by the USA. and the United Kingdom to a global telecommunications spy system, the victims of which include the countries of the European Union."
"The presence of Echelon bases in the Republic of Cyprus, i.e. the British bases, are particular important and are tied into Anglo-American attempts to obstruct the independence of Cyprus."
"The issue has huge implications for the democracy and freedom of communications."
"The European Parliament should set up a full committee of inquiry pursuant to Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, just as it did with extremely positive results during the mad cow crisis."
"Setting up a simple temporary committee pursuant to Rule 150 will not, I fear, allow Parliament to throw any light on Echelon and will be tantamount to bowing to pressure from the USA. and Great Britain."
"- (FR) The United States is spying on us, using a network of satellites, aerials and super-computers, via 'Anglo-Saxon' relay states such as Australia, New Zealand and even Great Britain, one of the Fifteen, one of the Member States of the European Union, which allows its territory and Gibraltar to be used so that the 14 other Member States can be spied on, despite the principle of Community loyalty."
"It has been established from and confirmed by numerous sources that this wholesale bugging of all telephone signals has had considerable economic and commercial repercussions, to the detriment of European companies such as Alcatel or Airbus, which have lost huge contracts to American multinationals privy to privileged information obtained fraudulently and illegally."
"Conditions of fair international commerce, with fair competition, have therefore been damaged, while within the WTO, on agricultural procedures, for example, the United States continually accuses Europe of undermining healthy international competition by granting aid, income support, export subsidies and certain production subsidies."
"This state of affairs cannot simply be ignored by the Commission, by the Council of Ministers or by Parliament, which is always anxious to apply the principle of precaution which, in this case, would allow us to protect Europe's economic health and its financial interests."
"How are we to explain this curious conduct, with 15 States agreeing to be spied on, 20 Commissioners agreeing to be spied on and a huge majority of the 626 members of the European Parliament, who are always calling for more transparency from the Council, still agreeing to cloud the issue of this American Echelon network which is spying on us?"
"How is it that all the European institutions and the people in them agree to what, under the laws of the 15 Member States, constitutes a serious criminal offence, in the narrow sense of the word, and is liable to punishment as such?"
"Instead of which, what threats and what pressure have persuaded several hundred European decision-makers, ministers, Commissioners and Members of Parliament to become accessories to the crime of espionage and undermine state security?"
"This question is fundamental because it conditions the very raison d'être of the European structure."
"Why, in fact, are we constructing Europe?"
"To be stronger, more independent, richer?"
"Obviously, the answer is yes."
"Then why accept the Echelon system, which makes us dependent and poorer as the result of lost contracts?"
"Anyone can see that this is where the ambiguity of the European construction lies."
"And we, the French members of the Front National, the Flemish members of the Vlaams Blok and the Italian members of the MSE, are alone in defending the need for a committee of inquiry into this global spy system."
"We must defend the true Europe, the truly European Europe!"
"- (DE) I am in favour of setting up a genuine committee of inquiry to investigate an infringement of fundamental rights by the Echelon interception system."
"However, I am voting against setting up a temporary committee, which, without a remit for its inquiry, I regard as a sop."
"If we only set up a temporary committee, the European Parliament will just be viewed as a paper tiger in its endeavours to cast some light on the activities of Echelon."
"The caution displayed by the major political groups in the EP about investigating Echelon demonstrates that there is no great interest in focusing on secret service activities, as the European public would then be quite justified in asking what the national secret services and so-called 'defenders of the state' actually do."
"Yet this would be even more important because not only are industrial secrets being monitored, but also the private and political activities of people in the EU."
"- (FR) The European Parliament has just shown, by refusing to grant itself the power to investigate the 'Echelon' global spy system, that it in fact has little interest in protecting European interests and that the majority of the House is obeying other, higher priority considerations."
"Luckily, we still have sovereign states in Europe to defend European interests, states with sovereign justice which can unilaterally open an investigation into the activities of this network, a leftover from the Cold War which has now been turned into an industrial spy tool at the expense of certain companies and certain Member States in the European Union."
"Clearly, for the majority in this House, transparency and the fight against distortion of competition are the stuff of words, not deeds."
"I hope that other Member States will follow France's example."
"It is a crying shame that the Conference of Presidents has decided, at the instigation of its Socialist and Christian Democrat majority, to put the lid on an important debate."
"It is likewise a crying shame that the President of our Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, felt compelled to prevent the chairman of the Group of the Greens, Mr Paul Lannoye, from reminding the House of the huge difference between a temporary committee of inquiry and a temporary committee before the vote: the first is a serious investigative tool, as the parliamentary committee of enquiry into the mad cow crisis demonstrated; the second is merely a smokescreen and will not brook any investigation into the Echelon installations located in several Anglo-Saxon Member States, including Great Britain and Germany."
"If ever we needed a clear illustration of the fact that real European interests are best defended by fully sovereign, resolute Member States, rather than by an assembly which is cut off from the people and indifferent to the threats to which they are exposed, then the European Parliament's dodging of the debate on the Echelon global spy system is it."
"Lehne report (A5-0175/2000)"
"Mr President, the Lehne report on money laundering."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Lehne and the entire group for the work they have done."
"The document is very sound and strikes a fine balance."
"The Green Group as well as the regionalists have voted in favour of this report because it is an instrument for fighting laundering practices, and fighting money laundering is the best way to tackle organised crime."
"The 1991 directive confined itself to examining money laundering practices with regard to drugs money."
"But organised crime embraces a great deal more."
"Hopefully, the proposals submitted by the rapporteur will open up the possibility of adopting a forceful approach in the fight against organised crime, such as trafficking in people and smuggling, but also fraud and corruption in the art trade."
"It is important that the exchange of information should be compulsory and we also set great store by the fact that a standard set of rules will be imposed on Member States and candidate countries in the fight against money laundering, thus guaranteeing minimum measures."
"The rapporteur also states, by way of justification, that the new directive provides for the possibility of requiring proof of identity from estate agents, notaries, external accountants and legal consultants, unless they represent their clients in legal proceedings or provide legal advice."
"This report can be used as a basis for further action."
"Our Group welcomes it with open arms, and I do not think that organised crime will receive this report with too much enthusiasm."
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote on Mr Lehne' s report, not because I am against the measures it lays down - it is right to employ all possible means to combat crime and the fact that we are combating the laundering of the proceeds of criminal activities is important, useful and right - but because I consider that the European Union is not doing enough to fight financial crime. Financial crime is a drain on energy, resources, means and therefore money which could be used by our governments in activities which are more important for society such as meeting the needs of the less well-off part of the population such as pensioners and the elderly."
"This is why I abstained from the vote."
"- (FR) You claim to be fighting financial crime and dirty money and yet even your report recognises the absence of any political will on the part of the Member States."
"The reasons are not technical, they are political - social even - in an economy whose sole purpose is to generate maximum profits."
"So where, in your economy, is the dividing line between dirty money and allegedly clean money?"
"Are the profits from the arms trade clean money? Are the huge sums spent bribing officials in order to land public procurement contracts clean money?"
"Are the profits amassed by western companies by making children under ten work in poor countries for a pittance clean money?"
"In order to eradicate financial crime, we need to start by abolishing banking secrecy and business secrecy and grant any civil group the right to inspect the accounts of companies and their owners and shareholders."
"You, however, do not even seem able to contemplate measures such as this."
"You prefer to remain ineffectual against traffickers and the mafia rather than making people realise that there are plenty of other ways of making money which are criminal from a humane point of view, from the point of view of the general good, starting with companies that throw employees on to the street, condemning them to a life of poverty, in order to increase their share price and their shareholders' wealth."
"- (FR) I am delighted that Parliament has had to debate the amendments to the 1991 directive on money laundering."
"This directive was in serious need of revision in order to adapt it to the new international economic and financial climate."
"France, which is a key figure in the fight against this scourge, has clearly indicated that it intends to make this issue a priority item on the European Union's working agenda."
"Just a few figures suffice to substantiate this position."
"Money laundering accounts for between 2% and 5% of the world's GDP each year. This phenomenon is now a threat of the first order."
"Financial crime has adapted to the globalisation of the international economy and now has two overriding features: more and more complex techniques are being used to launder dirty money and criminal financial flows are being internationalised."
"Discussions have been reopened at international level with a view to proposing effective new measures to fight this scourge."
"As a result, a United Nations seminar on the prevention of crime and criminal justice was held in France in April last year in order to discuss the fight against international financial corruption circuits."
"This seminar culminated in the 'Bercy recommendations' ."
"This action is being relayed through work undertaken in the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the financial stability forum."
"At European level, the European Parliament has been calling for the 1991 directive to be updated since 1996."
"The European Commission's proposals follow on directly from the proposals made at international level."
"First, the list of offences needs to be extended."
"Money laundering as defined in the directive should no longer apply solely to the proceeds from drug trafficking, it should also apply to activities linked with organised crime, such as fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity which affects the financial interests of the European Communities."
"Secondly, the obligations imposed by the directive have been extended unreservedly to various non-financial activities and professions, such as auditors and accountants, estate agents, traders in precious stones and metals, money carriers, managers, owners and directors of casinos."
"They also apply to notaries and other independent members of the legal profession engaged in activities which involve a high risk of money laundering."
"The idea is to ensure that the parties concerned identify new clients and store documents and evidence."
"Credit institutions and financial institutions are required to cooperate with the authorities; in other words, banking secrecy is lifted where there is any suspicion of money laundering."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this directive, which forms part of the general action plan to fight organised crime."
"Allow me to close by stressing the need for the debate on tax havens to culminate quickly in specific measures to dismantle them."
". (PT) I voted in favour of the Lehne report, which improves on the original initiative to widen the scope of the directive on money laundering."
"The great advantage of this directive was that its adoption led to all the Member States declaring money laundering an offence subject to criminal prosecution."
"By virtue of its overall preventive effect, it has helped to protect the financial system by discouraging those who might be interested in money laundering from exploiting the financial system to that end, by obliging credit and financial institutions to inform the relevant authorities of anything which might indicate money laundering."
"The aim of widening the directive' s scope in this way is to reinforce efforts to combat potential money laundering outside the traditional financial sector."
"The directive, which applied to various financial sectors, including banks, insurance companies, and so forth, is to be extended to other non-financial activities and professions which are nevertheless extremely vulnerable to money laundering."
"In the case of lawyers, there are to be clear safeguards, particularly as regards maintaining the right of confidentiality."
"The fact of the matter is that although there is an awareness of the enormous impact of money laundering and other forms of corruption, it is necessary to safeguard our citizens' right to legal advice and assistance."
"Furthermore, it is also intended to extend the list of defined offences."
"In addition to income from drug trafficking, it is also necessary to include activities associated with organised crime, and we need to find a uniform definition of organised crime not just at European level but also at international level."
"Efforts to approve definitions, types of crime and common sanctions with a view to harmonising criminal law are intended first and foremost to apply to particularly important areas such as money laundering."
"Because the world is becoming ever more sophisticated, many organised crime syndicates can take advantage of legal loopholes and differences between legislation in the Member States to exploit anomalies between the various systems."
"- At the outset, I would like to place on the record my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur Mr Lehne on the way he had dealt with this difficult brief."
"Each of us I am sure would wish to see action being taken to tackle the proceeds of cross-border crime and money laundering."
"This directive will go some way to linking cooperation and exchanges of information, as well as extending the scope and range of the offences."
"In Ireland, where there is already existing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is presently being updated to take into account some of the proposals contained in this directive."
"Whilst I voted in favour of the report, I must confess to having some disquiet with regard to two aspects contained within it."
"Firstly, the continuing attempt to create a European Public Prosecutor's office, is something which I am resolutely opposed to."
"We already have at our disposal many agencies at a national level, which are most efficient and which are able to deal with the vast majority of cases - and also the Court of Auditors, OLAF and other departments to deal with these issues at a European level."
"Secondly, the new disclosures requirements on lawyers, I believe, would seriously undermine the long established precedent of lawyer/client confidentiality."
"We must not interfere with the rights of individuals to a fair defence, trial, or prejudice the doctrine of presumed innocence."
"However, in spite of these concerns, which I hope to alter by amendment later via the legislative process, I vote in favour."
". (PT) It is a good thing that there is a desire to step up measures against money laundering, not just in relation to crime associated with drug trafficking, as in the previous directive, but also as regards money laundering linked with organised crime and a wider range of defined offences, that is to say fraud, corruption and other illegal activities damaging the Community' s financial interests."
"However, the proposal for a directive is not without its controversial aspects, particularly in so far as it undermines professional secrecy in certain sectors, notably the legal profession, whilst failing to impose a corresponding obligation to declare suspicious activities relating to high-value business transactions on professionals such as those selling luxury items, auctioneers, customs officials and so on."
"The rapporteur of this European Parliament report accordingly puts forward certain approaches which are slightly different to those contained in the proposal for a directive, but he basically supports it."
"In any case, one important and central issue, that is the growing liberalisation of financial markets and movements of capital, is not addressed, which means that the practical effects of this liberalisation will continue to be weakened."
"That is why I am abstaining."
"- (FR) We have a whole arsenal of international weapons with which to fight money laundering including, most importantly, the 1991 Community directive, together with the United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988, the Council of Europe Convention on laundering, search, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds from crime and the forty recommendations by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering), which is the main international body specialising in the fight against money with criminal origins."
"We all agree on the need - and Parliament has called on several occasions - for a review of the 1991 directive, which already goes much further than the 40 recommendations made by the FATF in 1996 and which has been applied successfully by the Member States."
"But those responsible for money laundering are highly ingenious when it comes to finding ways of disguising the criminal origins of their money, which is why it has been proposed not just to update the directive but also to extend its scope."
"I should like to point out the following so that we avoid using a sledgehammer to crack a nut by succumbing to the risk of making the scope of the directive so vast that it becomes ineffectual."
"That is why the criminal activities associated with the concept of money laundering need to be very clearly defined, in order to prevent the requirements of the directive from being extended to fraudulent activities in general in relation to money circulating legitimately in the financial system."
"We must not forget that the Member States have their own national laws for dealing with such offences."
"Subsidiarité oblige!"
"As for extending the obligations imposed by the directive to certain non-financial activities and professions, especially to members of the legal profession, we must not infringe the right of clients to professional confidentiality, the right of clients to access the justice system and the right not to incriminate themselves and, finally, the confidential role of lawyers in preventing crime."
"As several French Socialist Members have claimed the right during the debate on the fight against money laundering to put certain countries in the hot seat, including mine, on the basis of an erroneous, approximate and aberrant appraisal of the practices of Luxembourg as a financial centre and the Luxembourg political powers, I am anxious to refute here in the House, and as vigorously as our Prime Minister and the chairmen of the finance, budget and legal committees of the Chamber of Deputies of the Grand Duchy have done, the allegations which the French Socialist Members have become guilty of during their so-called 'assault course' against dirty money."
"Those who feel the urge to denounce the black sheep in the fight against money laundering and put pressure on tax havens should go right ahead; but they should at least exert pressure on those who really baulk at helping in the fight against money laundering and, more importantly, they should refrain from automatically classifying countries which respect banking secrecy as 'turntables for dirty money' ."
"You do not need banking secrecy in order to become a turntable for dirty money."
"The proof is that the Russian mafia tried to invest its dirty money in several European financial centres before deciding on New York, which does not recognise banking secrecy."
"This proves that abolishing banking secrecy is no guarantee of protection against the ravages of drug trafficking, organised crime and corruption and we would do well to remember that!"
"We have abstained from voting on Amendments 8, 16, 26 and 45, as we do not think that these amendments sufficiently reflect a good balance between, on the one hand, an effective reporting obligation to combat money laundering and, on the other hand, an advocate' s/lawyer's duty of confidentiality to his/her client and the obligations that this entails."
"It is important that an advocate/lawyer should not be covered by the reporting obligation when he/she represents a client in a case."
"However, it is more difficult to determine in which situations a lawyer/advocate shall be subject to the reporting obligation when he/she has access to relevant information in relation to so-called legal advice."
"We think that lawyers/advocates should, to a certain extent, be exempt from the reporting obligation, but the proposals from both the Commission and Parliament are not sufficiently balanced or precise in this respect for us to be able to support them."
"Finally, we would like to point out that the proposal has certain deficiencies with respect to definitions that could lead to confusion."
"In the proposal, the words advocate, independent lawyer and lawyer are used without it being clear what the distinction between these terms is intended to be."
"It is important to emphasise that lawyers must be considered equal to advocates in those countries that do not have the compulsory employment of counsel."
"Lehne report (A5-0179/2000)"
"Mr President, I also abstained from the vote on this document on the list of States into which it is permitted to enter with or without a visa, for this is certainly a barrier to the free movement in the European Union of citizens resident in other States."
"I abstained because I would like us to focus more on the free movement in our Union of citizens who are severely disabled, blind or partially sighted, deaf or totally disabled and in need of full time care, who, if they move and go to live in another country - if they move from England to Italy, for example - are no longer entitled, under a regulation which is still in force, to the disability allowance or to the attendance allowance for their carer."
"We must take steps to amend this regulation."
"I have two points to make in connection with the proposal for a Council regulation listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement:"
"1."
"I am pleased that the list of countries whose nationals are exempt includes Bulgaria and Romania, which have both made specific commitments concerning security on their external borders."
"As chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of the European Parliament and Bulgaria, I should like to call on the Council to apply this position."
"The abolition of visas is one of the positions covered by the proposals of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of the European Parliament and Bulgaria which starts sitting today in Strasbourg."
"2."
"The Council of Ministers and the Commission should make representations to the authorities in the USA, which insist on visas for Greek nationals."
"If - and rightly so - American citizens have free access to the entire territory of the European Union, then the opposite should apply, on the basis of reciprocity, and they should stop this unacceptable discrimination against Greek citizens."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Lehne' s report about the proposal for a Council regulation listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement."
"We note that, in its proposal, the Commission considers that this proposal is not covered by the Danish reserve, in spite of the fact that this matter concerns a positive list which, as we understand it, is in fact covered."
"When we vote in favour of the report, this should be seen in the light of our view that a solution should be found which satisfies all countries and respects the Danish reserve."
"- (FR) The concerns which have inspired this report clearly illustrate that the European Union is designed for money, and not for people."
"No visa is needed for money to enter, irrespective of its origin, but nationals from numerous countries require a visa, even if they are staying for less than three months."
"What is more, there are no respectable grounds for segregating a minority of countries, whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement, from the majority, whose nationals are not."
"Why refuse a Moroccan, Senegalese or Ukrainian national a right which is granted to a national of New Zealand, Israel or the Sultanate of Brunei."
"We abstained rather than voting against this report, despite disapproving of the spirit of the report as a whole, solely because, compared with the current situation, it does slightly extend the list of countries with no visa obligation."
"For our part, we are in favour of people being given at least the same rights which you grant to money, i.e. we are in favour of the free movement of people and the abolition of all visa requirements."
"- (SV) The EU' s strict visa policy constitutes a major barrier for people coming to Europe."
"The tightening up of the visa requirements that has been carried out over the last few years has unavoidably led to more cases of people smuggling and to an increase in so-called illegal immigration to the Member States of the EU."
"The people who have been smuggled in, or have found their way into the European Union in some other way, have often suffered terrible tragedies on the way here."
"Once they have arrived in the EU, they are completely lacking in rights and social protection."
"The list of countries whose citizens require a visa for entry into the EU contains more than 130 countries."
"There are not even as many as 50 countries among the states whose citizens are exempt from the requirement for a visa."
"This practice, i.e. of having the requirement for a visa as the rule rather than the exception, is not worthy of a democratic Europe."
"The basic rule must be that people have the right to enter the EU freely, not the opposite."
"Europe needs to change its attitude to immigration."
"Within the next few years there will be an acute labour shortage in the EU."
"It is therefore important that we recognise and welcome people who are seeking a better future in the EU' s Member States."
"A more generous visa policy is also a prerequisite for pursuing a common and humane refugee and asylum policy."
"By means of a policy that affirms the value of immigration, we can put a stop to the organised crime and the human tragedies that people smuggling is to blame for."
"Haug report (A5-0184/2000)"
"Mr President, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the fact that the entire budget has been tightened up and the increase in appropriations amounts to 1.07% of total GNP for the Member States, while the corresponding figure in the budget for 2000 was 1.11%."
"In addition, I am pleased with the increase in the appropriation for youth organisations to EUR 1.5 million."
"However, I would particularly like to explain why I supported the proposals for amendments tabled by Mr Virrankoski and Mr Mulder."
"I base my opinion in the notion that strict budgetary discipline should be continued and that the prevailing financial frameworks should be respected."
"Regarding funds for the Western Balkans, we must take account of the real needs of the regions, the prevailing political situation and the possibility of obtaining funds from other quarters."
"For this reason, I do not support an amendment to the financial perspectives in the area of appropriations under External Action."
"- (FR) The French delegation of the UEN Group is for several reasons unable to approve the report by the Committee on Budgets currently being debated."
"First, we feel that it fails to make a distinction between the debate on the 2001 budget and the debate on the revision of the financial perspectives, which we refuse to revise."
"Who could forget the circumstances under which the financial perspectives were drawn up at the Berlin summit."
"No French delegation from the European Parliament could possibly question the compromise which resulted from the difficult negotiations in March 1999."
"A revision appears to be even less in order now that the European Union has opted, having itself bombed Serbia, to cut off any Community aid to it."
"We therefore need to subtract EUR 2.3 billion from the 5.5 billion announced by Mr Prodi for the reconstruction of the Balkans from 2000-2006."
"The situation then appears to be quite manageable: there is enough money, the financial perspectives do not need to be revised and nor does the ceiling on the agricultural line need to be lowered."
"As far as the figures announced by Romano Prodi last November are concerned, the Commission may take them back today, it knows full well that these sums are not, alas, based on an accurate analysis of the region's needs and, in its own words, it is a 'political' sum which, by the way, has never been approved either by Parliament or, more importantly, by the Council."
"It is therefore possible to find a substantial sum of money for the Balkans without revising the financial perspectives."
"The fact that we have seen a chronic surplus of over EUR 3 billion at the end of the year demonstrates that the sum of appropriations voted for does not correspond to real needs, whilst it is possible to make substantial savings as the result of the patent under-implementation of certain programmes. This surplus also shows that it is better for efforts in the Balkans to be funded in part by redeploying appropriations."
"We also reject Mrs Haug's report for its proposals on the Union's special envoys."
"This is, in fact, tantamount to a reduction of what still comes under the intergovernmental conference for the benefit of Community integration."
"The Amsterdam Treaty, which we fought against, states that, as of this year, the administrative costs of the CSFP will come under the Council, while operational expenditure will be financed from chapter B8 under heading 4."
"Finally, we refuse the differentiated appropriations for rural development which the resolution appears to recommend because this would inevitably create difficulties in settling payments."
"We would simply remind the House that the agricultural guideline still applies, the ceiling decided at Berlin notwithstanding."
"Although the ceiling is reached if you add market expenditure (1A), rural development (1B) and pre-accession agricultural expenditure, to accept differentiated appropriations for rural development is to run the risk of having the Commission propose substantial commitment appropriations and far fewer payment appropriations, to the detriment of our farmers yet again, and this we cannot accept."
"- We have voted against point 9 in the Haug report, concerning the transfer of funds from the budget for Agricultural Policy to the reconstruction programme for the Western Balkans."
"Estimates show that a significant surplus will be available in the agricultural budget under heading 1a."
"As a great part of the programme for reconstruction of the Western Balkans is still not financed, we believe that it would be wise to transfer part of this surplus to heading 4 in the budget, should a revision of the financial perspectives become necessary."
"The reconstruction of the Western Balkans is on top of our political agenda."
"It is also one of the most important tasks for the European Union in the coming years."
"We agree with the intention of the Haug report that the financing problem cannot be solved only by redeployment in the Union's existing priorities in external policy."
"Funds must be found elsewhere, but this does not necessarily create a need for 'fresh money' from the Member States."
"Since a significant surplus will be available in the budget for agriculture, a reduction of the ceiling in heading 1a in favour of an increase of the budget for external policy would be a reasonable solution."
". (PT) Faced with the task of setting new objectives for the European Union, we consider it essential to carry out a wide-ranging revision of the financial perspectives with special emphasis on Heading 3, ""Internal Policies"" and Heading 4, ""External Actions"" ."
"We believe that the new priorities need to be matched to the 'fresh money' available."
"In view of this we fundamentally and above all reject the prospect of cuts in the cooperation policy, as implied in the Commission' s preliminary draft. The same applies to the cuts they propose in the areas of employment and the environment."
"In the same way, we reject the cut of EUR 300 million for agriculture."
"Indeed, as regards agriculture, we believe that it is vital to set up a fund to tackle the enormous problems in the primary sector."
"Accordingly, we agree with some of the rapporteur' s proposals. However, although she does suggest some improvements, they fall well short of what is absolutely necessary."
"Furthermore, some of the amendments made in the final vote limited and even changed its scope. And that is without even looking at the position on defence policy."
"For these reasons, we voted against the final version of the report."
"Paciotti report (A5-0177/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Paciotti report because I feel that it is right for the European Union to take an interest in anything to do with the protection of personal data."
"Sadly, personal data is all too often used by criminals to exploit confidential data for their own gain."
"As I have already said on a previous occasion, pensioners and the elderly are certainly among the victims."
"However, in voting for the motion I would also like to stress that, in addition to having our personal data protected, it would also be nice to be able to know what are own personal data are."
"In Italy, for example, workers are still unable to discover the size of the pensions they will receive and how much money they have paid in contributions."
"They are therefore ignorant of some of their personal data."
"In voting for the report, I therefore hope that, in the future, not only will our personal data be protected, but, as well as our name, surname and date of birth, we will all know how great our pension will be when we retire."
"Mr President, I hope that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi will give a written explanation of vote on behalf of our political Group, but I want to say a couple of things."
"First of all, I wanted to vote against Amendment No 11."
"It was purely a mistake that I voted in favour of that amendment, since any amendments to the Commission proposal were very bad and endanger the whole procedure of getting the safe harbour agreement enforced."
"We have negotiated with our US counterparts for over two years."
"We had a very good compromise but now the work here in the European Parliament means that European consumers and citizens have to wait until the new compromise proposal is made."
"It is not certain that the new compromise proposal will be as good as this was."
"We are now going backwards."
"I voted against the committee proposal along with other members of my Group."
"We are all very sorry that we have to wait for this agreement to come into force."
". (PT) I was unable to make the speech I had prepared during the sitting itself for lack of time."
"I am therefore summing up the key points during the explanations of vote."
"I share the rapporteur' s concerns that this proposal does not provide Europe' s citizens with an appropriate level of protection as regards transferring and processing personal data relating to them, especially if we take into account the protection they are guaranteed under the European directive on data protection."
"However, we all know that at present data is already being circulated in practice, but in an unregulated way."
"So while the safe harbour principle may not be an ideal solution to this problem, it will at least impose a certain number of rules and will be a way of preventing abuse."
"Work has progressed on attempting to reconcile two differing approaches, namely our own legislation-based system, in which compliance with legal restrictions on obtaining and using personal data is ensured by the public authorities, and the Americans' preference for self-regulation."
"The agreement reached represents a limited step forward as far as the guarantees involved are concerned, but it is positive in terms of what it offers for the future by way of security."
"We accordingly support the position adopted in the Paciotti report with the amendments tabled by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi."
"- (DE) The Paciotti report on the 'safe harbour' agreement has my approval, although it will not solve the problems attending transatlantic data protection for the following reasons:"
"It will still be possible, even with the 'safe harbour' agreement in place, to find ways of getting round it and selling clients' data to third parties without having to obtain the client' s consent."
"Even if the agreement succeeds in defining vague data protection standards, it is not clear precisely what action will be taken when companies violate these standards."
"Will it be possible to take them to court?"
"Will they have to pay compensation?"
"The question as to how far EU citizens will actually be able to assert the rights laid down for their benefit in the 'safe harbour' agreement remains unanswered, particularly as the court of jurisdiction for the US companies is in the USA and so they have a natural advantage over individual EU citizens."
"That said, I still subscribe to the report because, as matters stand, there are no provisions whatsoever for guaranteeing EU data protection standards in the exchange of data with other continents."
"The 'safe harbour' scheme does at least represent an attempt to guarantee data protection beyond EU borders."
"."
"(EL) Neither the letter, i.e. the legal basis, nor, more importantly, the spirit of the way in which the burgeoning e-commerce industry is developing and the speed with which it is spreading augur well for the protection of citizens' personal data and privacy; on the contrary, they give cause for serious, widespread concern as regards both the decimation and restructuring of commerce and the market itself and the intensification of efforts to abolish civil rights, make citizens slaves to technology and the savage laws of the capitalist market and turn their personal lives and their very existence into cheap, malleable raw materials to generate profits."
"The application of technological innovations, especially the innovations made during the impressive and rapid development of the information society, will cut right through the fabric of society."
"The dangers of misuse which lie in ambush behind the huge potential which is developing should encourage and oblige us to be vigilant when it comes to ensuring that the human factor and respect for citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms come first."
"New applications and technology cannot be stopped, but nor should they be allowed to develop with no regard for man and his needs, and under no circumstances should they be used to undermine political values and human dignity or to attack basic and inalienable rights such as the sanctity of privacy and personal data."
"The proposals and policies for electronic commerce and the measures being promoted to support it are coloured by the totally one-dimensional perception of profit and competitiveness."
"This policy is being driven by the huge and constantly inflating sums of money being invested in and thrown at e-commerce in order to serve the needs of the big multinationals in the sector and remove any obstacles which prevent them from adapting as quickly as possible to the rapid developments on this market and acquiring huge, fast profits and influence."
"The proposed Community model behind the EU's texts and proposals is supported by and vigorously supports unadulterated competition and unbridled, excessive profit."
"This perception is not a guarantee for, it is a blatant threat to the future of society and mankind: uncertainty, insecurity, a breach with man's own needs, categorisation of citizens and workers who will no longer shape their environment but will be shaped by it in order to serve those who define it in the best, fastest and cheapest way possible."
"As far as we can see, the term ""adequate protection"" as used in the report means the continuous and arbitrary definition and distortion of the concept of the protection of personal data, given that sanctions and compensation for breaching doors which are already wide open are advocated as deterrents and safety valves."
"Personal data on EU citizens is already circulating in third countries, without any fundamental control; in fact we barely even know the extent of the arbitrary acts already committed."
"Knowing as we do from the Echelon interception system that every form of democratic control is being flagrantly violated from without or from a distance, knowing that American multinationals are engaged in wholesale monitoring and spying at the expense of European undertakings and the economic, social, political and cultural activities of the Member States and the private life of the Union citizens as a whole, it is slightly hypocritical of us to approach this huge issue in stockinged feet with our prayer-book in hand."
"The current protective framework and the proposed standard contractual clauses are inadequate in the extreme, riddled with holes and inefficient."
"You cannot appeal to good intentions for doleful competition and a profit monocracy."
"We would only dare call the snake pit of unaccountable monopolies which find it easy to spring up, spread and act with impunity in cyberspace 'safe harbours' euphemistically."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Implementation of EMU (continuation)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A-170/2000) by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on communications strategy in the last phases of the completion of EMU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the euro has been around for a while now, it is still an abstract concept."
"It is something which is not tangible in our day-to-day life, and there is still no so-called 'euroreflex' on the part of the population."
"The present currencies are not yet being converted into the euro."
"That is why I cannot stress enough the importance of this information and awareness campaign for the euro."
"It is not yet too late, but we must all realise that 2001 will be crucial in our efforts to involve the entire European population in this giant operation."
"By means of the amendments which I have tabled and which have also been included in the report, I wanted to underline a number of aspects of this campaign."
"In the first instance - and I will not labour the point as it was sufficiently highlighted this morning - the campaign must devote special attention to making young people aware and involve education in the information campaign."
"Secondly, an information campaign must obviously be tailored to specific target groups, such as the weaker members of society."
"I would also ask for special attention to be paid to people on extremely low incomes."
"As you know, there are two groups of people who spend a great deal of their time thinking about money: those who are extremely rich and have a great deal of money and those who have very little money or who need to budget every day to make sure they can make ends meet for the rest of the month."
"Well, the euro will have a great impact on them and it is they who deserve our special attention."
"For this reason, and for other reasons, but especially for this reason, it is important that consumers should not be cheated when they convert their money into euros."
"The switch to the euro should not lead to improper price increases."
"I have therefore called for the setting up of local hotlines within every local community to ensure that citizens can report improper price increases in a way which is simple and easy."
"I have also asked the Commission to submit proposals in this respect and to present best practices to the Member States."
"Mr President, not being used to speaking for two consecutive minutes, I am a little worried that I will not manage to fill the time available to me, but I will do my best."
"Commissioner Solbes, I must express my approval of this report for I feel that the introduction of the euro is one of the most important, key results of the formation of the European Union out of our 15 States."
"Therefore, preparing the population for practical use of the euro is certainly a positive move."
"I would like to thank Mr Karas for incorporating a request I made to remove a point from the original measure which stated that adolescents and children must receive good teaching so that they can in turn teach their grandparents."
"I would hope that, also on this occasion, it will be the grandparents, the elderly, the pensioners - who elected me here to the European Parliament to represent the Pensioner' s Party, no less - who will teach the adolescents."
