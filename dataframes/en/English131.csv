"Proposals were made for very specific measures: European industrial initiatives, above all in the fields of wind energy, solar energy, bio-energy, carbon capture and storage, electricity grids and nuclear fission, the creation of a European Energy Research Alliance, the sustainable conversion of European energy infrastructure networks, constantly updated European energy technology systems and the establishment of a steering group on strategic energy technologies."
"At that stage, one crucial question was left unanswered, namely the issue of funding."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for Research provides for EUR 886 million per annum for energy research."
"It is clear to all, however, that that is not enough."
"In 2009, the Commission brought out its communication on the funding of low-carbon energy technologies, in which it described the need to treble the funding for energy research over the next 10 years."
"That would mean that EUR 50 billion would have to be invested."
"The communication described how the money for the most important low-carbon technologies should be apportioned so that Europe can move away from its heavy dependence on fossil fuels to a stronger reduction in CO2 emissions."
"The final plan estimates EUR 6 billion for research into wind energy, which, according to the Commission, could make up a fifth of EU energy provision by 2020; EUR 16 billion for solar energy, in order to develop new photovoltaic concepts and a major industrial concentration of solar energy facilities;"
"EUR 9 billion for bio-energy research, in order to cover 14% of the EU's energy needs. In order to integrate renewable energy sources into the energy market, electricity grids would receive EUR 2 billion so that half of the grid would be able to operate on the basis of a 'smart grid' principle."
"Apart from renewable energy sources, a further EUR 13 billion is envisaged for up to 12 projects in the field of carbon capture and storage, while nuclear research would receive EUR 7 billion."
"The funding proposal also envisaged a further EUR 11 billion for the 'smart cities' programme so that appropriate answers can be found in this field, too."
"The Commission suggested at the time that public-private partnerships are the most credible way of funding energy research but was unable to spell out precisely how the funding burdens in such arrangements would be split between the two sides."
"At present, the split in the field of energy research is 70% private and 30% public, excluding nuclear research."
"The EU argues that there is a need for a significant increase in public funding."
"In projects in which the risks are higher, public funding should play a major role, the Commission stated."
"In order to optimise the level of the intervention, the Commission called for the institution of EU programmes particularly in areas where there is a clear added value at EU level, such as where programmes are too expensive for the Member States individually."
"At present, 80% of public investment in non-nuclear energy research is funded at national level."
"This communication, too, ultimately leaves open the question of where the money is to come from."
"The Commission calculates that there is a need for an extra EUR 75 to 80 billion."
"That is the reason why we concentrated, in our committee, on obtaining a little more clarity on a few issues in this area of funding."
"I would like to just remind you of the questions."
"Firstly, how does the Commission intend to set its priorities for the 2010-2020 roadmap to support the financing of low-carbon technologies?"
"When will industrial policy initiatives to that effect be introduced?"
"Secondly, how does the Commission intend to make additional EU budget resources available?"
"How, specifically, is the Commission committed to ensuring that funds will start flowing in advance of resources from the Eighth Framework Programme?"
"Will the Commission ensure that the budgets identified for the various industrial initiatives will be respected?"
"Last but not least, how will the Commission - and, of course, this will also always apply to the Council - make additional funding from the EU budget available for the funding of technological options other than those specified in the communication, including storage technologies, ocean energies and so on."
"There is no need for me to read out all the questions."
"We have introduced the questions here, and we ask for answers from the Council and the Commission."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by stressing the importance of the strategic energy plan and the necessary contribution it will make to speeding up the development and application of technologies for clean, sustainable and efficient energy."
"Without this plan, it will not be possible to achieve the goals we have set for 2020, nor to carry out the transition to a low-carbon economy on the scale we would like for 2050."
"I am pleased to see that there is broad consensus between Parliament and the Council with regard to the importance and necessity of both the objectives of the plan and the resources that need to be made available."
"The Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council intends to adopt conclusions on the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in its meeting this coming Friday 12 March."
"These conclusions will be an important point of reference for the spring European Council meeting to be held on 25 March, since the subject of climate change will feature on the agenda."
"The draft conclusions to be debated at the Council meeting will include the subject of financing, although this matter will be approached with due caution."
"We do not want to preempt the negotiations that will have to take place on this subject within the context of the next financial framework."
"I will now set out the main elements of the draft conclusions."
"Firstly, the time has come to move from technological roadmaps to the operational implementation of European industrial initiatives."
"We should do so step by step, but as quickly as possible."
"Secondly, our approach to future cooperation in energy research within Europe should focus on using public resources effectively and building flexible, public-private partnerships with industry."
"We therefore urge the Commission to establish a platform that includes all of the interested financial organisations so that they can share information and best practices and, at the same time, coordinate their actions as deemed necessary."
"Thirdly, given the scale of medium-term public-private financing needed in order to support major demonstration projects in particular, it may be necessary to increase the proportion of public investment at EU level."
"We will therefore need to take that into account both when revising the budget and when negotiating for the next financial framework."
"Fourthly, we should support the governments of the Member States and encourage them to give adequate incentives and consistent signals in order for this policy to be implemented."
"If necessary, they should also make significant increases to public financing for the development of low-carbon technologies."
"The fifth point to mention is that the European Commission and the European Investment Bank are already working together to improve the coordination and continuity of financing for demonstration projects in the sector of energy involving high technological risk."
"They are also working to mobilise and make available other sources of financing, both public and private."
"Finally, the Commission and the European Investment Bank are looking into optimum financial packages for major demonstration projects, and so we also urge the Commission to analyse new ways of combining resources from different sources and to develop an ad hoc tool for financing the commercial launch of low-carbon technologies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, all of these elements constitute a clear message on future investment for the development of low-carbon technologies."
"Despite the severe budgetary restrictions we currently face, the message that the Council will send out in its meeting on Friday will be one of commitment, using positive terms to express the significance of this matter at European level and the vital importance for each Member State to invest in low-carbon technology."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, although I am replacing my colleague Günther Oettinger today, it is a real pleasure to discuss with you the future of low-carbon technologies."
"I personally was closely involved in the development of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) in the last Commission and I believe strongly that the development of these technologies is one of the cornerstones of the energy policy we have to develop jointly in the years to come."
"Parliament's report on the SET Plan of June 2008 was very clear in proposing an appropriate level of ambition."
"We should not now lower this ambition."
"Today you have asked three clear questions and I will respond to them in turn."
"First, regarding our priorities for 2010 to 2020 and the launch of the European industrial initiatives, those six initiatives really match our priorities - wind, solar bio-energy, sustainable fission, smart grids, and carbon capture and storage are priorities that were strongly endorsed by Parliament and the Council."
"At your request, we have also prioritised energy efficiency by developing a new dedicated initiative - 'Smart Cities' - to unlock the market potential of energy efficient technologies in cities and regions."
"To prioritise activities within this initiative, the Commission has developed, together with the stakeholders, technology road maps for the period 2010-2020."
"These road maps establish concrete objectives as well as the activities needed to achieve them."
"The initiatives are mature for launching this year, 2010."
"Smart Cities are planned for the following year."
"Your second question concerns the need for predictable, stable and adequate budgets for the SET Plan in the current financing period and post-2014."
"Our estimate of the public and private investment needs for the development of low-carbon technologies in the SET Plan is EUR 8 billion per year."
"Today about EUR 3 billion are being invested annually in the European Union, which means that a further EUR 50 billion is needed for the period 2010-2020."
"Bridging this gap should be one of the key institutional discussions over the coming years."
"Effort must be focused where intervention is most efficient, avoiding duplications and fostering the greatest potential impact in the market."
"It is clear that EU level investments - coming either from the Seventh Framework Programme or the European Energy Programme for Recovery - will not be enough."
"Nor will the potential funds from the 300 million emissions trading allowances set aside for the demonstration of carbon capture and storage and innovative renewable technologies."
"At current prices this is approximately EUR 4 billion."
"Major efforts are therefore required, both by the private and public sector; the public sector includes both the European Union and of course also the Member States."
"To be blunt, the bulk of the money will have to come from where the bulk of the money is."
"Thirdly, you asked if the Commission intends to finance other technology avenues and propose additional industrial initiatives."
"Other technologies that deserve European-level intervention will certainly emerge over time, so the SET Plan must remain flexible, as we have already shown with the new initiative on energy efficiency - Smart Cities - which we expect to launch, as I said, in 2011."
"We will closely monitor the most promising technologies through the SET Plan information system."
"SETIS, as this is called, is already working on storage and ocean technologies to assess their potential and identify the best opportunities for European intervention."
"We have also encouraged the establishment of a new technology platform on renewables, heating and cooling, that should help the sectors involved better to define their technology transfer."
"I am very pleased to see this file getting the support it deserves."
"It is a key file for achieving our energy policy goals, a key file for Europe and for our future."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I am delighted to see you back here, Mr Potočnik, in your post as Commissioner for the Environment."
"You are standing in for our Commissioner for Industry - thank you for that, and thank you also for your speech."
"I welcome the question put by my colleague, Mr Reul, who is right, Commissioner, to question you on how the Commission views this crucial issue of noncarbon energies and of the financing of new technologies."
"The world's population is growing."
"We will need 40% more energy in 2030, and I would add that 80% of this consumer demand will come from countries outside the OECD."
"In the face of these major challenges, the solution is not to adopt the ideology of decreasing our energy use or to take refuge in thoughts of the past."
"The European Union therefore has a duty to intervene, and I would like to say a word about an issue that may divide us, within our political groups, and that is nuclear energy."
"When it comes to nuclear energy, we have Member States that have a long tradition in these matters."
"That does not make the European Union privileged, but it does mean that we have a duty to contribute to the debate and to the financing."
"Nuclear energy, as we know, is a noncarbon energy, and we need financing, Commissioner, and particularly that accrued from carbon credits, to invest in research, development and training on all these areas."
"We are proposing some amendments to you with the specific aim of improving the resolutions that have been tabled, and I will conclude by saying a word about nuclear byproducts, which are a source of great concern for our fellow citizens."
"There are two options in the world: longterm storage, which is the United States' chosen option, and we, the European Union, have to choose a different approach, which is recovery by means of recycling."
"That is the option chosen by Russia, Japan and France."
"It is in this context that we who are responsible for safety and security must put our faith in science and in knowledge where all these subjects are concerned."
"Madam President, Secretary of State and President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are all aware that there is already clear consensus over the idea that the faster we establish a green economy, the faster we will emerge from the economic crisis."
"A number of studies have calculated that if we achieve the goal of a 20% share of renewable energy sources, it will mean that 2.8 million European workers will be employed in the sector by 2020."
"Furthermore, it is estimated that two thirds of the new jobs will be created within small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The key to this, ladies and gentlemen, lies in the development of green technologies."
"In order to make this a reality, my Group is in favour of three main objectives."
"Firstly, we need a real commitment to earmarking resources for the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan."
"It is not enough to simply regroup and rename the support programmes we already have."
"We agree that we need to transform our goal into a real increase in the resources devoted to research into renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"We should do so straight away, in the next review of the financial perspectives and, of course, in negotiations over the new financial perspectives."
"Secondly, if we want to create the jobs our economy needs in order to emerge from the crisis, it is vital that we boost the demonstration stage of innovative technologies and make it easier for them to be put into operation in the market."
"Finally, the potential creation of green employment cannot be steered in the right direction if we do not have a highly qualified workforce."
"We need to invest in education and awareness in order to strengthen the ties between the business world and the academic world, and we should promote qualifications of excellence in research and development and in innovation so as to be able to cover any potential gaps in the renewable energies job markets."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, we can set all the targets under the sun for tackling climate change but we will not reach them, especially the longer-term targets for 2050, unless we invest deeply and systematically in developing and improving sustainable low-carbon technology."
"The US is rightly criticised for its failure to sign up to greenhouse gas reduction targets, but the EU is nowhere near the level of investment that the US is at at present."
"Without proper investment, the EU's sustainable low-carbon investment programme will stall, and that means that hundreds of thousands of jobs which could be created here in the EU, and in regions like my own, the North-East of England, which are already starting to make that transformation to a low-carbon economy, without investment those jobs will go elsewhere to the US and China."
"I am disappointed that the Commission drew back from an earlier draft of the SET Plan, where the sources of the identified necessary investment were clearly indicated."
"Will the Commission now be more explicit, especially about the EUR 1 billion per annum shortfall that the Commissioner has just mentioned?"
"Finally, it is, of course, important to achieve improvements in nuclear technology, especially with regard to safety of operation and waste management, but my Group takes the view that 'sustainable nuclear fission' is a contradiction in terms."
"Will the Commissioner rename the sixth European industrial initiative simply the 'nuclear energy initiative'?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I think this SET Plan is basically an empty box because there is no money behind it."
"We really have to think about where the money could come from."
"What is worse is that the instruments the Commission had - the NER300, the Recovery Plan and certain funds available today at the European Investment Bank - are more prioritised for those so-called low-carbon technologies that are the least efficient and present the highest risk."
"In 2008 and 2009, more than 70% of all investments on the market in Europe were already in renewables: wind, solar, biomass."
"So how can it be that we are designing a SET Plan - and earmarking money at EU level - that basically gives a lower share to renewables than the market is already uptaking today, while diverting the money to carbon sequestration and to nuclear fusion, which is not addressed in this paper but which receives by far the largest share of EU money?"
"Our problem is that, because of certain lobbies, we do not have the courage to set the right priorities, and I think that even the IEA, which is not a green grass-root organisation, is extremely clear about the priorities."
"Fifty-five per cent of all CO2 reductions will come from energy efficiency."
"Why did we allocate zero euro to energy efficiency in the EU recovery package? Thirty to thirty-five per cent of CO2 greenhouse gas reductions will come from renewables, while at best only 10% will come from carbon sequestration and 10% from nuclear."
"That is according to the IEA, not a green grass-root organisation."
"So, even in Europe, in terms of how we allocate money we are behind what the IEA is telling governments."
"The only way out is to set clear priorities."
"Number one: energy efficiency; number two: renewables, because they reduce carbon without posing a risk; and then the other technologies."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I have to express some regret at the obsession on the left side of this Parliament with nuclear energy, which has meant that we have two resolutions before the House today, most of the content of which has much in common except for this issue of nuclear energy, particularly when it is the only proven technology to supply large volumes of ultra low-carbon electricity in Europe."
"If we are to wean ourselves off fossil fuels - especially oil and coal - we will need all the low-carbon energy technologies we can get."
"Many of them are still more potential than production, and we must be realistic about how successful we have been in achieving target levels of energy from renewable sources."
"The EU has a record of setting very ambitious targets and a 100% record of failing to achieve them."
"We must do better."
"In the mean time we must lose no time in increasing the share of European electricity supplied by nuclear energy."
"It already produces the largest amount of electricity, but, as we switch to and develop alternative and new technologies, we will need base-load electricity to keep the lights on and, for example, to power electric vehicles."
"There is huge potential in new green technologies such as solar thermal from the Sahara and wind farms from the North Sea, not to mention carbon capture and storage and basic improvements in energy efficiency, where - at least on that point - I agree with my Green colleague across the floor, but all of this requires massive investment, and that is the fundamental point about these questions today."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we are here to discuss the reinvention of a European energy system through investment in low-carbon technologies."
"I think it is one of the most important challenges, as mentioned in the communication."
"It is one of the challenges we must focus on, but there is no clarification here, so it is important to ask these questions and to seek clarification."
"It seems that not only is there no financial clarification, but there is also no political clarification."
"We speak of energy efficiency, of carbon capture, nuclear energy, bio-fuels, solar energy, and we speak inclusively of energy efficiency as the cheapest way to reduce emissions."
"It strikes me that there are other, much cheaper ways to reduce carbon emissions which are not even mentioned in this communication, such as, for example, reducing energy consumption, micro-generation, distribution and different forms of distribution, and different projects, which do not just have to be large structures, and access to energy."
"I believe that here we would certainly contribute towards enhanced financial clarification to select the cheapest plan."
"Therefore, as part of this political clarification and this financial clarification, we need to discuss what, in my view, is a vitally important matter, which is that the emphasis is always on public-private partnerships, as if they were the solution to everything."
"When we ask where the money comes from, the Commission tells us it comes from wherever it is."
"I confess that I do not feel more enlightened by being told that the money will come from wherever it is, without saying exactly where it is."
"Therefore, in terms of counting on public-private partnerships, which is what systematically happens when we talk about low-carbon technologies, we surely have one certainty: not knowing where the money comes from and knowing that there are public-private partnerships, we know, from the outset, who will pay."
"It is taxpayers who will pay in the beginning, consumers who, incidentally, are ultimately taxpayers, too."
"We also know that those that pay less are institutions and private organisations - that they are those who make investments, are paid for it but, in the end, keep the profits for themselves."
"Without this clarification, it seems to me that, once again, we are systematically leaving future generations to foot the bill for changing the European energy model."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle, we all agree that the SET plan is to be welcomed."
"We agree about large tranches of the content, but we have two problems."
"On the one hand, we will not be able - and I very much address this point to Mr Turmes - to build up pressure together on the Member States and on the Commission if we continue to hold an ideological debate where the subject is always nuclear energy."
"That is the sticking point in today's votes."
"We have reached a compromise on the SET plan, and that compromise is that we have specified the criteria according to which we want to support this, and those criteria are clearly defined, namely sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply."
"We have said that we want to work without limitation to specific technologies and we are again having an ideological debate about nuclear power, which is a discussion that can be held, but which ultimately makes no sense in the context of the SET plan."
"I concede to you in respect of the question of what the SET plan can actually achieve."
"Has the question of to what extent the Member States are prepared to find a coherent energy policy approach actually been resolved?"
"What the Council has put in place today is a series of platitudes."
"The problems, really, are not so much what we lay down in the SET plan, but how the assorted funds for research, innovation and the money from the SET plan, the issue of demonstration facilities, the issue of the transposal of European directives at national level - how all of this interacts."
"We are currently at a point where we have to say really clearly that we can produce another SET plan and that we can adopt another SET plan, but what we need now are tangible measures."
"That being the case, we should not always be arguing over the details."
"We should increase the pressure on the Commission and the Member States so that something happens in terms of implementation."
"(SV) Madam President, wishful thinking is not enough to bring about a changeover to sustainable, renewable energy sources and to a climate-friendly society."
"Substantial investment is also needed."
"The private sector must, to a large extent, share the responsibility for funding the basic research and the Member States must also make a greater commitment."
"In addition, more money needs to be made available from the EU budget."
"The budget must quite simply be adapted to conform with the political priorities relating to solar and wind energy, energy efficiency and so on. We need to reprioritise and redistribute funds within the EU budget."
"This is the only way in which the SET plan and the Members of this House can maintain their credibility."
"- Madam President, it is three years since the Council set itself a target of having up to 12 CCS demonstration projects in operation by 2015, and we have not got much to show for it yet."
"Yes, we have identified a source of funding and we have now got a draft decision from the Commission, which is awaiting confirmation by Parliament, as to how to use that funding, but it will not be until the end of next year before we are able to identify a project which will qualify for this funding."
"So the timetable is very tight and meeting that 2015 deadline becomes more and more difficult."
"There is slippage at every step of the way."
"Can I ask the Commission to consider these things."
"First, that timetable needs to be examined."
"Can days, can weeks be shaved off it at all?"
"And, in particular, can we put as much pressure as possible on the European Investment Bank to keep within the allocation it has been given in the draft decision?"
"Second, once Parliament's comitology procedure has been concluded, the Commission should make an announcement about the timetable."
"It should publish this."
"That will help ensure that there is a minimum amount of slippage."
"It will keep everyone working towards a series of set deadlines."
"Finally, remember that the biggest single delaying factor is likely to be the application that project developers have to go through to get planning permission for the pipelines and the like to take away CO2."
"That could be very lengthy."
"It could blow the deadline completely out of the window."
"So can I ask for a statement from the Commission, insisting that developers seeking European funding start applying for planning permission now."
"Let them put their money where their mouth is."
"(PL) Madam President, the resolution which has been presented illustrates very well the dominance of climate policy over energy security in the European Union."
"It also illustrates clearly the antinuclear prejudice of part of this House."
"It so happens that nuclear energy is the only commercially proven low-carbon energy source, but in spite of this it is very severely criticised in the resolution."
"The European Union's limited financial resources are to be invested in select energy sources just because they are sustainable, and this represents a strong market intervention."
"This policy will certainly limit expenditure on strategic large infrastructure projects which are already needed today, and on support for interconnectors."
"There simply will not be enough money for energy security."
"This is why we cannot endorse this resolution today."
"- (DA) Madam President, we have reason to be pleased with the SET Plan."
"Without the EUR 59 billion which are now being invested in sound energy projects, we will not reach our renewable energy target of 20% by 2020."
"Investment in real and sustainable renewable energy accounts for two thirds of the SET Plan funds."
"This applies, for example, to photovoltaics, wind turbines and biomass."
"However, the SET Plan is not only important and right because it ensures us cleaner energy."
"The SET Plan is also critical to our attempts to put the social and economic crisis behind us."
"With these massive investments in modern energy technology, we will be able to create hundreds of thousands of new green jobs."
"We will also be able to make the EU a centre of knowledge when it comes to green and sustainable technology."
"Let us not forget, however, that these investments come with a responsibility: a responsibility to ensure that many of the people who are currently employed in the energy sector are given the opportunity to retrain and upskill themselves."
"That is why investment in technology must go hand in hand with investment in people."
"- Madam President, there are two brief points I wish to make."
"The first relates to the importance of investment in low-carbon technologies and the second to carbon capture in agriculture."
"Firstly, in realistic terms, it is essential that the EU focuses its attention and budget towards the Strategic Energy Technology Plan."
"For the EU to reach its 2020 target figures, there is no doubt that increased targeted investment in low-carbon technologies is essential."
"Secondly, there must be increased research and investment in carbon capture and storage as a practical way of combating climate change."
"Here agriculture can play a key role in carbon sequestration and can contribute to the 2020 targets."
"Soil biomasses and natural carbon sinking - carbon in soil - could bring added benefit for farmers by reducing erosion and fertiliser inputs."
"Further research and investment is required in order to fully utilise agriculture and agricultural land to capture carbon and assist in reaching 2020 targets."
"For measurable results to be delivered, innovation and research in low-carbon technologies must be adequately and effectively supported."
"- Madam President, I welcome the initiative to talk about investment in low-carbon technology but more specifically about energy-saving and providing more secure and diversified energy supplies."
"I would like to look in particular at the use of EU funds."
"The region I represent already has an EU fund of over EUR 250 million for low-carbon economic growth."
"Whilst its ambitions are worthy, the performance of this fund in actually making meaningful investments has fallen well below expectations."
"The East of England, including Cambridge University, is also home to leading research facilities, and over 250 contracts have been signed in my region for Framework 7 grants."
"I have seen some excellent innovative research, but there are great questions about complexity, especially for SMEs, bureaucracy, and inflexibility when adapting to developments and science."
"In some cases there are appalling stories of late payments by the EU itself."
"When considering how taxpayers' money is invested in the future, we should look at the lessons of what has already happened and make sure we spend it better in the future."
"(PL) The discussion on investing in low-carbon technologies is a discussion about methods of adapting the economies of Member States to the requirements for limiting greenhouse gas emissions."
"Regardless of how climate and weather conditions for the last few months in our continent have been tending to supply arguments to those scientists who are calling into question the influence of man on climate change by CO2 emissions, we should, none the less, when talking about low-emission technologies in this context, ask the following question: how can the means necessary for the development of clean technologies be ensured, to achieve the maximum effects in the shortest possible time?"
"I think the system which is being created for support of research and development should be as flexible as possible, to enable resources to be managed in a way which is appropriate to the dynamics of scientific research."
"The question arises as to whether, and in what way, it is planned to create suitable mechanisms of support for investment in low-emission technologies?"
"Finally, I would also like to add that no matter what significant arguments can be found in favour of investing in the development of low-emission technologies, this should not take place at the expense of cohesion policy."
"(PL) Madam President, in the Communication from the Commission of 23 January 2008 entitled 'Supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels', which is part of the climate and energy package, it was stated that the European Union would support the construction of 10 to 12 carbon dioxide capture and storage demonstration plants."
"At the end of 2008, the European Parliament took up this matter, too, in a resolution."
"Item 11 of this document stated that the measures which had been unveiled by the Commission were not sufficient to provide the desired incentives for constructing at least 12 demonstration facilities by 2015, while in item 18 it was considered imperative that at least the 12 demonstration facilities earmarked for assistance should cover all possible combinations of the three carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies."
"The financial means are supposed, however, to come from the sale of 300 million allowances for CO2 emissions in the New Entrants' Reserve, or what is known as NER300."
"Consequently, the sum intended for support of construction of the demonstration plants is going to depend on the market price of the allowances."
"It is estimated that this will be from EUR 7-12 billion."
"From the proposed decisions of the Commission contained in the motion it can be gathered that support under NER300 will cover six carbon dioxide capture and storage projects in power generation and two in industry."
"Does the Council, in cooperation with the Commission, want to support the construction of a further two to four plants, and if so, how?"
"- Madam President, we have heard a lot of nonsense today about green jobs."
"The fact is that our obsession with renewables is already driving up the cost of electricity and forcing European citizens into fuel poverty."
"Higher energy prices mean that energy-intensive businesses in Europe will simply give up and go away, to more favourable jurisdictions."
"Higher energy prices mean lower growth and higher unemployment, and they cost jobs."
"I have only seen one formal study into this question of green jobs."
"That was in Spain, and it demonstrated that, for every single job created in the green sector, 2.2 jobs were lost elsewhere."
"If we are really serious about low-carbon electricity, there is only one solution and that is nuclear power."
"Across Europe we are starting to talk about new nuclear capacity, and that is good."
"If we want to keep the lights on, we need a nuclear renaissance, and it we need it fast."
"- (PT) Research and technology play a fundamental role in the development of a low-carbon society."
"It is crucial to invest in radical social change based on the sustainability of cities, decentralised energy production and the competitiveness of industry."
"This is an essential policy for a prosperous and sustainable society that is prepared for the challenges of climate change, energy security and globalisation, and that is a world leader in the sphere of clean technologies."
"The Strategic Energy Technology Plan aims to contribute to precisely this goal."
"I welcome the essential guidelines presented in the communication on how to organise the logic of intervention between the public and private sectors, between Community, national and regional financing."
"It is, however, essential to increase public funding for scientific research into the field of clean technologies."
"Europe also needs to create conditions that foster greater private investment in this field."
"We urgently need to move from words to deeds."
"The priorities of the future Financial Perspectives of the EU and the Eight Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development will have to be energy security, the fight against climate change, and the environment."
"This is the only way we will be able to maintain the competitiveness of our industry, promote economic growth and create jobs."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just a routine debate but it is supposed to be very specific and to ask clear and precise questions - what resources are there and where to get them - and I hope that Parliament is expecting equally clear and precise answers, today and at the forthcoming Councils on 12 and 25 March."
"We want to tell the Commission and the Council firmly that the European Union, which has flown the flag for the fight against atmospheric emissions and climate change in front of the world, now has to be consistent if it does not want to lose credibility."
"It must do everything it can to achieve these goals."
"We must be well aware that talking about a low-emission economy means a kind of Copernican revolution for the production system; it means changing many things, having clear priorities and political will but, above all, sufficient resources and instruments."
"We also know that this Copernican revolution is vital for our production system, European industry, to remain competitive."
"In many countries, in many research centres and in many universities, the intellectual resources are ready, the capabilities are there and the will is there: it is now time to set things in motion."
"Everyone has to do it, as the Commissioner and the Council have said: the Member States, entrepreneurs and the private sector have to do it."
"I believe, however, that the vital task of putting this complex partnership together belongs to the European Union."
"- Madam President, we all agree that greater energy efficiency is the first step in the chain, but I want in my contribution to draw your attention to the political confusion and anxiety surrounding bio-energy."
"I think that this House in particular and the Commission, and Europe in general, ran away from parts of bio-energy when we had the food price hikes of 2007 and 2008."
"Few of us are talking about the realities for most farmers across Europe now, which is a crisis of confidence because prices have collapsed."
"Yet there is no coherent political message to them on land use and using their land to grow energy crops."
"In Ireland in particular we have the Government running away from this area."
"Look, what industry needs is political certainty; what politicians fail to deliver is that certainty, and we have reaped the reward for it."
"If we are talking about investing in research and there is no uptake of the research because we will not make the right political decisions, we are wasting our time."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, financing the changeover to green low-carbon technologies will be particularly difficult in the case of the new Member States."
"One potential and very important source for Central European and Baltic States would be the use of the emission credits accumulated under the Kyoto Protocol's emissions trading system, thereby profiting from these countries' climate resources."
"The condition for doing so, of course, would be the creation of a post-Kyoto system or support from the European Council and the Commission in our efforts to get proper value for our remaining climate resources."
"As rapporteur for biogas, I am well aware of the cost of new technologies, and thus that technological development would be very important."
"It is very important to pursue this point within the framework of the common agricultural policy, for instance by altering the composition of livestock feed, by introducing ploughing methods other than deep tilling and introducing new, innovative technologies."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on the European Union's energy choices, one thing is certain: the most significant, cheapest and most sustainable energy source available to us is saved energy."
"For natural, historical, cultural and economic reasons, mountain regions are a model for reducing energy consumption, in line with the demands of modern life, and they lend themselves to large-scale experimentation with the use of renewable energy sources with low-carbon emissions."
"Mountain regions produce almost all of Europe's hydroelectric energy."
"To give an example, the province where I come from in Italy alone produces 12% of the hydroelectric energy of the entire country."
"Furthermore, in mountain areas there is historical experience of constructing buildings that are more efficient in terms of saving energy."
"We have managed to build homes that are completely self-sufficient in terms of both electricity and heating and that even supply more energy than they use, obviously with the use of advanced technologies."
"The mountains are often a testing ground, and so are the ideal environment for experimenting with better use of biomass, solar energy, geothermal energy, heat pumps and, above all, for overhauling energy distribution systems."
"Commissioner, the mountains are full of energy, clean energy: we just need to take it."
"For this reason we ask the Commission to involve mountain regions in its strategy, to look carefully at their experience and to recognise their right to receive fair compensation for all the renewable energy already supplied by these regions."
"Article 174 of the Treaty of Lisbon recognises the role of mountains, which is why we are anxiously waiting for an initiative from the Commission to implement this article and for a European mountain policy also in the field of energy."
"I therefore call on the Commission to follow the recommendations of the Durnwalder report, in the Committee of the Regions, and to include in the assessment of European territories the energy issues and the production capacity of mountain regions in terms of renewable energy and passive construction."
"Mountains, which make up 40% of European territory and are home to 90 million people, have, up to now, been seen as disadvantaged areas: by implementing innovative and consistent energy policies, these regions can overcome this handicap and provide a vital stimulus to achieve the objectives set in the 20-20-20 strategy, showing that energy selfsufficiency is possible, at an acceptable cost, if the firm political will is there."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking on my own behalf, and I would like to say to my opposite number: in my view, nuclear technology is no solution and is also not, as far as I am concerned, a renewable energy source."
"Our job here is to put in place measures that will benefit our children and our future over the long term."
"It is therefore very important for us to reduce CO2 emissions, although such a reduction must not be at the expense of the environment - in other words we must pay very close attention to which measures are funded and which measures are invested in."
"We must not save CO2 whilst at the same time ruining our environment."
"2010 is the Year of Biodiversity, and it is very important that we also put on record in these papers that all investments, all measures, must also be seen in the light of conserving our environment for our children, for our future and for biodiversity."
"- (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, the debate on the transition to a low-carbon economy must not allow us to forget this fact."
"The transition will hardly be a smooth process. In a few years we will be confronted with the effects of the shortage and the progressive depletion of the primary source of energy on which we depend: fossil fuels."
"These fuels also serve as raw materials for many extremely important industries, such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries."
"It is absolutely necessary for mankind that the world's remaining oil reserves be managed very wisely, which means, first and foremost, very sparingly."
"It is in this context, that the adoption of the plan called the Oil Depletion Protocol, presented in Uppsala in 2002 and in Lisbon in 2005 by a group of scientists and specialists from several countries who are part of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, would be crucial in introducing a plan that prioritises a good and fair management of these resources, the mitigation of their shortage and a controlled transition to other primary sources of energy."
"(HU) In my opinion, nuclear energy has not received the place it deserves in this report."
"The solutions aimed at developing alternative, bio-, wind and solar energy are all lengthy and not at all certain to pay off in the end."
"Yet we have to move fast in our energy strategy if we recall the effects of last year's gas crisis and the threat of climate changes."
"Nuclear power is the greatest carbon-free energy source within the European Union, and currently provides one-third of our electricity needs."
"Its further safe development is simply unavoidable."
"It would be helpful if we all realised this."
"(GA) Madam President, I listened to the debate and it was very interesting."
"I have read everything I could about this subject."
"I just want to make two points."
"Number one: the question has been asked, where is the funding going to come from?"
"It seems to me there is an opportunity here for the three institutions of the European Union - experts from Parliament, from the Council, from the Commission - to come together as a steering group."
"Number one: to source the funding that is required in the public/private partnerships, with possible targets for each country; and number two: to oversee and coordinate research."
"It should be R&D&D - research, demonstration and delivery - and with some of the funding certainly dependent on a successful outcome, otherwise every professor around Europe will be trying to do research, and it will be uncoordinated at the end of the day."
"(HU) We have heard beautiful words from the representative of the Council and the Commission about low-carbon technologies, but he failed to address the key issue: where will the financing come from?"
"A certain group of Member States does have a ready source: the former socialist countries have by far exceeded their Kyoto commitments."
"These countries are entitled to cash in on their carbon dioxide quotas. Yet the Commission and the 15 original Member States want to prevent them from doing so."
"In the case of Hungary this amounts to several hundred billion forints."
"In Copenhagen, Hungary and Poland agreed to use these sums for green infrastructures."
"So these, then, are the sources."
"So far, this proposition has fallen on deaf ears, indicating that it is true after all: new Member States do indeed count as second-class members of the European Union."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we completely agree on a couple of points, going on what I have heard this morning: efficiency, savings, renewables and new technologies."
"It is not enough though, ladies and gentlemen, if we do not decisively deal with another two issues."
"The first is nuclear: just the word, merely broaching the subject, frightens us."
"Let us conduct research and try to be responsible in this research."
"The second is funding: we are afraid to talk about PPPs, as I have heard this morning."
"The mere thought that the private sector could play a part in any initiative with the public is almost seen as something alien, shameful and suspicious."
"It is unavoidable, ladies and gentlemen, with the financial resources to which we have to refer. Furthermore, it is important for the public to interact with the private sector, since the public must learn to act in a business-like way and in accordance with a sustainable policy."
"(DE) Madam President, I will keep my question short."
"In the groups, we had hackneyed debates - but justified ones - about ideological issues in the context of technologies."
"Let us for once, however, come up with a question together that the Council and the Commission must answer."
"We discussed the SET Plan for a long time."
"What are the instruments to implement it?"
"What are the time frames?"
"What undertakings are there from the Member States?"
"(DE) Madam President, I am not going to deal with the issue of ideology at this point - we can do that another time - but I do think that the ideologists, really, are on the other side of this Chamber."
"The Commission will have two tangible instruments in its hands over the next few weeks."
"The first is the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility, which still has some money in it."
"This money could now be used for a renewed push for renewable energies and energy efficiency."
"I have been told that the Commission's Directorate-General for Research is blocking the money - it does not want to spend this money on energy but would rather spend it on ICT and other areas."
"Perhaps the Commissioner has something to say in this regard?"
"The second instrument consists of the 15% - at least - of the funds that are apparently still left in the Economic Recovery Plan, and we, as Parliament, have established that this money must be spent on energy efficiency, in particular on Smart Cities."
"Can you also tell me anything about this, Commissioner?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Madam President, I have taken due note of this morning's debate and I am pleased to confirm that many of the concerns voiced by Parliament are shared by the Council."
"I trust that the conclusions we will adopt tomorrow will allow us to establish a solid basis that meets the concerns expressed and enables us to make immediate progress in the launching of industrial initiatives."
"I think we have clear consensus over the fact that those initiatives are fundamental if we are to reduce our energy dependence, improve our efficiency, continue to make technological progress - thereby giving a further boost to European technology - and, of course, meet the challenges of climate change."
"These initiatives are also necessary to maintain European competitiveness and create employment."
"I think I can reassure Mr Helmer: there are other studies apart from the one he has read, some of which were carried out by the Commission itself, showing the positive impact on employment - an effect that will be even greater in the long term."
"We therefore propose that a set of common principles and practices be applied, giving direction to existing industrial initiatives."
"This will, of course, among other things, require us to establish financial tools and public intervention criteria that are needed to support the development of these technologies."
"A great deal of emphasis has been placed on financial aspects, and this is also a concern shared by the Council."
"However, the Council cannot commit to reassigning funds without respecting the Commission's right of initiative and the powers shared by Parliament in this area."
"Therefore, in the meantime the current financing agreements will have to be applied."
"Nevertheless, we need to insist on the importance of increasing our budgets in order to develop these new technologies, and on the fact that prioritising those increases must be a fundamental element in future discussions within the European institutions, particularly this Parliament."
"I can also assure you that the Council has done and will continue to do everything it can to guarantee that the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan has proper funding, within the context of both the current financial framework and future frameworks."
"As the Commissioner has already said, I would like to recall that, in general terms, private initiatives - private sources of funding - also have an important role to play; this is an area in which we need to work hand in hand in order to maximise the impact of public financial resources."
"We need to achieve a large-scale, multiplying effect that enables us to successfully implement these initiatives which are vital to the future of Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank you for this discussion."
"I followed it very closely and there are many things which we will certainly take into consideration when developing our future work."
"Let me start with a short story."
"After the 1970s oil crisis we saw enthusiasm for innovation adding a competitive edge, even respecting the environment, on an unprecedented scale, but this was short lived."
"After oil prices had fallen consistently for long enough, investment in R&D and deployment was dropped, market case for new technologies removed, shifting consumption patterns, and we were pushed into a period of tricky comfort where we depended on cheap foreign energy."
"It was a period with the illusion of sustainability."
"By the way, energy R&D investment immediately after the oil crisis was approximately four times higher than currently or some years ago."
"And where are we today, after that period of reluctant and irresponsible development lacking a proactive approach?"
"Reacting to climate change threats and trying to solve energy security dependence, so I do believe that a proactive vision is a realistic and necessary approach and not a daydream."
"In this context - the things underlined in the paper we adopted a few days ago: the European Union 2020 Strategy - we see no alternative to green growth."
"We need more clean industries, not more cleaning-up industries."
"We need incentives, prices, costs and the right signals."
"We need to focus on energy efficiency; we need to focus, if you like, on resource efficiency, which is one of the major things included in EU 2020."
"I shall turn now to the second issue, which is the SET Plan that we are discussing."
"All the estimates presented in the SET Plan for the financing required are based on technology road maps."
"This was a very serious piece of work."
"If you look at the proposals, what we envisage, how we estimate the financing needed for the future, you will find the following figures: wind: 6; solar: 16; bio: 19;"
"European Energy Research Alliance: 5, and basic research: 1."
"I would remind you that there is a figure of 7 for nuclear. I have to be fair."
"Fusion is not included, and fusion is, again, a serious figure which should come, but if we look at this picture I think that our message from the Commission side on where we should put the bulk of our investment is pretty clear."
"The next issue is the sources of finance and the road maps."
"The main sources, as I said in my introduction, will have to come from where the main sources are, and that is industry and the Member States."
"This means the European Union budget, current and future financial perspectives, the European Energy Programme for Recovery, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and, of course, use of the other instruments that exist, and the European Investment Bank especially should be considered in this respect."
"There is a serious question of the structure of the investment for the various initiatives proposed."
"I think it is obvious that the internal structure of public and private investment will not be the same because of the market proximity, because of the market failures you face in various types of technologies, which would need to be addressed, but I do believe that what is in front of you is a serious case, especially when you start discussing the next financial perspective, and that we have to rethink what our priorities are and how we should invest in the future."
"The next thing I would like to mention is that we will start all but one initiative - the Smart Cities, which came later, on your initiative, and which talks predominantly about resource efficiency - during 2010, but do not think that the things we are talking about here are not ongoing already: they are, especially in research."
"The Research Alliance has been working for a few years on this item already."
"The last thing I would like to mention is that, with the SET Plan, we are actually starting something very specific at European Union level."
"You know that, during my previous mandate, I fought very hard for a European research area."
"At European level we deal with approximately five per cent of research money, so unless we join our forces at EU level - meaning Europe level - and avoid duplicating our efforts, we cannot count on real success."
"Do not look only to the European budget."
"We should put the money together to step up our research capacity."
"The SET Plan is the best example we currently have of joint programming at EU level."
"Other activities are also coming, and rightly so, but I think we should not underestimate what is happening here."
"Here we are talking about public-public-private partnerships, which are very necessary and one of the issues to which I would draw your attention for the future."
"There is also the Financial Regulation where you will discuss it."
"It has to allow risk-taking if we seriously want these questions to be addressed."
"I think we are behind one of the major new developments in Europe when we talk about the SET Plan, about joint programming, which is behind this."
"We have here the European Energy Research Alliance - the best research organisations opened outward - which is already working together today on all these major issues."
"My final message is that I think it is our major duty to put our political weight behind this programme."
"I have received two motions for resolutionin accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure to wind up the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 on Thursday, 11 March 2010."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"Although I acknowledge that this Commission communication aims to speed up the development of new technologies with higher potential for low-carbon emissions through greater energy efficiency and the utilisation of renewable energy, I regret that the European regions still lack a more defined role in this strategy."
"It is necessary to guarantee regional authorities the correct financing, for example ensuring financing during the testing phase of pilot projects, or investment during the research and testing phase of renewable energy projects."
"I believe that it is important to include, for example, geothermal energy."
"This is a renewable energy source with great potential for expansion in volcanic regions, that is particularly important for remote and island regions of the Union, and for which no goals have been set."
"In this context, public and private investment must be increased by developing energy technologies so as to reach the desired goals of a low-carbon economy and also to help overcome the market failures referred to in the climate and energy package."
", in writing. - (HU) I think it is significant that the European Commission, when drawing up its Strategic Energy Technology Plan, took into consideration the amount of support needed for research and development of green technologies."
"This is all the more true because, at the present stage, solar energy, bio-energy and hydrogen technology are in most cases not yet commercially profitable."
"As Steven Chu, the United States Secretary of Energy rightly pointed out, research advances of Nobel Prize calibre are needed in order to make green technologies competitive with traditional fossil fuel technologies."
"However, the serious flaw of the green technology plan is that we have no idea what EU funds will be used to carry it out."
"Looking at the cost of EUR 16 billion deemed necessary for solar energy research, or the EUR 5 billion estimated for hydrogen-related technology, this cannot be a minor consideration."
"At this point there are no indications that the next seven-year financial framework will provide increased resources for research in green technologies."
"We are well aware that support from public funds is no substitute for the efforts of private investors."
"Nevertheless, the European Union and Member States must boost the funds devoted to green technology research."
"The eventual revenues from an emission trading system may serve as a good basis for this."
"The stakes are not negligible."
"We cannot allow the plans for energy policy and climate protection to suffer the same fate as the Lisbon Strategy with its contradictory outcomes."
"in writing. - To make Carbon Technology a practical reality we need to address the shortage of engineers and other high-skilled personnel designing and producing advanced technologies."
"We can do this by setting up or intensifying training schemes or scholarships to ensure that workers' skills are upgraded in time for economic recovery."
"We need to ensure a supply of highly qualified and well-educated workers with the right combination of both theoretical and practical skills.We also need to tackle persisting barriers to mobility within the EU, in particular for researchers and highly skilled people and to address the issue of EU-wide recognition of engineers' qualifications."
"Financial markets & institutions tend to be cautious about investing, particularly where SMEs are concerned number of EU schemes supporting innovation, although they need to be better synchronised and coordinated from both supply and demand perspectives."
"We need to facilitate cooperation between SMEs and research institutes, promoting IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) and technology transfer."
"EEI businesses themselves need to become more proactive in supporting cluster initiatives and joining clusters."
"We also need to stimulate research and innovation through tax incentives or innovation vouchers, and by improving the conditions for risk capital investment, for instance for business angels or cross-border venture capital."
"Global climate warming caused by human activity is a fact. Combating this process and its negative effects is the need of the hour."
"One way of dealing with these problems is to use clean and renewable energy sources."
"However, for these energy sources to play a significant role in the European energy system, two conditions have to be met."
"Firstly, we need an increase in funding available for research into their development."
"Secondly, we need an increase in funding for investments which implement the latest low-emission technologies."
"Investing in the development of the low-emission technologies contained in the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan is important from the point of view of the entire EU."
"In particular, however, it is important for countries whose energy industry - for historical reasons - emits large amounts of CO2."
"One such country is Poland."
"Improving and developing technologies for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a matter of vital significance for the whole of the Polish economy."
"Effects of the Xynthia storm in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, only two weeks after the dreadful disaster on Madeira, the Commission was again shocked and saddened by the death and devastation caused by storm Xynthia in France and other European countries."
"I wish to express my personal sympathy to all those that are suffering as a consequence of the disaster."
"The Commission's condolences go in particular to the families and friends of those that have lost their lives."
"Through the monitoring and information centre for civil protection, the Commission has been monitoring the events caused by storm Xynthia closely and has offered to set the mechanism for EU assistance in action."
"Fortunately, the French rescue services were able to respond to the disaster with their own means and did not request the activation of the mechanism."
"Together with the relevant authorities in the Member States, the Commission is now exploring all the possibilities and instruments that could be available at EU level to assist financially in overcoming the disaster and to help return to normal living conditions as soon as possible."
"Two days ago, Commission President Barroso met French President Sarkozy to discuss the situation."
"Yesterday he also met with a number of Members of this House from different countries."
"One week ago my colleague, Mr Hahn, Commissioner responsible for regional policy and the Solidarity Fund, visited the most hard-hit regions in France - La Rochelle and l'Aiguillon-sur-Mer - and met with national and regional authorities."
"On Madeira, where disaster struck two weeks earlier, the authorities and rescue services have been able to make enormous progress in combating the effects of the flooding disaster."
"Commissioner Hahn visited Madeira during the past weekend to get a first-hand impression and to discuss with the local authorities the way forward."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund was set up in 2002 specifically as the instrument at EU level to financially assist EU Member States affected by major natural disasters, if certain conditions are met."
"France has already declared its intention to apply for assistance from the Solidarity Fund."
"I should point out that the Regulation governing the Solidarity Fund normally allows its mobilisation only for what are known as 'major disasters', where the damage at national level exceeds the threshold of 0.6% of gross national income, or EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices."
"For France this currently means the damage would have to exceed approximately EUR 3.4747 billion at current prices."
"However, in exceptional circumstances and if specific criteria are met, the fund may also be used for smaller 'extraordinary regional disasters', in particular where they concern outermost regions like Madeira."
"The French authorities are currently carrying out an assessment of the damage and of its repercussions for the economy and the living conditions of the population."
"These are the essential elements for the application, which has to reach the Commission within 10 weeks of the disaster. That means before 9 May."
"After it is received it will be examined by the Commission as quickly as possible."
"The Commission services, in particular DG Regional Policy, are granting all possible assistance and guidance in preparing the application."
"Contacts at expert level are well established with the French authorities, thus allowing effective progress."
"Please be aware, however, that aid from the Solidarity Fund cannot be paid out immediately."
"The Solidarity Fund should not be misunderstood as an emergency instrument."
"It is a financial instrument to help bear the financial burden of emergency operations."
"As such, a possible grant could be used retroactively for emergency operations from day one of the disaster."
"The funding for the Solidarity Fund is raised through an extra effort of the Member States outside the normal European Union budget."
"It has to be approved by Parliament and the Council through an amending budget procedure."
"As you know, the whole procedure - from the moment the application is made to paying out the grant - inevitably takes several months."
"The Commission is, however, making every effort to keep this time span as short as possible."
"As regards the Structural Funds, in particular the ERDF, this can of course not be used for immediate emergency operations."
"France and the Commission have, however, started discussing the options and possible necessary programme modifications which might be instrumental for longer-term reconstruction and for investment in businesses affected by the flood."
"One last point, which Members of this House already raised during the debate on Madeira two weeks ago."
"The Commission will use the current political momentum to attempt to unblock the proposal for an amended Solidarity Fund regulation at the Council."
"Parliament widely supported this proposal, and I feel this is the right moment to take common action vis-à-vis the Council again."
"Madam President, Commissioner, during the evening of 27-28 February, storm Xynthia hit the coasts of Charente-Maritime and Vendée, my region, particularly hard."
"Fifty-three people died, a dozen people are unaccounted for, and hundreds of people have lost their homes."
"These are significant losses, and they are compounded by serious problems in relation to infrastructure."
"I am referring in particular to the dams, to the railway lines, to the sewage networks, to the electricity networks, to the telecommunication networks and to the entire system of small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular in the maritime sector, in the aquaculture sector and in the agricultural sector, with 45 000 hectares submerged by salt water, since this was a flood that originated in the sea."
"This is damage on a significant scale. This is damage of which the consequences will continue to be felt over time, since some farming land will now be unfit for use for several years."
"I therefore call here for the European Union to show solidarity and, of course, for this European Union Solidarity Fund to be made available in the best possible conditions and in the quickest possible time, because we cannot tell our fellow citizens that the funds will wait and that the problems cannot be resolved here and now."
"Together, we need, after the visit by the Commissioner - whom I sincerely thank for going and seeing for himself the scale of the disaster, and I know that he too has been deeply affected by it - unite our efforts to improve the use of this fund, so that progress can be made more quickly."
"We are always complaining that Europe is too far removed from our fellow citizens; let us show them here, today, that we are capable of reacting quickly."
"I regret that the Council is not here to help us with this regulatory amendment."
"In any case, rest assured that we need it and that our fellow citizens are expecting it."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the natural disasters that have hit Portugal, Madeira, France and Spain."
"Last week, a delegation from my Group went to Madeira, visited the areas most affected by the catastrophe and met with the regional and local authorities and business, industrial, trade and farmers' associations."
"We retain striking images and messages from what we saw and heard."
"We learnt of entire families who died in their own homes; we heard dramatic testimonies about people being pulled under the water, never to be seen again."
"Entire houses moved from one side of the street to the other, and cars still containing their passengers were swept away from the streets into the sea."
"However, the courage of Madeira's people in overcoming adversity was equally striking."
"I will never forget the pictures of determination of those who,despite losing their businesses, their homes and their possessions, refused to give up."
"On the contrary, they got straight to work, ready to start again from scratch."
"In just a few days, tonnes and tonnes of stone, earth and other debris were removed from the centre of the city of Funchal."
"The national, regional and local authorities joined efforts so that life on the island could go back to normal."
"Therefore, it is important to announce that tourists can return to Madeira."
"Its natural beauty and the warmth of its people await us."
"The people of Madeira are now also awaiting the solidarity of the European institutions to be able to rebuild the roads, bridges and public buildings that were destroyed."
"The tradesmen, industrialists and farmers also need our support in rebuilding their lives and contributing to the economic development of the region."
"I am greatly pleased, Commissioner, to hear that the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council, is determined to unblock the Cohesion Fund - the new proposal that has already been adopted by Parliament - so that new rules that are better adapted to the real needs of the public can be implemented."
"As you know, Commissioner, it is also necessary that the other structural funds are restructured and redeployed to the most affected areas, because special situations require special solutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to join with the declarations of sympathy for the victims of storm Xynthia, which has affected several areas of Europe."
"We must take action and in this regard I appreciated the serious declarations made today by Commissioner Potočnik, whose expertise I value and whose commitment I must acknowledge."
"In this regard, I call on him to make the necessary amendments to the Solidarity Fund, reminding him though that Parliament already adopted the measure by a large majority in 2006."
"Given these situations and given these deaths, we can only reiterate how critical it is to adopt measures such as this."
"However, at the same time, Mr President, we must act on several fronts and firstly review all the development and regional planning programmes and update them in view of their environmental impact, also including an assessment of the effects on the ground."
"We also need to invest substantial sums to establish long-term action aimed at implementing a disaster prevention strategy."
"This is not an optional or fanciful choice, but a necessary choice if we want disasters such as those we are discussing today not to have such tragic consequences."
"However, there are also economic reasons, if we want to limit ourselves solely to this aspect, which oblige the institutions to take action in terms of prevention."
"While we are claiming in the resolution that it is necessary to pledge substantial amounts to repair the damage, we must shift our attention and our action to investments and initiatives for environmental protection, reforestation and the protection of vegetation, given that these will reduce the costs of repairing environmental damage."
"We must learn from disasters of this kind - modern man must learn from them - that not everything can be controlled but that everything can be limited if adequate precautions are taken."
"We must do it, Mr President, also in memory of victims such as those who, in recent days and in recent weeks, unfortunately, throughout Europe have characterised the reality of our regions."
"Mr President, I would also like to express my deepest sympathy - my own and that of my Group - and my solidarity with the affected regions, while regretting the serious economic consequences of these disasters and offering in particular our condolences to the families of the victims."
"It is also important to emphasise the need for national, regional and local authorities now to focus on effective prevention policies and to pay more attention to adequate practices and legislation relating to land use."
"It is precisely for this reason that there are two amendments that we tabled as a group, because, in our view, they are missing in the joint resolution."
"The first states: whereas in France construction has been authorised on flood plains and on natural wetlands; whereas building speculation has encouraged the construction of buildings in vulnerable areas."
"For us this is a vital aspect to make progress."
"The second amendment calls for cofinancing by Community funds for implementing these plans, in particular the Structural Funds, the EAFRD, the Cohesion Fund and the European Solidarity Fund, to be subject to sustainability measures."
"For us this is vital in ultimately deciding whether or not we will vote in favour of the resolution."
"Mr President, our first words can only be of condolence and solidarity for the families of the victims of this catastrophe."
"We welcome the European Union's words of solidarity for the affected regions and towns."
"It is important now to make this solidarity tangible, by quickly mobilising the necessary means and resources to relieve the damage caused by bad weather."
"In the past years, the Member States have been hit by a considerable number of catastrophes, as demonstrated by the 62 requests to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, made by a total of 21 countries, in only its first six years of existence."
"The damage caused by these catastrophes is hard to assess, particularly because of the loss of human life."
"In any case, the economic and social costs are almost always very significant."
"It is in this context that prevention will have to play a more important social role, and become an increasingly important phase in the catastrophe management process."
"It is important to develop cooperation and solidarity in this area within the European Union. First of all, by creating a financial framework suitable for prevention that will support the implementation of protection measures for the public, the environment and the climate by the Member States."
"The recipients of special aid must be, amongst others, such actions as the correction of potentially dangerous situations, the protection of the most risk-prone areas, the reinforcement of early warning systems in the Member States and the establishment and reinforcement of existing connections between the various early warning systems."
"As it has already been said here, the sensible utilisation of land, economic and social development that is in harmony with nature, and strengthened cohesion in the European Union are also vital factors for the prevention of catastrophes."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several European regions have been hit by some exceptional natural meteorological phenomena, which have resulted in huge material, economic, agricultural and environmental damage, and have sadly claimed too many human lives."
"I dare to hope, Commissioner, that beyond your due condolences, the European Solidarity Fund, a European activity that in this case is useful, will be able to be implemented quickly and flexibly in both France and Madeira, just as it has been - as someone said - in other European countries, to help my compatriots in Vendée and Charente-Maritime restore their vital infrastructure and services."
"It is my understanding from what you have said that the French Government has not yet referred this matter to you, and I am very surprised at that."
"However, I must say that there are some aspects to the way in which certain people are exploiting these events that I find quite intolerable."
"Firstly, this compulsive need to link the natural disasters that we are suffering to socalled global warming."
"No matter what political or pseudo-scientific claims we may be fed, they will not dictate the weather and the tides any more than they will prevent earthquakes."
"The second is the systematic search for culprits and easy scapegoats."
"The Xynthia disaster in the west of France is due to the very rare combination of two events: the storm itself, of course, and some unusually high tides, which led to the collapse of the dams."
"Controversy has erupted over the building permits granted by the mayors, who have been made personally responsible for the deaths that have occurred in their municipalities."
"However, no one - not the département, the region, the public services, the town planners or the architects - objected to these building permits requested by individuals."
"The elected representatives of the region, and in particular in the small municipalities, are quite rightly held in high regard by their fellow citizens."
"They shoulder a great deal of responsibility for virtually nothing, they have a remarkable sense of the general interest, they are coping with ever more complex duties, for which Europe is partly responsible, and they have also been completely abandoned by the public authorities, and I was anxious to point this out here."
"- (NL) Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) endorses the resolution and advocates that we convey appropriate expressions of condolence and solidarity and take direct action."
"There are a few points I would like to add to that."
"First of all, I think it is excellent that the Commission has stepped into the breach and that Mr Hahn is also considering how he might be able to alter his operational programmes."
"That also bodes well for the short term."
"However, the actual problem lies in the Solidarity Fund."
"How has the Council been able to get away for years with holding up action by Parliament to make the Solidarity Fund more flexible?"
"In my opinion, it is really a very good thing that Mr Potočnik has been so unambiguous about the fact that the Commission will now be taking the initiative."
"The Spanish Presidency really ought to be here today in order to confirm that."
"Now is the time to act and Parliament is extremely unhappy about this hold-up."
"However, there is also a second dimension to this issue."
"I come from the Netherlands. Most of the Netherlands is situated below sea level."
"As the spring flooding of 1953 is still very vivid in our memories, we know that it is vital to look ahead."
"We know that safety and preventative measures have to go hand in hand with development in these regions, that is, development of any activities that have an impact on the coast."
"And that is definitely an achievable aim."
"We in the Netherlands have now come up with a plan, a delta plan, to reinforce our coastal defences and we are also looking into other matters where it is imperative that we link safety with economic development."
"By way of conclusion, let me add that in 2008 an initiative was taken in the French coastal town of Saint Malo to assemble all coastal regions under the auspices of the United Nations, in conjunction with the OECD."
"The United Nations now has a disaster prevention plan for coastal regions and it is that world-wide perspective that is so very important."
"The European Parliament has a pilot project for the 2009-2010 period and we have supported our regions' participation in it, by providing funding, amongst other means."
"The world-wide dimension is something that we have to get on the agenda here in the upcoming period."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the Madeira floods and of storm Xynthia."
"The necessary questions must be asked about the worrying increase in these destructive meteorological phenomena, and about the role played by climate change and the urgent need to find solutions."
"For now, it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters."
"Of course, public and private insurance providers must be responsive but, when it comes to the destroyed infrastructure and rebuilding the areas concerned, European solidarity must be expressed."
"That is why the French Government has requested aid from the EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, which I hope will be granted quickly and meaningfully."
"This is the thrust of the two letters that I have sent to the Commission since 1 March in my capacity as an elected representative for the west of France region and which I had the opportunity to discuss, last Thursday, in La Rochelle, with Commissioner Hahn, whom I sincerely thank for being so responsive."
"Commissioner Hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement."
"Well, we have to conclude that it could have been made more flexible if the Council had not incomprehensibly blocked the review of the operation of this fund as adopted by a very large majority of MEPs in May 2006."
"I therefore hope that the Spanish Presidency will break the deadlock on this text so that the system can be made more effective."
"In more immediate terms, I call on the Commission to authorise a oneoff increase in cofinancing via the ERDF and ESF regional funds for projects in the regions affected, within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer."
"Lastly, this aid should not be used to rebuild in such a way that the same tragic environmental and town planning mistakes are made; rather, it should be used in a considered way, so as to prevent as far as possible a repeat of such tragedies."
"(FR) Mr President, following the disaster that has struck the French coast only a few weeks after Madeira, our group has tabled some amendments so that our Parliament, as well as expressing its solidarity, will denounce those responsible."
"For European citizens have not died and others have not lost everything in these disasters simply because the elements were unleashed."
"This also happened because some very grave mistakes were made in allowing the coastlines and riverbanks to become builtup."
"These mistakes are the fault of the Member States, of their laws, which are very inadequate, of their authorities, which are too lax, and of their governments, which are too unaccountable."
"Having allowed building to take place in flood zones is no less serious than having permitted and encouraged the consumption of tobacco or asbestos over the years, even though people were dying and it was very clear that that was the reason why."
"Before Xynthia there was Madeira, and before Madeira there was Sicily; tomorrow, there will be other disasters."
"If the European Parliament does not raise its voice, it in turn will be accountable for the disasters of the future."
"The European Union must show its solidarity, but it must also demonstrate a sense of responsibility."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, like everyone here, our thoughts are first and foremost with the populations, with the bereaved families and with those who have lost everything as a result of storm Xynthia."
"One of the lessons to be learnt from this disaster will have been, once again, the usefulness of the services of the Member States, of the municipalities, of the departments, of the regions, including the public services and the civil protection services, which have demonstrated their effectiveness."
"As we all agree, today we must urgently help the families to repair and to rebuild, but we must rebuild in a different way, by taking account of nature and of human beings."
"To do so, we must encourage the insurance companies, which are swimming in profits, to reimburse people for the damage caused."
"On the other hand, given the exceptional nature of the disaster that has hit these regions, the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States, must take action on a much greater scale and more quickly, not least by harnessing the European Solidarity Fund, and it must do so in a more flexible manner than the one you have certainly just described, Commissioner."
"Indeed, the destruction of homes and businesses, and the sterilisation of farming land are probably impossible to quantify using our traditional criteria."
"On the other hand, we will also have to combine the regional funds and the ESF Fund to help the regions get back on their feet."
"Beyond that, it is important to learn every lesson from what has just happened and to take action to prevent such disasters or to limit the damage of such climatic phenomena."
"The issue of building in flood zones and of combating real estate speculation along the coastline must be completely reexamined in connection with the balances of nature, farming activities, aquaculture, oyster faming and fishing, which European policies all too often destroy."
"That is why I propose that the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States and the regions, should establish a consistent sustainable reconstruction and development plan that takes account of the geography, environment, biodiversity and activities along the coastline."
"Lastly, there must be an opportunity to establish a common prevention, monitoring and warning system by which swift, solidarity-based assistance can be provided to the populations."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague Mrs Morin-Chartier and the other Members have said, on 27 and 28 February the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions, claiming 53 lives and causing huge material damage."
"The storm was exceptionally intense; it caused devastating floods along the French coast."
"After Madeira, Europe has once again been affected."
"Brittany, the region of my colleague and friend, Mr Cadec, has been severely affected."
"A state of natural disaster has thus been declared in three French regions: Brittany, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire."
"In the face of these disasters, the European Union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity."
"Words and a resolution alone will not enable us to support the victims of these disasters; we must also and above all provide financial aid."
"I therefore call on the European Commission - and my colleague Mr Béchu supports my request - to swiftly release the EU Solidarity Fund so as to help the disaster areas cope with the damage."
"This disaster shows that Mr Barnier's proposal to create a European civil protection force is relevant."
"Europeans must take action together, since more and more disasters are occurring and they are affecting our European territories and, in particular, our most isolated and vulnerable regions, such as the islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean islands."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my solidarity to the families of the victims affected by storm Xynthia."
"Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Madeira with a delegation from the Committee on Regional Development of Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"It was the first time that a European delegation had had the opportunity to be there on the ground and to meet the authorities and people from the island."
"The storms that hit Madeira killed more than 40 people and wounded or displaced hundreds more."
"Economic losses are estimated at EUR 100 million with 900 businesses and more than 3 500 workers directly affected."
"The priority now is to rebuild infrastructure, ensure that the situation returns to normal and, above all, rebuild Madeira's image abroad and regain people's trust in its tourism industry, thereby stimulating its economy and development."
"A number of adverse weather conditions, particularly storm Xynthia, have also affected Spain, especially the areas of Andalusia and the Canary Islands, as well as western France and other countries."
"These major disasters have caused enormous economic damage and require an urgent, speedy and efficient response from the European Union; we therefore need to mobilise the necessary tools in order to tackle this kind of disaster."
"Commissioner, this is an extraordinary situation that requires extraordinary measures."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in October last year I had the opportunity, as part of a delegation from the Committee on Regional Development, to see all the wonderful things that are being done with EU funds on Madeira, for which reason I, too, feel personally very affected by this disaster."
"I want to express my sympathy to the family members affected, but also to those who, in the space of just a few hours, lost everything that they had spent their lives building up."
"At this time in particular, the European Union is under the microscope, and the Solidarity Fund was set up for precisely this kind of difficult situation, as the people of Madeira and France now need not only our sympathy but also, more than anything, our financial assistance."
"The disaster in France and on Madeira has also been intensified by the fact that people have perhaps been too ambitious in their attempts to control the natural world and have attempted to lead their lives by overruling the laws of nature."
"The fact that that is not possible in the long term has been demonstrated very painfully here again."
"What this means is that all funds must be used in such a way that they guarantee security, prevention and sustainability, and there must be special attention paid to this."
"(ES) Mr President, firstly I would like to express my solidarity and condolences to France and Portugal, particularly to La Rochelle and Madeira; secondly, may I express my solidarity with my own country, particularly Andalusia and the Canary Islands, which have been affected by these major storms."
"However, I must make a severe criticism of the European Union Solidarity Fund."
"The Solidarity Fund is obsolete and has not taken account of this Parliament's resolution of 2006."
"It no longer has any value whatsoever."
"The figures given - 0.6% of GDP and EUR 3 billion - do not correspond to what this situation demands, for this is no longer just an emergency but also a reconstruction effort."
"We have faith in the Spanish Presidency and we therefore call on it to provide the impetus needed to reform the Solidarity Fund."
"(PT) Mr President, I will start by expressing my most heartfelt condolences to all the families of the victims of Xynthia, especially in France and Spain."
"Nobody would have expected that just a week after what happened in Madeira this storm would hit the coasts of France, Spain and, especially, the Canary Islands with such violence."
"Last Saturday, I had the opportunity to accompany Mr Hahn, who was in Madeira visiting the most affected areas and was able to see for himself the level of destruction that took place on the ground."
"Tomorrow, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, will do the same."
"The fact that they are doing this, and personally witnessing the level of destruction, makes them privileged witnesses of what happened and focuses people's attention on what is most important now: urgent aid."
"It is essential that Parliament be able to commit itself to working quickly to review the structure of the Solidarity Fund, simplifying it and sending aid faster so that we can quickly provide relief to people from whom we cannot request more time."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I come from a small village, with approximately 500 inhabitants, which was severely hit by floods just two years ago."
"It was actually a pure miracle - or, if you wish, lucky - that there were no human casualties."
"At that time we benefited greatly from the same Solidarity Fund that we are talking about."
"I fully understand the feelings of the people on the ground."
"They are also looking for solidarity from all around the European Union - solidarity which is fast and efficient."
"That is why I think it is of the utmost importance that we focus on the Solidarity Fund Regulation."
"As you know, the Commission proposal for an amendment to the European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation dates back to 2005."
"This proposal concerns mostly the extension of the fund to disasters other than natural ones."
"However, it also includes elements that might have been relevant in the case of Xynthia as well - a proposal to lower the thresholds and the possibility of paying advances of the expected aid."
"There have been signals from several Member States lately - including from France - that they may reconsider their negative position."
"Together with Parliament, the Commission intends taking a new initiative very shortly vis-à-vis the Council and its Spanish Presidency, to unblock the dossier."
"I also agree with the remark that we should do our utmost to be better prepared."
"The frequency and intensity of disastrous events is clearly increasing, and this is worrying."
"So I think that being better prepared is of the utmost importance."
"In this context, the Cohesion and Structural Funds should play their role also."
"There are also other possibilities which can be explored."
"I have already mentioned the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"Also the Rural Development Fund can be redirected but of course only at the request of the Member State."
"I would like to thank you for your support and I would also like to thank you in the name of my colleague, Johannes Hahn, who has responsibility for this area."
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"On 27 and 28 February, the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions."
"It claimed 53 lives and caused huge material damage, including, in particular, serious flooding."
"After the disaster in Madeira, Europe was hit once again."
"My region, Brittany, has been severely affected, and a state of natural disaster has been declared in three departments, just as it has in the Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire regions."
"I should like to express my full solidarity with the families affected and with the victims of the disaster."
"The European Union as a whole must show its responsiveness and its solidarity by means of a financial aid package and support measures aimed at reconstruction."
"Mr Béchu joins me in requesting emergency aid."
"Today, the financial resources of the Solidarity Fund seem difficult to implement."
"It must be acknowledged that Parliament has been calling for more effective and swifter use of the EU Solidarity Fund since 2005."
"The Commission and the Council must facilitate the swift release of this fund for the affected regions."
"This disaster shows that the Barnier report on the creation of a European civil protection force - EuropeAid - makes perfect sense and would enable us to develop a more effective response to disasters."
"In recent weeks, two natural disasters of tragic proportions hit Europe and its Member States, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction and causing damage costing tens of thousands of euro."
"We will not forget the dramatic images from Madeira at the end of February - which I watched with particular sadness, because it was a tragedy affecting an island that I know well - or the dramatic report of the path of Xynthia through several areas in Europe."
"On this occasion, besides expressing my sincere concern for all those who were affected by these tragedies, I urge the Commission to act swiftly in the relief effort to the most affected regions."
"This must be done not only by mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund as urgently and flexibly as possible and with the greatest possible funding, but also by utilising all the instruments and mechanisms made available by the Cohesion Fund to assist the affected regions in overcoming this terrible tragedy."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to express my solidarity with all the efforts made by Madeira's local authorities and its people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we are having to deal with this sad and now customary matter once again."
"I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas, and I would like to express my particular condolences to the families of the victims."
"We need to provide help to the victims and pave the way so that the affected areas can recover quickly."
"We also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention."
"Finally, and most importantly, I would call on the Spanish Government to use its current Presidency of the European Union to provide the impetus needed to modify the current European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation - a request already made on a number of occasions by the European Parliament - in order to achieve faster, more flexible and more efficient access to it."
"in writing. - (RO) The incidence of global natural disasters is alarming."
"We can see today the consequences of our irresponsible actions in the past as we are faced with a new challenge: combating the effects of climate change."
"It goes without saying that the cost of the operations involved in rebuilding the areas affected by natural disasters are incomparably higher in relation to the efforts required for prevention."
"At EU level we have instruments available for dealing with such situations, which supplement the projects carried out by regions."
"For example, in the Western Region of Romania, which I represent, a project is being promoted for improving the capabilities and quality of the intervention system deployed in emergency situations."
"The financial instruments available, including the Structural and Cohesion Funds, as well as the Fund for Rural Development, must be reviewed so that they offer greater flexibility in emergencies."
"With regard to the Solidarity Fund, the lowering of the threshold for mobilising the fund and the possibility of making advance payments of the relevant amounts would speed up intervention and reconstruction efforts and make them more effective."
"Last but not least, we will have to give due attention to an older initiative, namely the rapid reaction force, which will cover the entire territory of the European Union, because natural phenomena affect neighbouring regions, and this creates the conditions for solidarity and cross-border action."
"in writing. - (PT) I would like to join with the many declarations of sympathy for the victims of the torrential storm that battered Madeira on 20 February, as well as the declarations of solidarity with all those who are suffering the pain of grief for lost family and friends and lost possessions."
"I would also like to stress the constant need to consolidate the European Union's capacity to provide help to populations affected by natural disasters."
"By losing personal property such as their homes, their livelihoods and their jobs, these populations could fall into a desperate situation."
"In these cases, social justice is only achieved through solidarity, not forgetting that all of society benefits from each of its citizens having decent living conditions."
"Therefore, it is not too much to insist on the need to enlarge the European Union Solidarity Fund and make it more flexible."
"In this context, I would like to declare my total support for the resolution on Madeira adopted today by the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (DE) The recent storms across Madeira, parts of Spain and France took a heavy toll with over 40 deaths on Madeira, another 60 in France, countless missing persons and extensive property damage."
"Managing natural disasters is an opportunity for Europe to prove its added value."
"Rapid and uncomplicated cooperation between European partners is required in order to counter the dramatic consequences of the storm Xynthia and the devastating torrential rains."
"The Solidarity Fund and other EU financial instruments can at least make it possible to tackle the economic damage of the disaster more quickly."
"However, the organisation of disaster prevention must always remain in the hands of the Member States, who are best placed to deal with their national circumstances and thus to react most rapidly in emergencies."
"In order to prevent future storm damage, the Commission should support the Member States in their efforts to produce effective emergency plans and tables of risks."
"With the march of climate change and the dislocation of water cycles that that promotes, it will not be possible to completely fend off even fiercer storms in the future."
"However, the damage that such storms cause can certainly be reduced with better prior planning."
"Storm Xynthia is another tragic and painful demonstration of the climatic disturbances that are intensifying the violence and the frequency of what are, nonetheless, natural phenomena."
"Nowadays, the European Union is confronted too often with such natural disasters to make do with its existing policies, and I believe that it should strengthen three areas of intervention in order to better protect its citizens: prevention, which is addressed in the 2009 White Paper on adapting to climate change, for which I was rapporteur for the opinion and which specifically emphasises the vulnerability of coastal and mountain areas; rapid intervention, by finally creating this European civil protection force, about which we have done nothing but talk and which only needs a proposal to become a reality; and repair, by permitting the emergency mobilisation of the Structural Funds - if necessary outside the regional framework of the planned areas of intervention - and of the Solidarity Fund, the regulation of which must be amended so as to speed up and simplify its mobilisation."
"It is clear, then, that I endorse this resolution, but I regret that our House should be obliged once again to call for measures that could have been proposed following one of the too numerous natural disasters that have plunged Europe into mourning in recent years."
"Major natural disaster in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and effects of storm Xynthia in Europe (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Situation in Chile and EU humanitarian aid strategy (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU's humanitarian aid strategy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I make this statement on behalf of my colleague, Kristalina Georgieva, Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response."
"Why instead of her?"
"It is pretty clear and obvious."
"Commissioner Georgieva arrived in Chile yesterday, 10 March, to visit areas affected by the recent earthquake and to follow the work of European humanitarian and civil protection experts there on the ground."
"Immediately after arriving in Chile's capital Santiago, Commissioner Georgieva travelled to the area most affected by the earthquake and tsunami, including the coastal region around Constitución, Talca, and Concepción."
"During her field visit she met representatives of ECHO partners working in the area, visited the monitoring and information centre base camp in Penco and had bilateral contacts with Chilean authorities in the region."
"Commissioner Georgieva will also represent President Barroso during the inauguration of President Sebastián Piñera in Valparaíso later today."
"The massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Chile in the early hours of Saturday 27 February are a terrible tragedy."
"The latest official figures indicate that at least 528 people have been killed, and that number is expected to rise."
"More than two million people are affected."
"The damage to infrastructure has been enormous and half a million homes have been seriously damaged."
"The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, called Chile's Foreign Minister, Mariano Fernández, the same day to express our condolences to the families of the victims and indicate our readiness to provide assistance and support."
"As soon as news of the earthquake broke, ECHO's emergency response system was mobilised."
"The EU civil protection mechanism immediately issued a pre-alert message to the participating states."
"The crisis room of the monitoring and information centre (MIC) operated throughout that first weekend, obtaining reports about the scale and impact of the earthquake, identifying civil protection assets that could be available for rapid deployment."
"Commissioner Georgieva went to the crisis room during the day to direct operations."
"A number of European Union Member States have notified the MIC of assistance deployed or offered."
"This includes personnel and equipment already sent to Concepción from Spain, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, funding pledges from Finland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and offers of bridges, tents, field kitchens and generators from Bulgaria, Slovakia, Sweden and Austria."
"The Chilean authorities have signalled their acceptance of offers of help made by the European Union Member States."
"The Commission's emergency humanitarian response system was launched simultaneously in Brussels and in ECHO's Managua regional office covering Latin America."
"Potential partners for fast-track funding with the capacity to provide immediate relief assistance were contacted and ECHO field experts were mobilised to travel to the earthquake zone at the first available opportunity."
"A three million primary emergency decision was adopted early on Sunday morning."
"Humanitarian grant agreements have now been concluded with four partner agencies: Telecom Sans Frontières from France to provide emergency telecommunications services; the Pan-American Health Organisation and the Spanish Red Cross to help re-establish health services, and the German Red Cross to supply shelter, safe water and basic household essentials."
"ECHO deployed a team of two humanitarian aid experts who arrived in Chile on the morning of Monday, 1 March to carry out needs assessments and to meet with the authorities and potential implementing partners."
"Two more members of the team arrived the following day and they were joined by a fifth some days later."
"An EU civil protection mechanism, a team of six experts, is also now in Chile."
"Four are working in the earthquake zone near Concepción, while two are currently based in Santiago to liaise with authorities and coordinate the response of European Union Member States."
"The ECHO humanitarian experts and the EU civil protection team are undertaking joint assessments with OCHA and several UN agencies in the most affected areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said previously, the earthquake in Chile, which was more intense than the one suffered by the Haitians and which was also followed by a tsunami, was nonetheless much less deadly, thanks to an early warning system that worked, to populations that were better prepared for disasters and to a robust state that was able to react."
"I welcome the rapid reaction of the European Commission and the Member States."
"The European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre was activated immediately, an emergency humanitarian decision was adopted to allocate EUR 3 million to respond to the immediate needs, and experts from the DirectorateGeneral for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO) were deployed in the disaster areas to carry out a needs assessment."
"I would like in particular to applaud the immediate public reaction of Commissioner Georgieva, who arrived in Santiago yesterday to visit the areas concerned."
"Most natural disasters are unexpected events."
"In order to preserve lives in areas vulnerable to natural disasters, it is vitally important to reduce the risks by being better prepared and having buildings that are fit for purpose."
"It is also important to ensure that development cooperation incorporates disaster risk reduction, that is to say, preparation for disasters, the mitigation of their effects and, above all, their prevention."
"Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the delegation within the EU-Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee, I would like to express our solidarity with the Chilean people, Parliament and Government following the disastrous earthquake that occurred on 27 February and the more than two hundred aftershocks that have taken place so far."
"At least 500 people, including two Europeans, have been killed and 2 million Chileans have been affected by the earthquakes."
"The Mapuche people have been the worst affected, for their lands lie in three of the four southern regions of the country."
"I would also like to express our gratitude to all the people who have worked selflessly and to all the professionals who assisted the victims."
"The Chilean people have shown themselves to be capable of meeting the challenges of a very complex situation."
"I would like to congratulate President Bachelet for the immediate relief effort her Government launched in order to contain the situation caused by the terrible earthquake that has destroyed housing and infrastructure."
"The Chilean Government acted quickly and showed seriousness and responsibility in identifying the specific areas in which support was needed; there has also been a show of solidarity from the international community, which is a testament to Chile's excellent relations with its neighbours and strategic partners."
"I also wish to congratulate Sebastián Piñera's new Government which takes office today, and to encourage him in the reconstruction efforts for which I hope he will be able to count on the European Union's full support."
"Chile, as well as being a friend and partner of the European Union, is a developed country and member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; even so, the cost of the reconstruction effort will be considerable: it is estimated that this will be as high as USD 20 million, which represents 15% of the Chilean GDP."
"For this reason, I call on the European Union to make every tool available to the Chilean authorities in order to help with the task of reconstruction."
"Chile is going to need international loans, and the European Investment Bank, with which Chile has just signed an agreement, should help with the financing of the reconstruction projects."
"The European Union, under the Spanish Presidency, has established a mechanism for coordinating aid with the United Nations, and a post-disaster task force; the European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response is also expected to arrive on the ground in the next few days."
"We hope that the Commission, without overlooking other equally urgent commitments such as the situation in Haiti, will also rise to meet the Chilean people's expectations."
"Mr President, we should use more than just words to show our solidarity with a country that has suffered a disaster, as Chile has, and we have heard this today from the Commission representative."
"Chile has been a source of protection and asylum for us in the past."
"For example, a large community of Basque people lives there, having emigrated to the area for economic reasons in the 19th century and for political reasons in the 20th century."
"That is why, in this case, words should be backed up by actions, and I am satisfied by the swift action taken by the European Union, which immediately sent EUR 3 million in aid in order to fund operations;"
"I am also pleased by the reaction of the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, and I congratulate Commissioner Georgieva who acted swiftly and, as of yesterday, is in Chile providing encouragement and establishing what is needed on the ground there."
"I am satisfied by the way in which the new European Commission Humanitarian Aid civil protection system is operating, by the help provided by the European institutions, and by the collaboration that has been established through the different agencies."
"At times like these Europe has had, and continues to have, an opportunity to consolidate its leading role on the international stage, working directly with those affected and helping to coordinate the aid that is being organised from the Member States and from the regions."
"I would like to highlight President Bachelet's actions, for she has demonstrated once again how politics should be conducted, displaying great humanity and working closely with Mr Piñera, who takes over as President today;"
"I also wish to congratulate him for the exemplary way in which he has put politics to one side in order to rise to the challenge as his country needs."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to express my solidarity, my support for all the operations being carried out, and my condolences to the families of the 528 people killed and all those missing, and to the people who have been left homeless."
"We recently visited the area on a pre-election observation mission for the delegation within the EU-Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"We had an opportunity to observe the projects developing there and we saw that Chile is a model for economic and social development in the Southern Cone region."
"We need to ensure that this earthquake does not interrupt that progress towards economic and social development."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by echoing what has been said by Mrs Muñiz and Mrs Bilbao, because I believe the first thing we need to do is show the European Union's solidarity with the Chilean people and Chilean institutions, which are very well represented by President Bachelet and President-elect Piñera."
"Secondly, I think it is also important to remember that, as is usually the case in these situations, natural disasters are indiscriminate and entirely oblivious to people's wealth or poverty: they punish everyone equally."
"However, it is also clear that the poor suffer the most, and it is particularly difficult to rebuild poor areas."
"I therefore think it is important to consider not only the recovery and reconstruction measures needed after a disaster has occurred, but also, in many cases, to re-examine certain structural elements, and my question relates to that point."
"If I may, Commissioner, I would like to ask about a very specific matter relating to the Country Strategy Paper that the European Union has with Chile."
"Of the EUR 41 million earmarked for the 2007-2013 period, how much is going to be used specifically to strengthen infrastructure such as roads and transport?"
"How much is going to be used to improve housing construction in order to ensure that, in the event of potential, unwelcome disasters in the future, people are better prepared for this kind of situation?"
"Finally, what proportion of these resources has already been set aside for these purposes?"
"The earthquake in Chile has claimed several hundred victims, and over one and a half million people have lost their homes."
"Let us, however, show solidarity with Chile, today, and remember that the people there are still suffering from a lack of hygiene supplies and a lack of access to drinking water, as well as a lack of food, medicines and blankets."
"In addition, the people are being harassed by criminal groups, who are plundering abandoned shops and houses."
"We, as the European Union, must do all we can to prevent people who have lost all their belongings, and in many cases members of their family, from falling victim to thieves who prey on their suffering."
"It is good that we have decided to send EUR 3 million for the most immediate needs."
"We should, however, remember that there are still places in Chile which have not been reached by aid, because of the damage sustained to roads and bridges."
"The recent events in Chile and Haiti demonstrate that, as well as financial aid from the European Union, the mechanisms of giving aid to countries hit by disasters still need improvement."
"Solidarity with Chile is a very beautiful thing, and it is good that the European Union is showing that solidarity."
"Let us remember, however, not to stop at just solidarity, but to support Chile in the future, too."
"Mr President, I wish you a speedy recovery."
"First of all I would like to express my solidarity with all those who have been affected by this natural disaster."
"Unfortunately, tragedies continue to happen because of large earthquakes."
"In situations like these, with widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure, and with thousands killed, it is important to constantly improve coordination of civil protection and emergency authorities to avoid overlapping of efforts and wasted resources."
"The European Union intervened promptly in Chile but it needs to collaborate with local authorities to identify needs and to coordinate aid effectively."
"This morning's press carried the news that half of the aid provided by the United Nations to Somalia has been stolen by local partners, by some UN officials and by Islamic militants."
"One aspect to consider, then, is transparency in the collection of public and private donations and the effectiveness of distribution of aid provided to populations."
"Generosity must not be betrayed and a strict system of controls needs to be put in place to prevent money being squandered or stolen, particularly when aid is sent to very distant countries whose institutions may be weakened by crises."
"Mr President, our people will be heartened to hear that there has been positive action in helping the people of Chile."
"We have all been moved by their plight."
"However, today I want to address my remarks to more general issues around the humanitarian aid strategy."
"The European Commission is very proud to declare itself to be one of the world's largest donors of humanitarian aid."
"Its mandate, it declares, is to save and preserve life, to find sanctuary for the displaced and to help the world ensure preparedness for natural disasters."
"These are truly worthy aspirations."
"However, it is not the Commission's money that is being donated."
"It is British, German, French - it is in fact money from 27 nation states."
"In a time of economic crisis every single one of these nations should be recognised for their worthy efforts."
"Perhaps in their documents the Commission should reflect this and acknowledge the efforts of those who actually do make the sacrifices."
"It is not the political elite and apparatchiks of the Berlemont, but ordinary people from ordinary communities."
"Whilst it is true that developing countries need aid, it is also true that they need our support in establishing and maintaining credible democratic structures."
"They need our help in building a strong and unfettered civic society."
"They also need our help - and, most importantly, our honesty - in pointing out the wrongdoing from political regimes that ensures that ordinary people continue to live in poverty and in need."
"(EL) Mr President, the recent huge, catastrophic earthquake in Chile, shortly after the disaster in Haiti, cost the lives of hundreds of people and caused massive damage to the structures of the country, especially in the area of Concepción."
"We need to stand by the victims and their families and make a frank declaration of solidarity."
"We need to stand by a country with which we have close and friendly ties and which is one of the strongest economies in the region and a development benchmark for neighbouring countries."
"This has been established within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"I would remind you that the European Union and Chile signed an association agreement which entered into force in 2005 and which provides for political and economic cooperation and joint action on a global scale."
"In addition, as already stated, the European Commission has adopted a six-year strategic development plan for Chile for 2007-2013, which makes provision for the take-up of Community resources by this Latin American country for regional and sectoral programmes being undertaken by the country's recently-elected government."
"The immediate announcement of financial support and all the other things the Commission has mentioned today are encouraging."
"However, I want to emphasise that we need to facilitate the release of the resources earmarked under the aforementioned EU-Chile strategic framework as quickly as possible, so that the consequences of this recent earthquake on the country's infrastructure and for the further development of the country can be addressed promptly."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the Chilean people, and that solidarity has also been expressed to the people of Haiti, Turkey and Peru, who have also suffered recent natural disasters."
"Solidarity is one of the European Union's distinctive hallmarks, and we have to strengthen that solidarity with regard to the future."
"Fortunately, Chile is a country with a far-reaching capacity to respond in such times of natural disaster; however, large areas of the world do not have that same capacity."
"I would therefore like to mention the European strategy for humanitarian aid."
"Our response could be even more efficient; it could be faster and more effective, as long as we are moving in the right direction."
"Which is the right direction?"
"Firstly, in my view we need greater coordination between Member States, their respective humanitarian agencies and the institutions of the European Union."
"Secondly, we need better coordination between the European Union and international humanitarian aid organisations, especially the United Nations."
"Thirdly, we need greater coordination between military and humanitarian actors."
"We have to maintain the safety of the civilian population and humanitarian groups while upholding the independence, neutrality and impartiality of humanitarian aid and respect for international law."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, in order for humanitarian aid and crisis response to be a fundamental component of our external action, we need more human and financial resources."
"We can take advantage of the Barnier report in order to establish a European volunteer corps and I would add, given that Commissioner Piebalgs is here, in order to strengthen and better coordinate the link between humanitarian aid and reconstruction and development policies."
"Mr President, I agree with everything that Mr Guerrero Salom has said in relation to our response."
"I have to say that I was initially shocked when I heard that what the European Union - Baroness Ashton - was going to donate was something in the region of EUR 3 million."
"EUR 3 million is nothing in terms of the consequences and the fallout and the devastation caused."
"Last time we were here - four weeks ago - we were discussing Haiti."
"This morning we are discussing the Xynthia storm in Europe, and we are also discussing the fallout from the Chilean earthquake disaster, which happened just over two weeks ago."
"Then you had the aftershock of 6.6, which in itself was absolutely devastating."
"The fallout is there."
"The consequences are there."
"The statistics are there."
"We are talking about 500 000 - half a million - houses destroyed."
"These have to be rebuilt, and that is where we come in with practical help."
"There are approximately 540 people dead, and the dead are still being exhumed from the ruins."
"That is a natural disaster in itself."
"But we are talking about an overall bill of EUR 22 billion."
"We really need to up our particular contribution in that regard."
"One of the selling points in relation to the Lisbon Treaty - and we know that in Ireland we rejected Lisbon I - was that we were going to have an immediate humanitarian response to natural disasters."
"I have to say that whether it be Haiti, southern Europe or from the point of view of the situation in Chile, we have not responded."
"I know it is early days, but we really need to get our act together."
"What we need above all else is practical help: (a) money, (b) clean water, (c) restore the electricity supply and (d) get the economy up and running as quickly as possible."
"(ES) Mr President, yesterday I spoke to Senator Pizarro, who became President of the Senate of Chile a few hours ago."
"Today Mr Pizarro will present President Piñera with the presidential band."
"I hope that President Piñera will undertake the reconstruction task efficiently and I would like to congratulate President Bachelet on her management of this crisis."
"Mr President, may I express my solidarity and brotherly affection to the people of Chile after the terrible earthquakes and tsunami they experienced in Concepción, Biobío, Temuco and Valparaíso."
"I am certain that the heroic people of Chile will be able to overcome this catastrophic situation, as they have done before."
"May I reiterate once again my affection and deepest solidarity with Chile."
"(DE) Mr President, given the devastating consequences of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile, you have to concede to the mayor of Concepción that 24 hours is an eternity for anyone lying buried under rubble."
"Even though the authorities and the rescue services in this Latin American country are undoubtedly well set up for possible earthquakes, the help for the more than 2 million people affected did not get to all parts of the affected area early enough because of logistical problems."
"Troops who were already late in getting there were swamped by the chaos."
"The population was forced to flee to its rooftops and set up roadblocks not only out of fear of aftershocks but also out of fear of criminals."
"Chile may be prosperous enough to care for those affected by the earthquake by itself, but, thank goodness, it swallowed its pride and asked for help, including from the EU."
"There will be lessons that we, too, must learn from this, however, namely that in emergencies the veneer of civilisation soon peels and that 24 hours can be too long."
"In this spirit, emergency plans and the coordination of assistance efforts for emergencies should be made more effective, including within the EU."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we were all shocked by the scale of the natural and human catastrophe."
"Through the rapid mobilisation of ECHO's emergency response system and the EU civil protection mechanism, we were able to offer coordinated and practical help soon after the earthquake struck."
"As I have already mentioned, the assistance deployed or offered by a number of EU Member States was also important."
"In addition to the humanitarian and other actions I have described, it is worth mentioning that on Tuesday in Luxembourg the European Investment Bank and Chile - this was mentioned by an honourable Member - signed a framework agreement to enable the bank to operate in Chile."
"This development highlights the excellent state of relations between the European Union and Chile and our shared commitment to continuing to expand and deepen our partnership."
"It is also extremely well-timed because the EIB can be an additional tool for the European Union to work with Chile in the medium- to long-term reconstruction efforts that are already getting under way."
"Regarding the concrete question of the country strategy for Chile and the committed EUR 41 million. EUR 25 million was spent in the first tranche;"
"EUR 15.6 million remains for the second."
"Normally this should be divided 50% for social cohesion, 50% for innovation and competition."
"We have offered to switch this to reconstruction under review."
"No requests yet from the Chilean authorities, but of course it could be directed under both headlines to reconstruction."
"The Chilean authorities have not yet made any specific requests for the European Union to help with reconstruction."
"As I mentioned, President Piñera takes office today."
"He will surely give top priority to assessing and quantifying the damage and planning the massive effort that will be needed."
"The Commission stands ready to consider any request that may be forthcoming."
"As I mentioned earlier, the fact that the European Investment Bank will now be able to operate in Chile adds an additional instrument to choose from among those which are already at our disposal."
"It is also worth recalling what was mentioned too by some of you, that Chile is a good example of development."
"It is actually a net creditor, unlike most Latin American countries."
"The outgoing Finance Minister last Friday highlighted the fact that, unlike during other tragedies that have befallen the Chilean people, this time they and the Chilean state have their own resources as well."
"So, to conclude, the European Union - the people, regions and countries of the Union - is standing shoulder to shoulder with Chile in the face of this disaster, and that is how it should be in a civilised and human world."
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (PT) After Haiti's earthquake, we are confronted again with a terrible catastrophe, with 800 confirmed victims and damage totalling to approximately 15% of Chile's GDP."
"According to the Chilean President, Mrs Bachelet, 80% of the population was affected and the country's infrastructure has been seriously damaged."
"Once more, the EU has assumed its responsibilities as a privileged trading partner of that country, of which it is the primary trading partner and the primary market for Chilean exports."
"The response from the EU was to provide EUR 3 million in emergency aid, while European civil protection experts are on the ground assessing the most immediate needs."
"The natural catastrophes which have been blighting the world, such as the earthquakes and deadly storms that we have recently witnessed in the EU, make us rethink the paradigm of humanitarian aid and of emergencies, which require a swift, agile and concerted answer."
"The EU has demonstrated effectiveness and the ability to react."
"Parliament, as well as giving its heartfelt condolences to Chile, is also demonstrating through this debate its commitment to helping to rebuild the country, which was so severely damaged by the earthquake of 27 February."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding to the vote, I would like to make a brief announcement, because today we commemorate the sixth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism."
"Today we pay tribute to the more than 5 000 victims in Europe and we express our solidarity with the countless people wounded, who have suffered the barbarity of terrorism."
"The bomb attacks carried out in Madrid six years ago, on 11 March 2004, which killed 191 people from 17 countries, and the bombs detonated in London on 7 July 2005 can be counted among the worst acts of terrorism ever perpetrated on European soil."
"Terrorism is an attack against us all: it attacks the very fabric of our democratic society."
"That is why Europe will always be united in the fight against terrorism, be it separatist, religious or political."
"Terrorism can never be justified, in any way and for any reason."
"This European day gives us the opportunity to show that no terrorist or act of terrorism will ever be able to break or destroy our faith in key values, those of fundamental human rights and democracy."

"(FR) Mr President, I would ask you to wait a little while longer because many Members are still stuck in the lifts."
"Someone had the extraordinary idea of repairing the lifts during the one week of the month in which we are in Strasbourg, when it could be done in the other three."
"Mr Goebbels, it is already after 12.00."
"We have already been waiting for five minutes."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"- (SK) According to government archives and available literature, the Communist regime in Slovakia sentenced 71 168 people in the years 1948 - 1989 for alleged political crimes."
"There is no better way to honour the memory of those political prisoners and prisoners of conscience than to work actively to promote the expansion of freedom and democracy where it is deemed an unattainable luxury."
"The European Union's appeals have so far been met with no response."
"However, I am deeply concerned about the situation of political prisoners in Cuba and I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to take effective measures necessary for the release of political prisoners and to support and ensure their work as protectors of human rights."
"To the citizens of Cuba..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, I endorsed adoption of the motion for a resolution on Cuba."
"Frankly speaking, I do not understand why Fidel Castro's European friends are so doggedly defending the idea of a bankrupt and demoralised revolution."
"Does it have to be the case that only the fatal victims of what considers itself to be a progressive regime will make people aware of the need for change in Cuba?"
"Sometimes individual sacrifices contribute to historic changes."
"I hope this will also be the case this time."
"At the same time, I would not like there to be more victims caused by the dogmatism of the authorities or their inability to analyse their own position and change."
"Neither can I accept the fact that many of the ACP countries take an entirely uncritical view of the character and significance of the social and political system which has been built in Cuba."
"I am profoundly convinced that this is an erroneous understanding of solidarity."
"It would be more honest to acknowledge what has been achieved in Cuba, but at the same time to condemn that which has not been a success and is anti-social, inhuman and destructive."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to speak on behalf of Mrs Muñiz to explain why the Spanish delegation within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has voted against Amendment 2 tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, even though the amendment requested that the Spanish Presidency be supported in its dealings with Cuba."
"Firstly, may I bring to mind the fact that we cannot support amendments tabled by a group that has sought to distance itself from the resolution as a whole, and that our commitment to all the political groups who have signed the resolution would not allow us to support a partial amendment of the document."
"Secondly, Amendment 2 tabled by the GUE/NGL Group is not in line with the position taken by the Spanish Presidency, which is looking to establish a consensus in the European Union in order to renew our framework for relations with Cuba, but not for a complete break with the Common Position, which is what the amendment was calling for."
"That is our reason for rejecting the amendment."
"- (CS) It was an honour for me today to support the resolution on prisoners of conscience in Cuba, not only as a Member from a former totalitarian communist state, but also because I have personally met Cuban dissidents in the past, in particular the physician Dr Darsí Ferrer, who has been imprisoned with others since July last year."
"Following my return I informed Parliament about the sad situation in the health sector and I would like to emphasise again that people who are not Communist Party members and who do not have dollars, have no access to medicines."
"Dr Darsí Ferrer was a significant personality in Havana, who was helping dissidents to obtain medicines."
"Now he is behind bars."
"I am delighted that we have adopted this resolution, which is a very strong resolution, and which also clearly challenges European authorities to continue their efforts for democratic change in Cuba."
"- Mr President, who would have thought 20 years ago, when the air of Europe was thick with the brick dust of falling walls and with cries of freedom, that the red flag would still today be flying over Havana and that Fidel Castro would be dying peacefully in bed on that sultry Caribbean island."
"Sola mors tyrannicida est, says my countryman, Sir Thomas More: death is the only way to get rid of tyrants."
"Two things have kept the Communist regime in place in Cuba."
"First, the wrong-headed American blockade, which has allowed Castro and his regime to blame all the privations of their countrymen on foreign imperialism rather than on the economic mismanagement of Communism; and secondly the indulgence of some in Europe, including some in this House, who have a disgusting double standard whereby they excuse human rights abuses and the denial of democracy in Cuba on the grounds that it is good at producing doctors and ballerinas."
"I hope that this House will grow up and that some in this House will see beyond their days as students wearing Che Guevara T-shirts."
"The time has come for constructive engagement with the democratic forces in Cuba."
"History will absolve us."
"- (NL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Cuba resolution because it is, on the whole, fairly critical of the totalitarian regime in Havana."
"At the same time, I would like to use this opportunity to call on the Council to bring to an end its attempts at normalising its relations with Cuba while we are still dealing with a communist dictatorship which violates human rights in a flagrant manner."
"I would also urge the new High Representative not to follow the line taken by the Commission in previous legislation."
"Here I refer, for example, to Mr Louis Michel, who has visited Cuba on repeated occasions without levelling any criticism whatsoever at the state of human rights and democracy there."
"It is totally unacceptable for the European Union to curry favour with the communist regime in Cuba."
"(PL) Mr President, in endorsing the motion for a resolution, I wanted to express support for investment in the development of low-emission technologies."
"The SET Plan can be effective and credible only if it is properly financed, and this includes finance from private sources."
"Arguments in favour of the necessity of such measures are, principally, the current economic situation in which Europe finds itself, dangerous climate changes and threats to energy security."
"Thanks to the latest research and technologies, an opportunity to overcome the crisis has arisen, which at the same time supports measures related to climate change."
"It is also an opportunity for European agriculture, a way to create new jobs in rural areas in the non-agricultural sector, especially in the area of creating sources of renewable energy."
"(CS) I too have voted for the motion for a resolution on investment in the development of low-carbon technologies (the SET-Plan), because in my opinion it is a key instrument for transforming the Union into an innovatory economy, capable of fulfilling demanding objectives."
"In this regard I consider it essential that the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Investment Bank, submits an overall proposal on an instrument for investing in energy from renewable sources, energy-efficiency projects and the development of intelligent networks no later than 2011."
"Hand in hand with this there should be a strengthening of the role of the European Investment Bank in financing projects in the area of energy, and especially projects with higher levels of risk."
"I categorically reject the exploitation of the topic of low-carbon technologies for below-the-belt attacks on nuclear energy in the presentations of Members from the left side of the political spectrum."
"I maintain that nuclear energy is a clean energy which contributes to sustainable development."
"(PL) I could not support the resolution, although it is extremely important for the European economy."
"It should be noted that the resolution provides for a huge concentration of money only in certain areas, only in certain branches of the energy industry - the 'green' areas."
"This clashes with the notion of energy solidarity with countries which rely mainly on coal."
"Poland's energy needs are based on coal, so a smooth transition to a green economy is extremely important for us."
"As a result of such measures in Poland, instead of creating jobs we would have to close them."
"During a crisis this is extremely difficult, and would be harmful to Poland."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 and 28 February storm Xynthia assailed France."
"Almost 60 people died, and hundreds of thousands of people sustained considerable damage."
"The European Union must set an example in the face of this tragedy."
"That is why I personally had a hand in drafting this resolution calling on the European Commission to be extremely responsive."
"We expect it to provide financial aid to the disaster areas by means of the EU Solidarity Fund."
"If, as a result of this tragedy, the regions of Poitou-Charentes, Charente-Maritime, Pays de la Loire and Brittany request a change to their allocation of expenditure cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, the European Commission will have to examine these requests extremely favourably and very quickly."
"Leaving this resolution aside, I, like my colleagues from the Union for a Presidential Majority, am convinced that it is time to create a true European civil protection force."
"It alone will be able to provide vital additional aid in the context of a disaster such as this."
"Mr Kelly, although you have not registered to speak before the first explanation of vote, you may do so by way of exception."
"Next time please remember to register."
"- Mr President, I just want to say that I think it is time that we had a conclusive paper on nuclear energy to outline the progress and the safety measures that have been brought to bear on it and how that will transpose itself in future into research that will be undertaken so that citizens can make up their minds."
"There is a lot of scepticism about it - a lot of doubt - and that needs to be clarified, which will take a lot of the difficulties out of this debate on low-carbon technology."
"Finally if I may say, on this, the anniversary of the declaration of independence of Lithuania and Estonia, I congratulate those countries on 20 years of independence."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - While we recognise that Cuba is a Communist tyranny and while we want to see Cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state, we do not recognise the EU in this process."
"The resolution by the European Parliament, the pretext for which is the death of the Cuban prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who died following a hunger strike, despite the efforts of the Cuban health services to restore his health, is a provocative and unacceptable attack on the socialist government and people of Cuba and forms part of the anti-communist strategy being directed by the EU and led by the European Parliament in a bid to overturn the socialist regime."
"We condemn the hypocrisy and provocative effort on the part of the centre right, centre left and Green representatives of capital in the European Parliament to exploit this event."
"The Greek Communist Party condemns and voted against the European Parliament resolution."
"It calls on the peoples to express their solidarity with the government and people of Cuba."
"To call for the common position against Cuba to be revoked."
"To condemn efforts by the EU to use human rights as a pretext for exerting imperialist pressure and coercion on the people of Cuba and its government."
"To demand that the criminal US embargo against Cuba be lifted immediately."
"To demand the immediate release of the 5 Cubans being held in US prisons."
"To defend socialist Cuba."
"The European Union is the most democratic structure in the world and the fundamental value on which it has been built has been respect for human rights."
"This is why I find it laudable and encouraging that all the groups in Parliament have been united in their condemnation of the abuses committed by the Cuban authorities against human rights, not to mention the constructive approach, receptive to dialogue, which the EU has decided to adopt towards Cuba."
"We are living in the 21st century and crimes of opinion and conscience should be erased from the values of every state in the world, no matter how long its history of totalitarianism and dictatorship might be."
"Conducting international dialogue rather than imposing sanctions can be used to change attitudes so that anyone who disagrees with their own authorities will not suffer abuses and injustices typical of regimes which lack respect for human beings."
"Tragedies such as the one which has befallen Cuban dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo, 'guilty' of a crime of conscience, must never be repeated."
"There are now other political prisoners too in Cuba who are in danger."
"As a guarantor of respect for human rights, the EU must get involved and take prompt action diplomatically so that the Zapata tragedy will never be repeated in Cuba, or anywhere else in the world for that matter."
"in writing. - I condemn unreservedly the ill-treatment of people in Cuba (or anywhere else)."
"However, I abstained in the resolution, as a whole, against Cuba."
"One reason was that the resolution purported to give authority to the European Union and its functionaries to speak and act on behalf of Member States."
"The other reason was that many Member States of the European Union prosecute and imprison people for exercising non-violent freedom of expression, the holding of heretical opinions or taking part in dissenting activity."
"It is utterly hypocritical for parties that favour political repression in Europe to point the finger at states such as Cuba that share their repressive and anti-democratic opinions and activities."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba."
"We reiterate the need for the immediate release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience."
"We believe that the detention of Cuban dissidents due to their ideals and to their peaceful political activity constitutes a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats share the opinion presented in the amendment that the blockade against Cuba should be lifted."
"However, we do not believe that the statement belongs in this motion for a resolution, as it concerns prisoners of conscience."
"in writing. - (PT) Orlando Zapata Tamayo died of starvation because he demanded to be treated as what he was: a political prisoner persecuted by a regime that, despite the changes in leadership, continues to rule over its citizens with an iron fist and prohibits them from associating or freely expressing themselves."
"The tragic circumstances of this death should put us all to shame."
"Especially the political decision makers who, following the lead of Mr Zapatero and Ambassador Moratinos, have changed European policy towards Cuba."
"All the European Union has achieved with its tentative attempt at appeasement has been to increase the feeling of impunity, whilst making the democrats - who deserved much more from us - feel more isolated."
"I hope for a return to the firm democratic policy that has only recently softened."
"I want the European Union to finally acknowledge that this change of policy has been a complete failure."
"I also want Oswaldo Payá and the Ladies in White to be able to travel to Europe freely to reveal the circumstances surrounding the events that have been taking place in Cuba."
"We voted against this resolution due to the political exploitation by the majority in Parliament of the death of Zapata Tamayo, following a hunger strike in a Cuban prison, despite having received medical treatment."
"They want to thwart the intentions publicly expressed by the Spanish Presidency to end the common position on Cuba."
"Once again they are attacking Cuba and its people, by seeking to meddle in its independence and sovereignty, its economic and social successes and its exemplary internationalist solidarity."
"Capitalism is not the future of humanity."
"Cuba continues to be an example that it is possible to construct a society without exploiters or exploited, a socialist society."
"The representatives of capitalism in the European Parliament do not accept that fact."
"They try to prevent a comprehensive political dialogue with the Cuban Government on the basis of the same criteria that the EU applies to all countries with which it has relations."
"They do not condemn the US embargo on Cuba, the immediate lifting of which has been sought on 18 occasions by the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"They say nothing about the situation of five Cuban citizens jailed in the United States since 1998, without a fair trial, and they ignore that the US continues to shelter a Cuban citizen who was the instigator of the bomb attack against an airliner in which 76 people perished."
"in writing. - (PL) In the vote, today, I endorsed the resolution on the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba."
"As the European Parliament, we must unequivocally condemn the practices of the regime in Havana and speak up for the rights of independent journalists, peaceful dissidents and human rights defenders."
"In the resolution which has been adopted we have expressed profound solidarity with all Cubans and have endorsed their efforts at achieving democracy as well as respect for and protection of fundamental rights."
"I come from a country in which a popular movement arose in opposition to the Communist regime - the Solidarity movement."
"Although Poland and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, which today belong to the European Union, have now put their painful experiences of Communist regimes behind them, all the more we cannot forget those who are imprisoned and persecuted because they so much want democracy, liberty and freedom of speech."
"The EU cannot have a romantic vision of the political regime in Cuba, which is a genuine communist dictatorship, based on the logic of a single party that violates human rights, oppresses its citizens, persecutes and eliminates political adversaries and imprisons countless people simply for the offence of having an opinion."
"The death of Orlando Zapata was just one more case to shock the world that the European Parliament must condemn firmly, without hesitation and false justifications."
"That is why I reject the attempts of some members of the far left to dress up this appalling crime in political terms, which are only intended to legitimise a regime that is neither tolerable nor acceptable."
"I voted against Resolution on Cuba because I believe it constitutes an act of interference that violates international law."
"With my vote I have expressed my condemnation of this exercise in political manipulation whose only aim is to express disapproval of the Government of Cuba."
"The Members who voted in favour of this text are those who time and again refused to table a resolution in this Parliament condemning the coup that took place in Honduras."
"This resolution urges the European Union to show unreserved support for the change of political regime in the Republic of Cuba and also proposes the use of European cooperation mechanisms in order to achieve that aim, which constitutes an unacceptable act of interference that contravenes international law."
"For more than 50 years, the United States of America has maintained an economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba, in flagrant violation of international law and with severe repercussions for the economy and living conditions of Cubans."
"In spite of that, the Cuban Government has continued to guarantee its citizens universal access to healthcare and education."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Cuba, as it is important for the EU, too, to clearly express the idea that there is an urgent need for democratisation in the country, which is still under Communist rule."
"The incarceration of dissidents and political opponents is a typical feature of Communist States, but it is excessively practised in Cuba."
"The fact that the authorities are not even permitting the family of a prisoner who has died as a result of a hunger strike to organise a burial is a particular scandal."
"It is to be hoped that a change of political system on the island will be achieved as soon as possible."
"Irrespective of that, however, it is important for the EU and also the United States to apply the same standards everywhere."
"It is unacceptable for the US to grant Cubans who are embroiled in bomb attacks 'political asylum'."
"You can only express effective criticism if you yourself meet the criteria set."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Cuba because, as I said in the debate yesterday, regardless of our respective positions with regard to Cuba, the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo is a regrettable occurrence in itself."
"I also insist that we need to demand the freedom of all the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, in Cuba and the rest of the world, but I nevertheless advise against taking action that has already proved to be a failure for Cuba's progression towards democracy and liberalisation, such as the embargo and the blockade."
"It is clear that changes are urgently needed on the island, and the European Union should monitor these so that the transition to democracy will benefit the Cuban people."
"in writing. - (SV) The USA has had a trade embargo against Cuba for 48 years."
"The embargo affects the Cuban population and is a constant and recurring excuse for the shortcomings of the Castro regime."
"Everything is said to be the fault of the American embargo and, as a result, the people of Cuba cannot lay the blame clearly at the door of the Communist regime and distance themselves from it."
"The democratic opposition in Cuba wants the embargo to be lifted."
"On 29 October 2009, 187 of the UN member states voted to lift the embargo."
"Three voted for it to remain in place and two abstained."
"None of the EU Member States voted in favour of keeping the embargo."
"In the past the European Parliament has condemned the embargo against Cuba and called for it to be ended immediately, in line with the demands made by the UN General Assembly on numerous occasions."
"(P5_TA(2003)0374) The European Parliament has also stated that the embargo defeats its own object."
"(P6_TA(2004)0061) The current resolution refers to the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba."
"During the debate before the vote, I tabled a proposal that Cuba should be presented with an ultimatum."
"The embargo will be lifted and within six months all prisoners of conscience must be released and reforms must be introduced."
"If the regime does not comply with these terms, the USA, the EU and Canada will bring in new and more intelligent sanctions which are aimed at the Cuban leadership, such as a ban on travelling to the country and a freeze on Cuban assets and on foreign investment."
"The EU has undertaken to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, to reduce energy consumption by 20% and to generate at least 20% of the energy consumed from renewable sources by 2020."
"Furthermore, the EU is aiming to set an example globally in saving resources and protecting the environment."
"These ambitious targets can only be achieved if the EU as a whole and each of the Member States individually make clear commitments to deadlines."
"Investments in low carbon energy technologies are key to meeting the targets proposed for 2020, which is not as far away as it seems."
"Attaining these targets requires a considerable financial effort: EUR 58 billion, according to some meticulous calculations, from both public and private sources."
"However, this financial, logistical and administrative effort will turn the EU into a global leader in innovation and will have a positive impact on its economy by creating jobs and opening up new prospects in the field of research, which has been unjustly underfunded for decades."
"The investments in developing low carbon energy sources will yield results in the medium and long term, making a positive impact across the whole European Union."
"It is vital to insist on a radical change in society based on the sustainability of cities, decentralised energy production and industrial competitiveness."
"This is an essential policy for a prosperous and sustainable society that is prepared for the challenges of climate change, secure energy supply and globalisation, with global leadership in the area of clean technologies."
"The SET Plan intends to contribute specifically to the development of clean technologies."
"I welcome the fundamental guidelines that the communication presents on how to organise the logic of intervention between the public and private sectors and between Community, national and regional financing."
"However, it is essential to increase public funding of scientific research in the area of clean technologies."
"Europe still has to create conditions for there to be more private investment in scientific research, in technological development and demonstration in the energy field."
"It is vital to move beyond words to action."
"The next EU financial perspective and the 8th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development should prioritise energy security, the fight against climate change and the environment."
"Only in this way will it be possible to maintain the competitiveness of our industry, promote economic growth and job creation."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on investment in the development of low carbon technologies (SET Plan), because, in order to effectively tackle the economic crisis, investing in those new technologies that have the greatest potential for job creation should be a priority."
"I believe that these investments could create new opportunities for the development of the EU's economy and competitiveness."
"The SET Plan presented by the Commission proposes investment in R&D to develop efficient and sustainable clean energy technologies with low carbon emissions, making it possible to ensure the necessary reduction of emissions without jeopardising European industries, thus making a commitment, which we believe to be serious, to sustainable development."
"New energy policies, particularly within the context of the general crisis, must not lose sight of economic efficiency and must not, in any way, jeopardise the economic sustainability of European nations, without this meaning poorer environmental performance."
"For this reason I urge a new approach on energy policy, one that is based on clean energy, more efficient use of the natural resources at our disposal and heavy investment in research and more environmentally-friendly technologies so that we can maintain European competitiveness and allow job creation within a framework of an innovative and sustainable economy."
"I welcome the objectives of the SET Plan (Strategic Energy Technology Plan), which insist on the development of a low-carbon society."
"The SET Plan seeks to accelerate the development and roll-out of low-carbon technologies."
"This plan includes measures relating to planning, implementation, resources and international cooperation in the area of innovative technologies in the energy sector."
"Several studies estimate that promoting the European target of 20% renewable energy penetration will result in millions of new jobs by 2020."
"Furthermore, roughly two thirds of these jobs will be created in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The solution requires the development of green technologies."
"Therefore, we need more funding for the SET Plan, which I advocate should be provided in the next review of the financial perspective."
"We also need to promote green technologies and skilled labour through investment in education and research."
"The sooner we begin to achieve a low-carbon society, the sooner we will emerge from the crisis."
"The development and implementation of low-carbon technologies is extremely important not only for environmental reasons - which include the need to reduce atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide - but also for energy reasons, considering the inevitable gradual shortage and eventual depletion of fossil fuel reserves, on which humanity is highly dependent."
"Unfortunately, both the SET Plan and the resolution just adopted, do not just offer an incomplete approach to the problem - both in terms of the technologies and energy sources to be considered, and of the necessity to reduce consumption - but, above all, they still consider this investment as another good business opportunity (in which some, a select few, will earn a great deal, to the detriment of many) rather than an environmental and energetic imperative to safeguard the common good of humanity."
"It is significant and revealing that in the vote on the amendments to the resolution, instead of promoting 'ambitious reduction targets' of atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions, the choice was made 'to promote world-wide carbon emission trading'."
"The use of low-carbon technologies which naturally produce less carbon dioxide is positive and desirable."
"However, we cannot accept that, at the expense of technological development and strengthening of the so-called SET Plan, yet another excuse is being sought to weaken national energy policies."
"Reading the words of the Commission that 'the SET Plan is the technology pillar of the EU's energy and climate policy', leaves no doubt as to the real intentions of the European Commission to weaken the sovereignty of Member States in such an important area as national energy strategies."
"The motion for a resolution contains aspects, in more detail, with which we cannot agree, particularly the promotion of 'world-wide carbon emission trading', given that this solution has already shown not to offer advantages in reducing carbon emissions, as well as the creation of more public-private partnerships, emphasising a 'substantive increase in the portion of public investment', thus using public money to serve private interests and profit."
"Our group therefore voted against."
"in writing. - Mr President, Sustainable and effective low-carbon technologies are the core essentials in the huge task of decarbonisation we in the EU, and globally, are facing."
"It is due to this fact that I welcomed the rapid process in which Parliament drafted a resolution on the topic, giving a clear indication to the commission and the council that the SET Plan is timely and important."
"If we are serious with our mission, it is evident that we need all forms of low-carbon technologies, including sustainable nuclear power."
"Therefore I am happy that we managed to delete the wording on recital i, which is yet another attempt to put nuclear in a light it nowadays does not deserve."
"This recital may have had negative implications on the concept of 'sustainable low-carbon technologies' suggesting that nuclear is not part of that."
"The fact however is that we in the EU cannot afford not to use it if we want to take climate change seriously."
"Until renewable energies really can deliver effective results and secure constant energy flow, it is such low-carbon technologies which we must rely on."
"Investment in low-carbon technologies must be a priority, since it is one of the most effective ways to tackle climate change, preparing the EU for a green economy."
"Intelligent low-carbon solutions should therefore receive special attention, not least with regard to their Community funding, to achieve the environmental targets set by the EU for 2020."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution on 'Investing in Low-Carbon Technologies' as, although it contained a number of reasonable approaches, it supports the further development of nuclear energy, which is something that I reject due to the major risks associated with it."
"The motion for a resolution rightly points out that research has had too little funding hitherto."
"However, so that Europe remains competitive in respect of other global players, the funding of research projects must be massively expanded, especially in the field of the new energy sources."
"The development of new, low-carbon technologies in the energy sector will, I hope, not only safeguard the existing jobs in this field but will also create many additional highly qualified jobs."
"However, I believe that, in this respect, the investment should be made in the fields of solar energy and carbon capture and storage."
"Given the potential for grave consequences, the investments in nuclear energy must be re-thought and redeployed."
"This new policy direction in energy issues will also improve the security of energy supplies within the EU and institute a more robust independence from foreign suppliers."
"in writing. - (ES) Like the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have voted against the motion for a resolution on investing in the development of low-carbon technologies (SET Plan) for a number of reasons; in particular, because the amendment requesting the deletion of recital I - which was key for us - was accepted; in that paragraph it was suggested that the sixth European Industrial Initiative on 'Sustainable Nuclear Energy' should be renamed simply 'Nuclear Energy'."
"We consider that the concept of 'sustainable nuclear energy' is meaningless because, in the best of cases, it is possible to reduce the threat to the environment and to people's health, and the risks of proliferation that stem from the development and use of nuclear energy, but not eliminate them."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, to express my grief for the victims and my solidarity with their families and friends in both natural catastrophes. These severely affected several Member States and regions."
"I would therefore state that it is imperative for Europe to make a prompt response to these events, namely activation of the European Solidarity Fund, thus showing the EU's solidarity with all those affected."
"At this time it is important to have special consideration for the island and outermost regions which, in addition to their permanent obstacles, are now confronted with devastated infrastructure and personal, commercial and agricultural property, and, in many cases, not being able to resume normal activities immediately, particularly in the regions that depend almost exclusively on tourism, as the media portrayal of the events could deter potential visitors."
"It is therefore necessary to call on the Commission and the Council to take prompt action, so that the Council reassesses the proposal to make implementation of the European Solidarity Fund simpler, quicker and more flexible."
"Similarly, it is important to review with the respective Member States the European programmes and structural, agricultural and social funds, so as to improve the response to the needs arising from these catastrophes."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the major natural disasters which have taken place in the autonomous region of Madeira and the effects of the storm Xynthia in Europe."
"I believe that the European Union must show solidarity to those who suffer as a result of these natural disasters."
"They have hit regions in Portugal, western France, various regions in Spain, in particular the Canary Islands and Andalusia, as well as Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands."
"In western France the storm caused the death of roughly 60 people and the disappearance of a number of people, not to mention the destruction of several thousand homes."
"The European Commission can provide financial support to the affected regions through the European Union's Solidarity Fund."
"It is of paramount importance that there is a sense of solidarity between Member States in the event of major natural disasters."
"There must be coordination between the authorities at local, national and European level in their efforts to rebuild the affected areas."
"Effective prevention policies must not be overlooked either."
"We must ensure, both in this case and for the future, that European funds will reach the affected regions as quickly as possible in order to help those affected by natural disasters."
"On 20 February, a unique meteorological phenomenon occurred on Madeira causing, at least, 42 deaths, with 32 people missing, 370 homeless and around 70 injured."
"On 27-28 February, in western France on the Atlantic coast (Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire), another phenomenon caused 60 deaths, with 10 people missing and more than 2 000 homeless."
"This storm also isolated several regions in Spain, particularly in the Canary Islands and Andalusia."
"Besides the human and psychological suffering, these meteorological phenomena caused a scene of widespread destruction with an extremely serious social and economic impact on the economic activities of these regions, as many people lost all they had."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, calling on the Commission to immediately take all action necessary to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF), in the most urgent and flexible way and to the maximum possible amount to help the victims."
"I would emphasise the need to draft a new EUSF regulation based on the Commission's proposal, in order to deal with the problems caused by natural disasters in a more flexible and effective way."
"The storm that devastated Madeira on 20 February caused enormous human and material losses in the region of Madeira."
"The role of the EU is vitally important, as it has mechanisms and instruments at its disposal, such as the Solidarity Fund, the Structural Funds - the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund - and the Cohesion Fund, which need to be activated and applied in a quick, flexible and simplified manner."
"I welcome the motion for a resolution in which the European Commission is asked, as soon as it receives a request from the Portuguese Government, to initiate the action necessary to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in the most urgent and flexible way and to the greatest possible extent."
"I call on the solidarity of the institutions of the European Union towards the swift and flexible application of the Cohesion Fund, bearing in mind Madeira's special status as an insular and outermost region of the EU."
"I appeal to the good will of the European Commission as regards negotiating the revision of the regional operational programmes INTERVIR+ (ERDF) and RUMOS (ESF), as well as the section on Madeira of the Thematic Territorial Enhancement Operational Programme (Cohesion Fund)."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report and was very happy that it was passed by the parliament."
"Following similar if less severe weather circumstances in Ireland involving flooding and the recent snow, I know how deeply these tragedies affect families and citizens of the EU, and it is important that this house acts to help in any way that it can."
"The natural disaster that affected Madeira on 20 February has left a desolate scene, human suffering and widespread destruction, with devastating consequences for the respective economic and production structures."
"One week later, another natural disaster - storm Xynthia - had devastating consequences on a region in western France and several regions of Spain."
"I would like to join with the feeling of grief and express my solidarity with all those affected by this tragedy, in terms of both the human and material losses."
"It is vital to provide aid to people, as well as to rebuild infrastructure, public facilities and essential services."
"It is true that the Solidarity Fund can only be paid after the completion of the procedures to mobilise the Fund and the respective approval by the Council and Parliament."
"However, in the current situation, it is very difficult to ask people facing immense difficulties in resuming their normal way of life to wait."
"Therefore, we ask for the greatest urgency and flexibility both in making funds available and taking exceptional measures to help Madeira."
"in writing. - (PT) On 20 February this year there was a tragedy in Madeira, characterised by unprecedented, torrential rain, strong winds and huge waves."
"It left at least 42 dead, several disappeared, hundreds homeless and dozens wounded."
"I would like to highlight the immediate efforts of the Regional Government of Madeira and its institutions in their rapid and coordinated response to this tragedy."
"On 27-28 February 2010 in western France - in particular the regions of Poitou-Charentes and Pays -de -la Loire - there was a very strong and destructive storm, dubbed Xynthia."
"It left more than 60 dead, several disappeared and thousands homeless."
"In the face of these tragedies I wish to show my profound grief and strong solidarity with all the affected regions, giving my condolences to the families of the victims and paying tribute to the search and rescue teams."
"I call on the Commission to begin taking, as soon as requested by the respective Member State, all the necessary steps to mobilise as much of the European Union Solidarity Fund as is possible."
"When assessing these requests, the Commission must take into account the specific nature of the individual regions, in particular the fragility of isolated and peripheral regions."
"I endorsed this motion for a resolution on the action to be taken in the wake of the devastating and deadly passage of storm Xynthia on our territory because, beyond trying to lay blame, we must above all show European solidarity so as to support the victims of this disaster, which struck several European countries."
"Not only must we harness the Solidarity Fund, but this aid must also come from the Cohesion Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development."
"Lastly, we must encourage insurance companies to intervene as quickly as possible and subsequently learn lessons from such events when it comes to issuing planning permission."
"in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, I endorsed the motion for a resolution on the major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira and the effects of the storm 'Xynthia' in Europe."
"Let us concentrate on Madeira, because it was there that the catastrophe took the heaviest toll."
"We are creating a large and strong community for many reasons, but also so that we can help each other in times of need."
"Today, Madeira and other regions are in need, because they have been hit hard by the effects of the storm."
"It is our duty to help those who need our aid."
"I hope the motion for a resolution will contribute to the effective elimination of the effects of the tragedy."
"I sympathise deeply with all the victims and their families. Thank you."
"In recent weeks, several EU regions have been hit by natural disasters: Madeira, then western France and various regions of Spain."
"The human and material consequences caused by the violence of these meteorological phenomena have left a deep impression on us MEPs."
"This explains the motion for a resolution on natural disasters voted on today in the European Parliament; it expresses our 'deepest sympathy' and 'solidarity' with the victims of the devastated regions."
"European solidarity must be reflected in financial terms by the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund and by means of other European-funded projects."
"However, when it comes to the Solidarity Fund, I must point out that the current regulation does not permit a sufficiently flexible and rapid response; the opportunity exists to amend this regulation, and it is now up to the European Council to make progress in this matter."
"I also voted in favour of the amendment supporting the proposal made by Mr Barnier in 2006 to create a European civil protection force."
"I regret that it has not been adopted; implementing this proposal would improve the EU's crisis response capacity."
"The recent natural tragedy that occurred on Madeira has left the island in a state of chaos."
"Other regions in Europe have been equally devastated by the impact of storm Xynthia."
"The EU should unreservedly help in a joint effort to express solidarity, mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund for this purpose."
"The EUSF was established with the aim of delivering urgent financial aid to Member States affected by natural disasters."
"in writing. - (DE) On 20 February, a serious natural disaster with torrential rainfall on an unprecedented scale, in conjunction with a powerful storm and very high waves, hit Madeira, killing at least 42 people, with many people still missing."
"In addition, hundreds of people have been left homeless."
"A few days later, the devastating storm Xynthia passed along the French Atlantic coast, causing nearly 60 deaths, in particular in the regions of Poitou-Charentes, Pays de la Loire and Brittany."
"There, too, there are many people missing."
"Thousands of people have also been left homeless."
"I therefore supported the measures proposed in the joint motion for a resolution for the EU to come to the aid of these countries and regions financially, for which reason I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"In particular, it must be ensured that the Union's Solidarity Fund is mobilised promptly and flexibly."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of European Parliament motion for a resolution."
"Ecological catastrophes and natural disasters are an increasingly common part of our lives."
"The dangers from changes in the environment have grown over recent decades, and we should do everything possible to prevent them."
"The European Union, which has 27 Member States and half a billion citizens, must tackle not only the emergence of climate and environmental change, but must also look after its citizens and guarantee them the best possible conditions for survival after a crisis."
"Our efforts, however, must not concentrate only on giving help after the event."
"A fundamental reason for the European Union's existence is to give its citizens a sense of security."
"In relation to this, the appropriate EU institutions must take specific steps to supervise the regions and their abilities to undertake preventative action."
"In order to tackle, as quickly as possible, the effects of the storm 'Xynthia', we should mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund and help all those who have incurred losses in connection with this catastrophe."
"Adverse and painful events which affect others should always prompt us to take effective action in solidarity with those who have suffered."
"Let us show that it is the same this time."
"in writing. - I abstained on the resolution on the major natural disaster in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe because two of our key amendments were defeated."
"More specifically, the one which made reference to the fact that in France buildings were allowed on floodplains and natural wetlands and that housing speculation caused the construction of buildings in vulnerable areas, and the one stating that all Community funds for the implementation of such plans, particularly from the Structural Funds, the EAFRD, the Cohesion Fund and the European Solidarity Fund, be conditional on sustainability measures."
"I would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the families of the victims of the natural disasters in Madeira and of the victims of storm Xynthia."
"Natural disasters have been an ever-frequent occurrence recently due to climate change."
"This is why we must ensure that the European Union is prepared to respond as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament motion for a resolution which calls on the Commission to consider the possibility of increasing the community cofinancing rate for regional operational programmes."
"No Member State is able to cope on its own with natural disasters of great magnitude."
"This is why the European Commission must adapt the European Solidarity Fund in order to guarantee that Member States hit by disasters will be able to access this fund quicker and in a more efficient manner."
"This motion for a resolution expresses the need to provide aid to those European regions that were recently the scene of natural disasters, such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira."
"The heavy rainfall on Madeira on 20 February has, in addition to the serious human consequences, with 42 people killed, several injured and made homeless, had countless repercussions and serious material damage."
"In this context, it is vital to mobilise assistance for affected regions to recover from the economic and social consequences of disasters."
"I would stress particularly the fragility of insular and outermost regions, as in the case of Madeira, where the specific nature of its economy and social situation makes it all the more vital to provide the best aid possible."
"I would repeat the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in a flexible manner, as well as to revise the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund, with a view to adapting them to the requirements arising from the tragedy."
"It would be equally apt to review the financing planned for 2010 earmarked for specific projects, in accordance with the general rules on the Structural Funds for 2007-2013."
"In view of the size of the natural disaster on Madeira, and its indelible consequences, and the effect of storm Xynthia, I voted in favour of the tabled document."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"The case of Gilad Shalit"
"The next item is the debate about cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure), initially the case of Gilad Shalit (four motions for resolutions)."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, at around 8 o'clock this morning, here in Parliament, I visited the website dedicated to Gilad Shalit and a painful fact immediately caught my eye: for 1355 days, 3 hours, 12 minutes and 37 seconds, Gilad, who has been abducted, has been denied any contact with his father, mother, brother and sister."
"However, on the same website I also came across a passage from the Book of Jeremiah: 'So there is hope for your descendants, declares the Lord."
"Your children will return to their own land'."
"Noam Shalit, who is with us here today, is placing his hope and confidence in you, as well as in the God of Israel, to obtain the release of his precious son."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the case of Gilad Shalit."
"During a special meeting with the Israeli delegation yesterday afternoon, I already assured Noam Shalit that his cause - the release of Gilad Shalit - is our cause, too."
"Let this debate and this resolution be clear signs of that, which obviously call for follow-up by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs."
"Yesterday morning, I spoke to Baroness Ashton personally about this."
"The case of Shalit is our cause, a European cause."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please remain loyal to this cause in the coming period as well."
"I am counting on you."
"Let Europe make a difference in the Middle East."
"Together with Noam Shalit and his family, we are looking forward to the fulfilment of the rabbinic prayer for Shalit, psalm 126, verse 1: 'When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion, we were like men who dreamed'."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Gilad Shalit was 19 years old when he was kidnapped in a Hamas attack near Gaza."
"Not in Gaza, but in Israel, in a kibbutz where his unit was stationed."
"For nearly four years, this young man has been living in a cellar; there is no right to receive visitors, no doctor, no lawyer, no mail, no trial and no Geneva Convention for Gilad, nothing."
"He who is known - wrongly, in fact - as soldier Gilad Shalit was carrying out his military service like all young people in his country."
"He is a rather shy young man - like his father for that matter, whom we have met on several occasions and whom we have the pleasure of welcoming today again in this Chamber - a young man who loved maths, who loved football and who would have returned to civilian life, of course, had he not been living, for four years now, in a hole, cut off from the world and cut off from his family."
"Commissioner, I do not want to talk to you about politics this afternoon;"
"I do not want to talk to you about the Middle East, conflicts, bargaining or prisoner exchanges."
"Our Parliament is unanimous today in calling for you to help a young man - a young Israeli, a young Frenchman, a young European - return home."
"That is why I, together with my fellow authors of this resolution and members of six political groups, Mrs Essayah, Mr CohnBendit, Mr Howitt, Mr Tannock and Mr Belder, who spoke just now, am writing today to Baroness Ashton."
"We call very strongly for Baroness Ashton, who will travel to Israel and Gaza next Wednesday, to exert all her influence in order to demand the release of Gilad Shalit, the influence with which she is endowed by the mandate of our resolution today, the influence of 500 million European citizens whom we represent in this House."
"(Applause)"
"author. - Mr President, I welcome this cross-party resolution calling for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit held captive since 2006 by the military wing of Hamas."
"I agree with Gilad's father, who has asked that his son's case be addressed as a humanitarian issue and not be turned into a political football."
"In the cut and thrust of political debate we must never lose sight of the suffering of both Israeli and Palestinian families whose loved ones have been taken from them in this conflict."
"The Geneva Conventions must be respected by all sides."
"It is totally unacceptable that Gilad Shalit has been denied his rights as a prisoner of war to which the Goldstone Report categorically states he is entitled."
"His family have no information on the state of his health, either physical health or mental health."
"At the same time, amongst the 7 200 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, also held in breach of the Geneva Conventions, 1 500 are held for an indefinite period and 13 have already served 25 years."
"Forty-four are children while 23 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council are detained in retaliation for the capture of Gilad Shalit."
"Again, Goldstone is clear: these detentions of PLC members are contrary to international law."
"I will raise these issues at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly in Jordan this weekend."
"I urge Catherine Ashton during her upcoming visit to the region to press the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, including those in Gaza, for the release of Gilad Shalit and of Palestinian children and PLC members and to ensure their safe and early return to their families."
"author. - Mr President, Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit has now been held hostage by the Jihadi fanatics of Hamas for over three years."
"Hamas claims it is a legal actor observing the Geneva Conventions and therefore he is a prisoner of war, but Israel, in my view rightly, regards him as an abductee from the moment he was seized."
"Irrespective of his legal status and international law, he has been cruelly kept incommunicado in Gaza, deprived of any contact with the outside world and even denied Red Cross access, which the Geneva Conventions mandate."
"His family has no information about his well-being beyond one video and sporadic indication from Hamas that he is still alive and well."
"If Hamas has any claim to be taken seriously by the international community, it should at least now show unequivocally that the conditions of his incarceration adhere to international humanitarian laws."
"But we demand more than that."
"We demand his immediate and unconditional release."
"I make no secret of my opposition to dialogue with the terrorists of Hamas, an organisation committed to Israel's annihilation, but, if we are ever to deal with Hamas, it must only be after Gilad Shalit has been liberated from his squalid captivity."
"author. - Mr President, usually when this House makes a resolution which has even a slight connection with the situation in the Middle East, it is hard to find mutual understanding."
"That is not so in this case, thanks to the colleagues who have made it possible."
"The situation of Gilad Shalit is a humanitarian issue and our joint resolution underlines the fact that, since being taken hostage nearly four years ago, he has been kept in an unknown place in Gaza, where he does not enjoy basic rights according to any humanitarian standards, including the third Geneva Convention."
"It is from this humanitarian perspective that we demand the immediate release of Gilad Shalit."
"Meanwhile, the minimum requirement is that the Red Cross and Shalit's parents may be allowed to be in contact with him."
"The value of a human person cannot be measured."
"It is immeasurable."
"Gilad Shalit should not be made a bargaining chip by the terrorist organisation Hamas but should be released immediately."
"This is the message that we would like the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to take with her to Gaza during her forthcoming visit."
"author. - (EL) Mr President, yesterday I and other members attended a meeting at which Shalit's father was present and I should like to say that it is impossible not to be affected by this family's tragedy."
"That is why our position is that Gilad Shalit, a member of the Israeli armed forces arrested in Israeli territory on 24 June 2006, meets the criteria for him to be considered a prisoner-of-war under the Third Geneva Convention."
"As such, he should be given humanitarian treatment and be allowed to communicate."
"The International Red Cross should be allowed to visit him and his family should have every right to be informed of his situation and, of course, to visit him."
"At the same time, we express our belief and our desire that this person will be released."
"However, without wishing in any way to detract from what I have said so far, I believe that our position that this issue can be differentiated from a series of other Palestinians in gaol is somewhat apolitical."
"Their presence in these gaols is also a humanitarian issue."
"I believe that we are giving false hopes to this family if we think that, by focusing, as a Parliament, solely on the release of this particular person, for whom I repeat our demand that he be released, we shall achieve something."
"Is the fact that dozens of 16-year-old Palestinian children are in gaol not a humanitarian issue?"
"How can you differentiate between these two issues?"
"We cannot not mention the fact that Gaza itself - as someone said earlier that he is living in a hovel and indeed he is living in a hovel - that Gaza itself, I repeat, is an immense hovel."
"One-and-a-half million Palestinians living there are living in a collective hovel."
"There are 7 200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons; they include 270 children aged between 16 and 18 and 44 children below the age of 16."
"Seven hundred and fifty thousand Palestinians have been arrested and put in prison since 1967."
"So we are calling for the release of Shalit, but our position that we believe that this can be achieved by divorcing it from the overall picture in Palestine is apolitical."
"To close, I should like to add that the only area in the world with a minister for prisoners is Palestine."
"I would like to express once again our love and sympathy for the family and I trust that this problem will be resolved shortly."
"Mr President, the resolution on Corporal Gilad Shalit, which we are examining today, supplements the many resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament on the human rights situation in the Middle East."
"Corporal Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage for 1 355 days, must be released as soon as possible."
"We demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released."
"The young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who has been detained by the Israeli authorities since 13 March 2005, must be released."
"The children imprisoned in Israel, in violation of the provisions of international law and the conventions on the rights of the child, must be released."
"The militants of the NonViolent Popular Resistance Against the Occupation, such as Abdallah Abu Rahmah from Bil'in, must be released."
"The elected representatives, the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council - including Marwan Barghouti - must be released."
"It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East."
"The solutions do not lie in oneupmanship, exercised under repressive and violent conditions, an example of which was the assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai, which we condemn, not least because it makes securing the release of Gilad Shalit even more difficult."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (CS) The case of Gilad Shalit has become a symbol of the endless desperation and frustration in the Middle East."
"This is true both for the people living there and for the international community, which is engaged there."
"Gilad Shalit is a hostage with a name, whose eventful fate we follow with sympathy and concern."
"The people of the Middle East are the nameless hostages of this never-ending conflict."
"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
"Or is there another hope for Gilad and all the other victims?"
"All of the standards of international law will not make up for what we hear so desperately little of in this conflict - an appeal for humaneness."
"To try and abandon the geopolitical view of the world, where human beings and their fates are manipulated like playing cards."
"To try and put ourselves in the position of the families of victims and of all innocent detainees and destitute people."
"What then prevents the release of Gilad Shalit and all those whose guilt has not been established beyond doubt by the courts?"
"Not to mention the encouragement of those who want to live in peace.The key to peace is trust, compromise and the courage to defend peace against all those who are implacable."
"I would like to ask you to take the first step."
"Mr President, the purpose of our debate today is, in all earnestness, to put a name and a face to human suffering, and in that way expand our compassion and our empathy."
"In this regard, it is very valuable indeed that we have chosen Gilad Shalit as a topic for our debate today."
"This will lead us to extend our empathy to others, so that we can identify with their suffering and their families' suffering."
"There are thousands of Palestinians who are being detained under totally unacceptable conditions, something that is contrary to international rules in every respect, and that is just as difficult a situation for them as it is for Gilad Shalit and his family."
"We must do our utmost to take this problem seriously, and my feeling is that all of us in this House are prepared to do so."
"The issue here is not just one prisoner, but thousands of prisoners who are victims of this major conflict."
"I would also add a further point: it is important that we face up squarely to the cause of this suffering and that we realise that, if we do not do something, not only about the siege of Gaza, but also about the occupation of Palestine as a whole, and if we do not create a two-state solution which I believe all of us are calling for and want, there will be no future for these people."
"I think this is a really productive way to go about finding a common solution, and I hope that Baroness Ashton will put the EU in a position where it does not only have to pay, pay and pay, but where it can also make its voice heard every now and then."
"- (NL) Mr President, on 25 June 2006, an Israeli Army conscript, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was abducted following a terrorist infiltration from the Gaza Strip."
"He has since been held hostage by Hamas."
"Hamas has kept Shalit completely cut off from the outside world."
"He has been incarcerated in deepest darkness and not even the Red Cross is allowed access to him."
"The Shalit case proves once again that Europe and Israel are on the same side."
"Barbaric Islamic forces are waging an all-out war against Western civilisation."
"Israel is in the frontline of that war."
"In Israel and Europe, every human life counts."
"For Islamic terrorists, human life counts for nothing, or rather, one human life is worth a thousand lives, because Hamas is demanding that, in exchange for Shalit, Israel release 1000 prisoners, including a large number of terrorist murderers."
"It is important that we obtain Shalit's release, but without Israel having to release terrorists in return."
"After all, we have seen where exchanges like this have led in the past: the euphoria of victory for the terrorists, for their followers and leaders, and inevitably more terror."
"We cannot allow people to profit from terrorism, and it would be irresponsible if we encouraged Israel to respond to such hostage-taking with an exchange, because the next Hamas hostage could be somebody from Paris, Amsterdam or Brussels."
"And what kind of a position will we be in then?"
"The boot must be put on the other foot immediately: it is Hamas, not Israel, that must pay for taking Gilad Shalit, a European, hostage."
"The price should be so high that they release him of their own free will."
"In this regard, we ask that a complete ban on travel to and through Europe be imposed on all officials of the Hamas regime, including those who are not formally allied with Hamas and those who are not on the European terror list."
"- Mr President, this young man has been kept in captivity for almost 1 400 days with absolute disrespect for any international norms and no access to him even by the Red Cross."
"I think this case should be seen and solved exclusively as a human tragedy."
"I am encouraged by the wide support in the European Parliament for this debate and by the warm reception our colleagues expressed yesterday to Shalit's father."
"Shalit's case should not become a bargaining chip."
"Instead it will be in the interests of Hamas if they want to gain legitimacy in the peace process."
"To conclude, the best proof for their credibility would be to release Gilad Shalit unconditionally and to abstain from further kidnappings."
"(PL) The resolution we are discussing, today, is not of a political nature, and we are not trying to solve the Middle East conflict."
"All we want is that an innocent son be allowed to return to his father and to his family."
"I do not know if fellow Members know of the existence of an organisation called the Parents Circle."
"It is an organisation of Israeli and Palestinian families who have lost relatives in the conflict."
"We are talking, today, about an individual case precisely because we do not want Gilad Shalit's father to join those who have lost the closest of loved ones - their own children."
"We are appealing for the release of a hostage, because we do not agree with the idea that the end justifies the means."
"Fighting in a just cause does not excuse actions which are universally considered to be wrong or acts of terrorism."
"Organisations which want to gain our approval, our respect, must not hold hostages."
"(Applause)"
"(RO) I too wish to add my support to those who have called in this Chamber, both today and yesterday, for the release of Gilad Shalit, and I also wish to express my sympathy to his family."
"I would like to address my speech to those who are perhaps asking themselves the question: 'Why have a resolution on the Gilad Shalit case, and why now?'"
"Other fellow Members have reminded us that it will soon be four years that young Gilad Shalit has been held hostage in brutal conditions and in breach of the international standards recognised by the Third Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war."
"As every one of us can imagine, every extra day in captivity means awful suffering for Shalit and his family."
"I would also give another reason for support, namely that Gilad Shalit is a European citizen, he is a European victim of terrorism, and on this day, which is European Day for the Victims of Terrorism, I can think of no more symbolic gesture than this resolution."
"- Mr President, first of all I would like to salute the efforts made by Gilad Shalit's family to seek his release, which we wholeheartedly support."
"That is the message we want to convey through this resolution."
"We believe, as the Goldstone Report highlights, that he is indeed entitled to the status of prisoner of war, as the prisoners kept by Israel, including many children, should be."
"We want all of them to be released."
"We want Gilad Shalit and all the Palestinian young men and women to be released."
"Indeed this is only way for peace to be achieved in that region."
"We urge Baroness Ashton to spare no effort to press for the release of Gilad Shalit and all the other Palestinian prisoners of war, especially those young people who are enduring this captivity."
"(PL) The case of Gilad Shalit has a particular, personal dimension."
"It is the tragic case of a very young man the same age as my son, and it is also the tragic case of his family."
"However, let us not pretend that the case does not also have a broader political context."
"It does, in fact, make us aware that the black and white film which is often very one-sidedly presented also in this Chamber, the film which speaks of victims only on the Palestinian side, is something which is, really, not very objective."
"I think that, today, we should demand very clearly the release of this young man, but let us also remember that those who are firing missiles at Sderot are responsible for the fact that he is still a prisoner."
"- (FI) Mr President, as we know, the background to this resolution was a very politically sensitive set of circumstances, but that ought not to prevent us from passing a clearly humanitarian resolution that is not watered down by general political remarks on the situation as a whole."
"I am pleased that this resolution has kept to the point."
"I intend to vote in favour of it."
"It stresses the idea that all parties involved in the crisis in the Middle East must comply with international humanitarian law and human rights legislation."
"I hope that it receives the firm support of this House."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the case of the abducted Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, is of great concern to the European Union."
"My former colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner called urgently for Mr Shalit's release in this very House already on 5 July 2006, less than two weeks after his capture."
"Over the years and on a number of occasions, including at the latest Association Council with Israel last June and in the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of December 2009, the EU has consistently called on those holding Mr Shalit to release him without delay."
"Therefore we join with today's Parliament motions calling for his release."
"It is our opinion, in line with the assessment of many human rights organisations, that the terms and conditions of Mr Shalit's detention are contrary to international humanitarian law."
"Therefore we urge his captors to respect such obligations and in particular to allow delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit him."
"Finally, we are aware that mediation activities have been ongoing, aimed at the release of Gilad Shalit."
"We encourage all efforts made in this direction and we express our hope that they will soon be successful."
"I will also personally pass on a clear message from you to my colleague Cathy Ashton."
"Of course our thoughts are with the family of Gilad Shalit."
"I know that his father has been in this House this week and I understand that he is at this very moment sitting here with us."
"(Applause)"
"I want to reassure him that our thoughts and efforts are with him and, of course, with all the others who are suffering the consequences of this long lasting conflict."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I wish to express my regret in view of the imprisonment of Gilad Shalit."
"His abduction alongside the detention of the rest of the prisoners in the area is unacceptable."
"This situation needs to be amended as soon as possible."
"I believe that release of Shalit would contribute to the Middle East peace process in general."
"(FR) For the rest, France has just decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action."
"2."
"The escalation of violence in Mexico"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on the escalation of violence in Mexico."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that Mexico is a great democracy that has progressed steadily over the last 20 years."
"It is a friend of the European Union and we share a Strategic Partnership Agreement."
"I would also like to say that Mexico is currently waging a very difficult war against organised drug trafficking."
"Today in the European Parliament, however, we are talking about Mexico in the context of human rights, because there has been and continues to be a marked increase in violence, which affects Mexican people in particular, and because there have been repeated, serious complaints about human rights violations."
"The resolution that the major political groups are going to adopt here today is based on respect and consensus; of course, it recognises the situation I have just described and urges Mexico to continue on the path towards rule of law and full democracy."
"However, it also makes four important requests: it urges Mexico to ensure the right to a free press, because there have been attacks on journalists; to guarantee protection for the organisations that defend human rights, because those groups have been attacked and threatened; to guarantee protection for women who suffer violence, because many women have been murdered; and to avoid impunity and abuses of power by their police forces."
"This is what Parliament has asked of Mexico, in the spirit of friendship based on a favourable relationship with Mexico."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this week we are celebrating International Women's Day."
"In this Parliament, we have seen a great many posters in all the languages of the European Union, saying that we can put a stop to violence against women."
"Today we are talking about violence in Mexico, and I think it is right that we should recognise that Mexican women, both indigenous and non-indigenous victims, receive the least protection from local and federal authorities."
"Mexican women are victims of all forms of violence, from domestic violence to sexual violence and torture carried out by the army or the police, and they also become murder victims."
"Regrettably, up to now the response from the Mexican authorities has been ineffective, which is why we can now accurately say that we are looking at a case of almost total impunity."
"Our resolution calls on the Mexican Government to fight against femicide, which is a harsh word, but an accurate one when we consider that almost all the murders involving female victims go unpunished."
"For example, during the past four years in Mexico, only 11% of the criminals who murdered almost 700 women have been sentenced."
"At the same time, it would appear that women are the judicial system's favourite victims."
"There is no other way to explain how it was possible for two indigenous women, Alberta Alcántara and Teresa González, to be sentenced to 21 years in prison and to have now spent more than three years in jail for kidnapping six men from the Federal Investigations Agency - all by themselves - during an incident in a market."
"Let us hope that the judge, who will make a decision on the women's appeal in one week's time, realises how ridiculous and unjust the situation is."
"However, violence against women starts in the home."
"I hope that Mexican legislators will soon make improvements to the General Law on Women's Access to a Life Free of Violence so that the different forms of violence and the mechanisms implementing the laws can be properly defined."
"It would also be right to establish domestic violence and rape within marriage as criminal offences."
"Furthermore, in order for Mexican society to change and reject violence against women, it is important that schools deal with this issue as a basic matter of education for young people."
"author. - (PL) For several years now, the authorities in Mexico, including, first and foremost, President Felipe Calderón, have been waging a bloody war against drugs gangs."
"Over 40 000 soldiers have been involved in the war, and several successes have been achieved."
"These successes include, undoubtedly, the arrests of the bosses of the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels, the destruction of over 23 000 hectares of opium crops and 38 000 hectares of marihuana, the closures of over 50 illegal laboratories which were producing narcotics and the arrests of over 45 000 people who were involved with this process."
"We need to be aware that the Mexican drugs cartels generate annual incomes of many billions of dollars, which is incomparably more than the amounts allocated by the Mexican Government to tackling the narcotics problem."
"So the gangs are spending huge sums on corrupting politicians, judges and police officers."
"This is precisely why the authorities are losing the war."
"Since 2006, almost 15 000 people have been killed, and over 6 000 of them have been killed since last October."
"Journalists are especially in danger, as over 60 have been killed, including, recently, Jorge Ochoa Martínez."
"We have to understand that without international involvement, Mexico will not win the war."
"(Applause)"
"author. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has a major problem with drugs trafficking and drug-related violence."
"To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons."
"The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct."
"The Government also recognises that it needs to make substantial changes in the area of security and justice, and is implementing an ambitious reform of the justice system in order for it to be more transparent and to bring to justice those who commit crimes, while respecting human rights."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to show its solidarity with the Mexican people in the fight against drugs trafficking, and we support President Calderón in his willingness to combat organised crime."
"Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction with this agreement, which unites the main political Groups of this Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 2007 there has been a constant increase in human rights violations in Mexico."
"According to the Mexican NGOs and media, more than 6 500 murders attributable to drugs cartels have been recorded for 2009 alone, the vast majority of which were in the state of Chihuahua."
"President Calderón's government has sent thousands of soldiers to the worst affected areas."
"Since then, the violent acts committed by these military forces and by the police forces alike have increased with complete impunity."
"The NGOs are producing ever more reports and talking about crimes of state."
"Journalists, indigenous communities, and especially women, both indigenous and nonindigenous, are particularly affected."
"I met some of these women from San Salvador Atenco; they had been raped and tortured by the police forces."
"I was appalled at what they told me."
"The perpetrators of these acts committed in May 2006 still enjoy complete impunity."
"Therefore we cannot share the concerns of the Mexican authorities, the agents of which regularly violate human rights."
"It follows that we shall not support the joint resolution and we shall table ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the images of the brutal use of violence on the open street in the so-called war on drugs in Mexico reach us regularly via the mass media."
"The murder of hundreds of women, mostly workers in the north of the country, is making headlines and has spawned the term 'feminicide'."
"The European Parliament has produced its own report on this."
"Despite knowledge of the major increase in serious violations of human rights, the Mexican Government appears to be unable or unwilling to do anything about it."
"Pointing out the necessary relentlessness in the fight against drug dealers is no substitute for consistent government action."
"The major expansion of military presence and power, the competence of military courts for crimes committed by soldiers, the almost complete impunity - these are the real causes of the escalating violence in the country."
"Even the Mexican national human rights commission has repeatedly documented the increase in violent crime by the military."
"The government itself does not want to admit the situation."
"It also continually hushes up crime."
"Yesterday, for example, there was a story going around in the media that the Ministry of Defence had paid out an awful lot of money to the families of victims of violence in order to buy their silence."
"Who were the perpetrators?"
"They were soldiers."
"The EU must address the fight against impunity in all its relations with Mexico."
"Given the severity of the human rights violations, it is absolutely necessary for the EU not to update the Global Agreement with Mexico."
"It must not do so until there has been a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in that country."
"The violence in Mexico is linked to drug trafficking and the social inequalities made worse by the economic crisis."
"Fighting impunity is key."
"It is vital to invest in the judicial system to try and punish criminals and to ensure protection of witnesses and victims, many of them young working women caught in the wave of violence by the drug traffickers."
"It is shocking that Juárez is the world capital of feminicide, but even more shocking is the macho culture that explains the inaction of the authorities in prosecuting those responsible for these crimes and in protecting defenders of human rights, including journalists."
"Europe must use the strategic partnership with Mexico to support constructively all those who fight for human rights."
"They are the same people who are fighting to defend the rule of law and democracy."
"Without human rights there is no rule of law or democracy."
"Mr President, in this Chamber a moment ago, I heard a call not to sign the understanding with the Mexican authorities."
"I do not understand this suggestion."
"After all, we commend the President of Mexico - and those who spoke before me a moment ago also did so - for his determined fight against the drugs barons and the mafia."
"We should, therefore, commend the Mexican authorities for their action, while at the same time, of course, pointing out that they should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, and that in this fight they should still try to respect human rights."
"That is obvious."
"We have to understand the situation of a country which has been struggling with huge organised crime syndicates and the mafia for decades."
"If the president of the country declares war in this area, he should be given complete support."
"However, of course, we have been speaking, here, about journalists, and we have been speaking about other victims."
"It should be emphasised that these people should not be made the victims of discrimination."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Ladies and gentlemen, just this morning, the Mexican Trade Union of Electricians was surrounded by a police force of between 100 and 200 police officers."
"It is the same trade union that, after announcing a general strike, saw one of its leaders, Domingo Aguilar Vázquez, captured the next day on 16 March, and arrested on phony charges."
"This attack on the freedom of trade unions in Mexico, conducted directly by the government, is even more shocking because we are talking here of the Mexican Federal Government not punishing crimes committed, for example, by their own military, or ineffectiveness in fighting drug trafficking."
"Yes, the situation is complex."
"There are attacks by the armed forces on drug traffickers, but at the same time there are attacks against the trade unions."
"What happens is that, in a situation of ineffectiveness, impunity and rising authoritarianism, a democracy like the Mexican democracy spirals out of control."
"This Parliament must vigorously condemn and, above all, call on the Mexican Government to finally stop being ineffective with regard to criminals and, apparently, so authoritarian with, for example, trade unions, workers and civil society movements."
"- (FI) Mr President, I wish to highlight two issues in our resolution on Mexico."
"Firstly, as we have heard, violence has been on the increase this year."
"Mexico is in the grip of large drug cartels and the violence they perpetrate is estimated to have cost 15 000 lives already."
"The situation is especially bad close to the border between Mexico and the United States of America."
"The Mexican Government is trying to bring the situation under control by means of a massive military and police operation."
"The strategy has also attracted a lot of criticism."
"Obviously, responsibility for the drug trade, money laundering and the problems these cause also extends to other countries, and Mexico needs to be offered assistance and cooperation."
"Secondly, I want to mention recent reports by Amnesty International regarding the unwillingness on the part of authorities to protect human rights activists."
"Those who stand up for indigenous peoples and poor communities are at particular risk."
"When it becomes dangerous to promote human rights, many have to consider the risks of the work they do."
"Those on whose behalf the activists work then lose hope."
"These matters, issues relating to the drug trade, and human rights must also be taken up for discussion in May, when we think about plans for cooperation at the next EUMexico Summit."
"(DE) Mr President, we often discuss dictatorships in this House."
"Mexico is not a dictatorship, but a democracy."
"We are debating individual cases of serious humans rights violations."
"For Mexico, that is not the key subject."
"The key subject is the fact that this large democracy, which is a strategic partner of ours, has been suffering from a serious, perhaps even fatal illness for decades."
"It therefore requires the right treatment and the right doctor."
"President Calderón and his comrades-in-arms are that doctor."
"That does not mean that they are capable of using, or allowed to use, every treatment there is, but we must support them."
"That is why I believe that paragraph 12 in the resolution, in which we state that we intend to make greater use of our financial instrument to reinforce good governance, the rule of law, the structures of a State under the rule of law against the disintegration of the State, against organised criminality, against that impunity, which has been quite rightly criticised, is so important."
"We cannot do that, however, by freezing or abandoning our contacts; rather, we must strengthen them."
"(ES) Mr President, we are all concerned by the increase in violence in Ciudad Juarez, but I trust in the broad measures that the Mexican authorities have put in place in order to effectively tackle this complex situation."
"I also support the vigorous battle President Calderón is currently waging against drugs trafficking, which is a very serious global threat that concerns us all."
"That is why we should help the Mexican authorities in this difficult struggle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, Mexico has gone through a very positive process of political and governmental modernisation."
"President Calderón is steadily promoting reforms."
"Mexico has also taken on greater international responsibilities and is playing an active role within, for example, the United Nations and the G-20."
"In this Parliament, within my modest capabilities, I have always supported the establishment of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, which we finally achieved in 2008."
"I hope we can adopt an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the May Summit in Madrid, because the European Union and Mexico need to work together in many areas, both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums, in order to confront challenges and threats together, including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime"
"- Mr President, Mexico has long been a primary conduit into the world's largest market for illegal narcotics, the United States."
"Mexico has therefore been scarred by the brutality and violence that go hand in hand with the drugs trade."
"Moreover, Mexico itself, as a country of 100 million people and a vital EU strategic partner, has increasingly - and sadly - become an important market for cocaine."
"The rising consumption by young people is especially worrying."
"Drug-related violence in Mexico only seems to be getting worse, with ever more grisly murders and journalists who report on such cases being themselves targeted."
"The prevalence of unemployment and poverty probably does not help either and induces a climate of lawlessness in parts of Mexico."
"President Calderón faces enormous challenges but he is determined to meet them head-on, and the EU should support him robustly."
"Particularly we should support his efforts to reform and restructure the police and criminal justice system in order to break up the corrupt links between the drug cartels and law enforcement."
"I believe he is also quite justified in the need to use the army as a temporary emergency measure."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, an unprecedented rise in violence has created, within the country, a sense of deep insecurity amongst the population."
"The Commission is of course highly concerned at this situation."
"We know that the Mexican authorities are taking this seriously and have put in place a lot of measures to address the problem."
"President Calderón's war on organised crime is its main priority."
"Apart from deploying a number of military across the country to fight organised crime, Mexico is making a tremendous effort to strengthen law enforcement and the judicial system."
"In August 2008, a package of security measures was adopted which aims at reorganising the Mexican law enforcement and justice system."
"The justice reform passed by the Mexican Congress in 2008 has the potential to address the main systemic problems facing criminal justice in Mexico, although we are aware that the implementation of this reform will require a long-term commitment."
"Mexico is also making a very serious effort to respond to the concerns over human rights abuses, in particular the impact of organised crime groups and vested interests of freedom of the media and freedom of expression, which have been brought to the attention of the EU by civil society organisations."
"In this connection, the Mexican Government established a special prosecutor for crimes committed against journalists in 2006."
"It is making noticeable efforts in addressing other shortcomings, as seen in the approval of a federal law to eradicate violence against women and the appointment of a special prosecutor on this issue, and in the new federal law to combat trafficking in human beings."
"As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Mexico pledged to adopt a state policy on human rights and to remain open at international level with regard to human rights."
"The issue of the protection of human rights in the framework of the fight against organised crime and the integrity of human rights defenders are reflected in the recommendations accepted by Mexico as a result of its participation in the UN Universal Periodic Review."
"Mexico has shown interest and readiness in discussing with the European Union all these issues, most recently during the session of the EU-Mexico Joint Committee held in Brussels on 26-27 November 2009."
"Indeed, this area constitutes the subject of dedicated cooperation."
"On 3-4 December 2009, the EU and Mexico jointly organised an international seminar in Cancún on 'The Legitimate Use of Force and the Protection of Human Rights'."
"The seminar provided a venue to hold expert consultations on a draft policy document on the human rights accountability of local police forces."
"The draft policy document was presented to the Quintana Roo local congress in the aftermath of the seminar."
"This initiative is complementary to the recently adopted federal law on the reform of the judiciary system and could be replicated by other federal states."
"We believe that the EU-Mexico Strategic Partnership provides the best framework for the EU to support Mexico in the areas of public security and the rule of law."
"The Strategic Partnership executive document currently under negotiation foresees the establishment of a formal EU-Mexico policy dialogue on security issues, as well as increased cooperation with relevant EU agencies such as CEPOL, Europol, Eurojust and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"From the Commission side, we are already supporting a project from 2004-2007 to strengthen the administration of justice in Mexico."
"Further cooperation in the field is foreseen for the period 2011-2013."
"In conclusion, it is clear that Mexico is facing important challenges in the areas of public security and respect for human rights."
"It is not easy and the situation is far from ideal, but it is also fair to say that it is showing willingness and determination to ensure the compatibility of an effective public security policy with respect for human rights."
"We will continue to support Mexico in its efforts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates."

"South Korea - death penalty declared legal"
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on South Korea - death penalty declared legal."
"author. - Mr President, after 13 years without an execution in South Korea, it is deeply sad that the Constitutional Court there ruled in favour of the death penalty a few weeks ago."
"The ruling states that the death penalty is a legal punishment that can deter crime for the public good."
"That is a commonly heard argument and merely a response to emotive situations in a given country at a certain time."
"It in fact means that the death penalty is being viewed as a preventive force in the hope that, when a criminal knows there is capital punishment, he or she will think twice about his or her acts."
"We all know that many studies have refuted that idea."
"Even more important is the fact that an execution is irreversible; there is no way back."
"Roman law at the time of Justinian stated that it was better for a guilty person to go unpunished than for an innocent person to be deprived of their life."
"That was 15 centuries ago."
"Since the South Korean Constitutional Court itself recognised that the death penalty could be subject to errors and abuse, our concerns brought forward today might strengthen the democratic institutions of the Republic of Korea in the idea that this method of punishment should be abolished for good."
"Since the Republic of South Korea acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1990, and is a signatory to most of the major human rights treaties, moving backwards would be very harmful to its international reputation."
"author. - Mr President, the European Union in general, and this Parliament in particular, has a very proud record - an honourable tradition - of opposing the death penalty."
"Therefore we can do nothing other than regret the decision of the Republic of Korea's Constitutional Court that the death penalty is not a violation of that country's Constitution."
"However, I believe we have to keep the issue in proportion."
"The justices ruled by a narrow margin of five votes to four."
"The last time they voted it was seven votes to two."
"They did not urge or condone the use of the death penalty but called for a political decision for the Korean Parliament to decide on the future abolition of the death penalty in that country."
"We also have to note that South Korea is de facto an abolitionist country."
"No executions have been carried out since February 1998 and, in 2007, Amnesty International categorised South Korea as a country that has virtually abolished capital punishment."
"However, the seriousness of this issue comes back to the fore when we realise that the floor leader of the Grand National Party in Korea said just recently that this de facto moratorium on capital punishment should be ended and a swift execution should take place of certain prisoners."
"I hope this unfortunate opportunistic voice in Korea will be ignored and that South Korea will indeed move away from being a de facto moratorium country by changing its law and becoming a de jure moratorium country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of States around the world still, in this day and age, conduct or permit this inhumane kind of punishment for serious criminals."
"I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person, be it at the beginning or the end of that life, and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act."
"This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world."
"The unforgettable, great Pope John Paul II pointed out that, above all, atonement, the chance for reconciliation, must be possible."
"With an irreversible act such as the death penalty, that is not possible."
"That is why, as parliamentary groups, we are joining forces to call on our colleagues in South Korea to take up this subject in their parliament and to join with us Europeans to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty, as a mark of humanity."
"I would like to call on all Members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously."
"Mr President, at the Fourth World Congress Against the Death Penalty, held at the end of February in Geneva, the abolitionist movement welcomed the growing number of countries that have abolished or suspended the death penalty."
"South Korea seemed to have committed itself along those lines, since no executions have been carried out there since December 1997."
"The recent decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Korea cannot but worry us; we cannot but regret it."
"We therefore want the Commission and the Council to regard the abolition of the death penalty - a violation of the right to life and a crime of state - as a key element in the European Union's relations with third countries."
"We want them to call on the Korean Government and the President of the Republic, himself sentenced to death in 1981, to make a firm commitment to abolish the death penalty; to decide on a moratorium, pursuant to the UN decision; to voice their concern at the situation of the 59 people, including certain political prisoners, who have been sentenced to death in that country; and to call for their death sentence to be commuted."
"Mr President, the policy of abolishing the death penalty is a very successful part of European foreign policy."
"This can be seen in accession negotiations, in bilateral talks and also in the United Nations, where more and more States within the world community are deciding to come out in favour of a moratorium or to abolish the death penalty completely."
"Until recently, the Republic of South Korea was one of those States that, in practice, no longer applied this degrading and demeaning punishment."
"Today's resolution is an expression of our concern that, with the decision of the South Korean Constitutional Court that executions are legally compatible with the constitution, a situation has now been brought about that truly facilitates the renewed use of the death penalty."
"We are therefore calling for the government of South Korea to do everything in its power, as an initial step, to adopt a legally binding moratorium that prohibits executions from taking place - there are, after all, over 55 people on death row - at which point, as a second step, the South Korea parliament should pass a law to abolish the death penalty."
"It is very positive to see that within South Korean society, too, a movement has come about that is campaigning, ultimately, for the advent of a law to abolish the death penalty."
"We in this House should support that movement."
"Mr President, at a time when the number of countries which are giving up use of the death sentence is growing, the decision of the Constitutional Court of South Korea should be received at least with surprise."
"The death penalty is a clear violation of human rights, because, after all, human life is a value which the law should protect, and a legal system which allows capital punishment strikes at its own foundations and is a peculiar kind of hypocrisy."
"Many arguments exist against the use of this means of administering justice."
"For me, the most important is its irreversibility."
"Whatever else might be said about it, capital punishment is a penalty which is final."
"It deprives people of that one most precious thing which they will ever possess."
"Besides, there remains the moral responsibility on those who carry out this act, because the risk always exists of executing an innocent person."
"Furthermore, the decision of the Constitutional Court is disappointing, because we know that no executions have been carried out in Korea for years. I hope this decision will not affect the number of sentences passed."
"What is more, I call for the handing down of death sentences in South Korea to be ended completely."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PL) South Korea is one of the European Union's key trade partners."
"It is also a country with which the European Commission has completed negotiations on a free trade agreement, giving both sides very broad access to the other's market."
"In view of such close economic relations, I am surprised that the EU and Korea differ so greatly when it comes to respect for human rights."
"All Member States of the European Union are signatories to Protocol 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which bans the use of the death penalty."
"What is more, the Union declares in the international arena that it has set itself the objective of working for universal abolition of the death penalty."
"In accordance with that declaration, the Union should express clear support for the movement in Korea which is working for the abolition of capital punishment."
"Let us hope that, first of all, a moratorium will be introduced on carrying out executions, and that the Korean Government will become actively involved in efforts to abolish the death penalty which are being made at the UN."
"Under new powers in the area of trade policy, we have the right and the obligation, as the European Parliament, to demand the abolition of capital punishment in all of the European Union's partner countries."
"Mr President, if today's views on capital punishment had been in force in Europe at the time of the Nuremberg Tribunal, none of the Nazi criminals who were tried by the tribunal, and who were responsible for the cruel deaths of millions of innocent people, would have been sentenced to death."
"I have not heard that anyone in Europe has criticised the Nuremberg Tribunal for its unjust judgments."
"Europe is moving ever further away from the essence of a just punishment as a response proportionate to the wrong done by the perpetrator and the guilt incurred."
"When we talk about the murder, the killing, of many people, for example in an act of terrorism, or when we talk about genocide and the deaths of millions of people, and this is what has happened, after all, in Europe, then the question arises as to a proportional punishment."
"It is true that in academic circles, in Europe and elsewhere, a debate is, nevertheless, in progress on the effectiveness of this punishment in terms of its preventative action and the protection of innocent human beings."
"This, however, is probably not the key argument, here."
"Europe has, today, abandoned the death sentence."
"This is a democratic choice, and we want this choice to be respected."
"However, we should also respect the choice of others, and this is why I am in favour of discussion on this subject, including discussion with people in South Korea."
"It is a democratic state, and a democratic country."
"(PL) I do not think we should comment on this matter, or that we should interfere, here, for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, because South Korea is a democratic country, and the ruling of the Constitutional Court is a ruling of a lawful body of that state."
"For this reason, there is no danger that the death penalty will be passed in political or trivial cases - it will be handed down to criminals and murderers."
"Secondly, capital punishment is a deterrent."
"It is not possible, of course, to prove this empirically, but if we assume the truth of the syllogism that a more serious punishment is a stronger deterrent, this means that the most severe punishment deters more, and this means that the death sentence deters most of all."
"This being so, by applying the death penalty we are, in fact, saving the lives of innocent people."
"Therefore, the European Union and the European Parliament should not interfere in this matter with the South Korean authorities."
"(PL) Mr President, the decision of the Constitutional Court of South Korea that the death penalty is not a violation of the Constitution must be received with sadness."
"That decision is a step backwards in comparison to the trend in South Korea, where the death sentence has not been applied for a decade."
"The last execution was carried out 13 years ago."
"There are currently 57 convicts on death row awaiting execution."
"A critical view should be taken of the South Korean court's ruling."
"South Korea, as an economic leader in the region, should in particular set an example on the matter of respecting the right to life of every individual."
"Capital punishment is not compatible with a contemporary system of criminal justice, and contrary to current opinion it does not lead to a drop in crime at all."
"- (SK) The death penalty is an issue that will live as long as monsters and murderers, living with the knowledge that they can torture, abuse and murder people, remain hidden within the human society, because a weak and impotent society is unable to cope with their brutal behaviour."
"Each of the victims of these monsters had the same right to life as all of us, until the moment when they crossed paths with such a monster, a criminal who condemned a person, in order to satisfy a perverse pleasure, to his or her fate without any right to mercy or defence."
"The Constitutional Court of Korea has delivered an opinion that the death penalty does not conflict with the Korean Constitution."
"Legal status has been thus practically evaluated."
"That the political elites in Europe, in our name, have abandoned this path does not mean, however, that we have become better people or that our society is more humane."
"No."
"The horrible, brutal monsters' killing of decent people in Europe, just like in Korea, did not stop."
"The only difference is that the European monsters do not have to worry about capital punishment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I respect our model based on the European Convention on Human Rights, but I believe that before we impose it on the outside world we should make sure that there really is a better solution for decent people, and that..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) I would like to say that the decision of the Constitutional Court of South Korea is disappointing and disturbing."
"Despite the fact that the last executions in South Korea took place in 1997, the court decided on 25 February that the death sentence is a form of punishment which does not violate the constitutional right to life."
"This is now the second ruling of the court with the same content."
"The first ruling was given in 1996, when the court stated that public opinion was not in favour of abolishing the death penalty."
"One can, therefore, conclude that public opinion in South Korea remains the same, and this is a pity, because a country which is an economic leader should be an example to other countries in respecting the right to life, which is a fundamental human right."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the fight against the death penalty lies at the heart of the EU's human rights policy."
"The EU considers that capital punishment is a cruel and inhuman punishment which fails to deter criminal behaviour, while the abolition of capital punishment contributes to the enhancement of human dignity."
"We have been able to welcome a number of recent positive developments in the fight against the death penalty."
"In January this year, Mongolia announced a moratorium on the death penalty."
"During 2009 Burundi, Togo and the US State of New Mexico all abolished the death penalty."
"In 2007 the UN General Assembly for the first time adopted a resolution calling on states to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty; a further resolution in 2008 reaffirmed this call."
"In this light, the EU was naturally disappointed at the judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Korea on 25 February - by a split vote of five to four - that the death penalty was in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution."
"We note, however, that this case revolved around the interpretation of the Korean Constitution; this was not a political decision on retention of the death penalty."
"We also particularly note the further views expressed by three of the five judges who found that the death penalty was in line with the Constitution."
"Judge Lee Kang-Kook and Judge Min Hyung-Ki made clear the need to limit the use of the death penalty and to reduce the number of crimes subject to capital punishment, while Judge Song Doo-hwan argued that any decision on the death penalty should be the subject of a public debate and action by the legislature."
"Although the courts continue to pass death sentences, the Republic of Korea has maintained a moratorium on executions since 1997."
"There is no indication at present that the judgment of the Constitutional Court will affect this moratorium."
"We welcome Korea's determination to maintain the moratorium on the implementation of executions."
"At the same time, as the UN General Assembly resolution has noted, a moratorium should be seen not as an end in itself but as a step on the path towards complete abolition."
"Accordingly, the EU urges the Korean National Assembly to take steps as quickly as possible to abolish the death penalty."
"The Republic of Korea has long been a regional leader on human rights issues in Asia."
"Abolition of the death penalty would thus only confirm the Republic of Korea's commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Congratulations to the South Korean Constitutional Court for upholding the death penalty."
"They intend to retain the death penalty for the worst criminal offenders."
"For example, for a Mr Kang Ho-soon, who has reportedly confessed to killing seven women."
"The Justice Ministry has recently released figures that show more than 60% support for the death penalty."
"If a similar question were asked in Britain it would produce at least the same result."
"In British prisons we have various assorted serial killers, rapists, child-murdering paedophiles, necrophiles and cannibals serving life sentences."
"The last example just last week was that of pervert Peter Chapman who lured an innocent 17-year-old victim, Ashleigh Hall, to her death and was sentenced to 35 years."
"This is an inadequate sentence."
"He and his kind should be executed."
"This would also save millions of pounds every year currently wasted on keeping such criminals in prison for life that could be better spent on the old and the sick."
"So well done South Korea: go on executing your worst criminals."
"in writing. - 'Every person shall have the right to life."
"If not, the killer unwittingly achieves a final and perverse moral victory by making the state a killer too, thus reducing social abhorrence at the conscious extinction of human beings' (Amnesty International, 1998)."
"Morality, deterrence and fairness are key in the debate on the death penalty."
"The 'crime control' approach seeks repression of criminal conduct, while the 'human rights/due process' model emphasises individual rights."
"The former considers the death penalty moral because the defendant took a life (retribution), a deterrent because those who might kill refrain from doing so fearing for their life, while fairness is unimportant or unproven."
"The latter model claims that death penalty is immoral because the state should not take a life, is not a deterrent - as shown by statistics - and is unfairly administered, sometimes people on death row being innocent and their trials involving irregularities."
"I believe in the human rights model, as reflected by the international community in hard and soft law, and by the increasing number of countries abolishing the death penalty."
"I urge the Republic of Korea to show a clear political will abolishing the death penalty, and, until then, to immediately adopt a moratorium on its application."
"EU guidelines on the death penalty date from 1998."
"This is the very year when the period of the unofficial moratorium on the death penalty started in South Korea."
"During this time, the South Korean Parliament has debated three proposals on abolishing the death penalty."
"Last month, the Constitutional Court in this country reaffirmed by a narrow majority the death penalty as being constitutional."
"I deplore this decision and I hope that the Korean Parliament will introduce a resolution banning the death penalty."
"If South Korea joined the ranks of the abolitionist countries, this would send a powerful signal to the whole Asian continent."

"The final draft agenda drawn up on 11 March 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"By agreement with the political groups, I would like to propose the following changes:"
"(IT) I just wanted to inform the President - as I have already done by letter - that the extraordinary committee on the financial crisis has wrongfully excluded the expert, the renowned demographer Professor Bourcier de Carbon, for no reason, describing him as an unsuitable person."
"I think that we are dealing with an extremely serious case of someone being excluded on ideological grounds from the position of expert in one of the European Parliament's committees ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Borghezio, this is not a point of order, since we are talking about a plenary sitting."
"Please raise such issues during Committee meetings, when this matter can be considered, but in a plenary sitting, points of order have to be about our work in plenary, and not about work in the Committees."
"Mr President, on 11 March, at the debate on Arctic policy, with a quarter of my allocated time still left, my microphone was switched off by the ALDE/Liberal Democrat Member in the Chair."
"This is almost without precedent."
"Mr President, I have already sent you a letter - to which I have not received an answer - and I would like to ask you under which rule the microphone was switched off and why it was relevant to apply this rule."
"I was simply making legitimate - and indeed valid - political comments with which the ALDE Chair disagreed."
"This is why the microphone was switched off."
"If the European Parliament censors political comment, it ceases to be a Parliament."
"The Vice-President of Parliament who was leading the proceedings at the time correctly applied the procedure related to Rule 20(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I will reply in writing to the letter you sent me."
"Thursday"
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has requested postponement to the next session of the vote on the motion for a resolution by the Conference of Presidents on transition to the Treaty of Lisbon for pending interinstitutional legislative procedures."
"So this is about postponement of the vote."
"Mr President, we have asked for the postponement of the vote on this motion, in the interests of the House."
"We had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order."
"However, it was a quick procedure, and we have learned in the meantime that not all of the committees had been properly consulted on this issue."
"It is a motion by the PPE Group, but some of the committees want more time on this very important and complicated matter, however urgent it may be."
"We therefore ask for the vote on this issue to be postponed."
"Welcome"
"I have some special information for you."
"I would like to extend a warm welcome to the delegation from the Pan-African Parliament, led by its Vice-President, Mrs Mugyenyi."
"They are with us at our sitting."
"Please welcome them."
"(Applause)"
"The second Vice-President of the Pan-African Parliament and Chair of the Delegation for relations with the European Parliament."
"Our Parliaments work closely together, and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the invitation for me to address the sitting of the Pan-African Parliament which will be held in three weeks' time."
"Unfortunately, I will not be able to be there, but I will send you a letter on that occasion."
"I am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again."
"Once again, I warmly welcome you all."
"Preparation for the European Council meeting (25-26 March 2010) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting (25-26 March 2010)."
"Mr President, we are, in these first few months of 2010, witnessing an extraordinarily strong dynamic in the European Union, in the midst of the most serious economic crisis we have known for eighty years."
"At the same time, we are implementing a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, getting new institutions off the ground, and carrying out a very broad reordering of the regulation of our economic systems."
"This is happening in a sometimes disorderly fashion, responding to big challenges as we go; currently, for example, the situation of the Greek financial system."
"However, Europe is meeting this situation by creating new economic policy tools in all areas."
"Sometimes, therefore, one cannot see the wood for the trees, but an entirely new way of tackling the extremely complex economy of the 21st century is being created and it is being done through a European approach."
"It was done in this way when responding to the very serious crisis and there was an immediate reaction in terms of injecting public money into Europe's economies, which led to large deficits."
"It was done in this way by undertaking - and we are here in Parliament to approve it - a complete reform of the supervision of the financial system."
"It is being done in this way, by coordinating economic policies."
"The Commission has indicated that it will submit a proposal to this effect, for the coordination of economic policies, essentially within the euro area."
"Furthermore, we are also, specifically, experiencing very determined and clear action by the European Union to support financial stability in the euro area."
"This political commitment was adopted on 11 February in order to consolidate and sustain the financial stability of the euro area."
"There is another initiative that is undoubtedly part of that set: the commitment to a new strategy for growth and the creation of high quality jobs."
"This is the main topic of work for the European Council this weekend; a strategy which was articulated and expanded upon by the European Commission in the document of 3 March and which will essentially be studied by the Heads of State or Government in the spring Council, basically from the viewpoint of the so-called 'strategic objectives'."
"These are the strategic objectives that the European Commission stated in its document, such as the issues of employment, investment in research and development, climate change and energy, leaving school early, education in general and poverty."
"In addition, the European Council will also tackle the issue of governance, which we consider one of the inadequacies of the so-called Lisbon Strategy."
"The Council wants this governance to revolve around its own political leadership and the action of the Commission in supervising the Member States' fulfilment of the commitments they have adopted."
"This will be, of course, with the close collaboration and monitoring of everything by Parliament and, of course, the Union's institutions as a whole."
"That will basically be the aim of the European Council's meetings this weekend, including the equally important area of the fight against climate change, in which the EU continues to be a leader."
"The European Union retains its world leadership in the fight against climate change; it must do so, it must continue holding onto this leadership."
"There is, moreover, a quantified commitment to the so-called 'fast start'."
"Let us hope, therefore, that the European Council will quantify and reaffirm that commitment to help developing countries combat climate change over these next few years as well."
"A commitment by developed countries generally to collaborate with those that are still not developed so that we all arrive at the very important Cancún conference in the best possible condition."
"At this conference, the European Union must - I repeat - hold on to the leadership it has now, without which the Copenhagen Accords, which we feel are inadequate, would surely not have been reached."
"The Member States have unanimously reaffirmed their full agreement with these objectives and that they want to move unequivocally towards legally binding commitments at the Cancún conference in Mexico."
"The Heads of State or Government will largely be dealing with those matters."
"It is also possible - depending on what happens right now, while the European institutions as a whole are sorting out how to cope with the crisis relating to the so-called Greek case - that they will deal with the issue of the financial situation in Greece and the refinancing of the country's public debt."
"That issue will also arise there, no doubt, because it forms part of a political commitment adopted by the European Union on 11 February at Heads of State or Government level."
"This was a political commitment to support the financial stability of the euro area, in the sense that if it is necessary to adopt specific measures to maintain that financial stability, such measures will be adopted."
"That is, at any event, the principle that will be very much in mind at this weekend's meeting of the European Council."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, it is indeed a very good and timely opportunity for us to meet today - one day before the important Spring European Council."
"We have challenging tasks ahead of us."
"For those tasks, the fresh and forceful backing of the European Parliament is of great importance."
"Having said this, I want to thank and congratulate Parliament for its resolution on Europe 2020, which it adopted in Strasbourg two weeks ago with broad party support."
"I also want to take the opportunity to thank the Spanish Presidency of the Council for its support for the Europe 2020 strategy."
"That support was clearly expressed at different formations of the Council of Ministers."
"But now to the European Council: I believe every European Council must do two things."
"It must show that it is responding to the needs of the moment, and it must work on Europe's long-term strategic framework and long-term strategic objectives."
"The crisis entails several pressing concerns for communities, workers and businesses across Europe."
"And, as we know, public finances at national level are under unprecedented strain."
"The European Union must of course tackle these issues, including financial stability."
"I will come back to this again later."
"Europe must not make the mistake of neglecting the imperative of working now to bring about long-term change."
"That is why the European Council will deal with two of our most obvious long-term challenges: our economic future, and climate change."
"We have already debated the Europe 2020 strategy together in this Parliament."
"Your contribution and your commitment will be indispensable in carrying through our ambitions for smart, sustainable, inclusive growth."
"So, too, will be the contribution of the European Council."
"Our level of ambition must be set by the scale of the tasks ahead."
"We need to show that we have the vision and the coherence to act."
"And we must be able to communicate this, to show people that our actions will make a difference where it matters."
"This is why I believe it is so important that the European Council agrees clear targets this week."
"The targets which the Commission has put on the table were carefully chosen."
"They address the need to increase the level of employment, to invest more in research and innovation, to meet our 2020 climate and energy targets, to improve our educational performance and to combat poverty."
"These five headline targets pinpoint objectives which people can relate to, and show that the European Union is leveraging reform in areas that everybody knows are important."
"This is also about the political will to tackle tough problems."
"Of course, the targets must be achievable."
"They should also require an extra effort compared to the status quo, a recognition by our Member States that change is needed, and I will try to convey to the European Council this sense of urgency for the economic situation of Europe now and for the need of reforms for a more sustainable, more inclusive economy and society in Europe."
"What is really important is the measures which each Member State will take to boost its growth rate and address the shortcomings we all know are there."
"We need national measures to address national problems defined according to national circumstances and in full respect of subsidiarity, but set within a common European framework."
"If there is a lesson from the financial crisis, it is that we are all interdependent in the world."
"So we cannot accept the principles of interdependence globally and reject them when discussed at European level."
"A common framework, too, which is supported and should be stimulated by particular European Union measures, what we call in our document 'flagship initiatives'."
"These flagship proposals will show the European Union level acting in critically important areas such as the digital agenda, innovation, resource efficiency and industrial policy - and, of course, in some cases, will also help targets to be achieved at a national level."
"What we are proposing here is a new departure."
"Thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, we can go for a new approach to economic coordination, a reinforced economic governance of Europe - one which gives the freedom necessary to target at the national level, but which brings a strong European dimension, and using all the instruments at European level to kick-start the economy."
"Accepting this approach will be the real test for the European Council."
"I am encouraged by the results of the informal European Council."
"I hope that the European leaders will be present and say 'yes' when it comes to responding to these challenges in a collective spirit."
"Regarding climate change, I know that this Parliament shares my conviction that climate change is not a subject that can be put on the back burner."
"We need to keep this top of our agenda."
"The European Union has been in the lead, and we still are - we alone have the reduction commitments clearly backed up with the mechanisms to deliver; we are the number one donors of aid to developing countries on climate issues."
"So let us move on from soul-searching about Copenhagen and take the initiative once again."
"We need a clear, unified and ambitious position."
"That is why the Commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations."
"At the same time, Commissioner Hedegaard has started a set of consultations with our key partners."
"So we should make a serious effort to advance at Cancún - building on the very real substance of the Copenhagen Accord."
"We should keep Kyoto on the agenda, but make clear that it can only be assessed in the light of a global agreement and not before."
"We should step up outreach activities and build trust, most obviously with developing countries - which is why respecting our pledges on fast-start finance is so important."
"And of course, at the same time, we will continue to implement our 20-20-20 package, showing, in particular, how it is compatible with the work of economic modernisation and reform set out in the 2020 strategy."
"These two areas show vividly how Europeans are looking to the European Union's political leadership for action."
"I am convinced that, if we have the will to be bold, we can show Europe as the decisive influence in building the right future for our citizens."
"It is in the same spirit that I will present to the European Council some of the major challenges for the G20 that will take place in June in Canada."
"In fact, we should never forget that some of those issues are European but they should also be addressed at global level."
"Financial stability and the economic and financial situation in Greece are not on the formal agenda of this European Council."
"However, frankly speaking, I cannot see how it is possible for Heads of State or Government, notably those in the euro area, not to discuss this issue."
"Let me therefore state our position on this."
"Greece is currently in the process of correcting its excessive government deficit."
"Bringing the deficit down vigorously is crucial and Greece has been taking measures to that effect."
"In particular, Greece is taking measures leading to a reduction of its deficit this year by 4% of GDP."
"Such fiscal effort is in line with the course of action recommended by the Commission and the Council, as acknowledged by the Council on 16 March."
"Naturally, Greece's fiscal effort must be continued; it is the only way to secure a lasting reduction in the cost of debt financing."
"In response to the economic and financial situation in Greece, the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 11 February stated that, and I quote, 'euro area Member States will take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole'."
"The Commission believes it is now appropriate to create, within the euro area, an instrument for coordinated action which could be used to provide assistance to Greece in case of need."
"It should be clear that the creation of such a mechanism will not imply its automatic activation."
"Creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity."
"Solidarity is a two-way street."
"Greece is making an economic effort at this point and by supporting this effort, we not only help Greece, but the stability of the eurozone as a whole."
"The framework for coordinated action should be understood as a safety net to be used only when all other means to avoid a crisis have been exhausted, including, first and foremost, exhausting the scope for policy action at domestic level."
"Beyond technical aspects, any possible solution must reinforce and strengthen the unity and the coherence of the eurozone and its governance."
"The world economy needs stability."
"The eurozone is a pole of stability, and it is important that its capacity to provide stability is further enhanced."
"We may need to resort to intergovernmental instruments for some issues, but they need to be embedded into a joint European framework."
"It is my firm conviction that the response to the specific challenges will also be a test to European leaders and to their commitment to the European - and monetary - Union."
"What is at stake is the essential principle of financial stability that is central to the euro; and the euro is one of the most important creations of the European project and the European construction process so far."
"I hope this issue will be solved in a spirit of responsibility and solidarity."
"That is the European way to do it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr López Garrido, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) expects the European Council to reaffirm European solidarity unequivocally while, at the same time, making everyone face up to his or her responsibilities."
"The PPE Group also expects the Heads of State or Government to define their roadmap so as to bring Europe out of the crisis."
"To what extent are they willing to cooperate, and what are the lines they are unwilling to cross?"
"Do they believe that the recovery of growth and employment depends on true common action, with the resources that that requires, or do they prefer to act on their own as regards innovation, education, training, support for SMEs, and the fight against unemployment and poverty, with all too familiar consequences?"
"I would remind you that our Member States all subscribed, in 2000, to the priorities of the Lisbon Strategy."
"However, because they did not equip themselves with the resources, because they did not take the objectives seriously, we are now many years behind, and everything that we said would happen has happened, but outside Europe."
"My group therefore expects the European Council to go beyond words and to give serious consideration to our common economic objectives on the basis of the Commission's 2020 proposals, an amended version of which Parliament will propose in June."
"I come back to solidarity, solidarity of which a great deal has been said for some weeks now and which is actually the be-all and end-all of European integration, from the creation of the single market to common defence, via the euro."
"This solidarity has been shown since the start of the financial crisis and it must not be denied our Greek friends, or any other EU country that encounters the same difficulties."
"This week, it is imperative that a European solution is found to this crisis, and it must be a Community-based solution - I repeat, a Community-based solution - which must be envisaged in accordance with European rules and within the framework of European financial aid mechanisms."
"Moreover, if we wish, we can even include the International Monetary Fund in this framework, but always in accordance with European rules."
"It is in everyone's interests that we guarantee the stability of Europe and of the European Monetary System."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on the reverse side of Europe there is solidarity, and, on the front side, responsibility."
"This responsibility is that of each Member State to guarantee accurate and reliable public accounts."
"It is also that of the citizens of States that are facing temporary payment problems to make sacrifices, to participate in the collective effort to get public finances back on track and to accept the reforms that are necessary to achieve this, however harsh they may be."
"In other words, yes, Europe must show solidarity with Greece."
"It must ensure that Greece comes through this difficult period."
"However, Greece, too, must carry out those internal reforms that are required in the short and medium terms and in order to warrant this solidarity, and it proposed them to Parliament yesterday in fact."
"It now remains for Greece to implement them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis is forcing us to change."
"The first change concerns the Commission, which I call on to exercise fully and, above all, authoritatively, its role as guardian of the treaties."
"The criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied, and the Commission must ensure this."
"This House will support it in this difficult task."
"The second change concerns the governance of our public finances."
"In a period of growth, it is generally felt that one has the right to conduct one's own budgetary, fiscal and social policy without really worrying about anyone else."
"However, in a period of crisis, those who have spent the most call for solidarity from those who have been, let us say, more sensible."
"Can this continue?"
"I do not think so."
"It is time for the Member States to coordinate their budgetary, fiscal and social policies better, and let us not be afraid to say it: we want more European governance!"
"Such coordination will only make implementing solidarity-based principles easier, fairer and more natural."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I invite you to take initiatives along these lines."
"As you know, I have a certain amount of experience: it is always in times of crisis that the machine is given a boost."
"We are in the midst of a real crisis as far as our citizens and the situation on the ground are concerned, and we need political courage."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the European summit must and will deal with the crisis in Greece; that much is obvious."
"The International Herald Tribune writes something interesting in its leading article today: 'Greece has promised to do its homework and to balance its budget'."
"The Member States belonging to the euro area made their solidarity conditional upon Greece's compliance with their demands in this respect."
"Greece has delivered, writes the International Herald Tribune."
"It is the Member States of the euro area that have not delivered - and particularly the Federal Republic of Germany, which is refusing to keep its promise."
"That is the first point."
"(Applause)"
"The President of the Commission has quite rightly spoken of a safety net."
"It is not about transferring money from taxpayers in Germany, France, Italy or any other country into Greece's coffers."
"That is not the objective."
"It is about enabling Greece to borrow money on the international markets at the same interest rates as are available to the other countries."
"Interest rates are usually 2.5 to 3%."
"As a result of the speculation caused by the failure to demonstrate solidarity with Greece, that country is paying 6%."
"To put it plainly, Greece's attempts to balance its budget are lining the pockets of speculators on the international financial markets."
"(Applause)"
"This means the people there are being robbed."
"It is foolish, because if this sets a precedent - if the failure to demonstrate solidarity enables people to speculate against a euro area country that is in deficit to the extent that eventually, internal solidarity is unsustainable and the International Monetary Fund has to step in, then Greece will be merely a prologue."
"The speculators will then turn their attention to Italy, to the UK and to Spain."
"If we do not want to see a large-scale conflagration, we need now to demonstrate solidarity with Greece."
"Solidarity with Greece - and this is a message that we need to get through to the German Chancellor in particular - therefore makes economic sense."
"It is not a matter of giving aid for the sake of it."
"(Applause)"
"Consequently, we cannot release Mr Barroso from this obligation by saying the International Monetary Fund should now sort it out."
"It is the Commission that must propose how we can achieve a sensible stabilisation within the euro area."
"The Commission has made good proposals and I believe that the Council should go along with them."
"These do not include calling on the International Monetary Fund."
"Why not?"
"We are in a position to resolve the problem within the euro area ourselves."
"Moreover, I am astonished that Chancellor Merkel is bringing the International Monetary Fund into play."
"The German Bundesbank - which to German conservatives is as the Vatican is to Catholics - writes in its monthly report for March: 'However, financial contributions from the International Monetary Fund to resolve structural problems - such as to directly finance a budget deficit or to finance a bank recapitalisation - are incompatible with its monetary mandate'."
"That is a quote from the German Bundesbank."
"Contrary to the statements of her Minister for Finance, the German Chancellor says that the International Monetary Fund should solve the problem."
"That is not the right way to go."
"What we need now is to send a signal to the international markets: you can speculate all you like, but you will not drive the euro area apart."
"To make it clear what kind of speculation we are talking about, we need to draw attention once again to Credit Default Swaps, or CDSs."
"This is nothing more than a game: I will insure myself against my neighbour's house burning down."
"Should my neighbour's house burn down, I get the insurance money."
"If I were to do that, then I would have a vested interest in seeing his house burn down."
"We cannot apply the Florian principle - 'Holy Saint Florian, spare my house, burn the others' - in the European Union."
"That is why solidarity with Greece is an act to stabilise the euro in the euro area."
"In the end, you have to decide whether you want to have European solidarity or whether you want to give in to armchair politics."
"I do not want to make it my own, but I would urge you all to listen carefully to the following quote from Wolfgang Münchau in the Financial Times Deutschland - which is not a Socialist journal, and this man is not a Social Democrat: 'In a situation in which European necessities come up against German populism, let us choose European necessities'."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I believe that the conclusion that all of us - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Greens, Socialists, Liberals and all the other groups, except the Euro-sceptic groups, which are perhaps pleased with what is happening right now in Europe - can draw is that greater clarity is required within the European Council."
"The battle has been raging for weeks now outside the European institutions on the question of what should be done to help Greece and the euro area."
"We have never seen this before: for weeks now, instead of decisions being taken, there has been quarrelling over the measures that should be taken, and anything and everything is being said."
"I shall go further, Mr President."
"I have a feeling that, in four days, certain Members of the Council have done more damage to the European project than all the Euro-sceptics put together have done in four years."
"That is my feeling today."
"(Applause)"
"The only way to change and to stop that is to take a firm decision on the basis of a Commission proposal."
"I am pleased that Mr Barroso has announced today that he is going to propose a solution to the Council, a solution - and I echo what Mr Daul said - which must be European and Community-based, and which is not about requesting what has already been requested for months now, namely that money be taken from taxpayers' pockets and given to Greece."
"It is not about that."
"It is, in fact, about the need to have a European instrument that will enable the interest rates on Greece's government bonds to be reduced."
"The best way of doing this is not to make just one country - Greece - issue these government bonds, but to issue them at European level, since Europe has liquidity and credibility."
"There are two elements that count in terms of knowing what the interest rate is: liquidity and credibility."
"Europe has the necessary credibility and liquidity, and it is on this basis that it will be possible to bring down Greece's interest rates without a single euro of taxpayers' money going to Greece."
"That is absolutely necessary, Mr President, because today the spread - that is the gap between the German rate, which today stands at 3.05%, and the Greek rate, which is 6.5% at present - is 350 basis points."
"The only way of resolving that is really to take the necessary step of introducing this European instrument."
"A second reason to explain this requirement is that the efforts that the Greeks are going to make - must make, are obliged to make - must serve a purpose."
"For, if a European solution is not chosen, if these interest rates cannot be reduced, all the efforts that the Greeks are going to make will ultimately go to the capital markets."
"That is what will happen if a firm decision is not taken during this Council."
"The Greeks are going to make efforts, are going to make savings, and who is going to benefit?"
"The speculators, the capital markets and so on, as they are going to have much higher interest rates."
"(Applause)"
"That is why Europe must intervene."
"Europe must intervene to ensure that Greece's consolidation measures are worthwhile."
"They are necessary, but they must also be worthwhile."
"That is why we support, and why the whole of Parliament must now support, the proposal that the Commission is going to make, and we must hope that the Members of the Council will keep quiet and approve."
"That is what we must hope for."
"Mr President, I would like to remind everyone briefly once again of how quickly - sometimes practically overnight - we decided to bail out Europe's banks when they were in trouble."
"Yet it is only now that we are debating the terms on which this assistance is being granted."
"We still have not clarified the terms of the repayments and responsibilities, nor have we set out how the banks will be supervised."
"Bearing this in mind, I must also point out that this Greek crisis - this crisis facing the euro - is actually a European crisis and that discussions have been going on for weeks and months without Europeans being able to garner themselves to make the necessary decisions; as far as I am concerned, it is simply shameful."
"As a German MEP - I hope you are listening, Mr Langen - I am ashamed of my national government."
"We read today that a special summit is taking place in Brussels at which decisions will be made on Greece according to Chancellor Merkel's will - what she wants and what will enable her to return to Berlin from Brussels as the victor - without actually discussing satisfactory solutions with the others."
"I think it is disgraceful."
"It means that the tabloids and armchair politics have won, and I believe we should think very carefully - you too, Mr Langen, in your German delegation - as to whether the 'to be or not to be' of solidarity in the European Union should hinge on the results of opinion polls currently being obtained by a German party of which the German Chancellor is a member relating to the prospects of electoral success in a Federal German state."
"I think it smacks far too much of populism, and it is intolerable that it has not yet been established that the Heads of State or Government will agree during the regular Thursday and Friday Council sessions on how the euro area is to deal with the crisis in Greece."
"(Applause)"
"I have been following the discussions in Germany carefully and last week I was also in Greece, and I would like to make it clear once more to the citizens of my own country, of Greece and of the EU, that this is a time for solidarity; but that henceforth, Greece will only be able to obtain credit on favourable terms if this is not a one-way street."
"The days I spent in Greece showed me that the people of Greece now have an opportunity to create a better state."
"The state of Greece must utilise the crisis to bring about real reforms."
"We will be doing no one any favours if we now show solidarity without calling on Mr Papandreou to make even more far-reaching reforms than have been announced to date."
"As I have said, the Greek people deserve much better."
"Since I find this populism so prevalent in Germany and because I consider it so dangerous, I would also like to argue this from another perspective: in our analysis, the continued existence of the euro - of a single currency - in the long term can only be secured if Europeans pull together and integrate their economic policy."
"Otherwise, competition for so-called hard interests will, in cases of doubt, always lead us into the difficulties that we are currently facing."
"We will then have a lot to do, and once again things will turn bitter, Mr Langen."
"We need to explain the necessity of integration to our citizens."
"We have made as heavy weather of this as when discussing the constitution."
"We are so pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon is finally in force, yet when faced with our first challenge after Lisbon, we let the tabloid press and armchair politics win out over reason."
"Chancellor Merkel would be well advised - and that means also by you, my fellow Germans in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - to apply the brakes."
"The necessity of integrating economic policy is what needs to be discussed henceforth."
"We must be led by transparency, reason and arguments that we can put to our citizens, not by the tabloid press such as BILD-Zeitung."
"Otherwise, as Mr Münchau wrote today, before long, Chancellor Merkel will be returning defeated from Brussels."
"Then BILD-Zeitung will write: the euro must be abolished - we must bring back the Deutsche mark."
"What will we do then?"
"It is not yet too late."
"Germany is in a decisive position."
"I hope that Mr Sarkozy will not give in and is instead more sensible than Chancellor Merkel."
"Mr President, it is not without reason that we are talking in this Chamber, today, about Greece, despite the fact that, unfortunately, Greece is not on the agenda for the meeting."
"I would like, in this Chamber, to express approval for the Greek Government."
"It is a government which, today, is facing protests on its streets."
"It may be that the protests are coming from the government's own socialist electorate, but it is a government which, in the name of a rational economy and European solidarity, is taking tough decisions, and is not bowing to populism."
"I regret to have to say that not all European leaders, today, are able to resist bowing to this kind of populism."
"It seems to me that Greece does need our solidarity, because Europe is built on the principle of solidarity, but, of course, we must not allow any politician in any country to treat economic policy like going shopping with a credit card with no limit, because things will end up as they have done in Greece."
"In future, we should very firmly set conditions for Member States, to ensure they follow a rational economic policy, because a policy which is not based on rational foundations ends up as it has done."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that, today, we are also facing a problem which is seen so often in Europe, namely that ideology and politics are more important than the economy."
"This, unfortunately, is how it ends, and we had an example of this with the introduction of the euro."
"We can say, today, that Greece probably adopted the euro too early, but because politics was put before the economy, we have the crisis which we have today."
"I would like to say that I hope the European Commission, under Mr Barroso's leadership, will be the guardian of European solidarity and European economic sense, because we need that sense and solidarity."
"I would also like to point out that, in response to the crisis in which we find ourselves, we should not look for medicines which will only make the situation worse."
"I do not think that greater bureaucracy, integration and regulation in Europe could help what is, and should be, our greatest objective - increasing competitiveness."
"We should not count on officials being able to decide about how to make our continent better, instead of allowing a free economy to do this."
"We should also respect the differences in economic and social policy which divide European countries and which result from their different history, culture and other factors."
"We can, and we should, appeal for European solidarity for Greece, and I hope that I will hear, in this Chamber, expressions of approval for the Greek Government."
"Mr President, it is rare for me to agree with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission."
"However, when they both call for solidarity with Greece and warn of renationalisation, then I can only agree with them, because what they say is correct."
"Moreover, recently in Strasbourg, we heard Mr Barroso thinking aloud as to whether the worst of the speculation on the financial markets should be banned outright."
"The increasing social chasm in the European Union and within the Member States can no longer be overlooked by anyone, yet the pressing issues associated with this are not on the agenda of the Heads of State at their first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda."
"As you are aware, my group is not at all keen on this strategy as it has been drafted by the Commission, because it is based on the failed ideology of competition which led to the crisis."
"We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests."
"EU 2020 is miles away from this."
"It is quite something, however, when individual members of the Federal German Government turn up and thunder against the few binding goals of the EU 2020 strategy, such as for the employment quota, for research and education and for combating poverty - and that in the European Year for Combating Poverty!"
"I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the Heads of Government."
"Mr President, my country, Greece, has many things in common with California."
"We have a wonderful climate, our land is our asset, our forests burned as have the forests in California, they have held Olympic Games, as have we, and we have ended up with the same problems as California."
"I wonder, if California had lending problems, would the central administration of the USA leave it at the mercy of speculators..."
"(The speaker was interrupted by a heckler)"
"It is the economy - yes, it is."
"I realise that."
"That is why I said what I said before."
"(EL)... or would the central administration of the USA resolve its problem?"
"Do we or do we not have a central administration in the European Union?"
"Are we certain that Greece, which accounts for 2% of the European economy, has caused such a massive problem with the euro?"
"Has it sawed through the cohesion of the euro and is it threatening the unity of the Union?"
"It is clear, therefore, that we face a crash test of the strength of the European currency and, more importantly, of the intentions of the leaders of the European Union to defend it."
"If we look back, we can see what we have achieved (30 years ago, I was a young employee at the Ministry of Labour and was trained here, in Brussels, in the single European market)."
"We have achieved the single European market."
"We have achieved the euro."
"I do not think that we have achieved anything else in common."
"That is why you also see me with the euro-sceptics."
"I trust that tomorrow, we shall prove that we really have achieved harmony and something in common."
"(HU) Those who spoke before me all mentioned the solution to the Greek crisis."
"Meanwhile, Mr Barroso, the summit did not even place it on its agenda."
"Do you not see this as a contradiction, as hypocrisy?"
"Because it does not appear on the official agenda."
"Of course, it is not just Greece that found itself in a difficult situation in 2008-2009."
"Hungary was the country that came close to bankruptcy, partly due to the serious errors made by the government."
"An IMF loan was accepted there, a move that has extremely serious consequences for the population."
"We need to face the question of what the lessons of the financial crisis are."
"Is it that everything is connected to everything else?"
"No."
"The true lesson was formulated by Prime Minister George Papandreou, who said that over the past twenty years, the Berlin Wall fell, and Wall Street fell."
"The 'Wall' street fell."
"Yes, this global financial system, which had become disconnected from the economy, is the fundamental reason why countries find themselves in this situation."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are more aware than anyone of how my party wanted to help make the Spanish Presidency a success."
"We want to continue doing so, but for that you need to make some adjustments and you need to get on with leading the Union right away."
"Leading the Union means seeking a solution for Greece."
"Everyone has said so and I am not going to repeat it."
"Leading the Union means approving the Directive on alternative investment fund managers as soon as possible and not delaying it, which is what the Spanish Presidency has done."
"Leading the Union means approving the financial surveillance package as soon as possible, not upholding at all costs a Council agreement that is much more conservative than the Commission's proposal and even more so than the de Larosière report from which it derives."
"Parliament will provide the Spanish Presidency with a supervision agreement that can be summarised in two words: more supervision and more Europe."
"I am sure that the Spanish Government, which has always preached these ideas, will support Parliament and not the other positions that originate from the other side of the Channel."
"Leading the Union means strengthening budgetary discipline, and strengthening budgetary discipline means coming up with new ideas to strengthen the preventive aspect."
"The Spanish Prime Minister knows that the review of the fourteen stability plans that have just been referred to was a purely bureaucratic procedure in the absence of a better idea."
"The preventive arm would have to take into account the competitiveness of the economies - because without wealth, there is no way of balancing the public accounts - and it would have to take the foreign account situation into consideration."
"Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement really appears binding."
"Leading the Union means bringing in a new idea on the issue of governance, on which you have just written in a newspaper."
"The Spanish Prime Minister told us here how he wanted more governance when Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which are the ones to which the Spanish Presidency now refers, are already in force."
"What else does it involve?"
"Tell us what it involves and we will help you."
"In order to help you, however, we need to know what it is you expect and want, because in this House, vague, vacuous and empty ideas get very short shrift."
"Madam President, we feel that the draft Council conclusions that we have all seen leaked this week could spell a very real danger for the European Union."
"The conclusions talk about a timely exit from exceptional support measures."
"What does that mean in practice?"
"We saw from the Ecofin conclusions last week that they want to see a withdrawal of labour market support measures from the end of 2010."
"In December, Council talked about the need for all Member States to return to the Stability Pact criteria by the end of 2013."
"We feel that timetable is hopelessly optimistic."
"If we follow that prescription of a rigid return to the Stability Pact criteria by the end of 2013, it will be a recipe for huge cuts in public spending and public provision, unemployment will rise, tax takes will be reduced, and we will enter a period of sluggish growth that could lead to a real reduction in the economic potential of the European Union for many years to come."
"It is a recipe for disaster."
"What we need instead is a smart balance between responsible fiscal policy on the one hand and continued labour market support on the other."
"We need a sustained social and sustainable exit strategy."
"The Danish Labour Institute has produced figures today."
"They say that, if the emergency exit strategies agreed by 20 Member States with the Commission are followed, an additional 4.5 million European citizens will needlessly be in the unemployment queues by the end of 2013."
"That can be avoided."
"We have to avoid it."
"One of the calls we are making, therefore, is for a two-year moratorium on withdrawal of support measures."
"Incidentally, this week, we are also proposing a new European mechanism for financial stability."
"I hoped President Barroso would still be here because I wanted to say that we would not mind at all if he stole our ideas and presented them as a recommendation to Council tomorrow."
"Madam President, the Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the future of a Europe that is faced with enormous challenges."
"At the present time, we are dealing with a financial crisis, leading to a jobs crisis, in combination with a climate crisis."
"An economic growth based on social and environmental grounds is crucial to kick-start Europe, but I am afraid that the Council and Commission's proposals for governance - however welcome - will be too vague and will not help to achieve the set targets."
"If implemented as it stands, Europe 2020 will be another Lisbon Strategy - a failure."
"Europe should instead dare to attack these challenges head on with bold governance proposals."
"Firstly, the open coordination method is not working and must be abandoned."
"Instead, binding targets should be established and followed up by the Commission, in accordance with the articles available in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Secondly, if funding should be conditional on how well a Member State lives up to its obligations according to the 2020 strategy, we cannot keep spending taxpayers' money on governments that lie and cheat with statistics - solidarity, yes, but based on transparency."
"Thirdly, the Commission should publish its annual reports with policy recommendations in Parliament before they are discussed in Council."
"An open process would create transparency and permit citizen involvement."
"As European politicians, we should always strive to put the citizens at the centre of our policy."
"So let us make that promise a reality and upgrade the Commission's kitten to a tiger - and a tiger with teeth."
"(LV) Thank you, Madam President."
"We must address the question of solidarity not only in the case of Greece, but also in shaping the long-term policies of the European Union, and I say this in the context of the agreement that we expect in the Council on the goals of the 2020 strategy."
"What worries me in the Commission's plan is that there are no accents on economic cohesion in this strategy alongside the accent on social cohesion."
"If we consider this in context with the emphasis on the financial forecast for the period 2014-2020, then in reality, these economic cohesion concepts become significantly weaker in monetary terms."
"In other words, this means that until 2020, the equalisation of economic disparities will be less dynamic."
"Indeed, it could come to pass to the contrary that in 2020, economic disparities in the European Union could be greater than they are in 2010."
"Is that what we wish to see, and is that the true understanding of solidarity within the European Union?"
"I should invite the Council to pay very serious attention to achieving this political agreement, but nevertheless also to stress the goal of economic cohesion. Thank you."
"(EL) Madam President, I think we have dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of Greece."
"I should like to touch on an issue that also concerns other countries."
"Mr Schulz said that interest rates currently stand at 2-3% in Europe."
"I should like to tell you that in Cyprus, the interest rate currently stands at 6%."
"Anything above this level and the banks are on their knees and nothing can change this picture."
"We consider that the Council should also work in this direction in future, so that we do not see other countries getting into the same mess as Greece."
"I should like to make two proposals:"
"We gave billions to the banks in a bid to get the banks rolling."
"Would it not have been better for the state to give this money as the interest rate on a mortgage for a primary residence, given that consumers were going to the bank to pay their instalment?"
"My second proposal is this: could we not have considered imposing a tax on major cross-border transactions between States?"
"I have one thing to say about one-minute speeches, Madam President."
"I am sorry but I wish to say that one minute is not long enough to present a view."
"In the final analysis, it is humiliating to have to resort to slogans."
"I understand that in one minute, you cannot say very much; however, I will now give the floor to Mr Borghezio for another minute."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear for all to see that the euro area is becoming increasingly difficult to govern with every passing day."
"The risk of state bankruptcy has not been eliminated, but despite the weekly meetings and summits of leaders and finance ministers, a clear solution has not yet been put in place."
"I hope that we do not have a mission impossible on our hands."
"The bailout of a Member State may not survive a probable constitutional appeal in Germany."
"These are all points that we should bear in mind and which I do not think have come out during this debate."
"I would, however, like to take the opportunity to mention that through its financial measures, the European Union should place solid, practical emphasis on the effective recovery of the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, which has been abandoned."
"What proportion of the huge sums given to the banks really ends up in the small enterprises sector, in my country - Italy - for example?"
"How much of the Structural Funds?"
"Only between 1-2% is used in the SME sector in some regions, according to bodies representing SMEs."
"These are real problems, affecting the real economy, which Europe should address very seriously and urgently."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to start with some praise for Greece."
"The solution to the Greek crisis must entail tough reform measures in Greece."
"That is the right path to take."
"Everything else that has been proposed here runs counter to the European treaties, and I expect both the President of the Commission and Parliament to abide by the treaties and not to make proposals that run counter to the treaties."
"To Mr Schulz I would say: turning up the volume is no substitute for knowing the facts."
"It is not speculators that have resulted in Greece's problems. It is the internal rules - the fact that the Member States have not been prepared to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Germany and France - not Greece - were the culprits, setting all the other Member States a bad example back in 2003 and 2004."
"Not the others."
"This is not meant as a criticism of Greece, but if we do not change the rules and the Member States are not prepared to abide by their own rules, then the euro area is going to have problems."
"Now it is being asserted that the blame lies with speculators."
"Less than a third of the Greek national debt is secured by Credit Default Swaps."
"Less than one thousandth of global CDS derivatives relate to Greece."
"That is just an excuse."
"For so long as we are unable to implement the rules and stick to them - and the finance ministers are the culprits here - we will repeatedly find ourselves in difficulties."
"That is the key; not reproaching any particular Head of Government who is abiding by the European treaties and her own constitution."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite clear - and it has already been stated, Mr Langen - that Greece must do its own homework."
"From my point of view, however, it has also been stated quite clearly that there must be solidarity."
"Solidarity that helps Greece to accomplish what it has to do."
"Whatever the percentages, speculation may not be responsible for the crisis in Greece, but it is to blame for the huge burden that Greece now has to shoulder beyond what is necessary. That is the crucial thing."
"Also, Mr Langen, the Financial Times - a newspaper that is closer politically to your views than to my own - has put it quite plainly: that is the difference between Chancellor Kohl and Chancellor Merkel."
"Chancellor Merkel takes flight and says: 'Well, what does the treaty say?"
"What do the Court of Justice and the German constitution say?'"
"That is the difference - whether you are politically in favour of the integration of Europe or whether you are always looking back home, or have a foreign minister who says 'We are not going to put the money on the table just yet'."
"Nobody has asked for money to be put on the table."
"If you always take the populist path and fail to think of the common future of Europe, then you end up with this cacophony."
"Or, as another newspaper that is closer to you, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, says: another day, another proposal."
"That applies not just to Germany, but to the European Union as a whole."
"The answer, or lack of an answer, that we have given so far is not acceptable."
"We need a carrot and stick approach."
"Measures are needed in Greece - there is no question about that - and they will be tough, very tough."
"However, we also need cooperation at European level, in particular, to prevent such problems arising."
"That can only happen - whether in the context of a European Monetary Fund as proposed by Mr Schäuble, or by another means - if we also have European solidarity."
"I therefore expect the summit to demonstrate European solidarity in order to create a better future."
"Madam President, the Spring Summit is supposed to be the energy summit."
"Had the Copenhagen conference ended with a global agreement, we would already be discussing the technical details of moving to a 30% emissions reduction, and we must still do so."
"Firstly, because the level of ambition agreed at the 2007 Spring Summit translates to a much higher than 20% reduction in today's economic circumstances."
"Just last week, Nobuo Tanaka, the executive director of the deeply cautious International Energy Agency (IEA), told MEPs that the IEA's 2009 World Energy Outlook predicts a 23% reduction in EU emissions and that 30% would represent a good target."
"Secondly, if we are serious about achieving up to a 95% target by 2050, then the roadmap requires a cut of at least 30% by 2020."
"And, last but not least, it is only the transformation of the EU into a sustainable low carbon and resource efficient economy which will ensure European economic recovery and job creation."
"Green jobs lie at the heart of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Therefore, the Council should back Commissioner Hedegaard and recognise that the conditions are now right to move to a 30% target, and the Council should recognise that the cheapest and easiest way to make that further cut is through energy efficiency and, specifically, a binding energy efficiency target."
"EU leaders need to deliver as clear a message at this 2010 Spring Summit as they did in spring 2007."
"(PL) Instead of having a discussion about implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, I suggest we concentrate on areas where we do, really, have an influence."
"We are, certainly, able to help safeguard the common market from protectionism."
"We are, certainly, able to make European law easier for businesspeople, so that it does not limit the competitiveness of the European economy."
"Better legislation is, of course, a particular responsibility of this very House, of this Parliament."
"Member States will reform if they are exposed to pressure from the world economy."
"This is why it is so important to give the Member States maximum freedom in the area of competitiveness of systems of taxation, social systems and economic law."
"By bringing in harmonisation in these areas, we are only maintaining the ills of the European social model."
"It is freedom, and not successive strategies, which is the correct response to the crisis."
"(NL) Madam President, no emergency solution is in place for Greece as yet, and in fact this is not a problem at the moment, as even the Greek Prime Minister said here in Parliament that the country wishes to put its own house in order."
"Indeed, this is the correct procedure according to the ground rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, and is itself a type of solidarity."
"Nevertheless, we have a problem."
"The euro is toppling, but this can be attributed mainly to the public debate among capital cities, which is giving the impression that we cannot reach a solution."
"We must put an end to this now, and hopefully we shall do so tomorrow."
"In my opinion, we need an emergency measure for this case of urgent need, which should unite the European Commission, the Member States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"There should be emergency loans and nothing more."
"Madam President, I hope that tomorrow, we shall look beyond the debate on this crisis."
"I hope we shall also look at medium- and long-term solutions."
"We must strengthen the preventive force of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Moreover, as others have also said, the new EU 2020 strategy can be successful only if we really achieve sound European economic governance."
"This will entail not only Member States appearing together at the summit but also the European Commission deploying all the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon; all the powers to really act and enforce things."
"After all, as Mrs Ek also said, a free-for-all is not the way to success."
"I very much hope that the emergency measure has been agreed by the time the summit starts tomorrow, so that we can focus on how to lift the Netherlands out of the crisis with a solid 2020 strategy, and also on achieving a solution regarding the way ahead after Copenhagen."
"(EL) Madam President, according to recent statements by officials and articles in the press, it would appear that the most likely 'rescue' scenario for the Greek economy will be a joint effort between the Member States of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund."
"Mrs Merkel also appears to be pushing things in that direction."
"May I say that this is the worst, the most anti-social scenario both for Greece and for the euro area."
"For the European Union, any such possibility violates Community legality - and I say that for those who defend it, given that no treaty, no legal text makes any reference to any such intervention by the International Monetary Fund or other international organisation in these procedures."
"At the same time, it creates a political and legal precedent by making the Stability Pact even more austere and lets the United States of America into the euro area through the back door."
"As far as Greece is concerned, any such choice would seriously intensify the anti-labour and anti-social measures taken by the government, measures which you call bold and which have increased poverty, increased unemployment, cut off any prospects for growth and cut off any hope of Greece's emerging from the crisis."
"This is the prospect that awaits other countries which may apply such measures under such pressure."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, is it normal that it should take two European Councils to resolve the issue of euro area countries showing solidarity with Greece?"
"I heard Mr Langen interpret the treaty."
"Yes, there is the treaty, the letter and the spirit."
"Moreover, when one reads Articles 143 and 122, none of the authors of the treaty bore in mind the fact that, after the changeover to the euro, we could be faced with a problem of the kind with which we are faced today."
"That is why we have to be creative; that is why we have to show solidarity."
"The idea of referring Greece to the International Monetary Fund seems to us - for those us who aspire to be responsible and consistent Europeans on the international stage - to be a complete nonsense."
"There is one thing that we must do, and that we must hope the European Council will do, namely, to send out a message of solidarity with Greece and a message of responsibility regarding the issue of economic governance."
"That issue is now on the table; it is serious, it is unresolved."
"We must address it calmly, we must reduce the pressure and we must not start with the assumption that we have to, in principle, strengthen the tool - an ineffective one so far - that is the Stability and Growth Pact, because it was repressive before it was cooperative."
"We need to pursue objectives in terms of public deficit, in terms of debt, but we also need to invent terms of cooperation, of good added value between members of the euro area."
"This is the challenge facing the European Council, and I hope that it will rise to it with a sense of responsibility."
"(PL) Madam President, on the eve of the European Council meeting which will define the Union's new economic strategy, we should learn the lessons of the fiasco of the Lisbon Strategy and, working together, take a fair look at all Member States."
"In order to be competitive in world markets, we have to be innovative, but the redistribution of the main part of our budgetary resources exclusively to that end will de facto discriminate against many countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland."
"There is a great expectation that thanks to EU funds - as was the case earlier in Spain, Portugal and other countries of the European Union - the air, road and rail transport infrastructure, and also the Internet, will expand."
"A particular priority should be to help the eastern border regions of the European Union, such as the region around Lublin in Poland, for which a special budget line should be established as part of the 2020 strategy."
"The European Council meeting must not send out a signal that poor regions of the Union are going to finance ideas which will bring maximum benefits only to the old Member States."
"(EL) Madam President, the EU 2020 strategy to be discussed at the summit, which follows on from the Lisbon Strategy, proves that the anti-grassroots shotgun measures being promoted by the PASOK government in our country, with the fundamental agreement of all the political forces of capital and the parties of the European one-way street, are not unique to Greece."
"They are decided in advance by the political elite and governments of the Member States of the European Union."
"They form part of the overall strategic plan of capital and are being promoted uniformly throughout the European Union by stepping up ideological terrorism and misleading the working and grassroots movement."
"The lies and demagogic statements by the representatives of the bourgeois governments, the forces of the European one-way street, that the European Union and EMU will act as a shield against crisis, the fairy tales about the European market of 480 million, the big European family, Community solidarity and other such idealistic talk have failed."
"The European Union is an imperialist, transnational union between capital and the monopolies which, with a single strategy, is attacking the people and crossing swords for a share of the spoils."
"The economic and political problems in Greece, in the Member States of the European Union, will be solved through the fight of the working and grassroots movement, the fight and solidarity of the peoples."
"It is obvious that what is happening in Greece is directly connected to the acute competition between the imperialist states and between the European Union, the USA, China and other developing countries."
"Thus, in the face of the strategy of capital, the working class and the grassroots classes must set up their own strategic fight to overturn this anti-grassroots policy, in order to satisfy the modern needs of the working-class and grassroots family."
"Madam President, two things."
"The first concerns public finances, and the second competitiveness."
"Last year at this time, we were discussing in this Parliament how to face the crisis."
"There were those who said 'let us meet the crisis by spending more and accepting bigger deficits', and those of us who said 'now we need to be in control of public spending in order to secure stability for the future'."
"Now we see the results."
"Some Member States followed the policy of spending and accepting bigger deficits, and we can all see the consequences: increased public debt and increased costs for servicing the public debt by increased interest rates."
"That is the reality which is squeezing out welfare spending and investments in a lot of the Member States."
"I think we need to learn from this: we need to abide by the rules we already have and we need to develop and improve the Stability and Growth Pact and make it more able to meet crises in the future."
"But we have the same debate now, because some now say that we should delay the exit strategies and the exit from public deficits."
"That is wrong, because then we will undermine our ability to recover and will increase the cost for interest rates in the Member States."
"The second thing is that competitiveness goes hand in hand with our ability to have stable public finances and to make the real changes we have talked about for decades."
"That is up to the Heads of Governments to do this week."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Hökmark, I think we have been in different parliaments in recent years, because the parliament I have experienced is different to yours!"
"I have experienced a parliament in which some say we must look more closely into ratings agencies, hedge funds and private equity corporations."
"We must regulate them, we must carry out checks on the critical players in the financial markets and the critical products to ensure that we are not veering towards an international fiasco."
"I have also heard others saying 'hands off': the market will regulate itself, we do not need all that."
"Or as Mr McCreevy said - whenever politics interferes, the result is always worse."
"We have seen the results."
"The international fiasco is the cause of the overindebtedness of the Member States of the European Union."
"However, we cannot stand here today and say that it was wrong to focus our growth policy on employment and economic activity."
"It is irrelevant to the debate, just as it is irrelevant to the debate when Mr Langen says that Chancellor Merkel understood the European Treaty."
"No, she did not understand it at all."
"What is worse, she is probably in a position to subordinate the European Treaty and its aims for Europe to her fear of losing an important regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia."
"These are not the leadership skills that we need in the European Union."
"We have told the Commission here that EU 2020 is too watered down."
"There is no meat in it."
"Please provide some evidence that you are able to acquire new funds."
"Please fight for a financial transactions tax."
"Please fight for more economic activity and greater growth prospects in the European Union, to give small and medium-sized enterprises and the workers a chance."
"Right now, however, we almost sympathise with you for having to save the European Union with governments such as we have at present - governments such as that represented by Chancellor Merkel."
"Stay strong and create European instruments!"
"That is our main message for the summit, because only then can people hope that we will provide the right answers."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz said that Greece has delivered and that it is now Europe's turn."
"I wonder whether Europe actually needs to say 'thank you', nowadays, if Member States in the euro area simply keep to the rules, in other words, if they manage to get back to the 3% criterion."
"I also wonder what the difference was last year when Ireland faced the same situation and instituted hard cuts."
"Nobody came forward at that time with the idea of calling on a European Monetary Fund."
"Mr Verhofstadt says that speculators are at work."
"Clearly there is pressure in that regard at the moment, but the fact is that Greece enjoyed major rate advantages thanks to being in the euro area."
"Our Italian colleagues used the rate advantage they gained from their accession to the euro area to consolidate."
"Greece consumed it."
"We can indeed therefore say that the good European today is not the one who is putting his or her money on the table; the good European is the one who actually implements the rules that everyone has signed up to and accepted, so that they are actually complied with in the European Union."
"As a second point, I would like to give my backing to the Commission because the proposals that are on the table for the long-term future represent a move in the right direction."
"We have agreed the 3% and we therefore need a strong Commission that will, in future, monitor and also enforce that 3% limit."
"We have seen how the Member States in the euro area are unable to police each other and to observe the 3% limit on their own."
"That is why I am in favour of a strong Commission that will be able, in future, to see that the criteria are met."
"I have one more thought."
"We should talk positively about the euro."
"It is not a currency crisis that we have; it is an economic crisis."
"The euro is a major benefit for everyone."
"If our leaders in the European Union no longer say that, if that point is no longer made in the Council, people will not know it."
"That is why I am in favour of this major, strong currency."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is a current problem, while the growth crisis and the environmental crisis are long-term problems, and both need to be tackled dynamically with decisions taken by the European Council."
"The Europe 2020 strategy rightly states that growth should be intelligent, sustainable and inclusive."
"When I look at the Council's conclusions, however, I see that they are much more narrowly focused and reduced to the classical growth strategy - a strategy that has failed and that did not get us very far."
"Growth cannot be intelligent if it is not sustainable and it is also not intelligent if it is not inclusive."
"That is why I would like to ask the Council and the Presidency of the Council to ensure that this triad, these three pillars, are retained."
"This is the new development that really should be implemented now."
"I am very pleased that growth that saves on resources and on energy is to be a flagship of the European Union."
"Of course, we have been talking about this for a long time."
"This will actually help us to save costs, reduce dependencies and solve a series of problems."
"I expect the Commission to provide us with a roadmap in the course of 2010, as it is a shared responsibility of the EU itself but also of the Member States, and many areas are therefore on very soft ground and very vague."
"Above all, we must make the target of 20% energy savings binding."
"This efficiency target must thus be made legally binding so that everyone knows where things are headed and industry can also realise the relevant investment."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were to ask myself the question frequently being asked in half the bars in Italy, I would ask what the point of Europe is, and I would make a snap reply, from the bottom of my heart."
"What is the point of Europe if not to help Greece at this time?"
"I do not think that this idea is crazy because it is in our DNA, in the nature of our political project: in the nature of our political project because it embraces solidarity."
"At the same time, however, I am struck that those who say they want to combat financial speculation intend to replace financial speculation with political speculation."
"Indeed, how can they think of waging this battle against Chancellor Merkel?"
"In other words, how can they think that the aim of trying to show solidarity with Greece is to attack another Member State, because it is simply reminding us that the policy of solidarity must go hand in hand with a policy of responsibility?"
"This is something of which we have often reminded ourselves, with one voice, because we are aware that solidarity and responsibility will enable us to make the European political project practicable for everyone."
"We must be certain that what unites us is stronger than what divides us, and in light of this, we must ask the Commission, as from tomorrow, to be ambitious and demand the necessary rigour from the Member States to ensure that they are capable of providing solidarity by means of a project which, in the long term, will be capable of giving tangible form to our European project."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek crisis is clearly the most serious problem that Europe is facing, and it is undoubtedly caused by a lack of rigour in the management of public expenditure."
"However, the European Institutions' delay in taking steps to address this Member State's moment of difficulty is incomprehensible and unacceptable."
"Moreover, this delay has already had a negative impact: indeed, it has opened the door to speculation; it has created, within the Union, doubts over certain countries' intentions with regard to the future of Europe (I do not want us to forget that this is the first major issue that we have had to deal with following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon); it has accentuated the difficulties of the Greek Government, which has had to implement anti-popular measures - not trivial or minor decisions - affecting millions of people, and it has done so without being sure that help was on its way."
"Our intervention therefore needs to be free of any speculation. I would like to remind Mr Mauro that Germany is, without doubt, one of the countries to have benefited most from the entry into force of the euro and its effect on interest rates."
"We must act swiftly to help Greece."
"Europe must do so in the interests of Europe."
"(RO) The Council of the European Union enthusiastically welcomed the Commission's Europe 2020 Communication."
"This document is, admittedly, an absolute necessity, which is precisely why we must scrutinise its content closely."
"I think that it lacks financial consistency."
"It is the Council's duty to ask the Commission to clarify the budget resources and their allocation to the key items in the budget."
"In my view, the budget cannot be drawn up before the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy have been reformed."
"One of the major areas supporting the EU's development and stability is completely missing, namely, the infrastructure for both transport and energy."
"The development of transport and energy infrastructures in the European Union, along with their harmonisation with those existing in neighbouring countries, can provide a powerful driving force promoting sustainable growth and ensuring stable jobs."
"They can also provide the European Union with much sought-after security in both the energy and transport sectors."
"For this reason, I call on the Council to ask the Commission to include these key areas in the EU 2020 strategy for the benefit of Europe's citizens."
"(EL) Madam President, the European summit on 11 February, which was to send a message of support to Greece so that the markets would calm down, has basically been annulled due to the dissonance and uncertainty prevailing within the European Union."
"The European Council, which starts work tomorrow, cannot afford the luxury of maintaining the current climate of uncertainty and dissonance."
"Everyone now acknowledges that the Greek Government has taken very harsh measures, most of which have already started to be applied at the expense of and with sacrifices by the Greek people."
"However, at the same time, it continues to borrow at exceptionally high interest rates, the most recent example being on 5 March, because there are speculators on the markets making a fortune by betting on the odds of a country going bankrupt and ultimately creating the conditions and preconditions for that to happen."
"Today, the debate revolves around Greece; tomorrow it will probably concern another Member State."
"Will the European Council stop it by creating an effective European preventive mechanism which will safeguard the national economies and the stability of the euro area?"
"The President of the European Commission spoke about responsibility and solidarity."
"He was right."
"Both are needed when you belong to a family such as a euro area."
"I do not think that anyone can doubt that Greece has fully assumed its responsibilities."
"However, it cannot face the fury of the market alone at this difficult stage."
"Eighteen months ago, the markets were threatening to bring down the global economy."
"Surely Greece will be threatened today."
"That is where the concept of solidarity comes in, a concept which should be obvious and which should go hand in glove with membership of the euro."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, enough has been said about Greece - I want to turn to the future now."
"With the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission has brought an important document into the discussion, one that is intended to lay down quite broad guidelines for how the European Union should be led in future."
"I believe that, in the end, we will all need to attain the joint targets that we are laying down in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"That was one of the major problems with the Lisbon Strategy, on which, ultimately, we all have work to do."
"Only if all the Member States truly stick to the targets laid down in the strategy will we be able to achieve these targets together."
"It will not succeed if the European Council believes itself to be the administrative body and if things are organised at the last minute."
"It will only succeed if those working in this institution truly realise the political leadership role that it has to play."
"Furthermore, it will really only succeed if the principle of solidarity is fundamentally laid down in this Europe 2020 strategy."
"That means, first of all, individual responsibility on the part of the Member States in all those areas where they, themselves, are responsible."
"This includes reform efforts on the labour market, but it also includes national budgetary policy."
"Conversely, this also, of course, means an obligation to assist on the part of the other Member States - in other words, Member States that have got into difficulties through no fault of their own will also receive assistance."
"What is more, it will only succeed if the Commission takes the lead politically."
"In other words, we absolutely must avoid the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It has often been said in the past that the strategy of cooperation that characterised the Lisbon Strategy failed."
"We need clear objectives from the Commission, and I believe that Parliament will support the Commission in this area."
"(ES) Madam President, I think we are all aware that five hundred million members of the public will be following the European Council to be held next week with unusual attention."
"The reason is that the European Council will have the opportunity to issue a message of commitment to the exit from the crisis, which is what those who are suffering from it the most are desperately waiting for."
"Furthermore, the exit from the crisis must, of course, be reflected in that commitment to the strategy, it must be convincing in the change of model for growth and in its emphasis on economic, social and environmental aspects."
"From the economic point of view, it must be reflected in the commitment to governance."
"From the social point of view, it must be reflected in the commitment to workers and social protection - the model that made us Europeans - and, in particular, to equality;"
"I want to underscore that emphasis in a document in which the commitment to equality is clearly improvable."
"Furthermore, from the environmental point of view, it must be reflected in the commitment to recovering the spirit that made Europe the leader in the commitment to environmental sustainability and preventing climate change at the Copenhagen conference and, above all, to acknowledging that deeply disappointing taste in the mouth with which we left the Copenhagen conference."
"However, the most important thing of all at the Council meeting is that there must be a clearly European commitment to support monetary union with the coordination of fiscal, budgetary and economic policies on a par with monetary union."
"The message of solidarity with Greece is not a message for Greece; it is a message for Europe and Europeans."
"It is not a matter of rescuing Greece; it is a matter of giving European signs of life, of engagement with deep reality, with the deep historical commitment that monetary union represented."
"Understand once and for all, therefore, that we are not talking about Greece; we are talking about all of us."
"There have been delays in getting the new institutions going; there must not be any delay in getting the answers going that Europeans expect from the next Council."
"(EL) Madam President, it is true that my country, Greece, has failed over the years to develop its economy with the necessary moderation and consistency."
"Now, however, it has fully assumed its responsibilities."
"The Greek people are paying a heavy price."
"However, we must not hide our heads in the sand."
"Greece is not the only country in EMU facing serious problems."
"It was not the only country to take recourse to the toxic services of certain credit institutions."
"It is not, nor will it remain, the only target of speculators."
"We all know - and we know full well - that the Greek issue is a European issue."
"EMU will remain mutilated without more coordinated economic and fiscal policy and, above all, without solidarity."
"The crisis, any crisis is the mother of change."
"The current crisis may give birth to a stronger Europe and Greece may be the midwife of that change."
"So let us not shoot Greece down."
"Let us together shoot down the speculators who would like to see the euro on its knees; that is what the European Council should do tomorrow."
"(HU) Madam President, I would like to call the attention of the Commission and of the Council to the fact that when determining the new objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, they must not forget those policies that are currently working well, that is, the cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy."
"These are tried and true instruments which, although needing reform, can significantly contribute to the achievement of the new EU 2020 objectives."
"It is regrettable that these two very important Community policies were omitted from the earlier material provided by the Commission."
"Hungary and the new Member States therefore consider the formulation of these policies, the legal harmonisation of the internal market, and the elimination of the bottleneck in infrastructure and energy security, extremely important."
"And finally, this EU strategy cannot replace appropriate debate on the budget directive, and we consider it very important that the regional dimension of the cohesion policy also be given space. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the euro, the debate about Greece, has defined recent days."
"I would like to draw your attention, at this point, to what strikes me as a disturbing piece of news, namely that 40% of Germans now believe that the introduction of the euro was a mistake."
"We have to be disturbed by that, because the introduction of a Community currency is not a one-way street."
"Europe's integration process is not irreversible."
"I believe that we must keep the promise that we gave the German people when they gave up their national currency, namely, that the euro would be just as stable as the German mark."
"I am also firmly convinced that we in Europe need a discussion about the social market economy, about the regulatory framework."
"We should not be talking about how we are making Germany less competitive."
"Instead, we should be discussing how we can make the whole of Europe competitive so that we can be successful on global markets."
"That is what our aim must be; that is why I am calling for a debate on the social market economy in Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, I agree with everyone who feels the need, at this point in time, for stronger European integration, especially in the economic field, and I hope that that will not only be discussed at the euro area summit but also actually at the European Council."
"However, the truth is that the population does also - and my fellow Member mentioned this just now - see negative sides to the euro."
"There was a birth defect when we launched monetary union in terms of having a single currency whilst, at the same time, failing to shape economic policy more jointly."
"We must now acknowledge that that was a major mistake."
"The voice of reason tells us that a solidarity fund - for Greece too - must now be set up so that Greece can obtain lower interest rates."
"There has, however, been too little mention in this debate of the fact that Greece itself must also do something."
"One important element would be for it to cut back on its military budget."
"An EU Member State that spends more than 4% of its gross national income on military expenditure, on armaments from countries such as Germany, France and others, is not what we need in the European Union, and so it is right that there should be cuts in this area."
"Madam President, I would like to make the point that you could not make this up today."
"Almost every speaker here has discussed Greece - the crisis in Greece - and yet Mr Barroso said at the beginning that it is not even on the formal agenda for the two days at the European Council."
"That is incredible."
"The whole world is watching every day what is going on here."
"The truth of the matter is that you are again trying to hide the fact that this project is not working."
"It is rapidly failing."
"We have already seen the good people of Germany saying that they are not happy with the situation."
"But should it not be for the people of Greece to have their say, not the dictators in this place?"
"Surely it should be for the good people of Greece perhaps to have a referendum on whether they should be in the euro."
"It is their case."
"It is their cause."
"I am sickened by what I have heard today from many."
"It is a self-centred opinion for those other Member States, looking after themselves."
"Greece is the problem at the moment."
"I feel it will go from Greece to Spain and then Portugal and Italy and so on."
"The rollercoaster will start."
"Mark my words: the problem is here to stay."
"(SK) I will be very brief, because most of the issues have already been mentioned, of course."
"My personal opinion is that the situation we have already been tackling for some months now in Greece is not a unique situation, and it seems to indicate that a new approach is required in terms of adhering to, or, as the case may be, not adhering to the Stability Pact."
"We have, in principle, two options: either we insist on adherence to what is valid and what is in the treaties and take the full consequences of this, or we understand that the Stability Pact, just like anything else, is subject to a certain amount of development and must therefore also undergo certain changes, and we draw up these changes and carry them through in such a way that not only do we maintain growth and economic stability directly in those states that are members of the euro area, but we also prepare other EU Member States, which are not yet in the euro area, to join, without us having to make dramatic use of the structural funds, for example, in these countries."
"(FR) Madam President, I have one observation and three proposals."
"Firstly, my observation: I do not understand why President Van Rompuy is absent from such an important sitting - Minister, you are not a member of the European Council - and I believe that he could have been here."
"My three proposals concern Greece's recovery plan."
"In the medium term, I support Mr Cohn-Bendit's idea, which was in fact mentioned just now: if the European Union were able to make a pact with Turkey to solve the Cyprus issue, we could help Greece recover two per cent of its GDP."
"My second proposal concerns finance, since we do not have the instruments."
"Why does the European Union not support a series of financial commitments, which would enable interest rates to be reduced and which is an objective on which a consensus has been reached within the European Parliament?"
"Lastly, it has been said that Greece's accounting was flawed."
"It is not only in Greece that accounts are flawed."
"I propose that we create public sector accounting standards for the entire European Union so that we have financial statements that are consistent, above board and reliable for all the Member States."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first let me tell you how impressed I was by the clear demonstration of solidarity and by the calls for responsibility from most of the speakers."
"This is exactly what we need at this moment, because it is very clear that a European problem needs a European solution."
"Sometimes, I wonder if we have not sufficiently learnt the lessons regarding the consequences of our course of actions, if we do not follow European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific even though we have to deal with it collectively."
"I think it is very clear that we are not just a group of countries."
"We are a European family, and if one of our family members has a problem, we must definitely come to the rescue."
"The Commission is therefore ready to propose an instrument for coordinated assistance to Greece which will be fully compatible with European law, and I am sure that this is possible."
"I would like to thank all of you for support when it comes to the EU 2020 strategy."
"I cannot overemphasise how our citizens are expecting leadership at this moment, how they expect us to improve our performance and how they expect us to lead them after the crisis and set very solid medium-term strategies, as our international partners such as China, the United States, India and others do."
"The time has come for a decision."
"I was listening very carefully to the calls for better governance."
"I was listening very carefully regarding improved monetary and economic surveillance and that we have to do a better job of enforcing the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is exactly what the Commission has in mind and these very proposals will come very soon."
"I would like to thank all of you who supported the Commission on having very clear concrete goals for tomorrow's European Council conclusions."
"I think it is very important to have a medium-term strategy, but we have to have very clear indicators of where we are going and what our goals are."
"The Commission therefore insists that the European Council accept these concrete headline goals after the deliberations tomorrow and the day after."
"We need higher employment, we need a better gender balance and we need stronger education."
"It is very clear that we need to invest more in research and development, and it is absolutely clear that we need to fight poverty."
"Therefore, the Commission insists on solidarity, on responsibility and on having a concrete strategy for Europe and European citizens."
"Let me just express my hope that the positive spirit which was present here, which was clearly supporting solidarity and responsibility, will be just as present during our leaders' deliberations tomorrow."
"Madam President, I believe this has been a very important debate: a debate on an issue that is at the heart of European concerns at the moment - the Greece issue - but, beyond that, on the economic situation of the European Union as a whole, a debate at which, by the way Mr Audy, the Presidency of the Council has been present, as agreed in Parliament: I represent the Presidency of the Council here."
"With regard to the issue of Greece, about which there has been most debate and to which most reference has been made, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has very clear ideas."
"Firstly, Europe is an integration of economic policies: we have integrated economies."
"Secondly, Europe is based on solidarity and therefore has a strong social content."
"Thirdly, Europe has economic and financial stability."
"These three European characteristics are clearly implied in the Greece issue."
"That is also why the three ways of seeing Europe take account of and reaffirm one another in the very important statement made by the informal European Council on 11 February 2010."
"That was, I think, one of the most important statements that has ever been made in the Council, because it is a statement that tackles the problem of Greece by talking about solidarity and the absolute political commitment to the financial stability of the euro area; the commitment to act when necessary to safeguard that stability."
"I am sure that this weekend's European Council, which is the same European Council that met on 11 February, will strengthen and preserve that stability."
"A strong political message on Europe will be sent out from that European Council; one of support for its economy, support for its currency and, therefore, a message of support for solidarity, because this is what the public is hoping for, although it is true that a number of Eurosceptics are hoping for failure."
"Such a failure will not come about in the European Council."
"Rest assured that such a failure will not come about, but that the political commitment to solidarity at the heart of the European Union and at the heart of the euro area will be reaffirmed."
"Moreover, we are going to look further ahead."
"We are going to look at the short and the long term."
"We are going to talk about how to engineer a coordinated exit from the crisis, bearing in mind that there will not be a complete withdrawal of fiscal stimuli until there is economic recovery."
"We are also going to talk about more long-term goals, goals which I would like to single out, in particular, the element of economic, territorial and social cohesion; in essence, solidarity."
"And we are going to talk about where there will be a new form of supervision different from the Lisbon Strategy."
"There will clearly be changes in this regard: the leadership of the European Council was not in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The coordination of economic, employment and social policies that is in the Treaty of Lisbon was not in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The importance of the Commission's role - of supervision, tracking, monitoring, control, of laying down requirements to meet the goals - was not in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The elements of creating incentives with the structural funds were not in the Lisbon Strategy."
"Clearly, very important progress is therefore being made."
"Finally, Madam President, I shall refer to Mr García-Margallo's speech, which was the only speech aimed directly at the Spanish Presidency by criticising the way in which the European Union is, in his opinion, being led."
"I have to tell you, Mr García-Margallo, that the Spanish Presidency of the Council is working in a close and coordinated way - the Community method - with Mr Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, to push forward the essential goals."
"It is also working closely with the Commission and Parliament."
"You referred largely to the economic issue."
"I would like to ask you whether you think, for example, that adopting a decision such as the one adopted at the European Council - obviously with the participation of the Presidency of the Council - on the political commitment of Europe to the financial stability of the euro area is not leading the European Union."
"I would like to know whether you think that it is not leading the European Union to contribute to the holding of a debate this weekend on no lesser subject than the Europe 2020 strategy, in which, by the way, majority support was generally won for the speeches made in Parliament."
"The debate was also on governance, as a fundamental element in that regard."
"I would like to know whether you think that it is not leading the European Union to have negotiations going on at this moment with this House on the financial supervision package."
"Furthermore, I would encourage you, Mr García-Margallo, to work with this Presidency so that we can reach an agreement as soon as possible between the Council, which has adopted a position, and Parliament."
"During the Spanish Presidency, by the way, we want to remove the Directive on 'hedge funds' from the European Union and we want to remove it with as much agreement and consensus as possible."
"I do not think that should be criticised, quite the contrary."
"I also think that it is leading the European Union to be very much in agreement and work with the Commission on the proposal that the Commission will submit on the coordination of economic policies in enforcement of Article 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Equally, it is leading the European Union for there to be a general policy for getting out of such debt, debt that was essential to the European Union in the face of the crisis and in the face of the social need to tackle the crisis and to protect the most vulnerable."
"This is unavoidable debt that must be dealt with now, properly, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to get back on track in terms of the Treaty of Lisbon's parameters."
"This is leading the European Union according to the Community method."
"This is leading the European Union, and leading the European Union means holding a European Council this weekend that will clearly express its support for Greece and for the Greek Government."
"No, you cannot take the floor using the blue card procedure, because this is reserved solely for MEPs."
"Therefore, the Minister's speech brings the debate to a close."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"One of the important topics on the European Council agenda relates to the EU 2020 strategy on job creation and economic growth."
"We need to coordinate European policies so that we can meet the challenges and needs we are facing at the moment."
"We also need to set clear long-term objectives."
"Priority must be given to the sustainable development of the European economy."
"The Commission's new strategy for the next 10 years envisages five courses of action: the creation of new jobs, the battle against poverty, the reduction in the school dropout level, investment in research and development and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"The last Member States to join the EU need resources and support from the European Union in order to achieve these ambitious targets."
"Romania supports the 20-20-20 target on cutting carbon emissions by 20%, increasing the proportion of energy obtained from renewable resources by 20% and boosting energy efficiency by 20%."
"The more ambitious 30-30-30 target, which envisages achieving a 30% threshold in all three areas, would definitely incur costs which are excessively high for my country."
"This would be an unrealistic target for a number of European states."
"As a project, Europe has been about peace, social well-being, freedom and growth."
"It has served as an example in terms of its social model and has also taken the lead on environmental issues, without equal on the global level."
"The economic, financial and social crisis that we are currently experiencing requires a concerted response at European level."
"The crisis in Greece and the attack on the euro require a joint response, but unfortunately, this has been delayed. It is both possible and desirable to find a European solution in order to avoid these constant speculative attacks on the euro."
"The EU has credibility and liquidity."
"If the required coordination is in place at European level, this should be enough to calm the market swiftly and cover the cost of the loans that Greece needs."
"This is a time that requires solidarity between the Member States and Europe's institutions."
"It is even a matter of duty."
"It is to be hoped that the upcoming European Council will take steps towards achieving integrated and coordinated solidarity."
"Such an attitude is needed if the European project is to move forward."
"Solutions for the monitoring of each Member State's deficit must be sought later."
"The seriousness of the social problems that are being experienced in various EU Member States, including unemployment, lack of job security and poverty, make it vital that the spring European Council gives a serious and thorough response."
"However, we fear that its responses are aimed mainly at the supposed sustainability of public finances, while neglecting measures aimed at social sustainability."
"The response to the situation in Greece is an important matter, especially because what is happening there contradicts everything that was trumpeted about the virtues of the euro and the blessings of being in the euro area: being in the vanguard of the strong currency of rich countries."
"It was said that being in the euro area would be a safeguard against financial crises, as the country in question would be able to avoid loans and receive money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"The initial crisis was enough to show that there is no real solidarity within the euro area and that so-called 'economic and social cohesion' is nothing more than propaganda used in electoral campaigns."
"Now Mrs Merkel is even threatening that Member States which do not fulfil the requirements of the Stability Pact, such as Greece, amongst others, will be expelled from the euro area, forgetting that Germany has been and is the major beneficiary of policies based on a strong euro..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The economic and financial crisis, and Greece, require European action."
"An end needs to be brought to the public arguments."
"We await a joint answer from the summit."
"We say 'yes' to the Greek Government's savings and reform programme - Greece is firmly resolved to do its homework and comply with the European rules."
"We also say 'yes' to loaning money where the reform programme would otherwise be threatened."
"We do, however, say a definitive 'no' to fines and to expelling a country from the euro area."
"All that would do is to institute a domino effect that would lead to a loss of confidence by the markets."
"We also say 'yes' to Commissioner Rehn's proposal for prior approval of the draft budgets by the Commission."
"Budgetary and economic data must be inspected by Eurostat and the Commission."
"I demand a strict review of the books in all the Member States based on a joint list of criteria."
"The tax systems and those tax rates relevant to the internal market must be harmonised, the economic, budget and social policies coordinated."
"I demand a 'Europe 2020' planning committee involving the Commission, the Member States, the European Investment Bank, the European Central Bank and Eurostat."
"I therefore call on the Heads of State or Government to put a joint European willingness to act unambiguously on the record."
"Greece is an example that Europe must learn from."
"The conclusions must be drawn at the local, the European and the global level."
"More European collaboration and less national egoism are the order of the day."
"in writing. - I would like to speak about the European Digital Agenda."
"The Commission's figures show that barriers to the digital single market exist: only 7% of online transactions are cross-border."
"Although Internet and relevant infrastructure objectives serve as solid prerequisites for further development, improving the infrastructure must be complemented by the creation of a pan-European regulatory framework, utilisation of services and enhancement of ICT skills."
"By 2020, a single and secure European e-services area should be created."
"It would provide EU citizens with easy and safe access to all digital services, both public and commercial."
"Member States should develop national plans for the digital switchover of public services."
"Particular focus should be on encouraging the participation of lower socio-economic groups, as they are the most likely to be excluded from the digital society."
"Cross-border e-authentication and digital signatures should be characterised by legal and technical interoperability so that cross border e-authentication could be used by all service providers and consumers across Europe."
"The comprehensive approach to the digital single market should include reducing the remaining fragmentation in financial services, logistics, consumer protection and intellectual property."
"A 100% target should be set for citizens to have both access to, and the ability to use, e-services."
"The horrendous financial crisis in Greece and the financial imbalance in other Member States of the euro area raise questions about the static and dynamic strength of the very structure of EMU."
"There can be no doubt that the restoration of the public finances of a Member State of the euro area is its responsibility."
"However, the financial crisis has brought the correlation between full, uniform monetary union and the imperfect economic union of the EU to the surface."
"It has urgently highlighted the need to set up politically directed European economic governance, for Europeanising economic policy and economic risk, for covering the structural deficits of EMU, for more Europe and for coordinated and solidarity-based European action."
"What is needed is a European support mechanism, a European Monetary Fund equipped with the necessary resources and facility for intervention."
"Coordinated regulatory intervention is required in order to protect the common currency against speculation."
"A detailed examination of the operation of the credit default swaps market is needed."
"The European Council is being called upon to give fundamental answers to the crisis in the euro area and to express real solidarity towards Greece in order to overcome the financial crisis."
"Greece is not begging."
"It is demanding that the short supplies of Greek citizens should not vanish into the pockets of international speculators."
"During the current economic and social crisis, combined with the climate crisis, the EU has devised a new strategy for the next 10 years."
"The EU 2020 strategy must help create a more inclusive Europe, with an economy which is integrated and environmentally friendly."
"The development of research and innovation must become a priority to enable us to combat the effects of climate change and create green, 'intelligent' jobs."
"For this reason, the targets set must be mandatory in order to ensure sustainable growth and the development of a more inclusive labour market and decent living conditions for all citizens."
"The EU can only succeed if we know what direction we want to take when it comes to the economy and social policy."
"For that reason, particular attention must be given to the drawing up of the 2020 strategy."
"The Member States must produce clear concepts, visions and ideas."
"Producing a strategy for the next 10 years is certainly an ambitious undertaking, but it should be remembered that this is not about the final details."
"The EU needs to ask itself where it wants to position itself and what priorities it is going to set for itself."
"One objective which, in the long term, would also yield positive social and economic consequences, would be to create a sustainable energy mix for Europe."
"A rethink is necessary in this area, and not only because of the ever dwindling supply of fossil fuels and the impact on the climate that non-renewable energy sources have."
"Europe must also take on the leading role when it comes to environmentally friendly technologies."
"In my view, however, nuclear power is little suited to leading Europe into a sustainable energy future."
"The purpose of the European Council meeting which begins tomorrow is, principally, to discuss the general framework of the Union's new Europe 2020 strategy and to evaluate emergence from the economic crisis as well as the situation in Greece and other countries in the euro area."
"These are closely interrelated topics, for the Union's strategy for economic growth and employment is related to these issues."
"In evaluating the current situation, we need to answer questions about how the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact are being observed in different countries, and where was the European Commission in all this?"
"We can assume that the Europe 2020 strategy will be viewed in different ways among the Heads of State or Governments of the Member States."
"This is the result of significant conflicts of interests of individual countries, which, in turn, come from differences in levels of development."
"For obvious reasons, the countries of the last two enlargements, but not only these countries, are going to fight for a greater emphasis on cohesion policy, infrastructure development and agriculture, although let us not forget innovation and new technologies."
"The successful development of Europe and a return to a path of growth in the next decade will be dependent equally on realisation of the objectives of the strategy contained in the Commission's proposals, but also on continuation of the more traditional policies."
"For the Union to cope with the difficult challenges in the global sphere, it must first reduce internal disparities, and this cannot be achieved without respecting the treaty's principle of solidarity."
"The main theme of the Spring European Council is the EU 2020 strategy."
"At the start of this year, the unemployment rate reached 10%, while the figure in countries such as Spain and Latvia reached almost 20%."
"67% of European citizens feel that job losses are their main concern."
"European leaders' main concern must be to preserve existing jobs and create other new ones to allow European citizens to make a decent living."
"This objective can only be guaranteed through making substantial investments in economic and social development, transport and energy infrastructure, agriculture, research, education and health."
"This is precisely the reason that the European Council must focus particular attention on the EU's industrial policy."
"According to European statistics, compared to December 2009, in January 2010, industrial output fell by 2% in the euro area and by 0.2% at EU27 level."
"At Community level, industry generates 26.4% of GDP, but there are Member States where industrial output contributes only 14% of GDP."
"The European Union must retain its global competitiveness."
"In order to achieve this, jobs and industrial output must be kept within the European Union and not relocated to third countries."
"Development of the European Citizens' Initiative based on Article 11(4) of the Treaty on European Union (debate)"
"The following point is the Statement of the Council and of the Committee on Development of the European Citizens' Initiative based on Article 11(4) of the Treaty on European Union."
"Allow me to extend a very warm welcome to a group of reporters from my region, Castile-La Mancha in Spain, who have been in the press gallery and are currently visiting the EU's institutions."
"Mr President, I am grateful to Parliament for having had the initiative to hold this debate on, it seems to me, one of the most important, most relevant aspects from the democratic point of view, on the development of the European Union and of Europeanism amongst the European public."
"This relates to a very relevant issue, which begins a new stage in the European Union; as you know, of course, it concerns the Citizens' Initiative."
"In other words, the possibility for at least one million European citizens, both men and women, from the various Member States, to be able to sign a legislative initiative."
"A legislative initiative that is, understandably, addressed to and set out before the Commission, which is the EU body with capacity for legislative initiatives."
"The Citizens' Initiative is a very clear priority for the Presidency of the Council."
"Very clear."
"It is a priority because we believe that it is a priority for Europe."
"When a country chairs the Council of the European Union, we believe that it should not implement its own priorities, its own goals simply as a country during that Presidency, but must go further and must be capable of representing Europe's goals."
"The Citizens' Initiative, with its possibilities, with those entitlements it gives to citizens - to the approximately five hundred million European citizens - is an essential goal of Europe and for that reason, is one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, not through being a priority of Spain, but through being a priority of Europe."
"Citizens are hoping that the Treaty of Lisbon will be implemented as quickly as possible after eight years of losing time through institutional uncertainties."
"We have to make up that lost time and essentially respond to citizens, for what they want is participation."
"In other words, we have to gradually effect a rebalancing between the Europe that was being built during the 20th century more from the bottom down - albeit a democratic Europe - and a Europe that is also built from the bottom up."
"That is why we believe that the Citizens' Initiative must get going as soon as possible, because it will be evidence of the political will of the Member States, of Parliament and of the Union's institutions to give the public a voice and enable citizens to participate in the life of the Union."
"It will also counteract something that is unfortunately happening in the European Union as well: the fact that political debate is, for the most part, likely to be at national level; inbred debate."
"Here in Brussels, or in Parliament, a European debate is taking place, but in each of the Union's countries, it is the national debate that predominates, not the European debate."
"The citizens' initiative is a tremendous device for successfully unleashing a genuine European debate in civil society."
"The initiatives put forward by citizens of various countries will unleash a European debate in every country, not just a purely national debate."
"That is why, Mr President, we have considered the citizens' initiative to be a priority."
"As soon as the Commission submits its draft regulation - we would like to thank the Commission, and I must say especially President Barroso and Vice-President Šefčovič, for the concern with which they have prioritised this issue in the Commission's work schedule; we are also grateful that it will take place imminently and very speedily, as Mr Šefčovič will be telling us shortly - we shall have a text that enables us, together with the Council and Parliament, to set in motion what European citizens are undoubtedly hoping for, before this six months are up."
"We shall need to work on the different aspects involved, some more technical, others more political, but we must encourage it to happen."
"That is why, from the time of the informal meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs at La Granja de San Ildefonso, as Mr Šefčovič and Mrs Malmström - still in office because the new Commission had not yet taken over - will remember, to the first meeting we held with the Commission in Madrid when the new College of Commissioners took over, and now this afternoon in Parliament, we are anxious to push this initiative."
"I would ask them - this would be the message I would like them to pass on to you, honourable Members - to show the utmost concern for this initiative."
"I know that they will."
"Moreover, I would ask them to bring the utmost speed to something that I believe fairly easily unites general consensus in its various aspects, through the discussions that have taken place in the Council, Commission and Parliament, on the committee in which I participated, the Committee for Institutional Affairs, for example."
"I therefore think we can put this into practice, as it is one of the aspects of the new stage that is now beginning in the European Union that is most exciting for the public."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would really like to thank Parliament for putting this very important item on the agenda."
"I would like to personally thank my dear friend, Diego López Garrido, and the Spanish Presidency, for keeping this on top of the Spanish Presidency's agenda, because I believe that the instrument we are going to have will really change the way we do politics in the European Union."
"Until now, the European construct was based on representative democracy."
"I think this was very well reflected also in the Lisbon Treaty, where it is very clear that Parliament's powers are very much strengthened and when we are going to include the national parliaments more in the European legislative process."
"And we needed to complement it with greater inclusion of citizens in this process, through this instrument of participatory democracy."
"There was the debate, a while ago, on whether one cancels out the other and whether it is a zero-sum game."
"I really do not think so because I consider both elements of representative and participatory democracy as mutually reinforcing, and both help to create real European political and public space."
"I also believe that, thanks to this instrument, we will underline even more the importance of European citizenship for Europeans."
"As Diego has already said, I am also convinced that this would lead to stronger, better cross-border Europe-wide debates in Europe, more on European topics, and not only on national topics that we see so often in the capitals of our Member States."
"The Commission was and is very grateful for the work the European Parliament has already done on the European Citizens' Initiative."
"For us, the resolution you adopted on 7 May last year was very important political guidance and a very important pointer as to how we should prepare this initiative."
"As you know, the Commission, when preparing such important pieces of legislation like this one, wants to engage the European public in as wide a discussion as possible."
"Therefore, we organised a public debate on this issue, based on the Green Paper that we issued in December last year."
"I must say that we have been very positively surprised by the responses we have got."
"We got more than 300 responses coming from a range of contributors: individual citizens, organisations, public authorities and even some national parliaments."
"We evaluated the responses we got and completed the consultation process with a public debate in Brussels, where more than 150 stakeholders were in attendance, including honourable representatives of Parliament."
"If I had to sum up this debate, I would say that there were a lot of innovative, interesting and positive suggestions coming to the Commission's table."
"What were the major conclusions?"
"That citizens are very much interested in having this initiative in place as soon as possible, that they would like to have it as user-friendly as possible, that they would like to have it simple, straightforward, understandable and, most of all, accessible."
"And, as you would agree, these are clear and very important parameters for having this legislation prepared in this way, because only these parameters would guarantee that citizens would use this instrument for better communication with the Commission and with the European institutions."
"Drawing on the results of the consultations and also on the proposals made by the European Parliament, the Commission is currently finalising its proposal."
"I hope that the College will adopt the proposals we are working on on 31 March."
"I can also tell you that this probably would not be possible without strong encouragement from the Spanish Presidency."
"It is very clear that such a top priority for the Presidency must be respected, and I know there is strong commitment from Spain to try to make progress on this initiative within the term of its Presidency."
"So, I am very hopeful that, thanks to the constructive approach of the Presidency, the Council and Parliament, we will have this new and very important instrument in place well before the first anniversary of the Lisbon Treaty coming into force."
"Mr President, it was in this very House, almost seven years ago, at the end of the constitutional convention, when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium."
"I had the honour of taking it to the Presidium and we approved it."
"Furthermore, I wish to recall here the names of Mr Lamassoure and Mr Mayer, because it was they who drew up the Citizens' Initiative proposal, a popular initiative that is today incorporated into the treaties."
"A popular initiative that is an example of participatory democracy - Mr Šefčovič has explained this very well - and of European democracy, because the issues that need to be covered by this initiative must be European issues, not local issues."
"Participation by citizens, therefore, and issues dealt with at European level."
"Mr Šefčovič, who is preparing this proposal, has not told us what it involves."
"He has left us with our mouths watering."
"On behalf of my group, Mr Šefčovič, I would ask that it contain at least three ideas."
"Firstly, that it should be clear and simple."
"In other words, do not let us make things complicated."
"It must be something accessible to the people, so that they can participate without having had to have gone to university."
"Secondly, that it should provide for cooperation between the European authorities and the national authorities, because, in my opinion, the national authorities must play an important role in the way signatures are organised."
"Thirdly, that we should educate, through the European Commission and through Parliament, by explaining how this legislative initiative may be used to avoid disappointments."
"I will give you an example of this that I saw on the Internet."
"An online petition has already been launched to use the popular initiative to make it possible to change the seat of Parliament so that there is only one."
"Well, this is impossible and we must say so from the start; it calls for reform in the treaties and cannot be dealt with by the popular initiative."
"There is, therefore, a lot of educating to be done, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, and of Parliament, in an initiative that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) endorses and hopes may serve to promote the sense of belonging to the Union and public participation in the Union's business."
"Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, I was very pleased to learn that the Commission plans to approve this draft regulation next week, on 31 March no less."
"I believe this is great news, I think it is appropriate and right to congratulate the Commission, Mr Šefčovič and the Spanish Presidency for the boost they have given to this initiative and for agreeing to submit a very important proposal to this House."
"Very important because, in the first place, I believe that it strengthens the legitimacy of Parliament."
"This is because it gives the public direct access to Parliament, not through parties, but in a way that gives direct access to us here with nothing more or less than a bill."
"It is direct public access to Parliament that justly strengthens its legitimacy."
"It strengthens the notion of citizenship, which is at the very root of the European project."
"From Maastricht to here, it is the citizen who is central to the European project and is the one who is becoming the key player here."
"Thirdly, I would say that it is something that gives extraordinary encouragement to the connection between institutions and citizenship, something that we are always demanding and never achieve."
"It is the opportunity for people to actually get close to Parliament and learn how it can be useful."
"That is what leads me also to make a couple of recommendations that are, to a large extent, in line with those Mr Méndez de Vigo was making before."
"I think that it is important to draw up a text that is, in the first place, truly flexible."
"In other words, that it should allow that right to be exercised; that it should afford it to many people, because we need to specify how many countries, what percentages, what systems of signatures."
"Be flexible, please!"
"Make access to this initiative easy, but let us make it clear as well and not disappoint expectations."
"There is a fundamental procedure, beforehand, to be carried out by the Commission to say whether or not a draft initiative will be successful, whether or not it is possible to carry it through."
"Before signatures are collected, we must say 'yes' or 'no', in order not to disappoint expectations: clarity and flexibility in this project, ladies and gentlemen, and, of course, well done."
"The European Citizens' Initiative is important because it is one of those rare innovations introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon that we might say will, in real terms, increase opportunities for the public to make a contribution."
"This is obviously just a small step forward and collecting a million names will be quite a job; even then, we can only suggest that the Commission should do something."
"The Commission will then, in its wisdom, decide whether it does anything or not."
"If the citizens' initiative experiment is successful, as I hope it will be, it is very possible that afterwards, we will be able to make further progress along the path towards direct influence."
"That is why it is very important now, as we establish a framework for the citizens' initiative, that that framework is defined in such a way that the initiative can be introduced easily and that it is clear and comprehensible."
"We should not raise false hopes or create misunderstandings."
"A procedure for advance conformity has been discussed."
"I think that it is something that should be considered very carefully."
"It may have its good aspects, but I do not know if it is right to trim down the initiatives at that stage."
"Let us allow the public to have their say."
"In my opinion, it is important that the threshold for the various Member States - the number of countries involved - should not be too high: a quarter would be sufficient to regard the initiative as having gone ahead and to make it seem likely that it will be taken forward."
"We need to ensure that the Regulation does not create needless barriers to the implementation of the citizens' initiative, but that it makes it clear and simple."
"Let us hope that there will be a good deal of initiatives and that the Commission will take them forward."
"Mr President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have, at this point, a major opportunity for Europe, this shared Europe of ours, that began with treaties between States - the classical instrument of foreign policy, in which the citizens were more or less spectators - to now increasingly become a Europe of the citizens."
"What we are discussing today is the first instrument that provides for direct citizen participation at the European level."
"I think it is clear to everyone what an opportunity this offers, in particular, for the creation, for the gradual development, of the likes of a European public, a European demos, which this Europe does need, as we continue to debate matters in France, in Italy, in Portugal, in Germany, et cetera, thus, essentially more or less separately."
"As far as relates to the citizens, there are hardly any Europe-wide debates at all."
"A European citizens' initiative of this kind could help to bring such debates about, however, and it could help to overcome, to some extent, Europeans' feelings that Brussels is a long way away and that they - the citizens - have no voice in Brussels."
"What we are doing here is creating a first instrument that will allow the citizens to make their voices heard in Brussels."
"The crucial thing, however, is what form we give it."
"I want to make the point very clearly that it has not yet been determined whether this measure will ultimately be a success or a disappointment."
"That depends on the form that we choose for this measure."
"I can well understand, Commissioner Šefčovič, that you are unable to present details to us today, as I know that you have not completely made your mind up yet."
"We do have an opportunity, here, however, to perhaps briefly put a couple of points on record together."
"There is, therefore, one very particular point that I would like to bring up."
"For me, the success of this will rise and fall by the fact that the Commission proposal or at least, ultimately, what is decided as a legislative proposal here, not only contains hurdles and stipulations that citizens must observe, but also stipulates that the Commission must seriously work on a citizens' initiative that has reached it, as, in my view, it would be extraordinarily frustrating if a million citizens had signed such an initiative and, in the end, the whole thing just disappeared, silently and unceremoniously, into a wastepaper basket."
"We need three levels of admissibility checking."
"Firstly, the formal level: does it have the necessary signatures?"
"Secondly, the legal level: is the matter at hand one of the competences of the European Union, does it not violate current law?"
"Then, finally, we need a content-based check, and, in this regard, I think it is important that the citizens are invited to this examination, that there is a hearing, that they are valued and their concerns are discussed, and that they do not just receive some ex cathedra letter from on high."
"This is by way of encouragement."
"Briefly, I have a second piece of encouragement to mention."
"One third, or nine Member States, seems to me - and seems to us in this House collectively - to be too high."
"Parliament has declared itself in favour of a quarter, and this figure must be seen in conjunction with the second hurdle, namely the hurdle within the Member States."
"In the talks that we have had, I proposed that this be graduated depending on the size of the Member States, as it makes a major difference whether a large or a small State is involved, and I see that there is openness to this proposal."
"Due to the time constraints, I cannot now go into any other points."
"I hope that we can together bring this first instrument of transnational democracy into being."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I think many of us should welcome any initiative that takes power away from the European Union and other political governments and devolves power closer to the citizen."
"In one respect, I would like to make a request for more flexibility."
"Why should we predefine the issues on which citizens can raise an initiative?"
"If they want to raise an issue, let us be held accountable and let us give our view on whatever we think."
"If, for example, it is on the place where Parliament should sit, we should respond."
"Why should we avoid the issue?"
"Let us tackle what the citizens are asking us head on."
"There is one issue that I would like to make clear, and that is transparency."
"It is going to be difficult for any individual, or group of citizens, on their own to collect the required number of signatures."
"Therefore, you might see a number of organisations organising the collection of these signatures."
"They should be transparent about their funding, so that you do not get organisations who hijack the process to basically request more funding for initiatives they believe in."
"Let it truly be an initiative of the citizens and not of civil society organisations and NGOs."
"Mr President, our citizens' mistrust of the European Union is growing."
"The low turn-out at the EU elections speaks volumes."
"If the European Citizens' Initiative is interpreted in such a way that only a few are able to take advantage of it, this will only exacerbate the situation."
"Our group is therefore calling for the rules not to be made too stringent."
"For example, issues may still be relevant to Europe as a whole even if the first million signatures come from only a very few countries."
"However, as the European Parliament, we can also do something to take the citizens' initiative seriously."
"We can take a decision in this Chamber that every time a citizens' initiative is approved, we will undertake to conduct a debate here - a debate that may lead to a statement on the initiative in question."
"In this way, we will also be taking citizens' wishes seriously and I hope that the groups can work together to bring about the adoption of something along these lines, for example, in the form of an amendment to the rules of procedure."
"(NL) Mr President, I have been listening to everything that has been said here up to now with clear-headed, and thus very great, scepticism."
"After all, our own experience - gathered from the referendums in the Netherlands, France and, last but not least, Ireland - has taught us how the eurocracy responds to the will of the people and expressions of this will."
"What is this European Citizens' Initiative, in essence?"
"In essence, it is a mere palliative, a sham intended to suggest a modicum of citizens' involvement in the Treaty of Lisbon without really bringing that involvement into the decision-making process."
"Indeed, this is clear from everything we have learned up to now: complicated procedures, constraints on the topics and, if anything should emerge in the end, this is to be considered and, in particular, decided on in exactly the same eurocratic, rather undemocratic cenacles as before."
"What we need in Europe are binding referendums, for example, on the accession of Turkey."
"These are necessary in order to restore democracy but, unfortunately, the European Citizens' Initiative is merely a kind of castrated caricature of such things."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed the statements by Mr López Garrido and Mr Šefčovič."
"The new Treaty of Lisbon urges us to swiftly adopt a systematic course of action to promote the citizens' initiative, which is testament to the existence of a European people."
"Indeed, it is a well-known fact that one of the harshest criticisms of the Union is that it is not a fully democratic structure."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has sought to reduce the democratic deficit in several ways, including by making provision for at least one million European citizens to submit a proposal for a legislative initiative."
"This new instrument, in order to be a serious tool, will have to produce legal effects of a certain importance."
"It certainly cannot have equivalent value to the pre-existing petitions which are signed by a wide range of individuals - a clear distinction must be made - and it must therefore be regulated in such a way as to prevent its abuse and still allow broad discussion, as the expression of informed and verifiable popular consensus."
"However, the most important aspect of the initiative laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty of Lisbon is its symbolic significance: the democratic deficit is being tackled not only by the decision-making power of the people's representatives, but even more so by the very existence of a European people which is not just the mathematical sum of the citizens of the individual nations."
"Therefore, with regard to the rules we are considering, there are two aspects that I consider to be particularly important: the first concerns the subject matter, which must be - as someone already said - a European issue; the second is the distribution of the minimum number of signatories across a significant number of Member States, representing an appropriate percentage with respect to the electoral weight of each country."
"I hope that the new rules will help citizens of France, Italy, Germany, Spain and so on feel that they are, first and foremost, citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, the European Citizens' Initiative is one of the major innovations of the Lisbon Treaty, aimed at increasing direct democracy in the European Union."
"This new tool should be correctly used by being fully exploited."
"Furthermore, its credibility must be assured."
"In this respect, serious requirements need to be addressed."
"Let me briefly mention only two, knowing that there are several others."
"The collected signatures must be verified appropriately."
"This is a crucial question that can cause serious problems, as the relevant legislation is very different in our Member States."
"We must find the optimal solution - the appropriate balance between different rules and common requirements."
"The second topic is the admissibility of the initiative."
"Again, every aspect must be examined carefully in order to find the best way to go."
"Should the topic of the public discussion be limited in the defence of the values of the Union, or should freedom of expression prevail?"
"Are they mutually inclusive principles?"
"I welcome and am grateful for the progressive work of Vice-President Šefčovič and the Spanish Presidency."
"I am glad that the stakeholders had the opportunity in February to discuss the majority of the questions that need to be solved so that the citizens' initiative is operational."
"I would really like to know the outcome of the meeting."
"How is the Commission going to handle the issue of verification and admissibility of an initiative, and at what stage?"
"Of course, when we prepare a report here in the European Parliament, we really have to be clear what approach we are going to deal with. I strongly believe that we are here to represent the European citizens and we have to be clear that we are capable of sending a very strong message for all of us."
"I strongly believe that the Spanish Presidency is doing an excellent job as a member of the trio together with Belgium and Hungary, my good comrades."
"So, thank you very much again, Vice-President. You did an excellent job."
"Let us continue."
"Mr President, this is an instrument that has huge potential and could deliver an important democratic signal to Europe."
"When I think of my own country, if you want to get forward a legislative initiative in the UK, you have to find a Member of Parliament, they have to be lucky enough to win an annual ballot or lottery, and then it is likely to get talked out by the government of the day."
"So, I think we are about to deliver something very important and very exciting into the hands of Europe's citizens."
"That makes me proud, but it has to be user-friendly, accessible and credible, and that means we will have to be reasonably strict about it being within EU competence and adhering to human rights at the outset."
"We will have to be able and want to give support to promoters to meet the technical requirements."
"Most importantly, parliamentarians should be prepared to act together with initiators of an initiative."
"This does not compromise our rights."
"It is something that we can join hands with citizens over, but they must direct their message to the Commission."
"We can help, and that way we can establish together a real European democracy."
"(FR) Mr President, my colleague, Mr Häfner, has mentioned some of the conditions for ensuring that this initiative is, as he said, feasible, credible and legitimate."
"I, for my part, would like to draw this House's attention, on the one hand, to the opinion of the Economic and Social Council, which is very interesting, and which could also shed light on the decisions to be taken and, on the other hand, to stress the fact that participatory democracy works when everyone - the MEPs, the Council, civil society organisations and unorganised citizens for whom the citizens' initiative is an opportunity - has a role to play."
"In this regard, Commissioner, pursuant to Article 11 of the treaty, which also provides for the possibility of establishing a structural and organised dialogue with civil society, I would like to ask you what kind of initiative you envisage - on the model of the social dialogue provided for by the treaties - and to know whether, alongside the citizens' initiative, which is very interesting and very useful, you intend to organise the dialogue with civil society in a structural and interinstitutional manner."
"(NL) Mr President, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, citizens can launch citizens' initiatives."
"This represents progress, as citizens are still too far removed from Europe and it is difficult to involve them in policy development."
"I see the European Citizens' Initiative as a good opportunity to increase support for Europe among citizens."
"Mr President, I wish to draw attention expressly to a citizens' initiative that was launched recently."
"It is an initiative by Mr Kastler, who is present here today, and it calls for Sundays to be kept free as a day of rest and reserved for family and contemplation."
"I endorse his plea fully and wholeheartedly, and am working with him to collect as many signatures as possible in the Netherlands."
"I would appeal to everyone to support and publicise this initiative."
"Such initiatives can indicate what citizens consider important."
"I call on Parliament and the Commission to take these signals very seriously, as Europe is there for citizens, not the other way round."
"(PL) Mr President, the increased role which the Treaty of Lisbon gives to the European Parliament, as well as the European Citizens' Initiative, are a very important step towards the strengthening of European democracy."
"However, in order for the initiative to fulfil its role, procedures must exist which would not limit its democratic character at the outset."
"The European Parliament does not, in fact, play any role in the process of the citizens' initiative at present."
"The previous Parliament voted that the Commission should decide which of the initiatives that are submitted will be accepted and which rejected."
"I think the European Parliament's role should be much greater, here."
"Parliament should work together with the Commission to evaluate and give opinions on initiatives which are submitted."
"In this way, decisions on the admissibility of proposed initiatives would lie equally in the hands of the representatives of the electorate, and not only of the executive."
"Parliament is currently the only European Union institution which is chosen in free, democratic elections, and the citizens' initiative is, in fact, about the problems and views of the people."
"If an initiative is rejected by the Commission, and so by the executive which is supposed to put it into effect, this may not be understood by the citizens."
"It is also important that the organiser of an initiative - a social organisation or a non-governmental organisation - clearly and explicitly specifies the subject and objective of the initiative, although it does not necessarily have to submit a motion for legislation."
"I think, too, that the procedures concerning initiatives should be harmonised in the Member States, because too much variety will make it difficult for us to gain broad support for these initiatives."
"(SK) The citizens' initiative, as one of the powers of EU citizens, represents significant progress for democracy and for the direct participation of the broader public in political life."
"I very much appreciate and value your approach in this matter, Commissioner Šefčovič."
"I would now like to refer to the questions put by my colleague, Zita Gurmai, because I, too, consider it important to find an answer to some of these questions."
"One of them concerns the place and method of formalisation, in other words, the place where signatures will be collected under an initiative, be it in a government office or somewhere on the street."
"In connection with this, there is also the question of whether there will be a conflict with other human rights, for example, the right to freedom of expression."
"The second question concerns the financing of the whole process."
"Who, therefore, will be responsible for financing citizens' initiatives?"
"Will it be the European Union or will it be the Member States or the actual citizens who are mounting an initiative?"
"In the worst case scenario, it would amount to a violation of democratic principle by establishing solvency as a condition of involvement."
"Last but not least, it will be essential for the Commission to specify a precise time limit within which these signatures will be collected, or, as the case may be, collected in a valid manner, not forgetting, in particular, the need to retain the openness and transparency of the whole mechanism in such a way as to prevent it being abused by the interest groups that operate throughout the EU."
"I offer you my sincere thanks, Commissioner, and I will be keeping my fingers crossed for you to succeed in this."
"Mr President, as somebody who has campaigned twice for a 'yes' vote to Lisbon and promoted the citizens' initiative as positive, I disagree with my colleague."
"I think it is not just a fig leaf."
"Yes, there are constraints, but it has potential, and it is a real meaningful step towards facilitating participatory democracy."
"I have discussed this matter with citizens."
"I have facilitated citizens to participate in the Commission's consultation and in the hearings in the Petitions Committee."
"However, we must not just consult with citizens: we must listen to what they say and we must ensure that their views are taken on board in any legislation we produce."
"This is an opportunity for the EU institutions to clearly show that the citizens' initiative will reflect the views of European citizens from start to finish."
"This legislation must be citizen-friendly and it must be highly visible."
"There must also be easily accessible assistance and help given to citizens who wish to organise a petition."
"It should be made clear where the Commission can act and where the Commission cannot act."
"It would simply lead to further accusations of a democratic deficit and cynicism and anger on behalf of citizens if a million signatures were to be gathered for a petition and then it were deemed to be outside the competence of the EU."
"So we need absolute clarity on this and we need to be proactive."
"While we need to squeeze every possibility out of this legislation, we must not promise more than we can deliver."
"The citizens' initiative is like a newborn baby."
"It has unlimited potential but it must be handled with care when it takes its first tentative steps."
"(DE) Mr President, in designing this instrument, we have an enormous responsibility to bear, as the hopes of citizens who think European and who want to push and assert European concerns at European level are riding on us."
"We must avoid those errors that are currently looming in relation to petitions at all costs."
"We need to avoid the European Citizens' Initiative becoming just a wailing wall where there is no follow-up to the complaints made."
"Active citizens are awaiting the result; they are waiting to see what form we give to the initiative."
"If we set the hurdles too high, we will be frustrating a major potential for Europe."
"Think about it."
"It will take an enormous effort for interested parties in a particular subject to collect a million signatures."
"If these are then thrown straight into the bin without being properly dealt with and without the proper follow-up, then we have probably done democracy in Europe a disservice."
"It is therefore of particular importance how the Commission deals with this concern."
"For me, this is the key issue."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens' initiative is an additional contribution to the creation of a true European civil society."
"It is a new opportunity for European citizens to have a greater say in the decision-making process."
"I hope that its introduction will help strengthen the sentiment of belonging to the same entity, our Europe, since this European sentiment is unfortunately very weak and all too often lacking."
"Looking beyond the technical, administrative and practical aspects associated with the actual implementation of the initiative, I believe that our message must, above all, be political."
"Indeed, we must not lose sight of the guiding principle that underpins the introduction of this initiative: bringing citizens closer to the institutions, stimulating their interest in Europe, promoting their involvement, and making them stakeholders of European policies."
"That is what we must always bear in mind."
"Whether we are talking about the minimum number of Member States from which the signatures derive, the collection, verification and checking of those signatures, or the admissibility of initiatives, we will have to ensure that citizens are not hindered in their desire to present an initiative."
"For example, I would like to point out that the costs involved in having a notary validate the signatures must be reasonable."
"Some Member States, which have already introduced this type of initiative at national level, at times charge excessive amounts."
"It is these kinds of obstacles that we must avoid in the case of the citizens' initiative."
"Lastly, we must not lose sight of the enhanced role of our Parliament."
"As the guardian of the democratic will of the European citizens and the guarantor of budgetary transparency, it must have a greater involvement in the process of implementing the initiative."
"Only in this way will we make the Union's extra bit of soul a true democratic heart."
"Mr President, this is one of the most important democratic advances for the European Union."
"Two thirds of the people of Ireland voted for the Lisbon Treaty and one of the reasons was because of the availability of this citizens' initiative."
"For the first time, citizens on a transnational basis can request that the Commission bring forward proposals."
"But this needs to be a transparent process."
"We must know who is organising these initiatives and we must know who is funding these initiatives."
"They must not be captured by corporate interests."
"The Commission, which will have to decide on whether or not to act on a proposal, must not be the body that decides on its admissibility, in my view."
"I believe we must expand the role of the Ombudsman to decide on a central European level what is admissible and what is not admissible."
"The minimum number of states that is necessary, I believe, should be seven, not nine, as proposed or indeed as suggested by the Commission, and I must argue and insist that the one million threshold set by the treaty should not be breached."
"It must not be raised by having a high proportion of citizens in Member States and a high number of Member States."
"It is extremely important that the treaties are complied with."
"And, finally, could I say that I believe it should be possible to enable citizens to register on the Internet."
"(ES) Mr President, I want to begin in Spanish by thanking the Spanish Presidency for having taken the decision to present the initiative earlier than was originally expected."
"Many thanks for that."
"(DE) I will now continue in German."
"I would like to thank the Commission for having taken on the Spanish Presidency's initiative and for having come out and said, 'OK, we will act quicker than that, we will put forward the proposal next week'."
"We hope that there will be a finished proposal by the summer."
"That is important in order to meet the expectations of the citizens."
"Like many of those who have spoken before me, I believe the planned nine-country hurdle is just too high."
"My proposal would be to start at five, which is a fifth of the Member States."
"It is not easy to collect a million signatures, even if, perhaps, you can use the Internet to do so."
"It is necessary, however, to show the people that we want them to participate in this shared Europe of ours and to hold a real European debate."
"I think it is important that the legal, formal and content-based examination of this matter takes place right from the outset and not once people have already begun to collect signatures."
"There should also be support for the initiatives, for example, with translations."
"If that happens, we will be able to once again enthuse the citizens about our shared Europe - and more strongly, too."
"(SK) Commissioner, thank you for providing an outline of the next steps."
"We have progressed from conceptual goals and several lines of text in the Treaty of Lisbon to a directive through which the EU will be regulated."
"The citizens' initiative shows the citizens of the EU a further means of European integration."
"Member State citizens will have the opportunity to lobby European institutions."
"It should be pointed out, however, that the right to a citizens' initiative may be a democratic instrument, but it also opens the door to a federalised EU."
"I support the citizens' initiative, but it will be necessary to integrate the competent Member State authorities into it as much as possible."
"The protection of national constitutions must be given precedence and guaranteed."
"As the Commissioner said, this initiative must be balanced, and I might add that in no case should it be allowed to serve as a pretext which might threaten the principle of subsidiarity."
"The framework for the application of this measure must be clearly defined, so that we can avoid unrealistic expectations on the part of some institutions, and particularly on the part of EU citizens."
"Mr President, I am very happy with the citizens' initiative."
"If you do not mind, I will switch to Dutch to explain why I am so happy!"
"(NL) Mr President, I am delighted with the European Citizens' Initiative because citizens currently have the chance to indicate their wishes just once every five years, but this way they will be able to play a genuine role in the European Union in the interim, too."
"It is also important, therefore, that they know when they can come knocking at our door."
"In fact, it is not our door but that of the European Commission."
"Does the man on the street know when it is possible to appeal to the Commission?"
"A far-reaching information campaign is necessary to let citizens know."
"I must say that the critical point to make in this regard is that the citizens' initiative will be truly mature only if all the European institutions take the one million citizens' voices seriously; and ministers and Heads of State or Government should also listen to these."
"Of course, this means that, if one million European citizens wish to dispense with the Strasbourg site, that desire too must be heeded."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that this right of initiative granted to European citizens by the treaty will help bring the peoples closer to Europe and to the European institutions to a greater degree than the costly awareness campaigns funded by the Union which, hitherto, have produced modest results: electoral turnouts confirm this."
"This initiative certainly further strengthens democracy, since it allows citizens to propose laws directly."
"In other words, it is a form of direct democracy which complements parliamentary representation."
"We must not let this opportunity slip through our fingers."
"The Commission must make this right of initiative straightforward, understandable and accessible, and assist and support citizens from the initial stage of the process through to the signature collection stage, for example, by determining the admissibility of their proposals."
"This is a practical contribution to European democracy."
"(EL) Mr President, we often refer to the need to increase the participation of European citizens, to the need for us to get closer to the Union's institutions, to the citizens of all the Member States."
"We debated this intensively at the last European elections, when we saw in many Member States that participation was particularly low."
"A very important event has occurred between then and now, which has changed the very structure and operation of the Union."
"I refer, of course, to the Treaty of Lisbon, an important treaty, the epicentre of which is the citizen, the basic pillar of which is how all of us, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, can get closer to the citizens."
"This principle finds specific expression in the citizens' initiative in Article 11(4)."
"This is an important and exceptional arrangement which promotes democracy, political equality and transparency."
"Of course, what we want is for this arrangement to be applied correctly and to see it in practice."
"This is where the problems arise."
"While all my fellow members are right to highlight the need for this procedure to be reliable, for the role of the Commission and the role of Parliament to be defined, we must all be able to work together so that this important citizens' initiative, if signatures are collected, does not go to waste."
"My conclusion is this: we all have a responsibility to promote this initiative."
"We all have a responsibility to explain this right which all our fellow European citizens now have, to give them to understand that they personally can set procedures in motion, without any other intervention, at the level of the Union's institutions."
"Above all, our message must be clear and must be contained in a simple, understandable, comprehensible procedure which, if nothing else, functions for everyone, functions for the citizens, functions for Parliament, for the Union's institutions, for the Member States and for all stakeholders in the procedure."
"(PT) Only a few months ago, some were saying that the Treaty of Lisbon would never come into force."
"Yet here we are, beginning to think about how we are going to implement it and laying down some of its provisions."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has an important contribution to make in fighting the democratic deficit."
"I am talking about the strengthening of parliaments (both the European Parliament and national parliaments)."
"Even more importantly, I am talking about investment in a Europe for the public, with rules on the area of freedom, security and justice, on monitoring subsidiarity, and with the realisation of this innovative initiative which stems from public action."
"I endorse what has been said by many of my fellow Members and especially by my colleague, Mr Méndez de Vigo, but I would like to emphasise that when regulating this instrument, we must ensure that it is truly Europe-wide."
"It needs, of course, to avoid being the expression of the will of the public in only one country or a limited number of countries. We do, however, need to seek a solution that will encourage and stimulate public involvement."
"If we have to choose between being very strict and rigorous or being more generous, I would err on the side of being more generous."
"If we come up with solutions that discourage public participation, we are betraying the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and denying the European public because, ladies and gentlemen, we need more Europe and a Europe that is aimed more at the public."
"We need the European public to have greater involvement and to actively exercise their citizenship."
"(SL) I would like to express my satisfaction and pleasure that we are today discussing this initiative which will, I am sure, reduce what we call the democratic deficit or partially eliminate it."
"Generally speaking, it is a fact that democracy is today taking a backwards step."
"As some research suggests, democratic dialogue is becoming narrower and the notion of democracy is being confined merely to democratic elections and nothing more."
"All of this has an impact on the mood of our citizens, who are becoming increasingly passive, and is reflected in low electoral turnouts, or even in a lack of trust in the institutions of democracy."
"For this reason, it is very important that we have adopted the Treaty of Lisbon because it expands the role of parliament, both the role of national parliaments and that of the European Parliament."
"Above all, it enables citizens to take forward initiatives and I am delighted that is the case."
"As a result, we are now witnessing something that we could describe as a European democracy project taking shape on a European level and I think that we have already made a major leap forward in this respect."
"However, this so-called European democracy must, of course, be further extended to cover other areas, including, for example, nominations for the European Commission."
"In brief, there are a number of areas where the European institutions involved could be further extended in democratic terms."
"I firmly believe that this project, i.e. this initiative, could greatly strengthen European democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a wonderful opportunity today: the chance to assert a value, namely the instrument of participatory democracy being offered to citizens under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The fact that after only a few months we are discussing this instrument is, in my view, in itself an absolute value that should be safeguarded."
"I am certain that it will, of course, be crucial to determine clearly and precisely what is meant by a significant number of Member States."
"We must use a criterion which combines, on the one hand, the citizens' drive to participate in the institutions and, on the other, our drive to give this instrument democratic validity."
"Naturally, the procedures must be simplified, straightforward and flexible."
"I personally have visited several schools in the last few weeks, and was met with a great willingness to listen, but, above all, I gained a great awareness of the increased role that children wish to play in a Europe which is changing, in particular, under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Therefore we need transparency, objectivity and change in order for this instrument to serve society but, at the same time, to serve the institutions."
"In this regard, Parliament is being called upon, together with the Commission and the Council, to decide, precisely, on simplified procedures."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who has brought one of the first citizens' initiative petitions into being, specifically, on the subject of protecting Sundays."
"Today, we have the pleasure of debating - and then deciding upon - a potential way of involving the citizens in the process of Europe's political work."
"That means that this is a potential way to bring about more democracy and to counter Europe-fatigue."
"That said, I am not here just to give praise."
"Rather, I have two requests to make of you, when you now take this Regulation into its final phase."
"Firstly, we Europeans are technologically advanced people."
"I would like to ask you to make the Internet the definitive medium so that a citizens' initiative with a million signatures is also admissible with electronic signatures, which are also legally binding."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step."
"I would like to go a step further."
"We now have a right of initiative for the citizens."
"It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future."
"What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum."
"It would be my wish that we should also have this in Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, public consultations on the European Citizens' Initiative have just ended, and it turns out that the consultations attracted only 323 respondents."
"This result shows that all the European Union institutions should now strongly engage in promoting this new instrument, because at the moment, it can be seen that very few people are aware of its existence."
"The results of the consultation do, however, show the direction which the Commission should take in framing appropriate executive legislation."
"Firstly, it is essential to establish common principles, which would apply throughout the Union, for the collection and authentication of signatures, and also to ensure that citizens will be subject to the same requirements, for example, as regards age."
"Another important matter is the introduction of a certain form of evaluating admissibility ex ante, with the assumption that initiatives and initiators are aware that formal recognition of admissibility is not equivalent to the Commission putting forward a legislative proposal on a particular matter."
"I am sure the European Citizens' Initiative can become an important instrument by means of which debate will be conducted in the future - broad debate on matters of interest to all Europeans."
"For this reason, I eagerly await an appropriate regulation from the Commission."
"Mr President, the use of the referendum - direct democracy - is not an exotic version of democracy."
"It is the original form - government by the people and not government on behalf of the people."
"So perhaps we should be grateful to the EU for introducing this."
"I think not."
"The EU only likes democracy when it can manage it and arrange for a result that it wants."
"We have heard that the power to call such a referendum will be limited by mischievous provisions, such as the EU's competence and the EU's own version of human rights, which, in reality, means political repression, limitation on freedom of speech and even on freedom of thought."
"One final point is that democracy means government by the people - an identifiable and cohesive unit - and not government by an arbitrary collection of persons."
"Mass migration has made this difficult to achieve."
"Europe as a whole has become even less of a single people than it might otherwise have been."
"Nevertheless, it is better than nothing, and we might, at least, demonstrate that this initiative was a hollow promise."
"(RO) I believe that the inclusion of the European Citizens' Initiative in the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon marks an important step in the consolidation of democracy in the European Union."
"Another important way of exercising and consolidating democracy is the use of referendums."
"I wish to digress at this point by telling you that three referendums have been held in Romania since 2004, with the last one on the switch to a unicameral system and a reduction in the number of MPs."
"There was a 51% turnout, with an overwhelming majority voting in favour of the proposal."
"I wish to welcome the Commission's initiative in launching a broad public consultation on the regulation online."
"This will determine the number of states from which signatures need to be collected, the minimum number of signatures from each country, and the rules for verifying them."
"I would like to end by asking the Commission when it thinks that this regulation will come into force, as I believe it must be finalised as soon as possible."
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few years, the European Union has experienced a crisis of confidence on the part of its citizens."
"One of the signs of this is the very low turnout for elections to the European Parliament, arising from the widely-held feeling that citizens cannot influence events in the EU through their vote in any way whatsoever."
"I therefore warmly welcome the possibility of citizens' initiatives which the Treaty of Lisbon opens up for EU citizens, and in this context, also the public consultation with the Commission and the Green Paper on how to bring the citizens' initiative to life in concrete terms."
"I agree in principle with most of the proposals in the Green Paper."
"However, if we hold out a helping hand, we should not at the same time be afraid that EU citizens will grasp it."
"Therefore, if we care about maximising the dialogue with citizens, I consider some of these limiting measures to be too strict."
"These mainly concern the minimum number of Member States that the citizens signing an initiative must come from, and the definition of a so-called substantial number of states."
"The proposal for one out of three states, in other words, nine at present, is, in my opinion, discouraging and unrealistic for prospective initiatives in practical terms."
"A reduction in this number to 20% would, I believe, be a step in the right direction for the general public of the EU, who will, for example, also take note of the greater emphasis being placed on the role of the macro-regions in creating EU policy."
"And why not?"
"(HU) The possibility of a European Citizens' Initiative can promote the development of public debates on European questions, leading to a true European public sphere."
"The representatives of civil society can address those social questions which the political groups now represented in the European Parliament cannot or do not wish to raise."
"Of these questions, I would like to emphasise one in particular."
"I consider it important that, parallel to the advance notice of proposals for a resolution and even before the gathering of signatures begins or perhaps after a certain number of signatures have been collected, the Commission should give an opinion, based on its own competence and on Community law, as to whether the proposal in question would be acceptable."
"A rejection on formal grounds or due to a lack of legal basis after the million signatures have been collected can portray not only the Commission but the entire European Union in a very unfavourable light."
"(LT) The Treaty of Lisbon provides for the strengthening of the role of civil society in European institutions and the opportunity for European citizens to initiate legislative proposals."
"The citizens' right of initiative would allow no fewer than a million citizens to call on the European Commission to take law-making initiatives in a specific area."
"However, collecting such an amount of voters' signatures is really difficult; therefore, in order to establish an effective mechanism for democratic participation and to ensure the accessibility of this initiative to citizens, the opportunity must be provided to initiate a proposal, with clear guidelines and a simplified and appropriate procedure."
"Unfortunately, since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the citizens' right of initiative has not been put into practice."
"None of the aspects of the citizens' initiative have been discussed yet, and there is no concrete action plan on how to guarantee the transparency of initiatives and democratic accountability, so that citizens do not fall victim to the representation of large companies' interests."
"Thus, the civil dialogue is the most important element of the democratic model of Europe and of my own country of Lithuania and is an essential foundation for this, so I call on the Commission to take all measures to ensure that this citizens' right of initiative is properly implemented as soon as possible."
"(GA) Mr President, our colleagues have done many interesting things in relation to this issue and they agreed unanimously that this is a wonderful facility to put in the hands of our citizens."
"The citizens' initiative was a powerful and convincing argument against the 'no' side in the Treaty of Lisbon referendum in Ireland, especially when they argued that it was a grab for power by the European Union rather than a truly democratic attempt to involve the citizens."
"But there is a big difference between putting something into a treaty and putting it into effect, and there is a big challenge here for us."
"On the one hand, there is a danger - and a real danger - that the process could be hijacked by vested interest groups and by powerful lobbies who would have no difficulty in getting a million signatures."
"That is why the suggestion by my colleague, Mr De Rossa, concerning the involvement of the Ombudsman, might be well worth considering."
"On the other hand, however, this has real possibilities for citizens."
"One initiative started by my colleague, Mr de Castro, is well worth considering, that of making Sunday special and whether we want to rest on the seventh day, like our creator, or treat it the same as any other day of the week."
"That is an important consideration."
"So I think there is great scope here, and I look forward to its development."
"Mr President, I must express my deep satisfaction regarding the debate that has taken place."
"This was, moreover, a debate that has taken place at the request of Parliament, which specifically wanted this debate to be held on the citizens' initiative, and I consider there have been a string of speeches in which I have seen absolutely unanimous support for this as a priority of the Spanish Presidency of the Council."
"Furthermore, there is support for it to be carried out quickly."
"In this respect, I believe that Mr Šefčovič's announcement of the presentation of the text of the regulation on 31 March was welcomed with great satisfaction by all of you as well."
"Once again, I thank the Commission for the speed, concern and enthusiasm with which it has dealt with this matter and the fact that we can therefore, as of now, begin this legislative procedure."
"I hope that it will end as soon as possible with the setting in motion of this legislative initiative, which almost everyone who spoke considers necessary, urgent and indispensable."
"I believe that this can, moreover, be interpreted as support by all the parliamentary groups and all the honourable Members, including those who, like Mr Kamall, in his extraordinary speech, supported the popular legislative initiative because, in his opinion, it will weaken the European Union."
"Mr Kamall is not here... I am sorry that he is not, I am sorry to give him bad news and discourage him, because this initiative will strengthen the European Union, not weaken it at all."
"It will strengthen it because it is an initiative which, in short, strengthens the two essential concepts of the European Union: democracy and citizenship."
"These are the two main political pillars of the European Union: democracy and citizenship."
"This is an initiative which, to some extent, tries to offset that paradox which we see: a European Union that is increasingly powerful, and Parliament is proof of that; that is increasingly influential; and that has an ever greater effect on the lives of the public."
"Yet it is a European Union that is unconnected with the debate that is carried out in each country."
"It is a paradox that affects democracy itself."
"This citizens' initiative will, as Mr Méndez de Vigo said, extend a series of debates of European importance, on issues that are European, not local."
"This is because it forces contact between people from different countries; therefore, it is clearly European in effect."
"It is undoubtedly one way of strengthening this democracy, and also the citizenship or European demos referred to by Mr Casini, who is, moreover, Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which will, for the most part, be dealing with this initiative."
"That citizenship that Mr Jáuregui considered so important in his speech, that so much represents the roots of the European Union; or Mr Sógor, who referred to it as well; or Mr Häfner, who mentioned it too."
"As Mr Kastler also said, this initiative must be applied."
"It is an appeal to citizens, because European civic identity develops when it is put into practice; not simply when a right is obtained, but when that right is put into practice and exercised."
"That is what I think is the important thing that should happen as soon as this citizens' initiative enters into force."
"I once again repeat my thanks to the Commission and to Parliament, which, I am sure, will deal with this matter meticulously, thoroughly and swiftly."
"Mr Iacolino mentioned a particularly speedy procedure to enable us to see this initiative emerge as soon as possible and Mrs Băsescu, in her speech, also appealed for the speed with which we want to see the initiative set in motion."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would first like to thank Diego for an excellent summary of today's debate."
"I would like to thank all of you for your support and positive expectations linked to the citizens' initiative."
"I can assure you that I will be happy to present to you the proposal at the earliest convenience after its adoption."
"Because of time constraints and the fact that the proposal is not yet finalised, we could not go into details today."
"However, I am very thankful for your views and opinions because they really reflected the nature and the quality of the views and opinions we have been collecting in the preparations of the European Citizens' Initiative."
"There are many things on which we all agree."
"The first one is, clearly, transparency."
"I can assure you that we are looking for a solution which would guarantee, through the registration of the initiative by the Commission, that we would know who the organisers are and how they are financed."
"We would have a very strong indication whether the initiative is really genuine, whether it is really a citizens' initiative, and whether it is really a European initiative."
"I think it must include all these elements in order to make good and successful use of this new instrument."
"We all agree on practicality. We would like to have a system which is user-friendly."
"We would like to create a system where the citizens would not have the feeling that they have to go through a very burdensome procedure to collect or to give their signatures."
"We are looking into these opportunities and, of course, we are looking into ways in which modern IT technology - so characteristic of our century - can be used."
"It is clear that there are different systems for the verification of signatures in the Member States."
"One of the clear responses we gathered from the public consultation was that the citizens would prefer having a certain uniformity when it comes to the verification and the collection of signatures."
"At the same time, we got the clear message from the Member States that we should look for a system which would not be too burdensome or too complicated for the national authorities, because it would be the Member States who would have to verify that the signatures collected for the citizens' initiative are real and genuine."
"I listened very carefully to your calls for having very clear procedures once the initiative is successful and once the signatures are collected."
"I would like to assure you that we will definitely do that. In the proposal, there will be very clear deadlines - when, how and in what timeframe the Commission will have to react when the citizens' initiative is successful."
"As you have listened to the opinions here, you will agree with me that the most difficult issue we have to tackle is the issue of admissibility - how we can find a solution which would avoid the frustration of citizens, how we can protect EU values, and how we can keep this institute of the European Citizens' Initiative serious and real."
"I can assure you that there are no easy answers to these questions and to these slightly contradictory requests."
"The Commission is looking into the option which would defend European values and human rights from the outset."
"At the same time, we would like to have a clear view that the proposals for the citizens' initiative have a genuine potential to be successful."
"We would like to avoid possible abuse where we might get proposals for the initiative every second week on nonsensical issues on which there would be an obligation to pronounce a view on admissibility, and then for it to be appealed to the Court - initiatives whose only reason for proposal would be the self-promotion of the potential organisers for negative political agenda."
"We have also to bear this in mind."
"I hope that we will find the right balance on how to keep this admissibility check in adequate proportion."
"To give a short answer to Vice-President Durant's question concerning communication with civil society, I think that the European Citizens' Initiative is the best answer."
"We have a very good structured dialogue organised by the European Economic and Social Committee and I had a very lengthy debate with them just two weeks ago."
"I think that strong and wide public consultations are taking place through the smart-legislating proposals."
"We will widen this and use it even more in the future."
"In view of the time, let me conclude by saying that I am really looking forward to being back soon with a proposal."
"I look forward to our mutual discussion on this issue and what I hope will be very dynamic and speedy procedures so that we can have this very important instrument approved as soon as possible."
"The item is hereby closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The new legislative framework on the European Citizens' Initiative is undoubtedly welcome."
"There had long been a case for citizens to have access to such an instrument."
"On the other hand, I share the sentiments of those who have taken the floor today and called for the regulations which will be used as the basis for implementing the citizens' initiative to be simple, accessible, easy to understand and involve as little red tape as possible."
"This is the only way that the citizens' initiative will actually manage to become a proper instrument available to Europeans, which they can use to make their voice heard."
"This is the only way that the EU will successfully move closer to its citizens and become more democratic."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives the citizens of the European Union the right to propose a legislative initiative."
"This is one of the most important steps in the building of civil democracy and direct inclusion of the citizens in the EU decision-making process."
"The European Citizens' Initiative can contribute to a reduction in the gap between the institutions and the citizens, and can support the development of European civil society."
"Therefore, rapid adoption of a regulation to govern the process, conditions and procedures for presentation of such an initiative is essential."
"The citizens of the European Union eagerly await this."
"The European Citizens' Initiative is mainly about greater involvement of the citizens in creating European law."
"Therefore, I would like to raise the matter of digital signatures in the citizens' initiative, as an additional channel for attracting interest in European politics."
"Since we can already vote via the Internet and carry out banking operations online, we are certainly able to develop a secure system which would allow us to identify digital signatures."
"Transparency of procedures is also important."
"The organisers of initiatives must be publicly responsible for transparency concerning the financing of the campaign to collect signatures."
"Even the establishment of clear criteria for the course of such a campaign does not ensure protection from possible abuses of this instrument by Eurosceptics, for whom collecting a million signatures, with the use of significant financial resources, may not constitute a major problem, as the last European Parliament election campaign showed."
"One solution could be to oblige initiators to maintain an Internet site containing financial information, such as sources of income, expenses and financial reports."
"Today's debate is another step on the road to establishing the final form of the European Citizens' Initiative."
"The idea to create a tool enabling the citizens to participate more fully in the democratic life of the Union was mooted as far back as 2005 after the unsuccessful constitutional referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"Those votes reflected a noticeable lack of communication between the European Union and its citizens."
"Even the recently published results of the social consultations, starting with the Green Paper on a European Citizens' Initiative, show the low level of interest on the part of individual citizens."
"The Commission received as few as 159 responses from individuals."
"The citizens' initiative makes it possible for us to change this situation and give a stronger voice to our citizens by giving them the right to call directly on the Commission to bring forward new policy initiatives."
"To guarantee that the initiative does not become an instrument in a political game, we must not make demands of our citizens which are too strict."
"However, we must make sure that guarantees against abuses are met."
"It is important that the European Citizens' Initiative be a truly supranational instrument which will be citizen-friendly and easy to use."
"It should be simple, understandable and easily accessible."
"If the draft of an initiative does not meet formal requirements, its idea should remain and be presented in the form of a petition."
"In this way, the work put into its preparation and the effort invested will not be wasted."
"Fulfilment of these conditions will allow Europeans, for the first time in the history of our integrated Europe, to have a real and direct influence on the creation of European policy."
"Situation in Tibet (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission's statement on the situation in Tibet."
"Mr President, I see that the EU Spanish Presidency is leaving the meeting room, so I would like to express my deep disappointment that neither the Spanish Presidency nor the High Representative will be present for this discussion and that their seats will be empty."
"It is a disgraceful move against the European Parliament, which is the only EU institution elected by the people of Europe, and it sets a very bad precedent, especially having the Treaty of Lisbon in force."
"May I ask you, Mr President, to forward to those who will be absent that the agenda of the plenary session is decided by Parliament, not by the Council and not by the EU Spanish Presidency, and that at least one of them should have been present here today."
"I was informed that the Spanish Presidency had already announced earlier, a month ago, that, to its greatest regret, it cannot stay beyond this time."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for putting this issue up for debate today, because I think that it is worth discussing and I think we should start by stating the fact that our relationship with China - which we consider to be very important and strategic - has made enormous progress over the last number of years."
"Having such a strong strategic partnership would and does definitely permit us to tackle all issues, including the most sensitive ones."
"We have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interactions where we regularly address the global challenges that our citizens are facing without neglecting the issues where our views may differ - and Tibet is definitely one of them."
"It is evident that differences with China on Tibet remain."
"We have real concerns about the human rights situation in Tibet, about the fact that Tibet has remained largely closed to international media, diplomats and humanitarian organisations and also about the lack of progress in talks between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities."
"The EU position does not leave any room for misinterpretation."
"Therefore, let me stress: the EU respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, including Tibet."
"We respect the 'one China' policy."
"However, we have always supported peaceful reconciliation through dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"This dialogue has to be constructive and substantive, addressing all core issues such as the preservation of Tibet's unique culture, religion and traditions and the need to achieve a system of meaningful autonomy for Tibet within the Chinese Constitution."
"The dialogue should also address the participation of all Tibetans in decision making."
"For the EU, Tibet is a human rights issue."
"We have consistently passed this message on to our Chinese counterparts and listened carefully to their views, and we make every effort to understand their position in a spirit of mutual respect."
"But human rights are universal, and the situation in Tibet is a legitimate concern for the international community, a point that we regularly make to our Chinese interlocutors."
"In the Sino-Tibetan dialogue, the Tibetan side has recently submitted an updated memorandum on genuine autonomy for the future of Tibet."
"We welcome that the Tibetan side has reiterated its firm commitment not to seek separation or independence."
"We are also pleased that the Dalai Lama remains committed to the middle-way approach and to dialogue as the only means for achieving a mutually acceptable and lasting solution."
"The EU welcomes the fact that both parties continue to hold talks even if we note with regret the lack of results and the lack of momentum."
"Let me conclude by appealing to the representatives of the two sides to continue and intensify the dialogue with an open spirit and with a view to achieving a durable solution in Tibet."
"From our side, I can guarantee the EU's wholehearted support to such a process."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the ninth round of Sino-Tibetan talks failed to produce any concrete results and has not improved the situation of the Tibetan population on the ground."
"We regret the absence of any statement by the EU before the end of the talks, and hope that the European Union will release a statement on the evaluation of the outcome of the talks."
"The European Parliament would like to know in what way the EU Council could help create a mutually acceptable solution to the Tibet issue and ensure basic human rights and genuine autonomy for Tibetans."
"My second point is to remind you that the European Parliament insists on the importance of the European Commission supporting development and civil society projects in favour of the Tibetan population in Tibet and of Tibetan refugees in exile - in India, Nepal, Bhutan - in economic and social fields such as health and nutrition, livelihoods and education, access to jobs, gender issues, the environment and the revitalisation of settlements."
"On this last point, the Tibetan revitalisation plan for refugee settlements, drawn up by the central Tibetan administration in Dharamsala, presents the needs of the Tibetan community in exile and could be taken into account and supported by the European Commission."
"Finally, President Obama recently met with the Dalai Lama in the White House."
"We look forward to seeing Baroness Ashton inviting the Dalai Lama and meeting him in Brussels."
"This would create an opportunity to start coordinating national positions on Tibet and to define a unified and clear EU position and policy on this issue."
"The appointment of an EU special coordinator for Tibet, which is mentioned in the EU budget, could be a useful tool in helping to define a common European position and strategy on Tibet."
"Mr President, it is now two years since the events, the uprisings, in Tibet, and we hope that, following the demonstrations on this occasion, there will be no repetition of the assaults, arrests and deaths that occurred two years ago."
"In any event, the timeliness of this debate is very doubtful, because Parliament has stated its opinion on the issue of China on a number of occasions over the last few months and, above all, because China is a big international player whose relations with the European Union go well beyond the issue of Tibet."
"Although the issue of human rights is very important, Parliament only states its opinion on Tibet and not on human rights."
"At any event, in this debate, our position, the socialist position, is very clear: we hold exactly the same position as the European Union."
"In other words, we defend human rights and we also defend dialogue, meeting and agreement."
"In this respect, we are entirely in favour of and delighted by the resumption of negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of Tibet, and we plead for a mutually acceptable solution based on respect for the religious and cultural rights of minorities and within the framework of the territorial integrity of the single State of China."
"I deeply regret the fact that the Vice-President of the Commission and the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is not here, because it is she who chairs the Foreign Affairs Council and who ought to attend debates on foreign policy."
"Furthermore, to say that the Spanish Presidency is wrong not to be present at this debate is deeply unfair, because the Spanish Presidency is indefatigable."
"Mr López Garrido's presence in this House to talk about all matters is almost superhuman."
"We have equipped ourselves with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who presides over the positions of ministers on matters of foreign policy and it is she who ought to debate these issues with Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems clear that China has no intention of negotiating or engaging in dialogue with regard to Tibet."
"China's involvement in international trade, the Olympic Games and past changes in Beijing's leadership have not led to any substantive change in policy."
"In the meantime, the David versus Goliath struggle continues, especially with China altering the demographic balance in Tibet, which is of great concern, and, when necessary, even using military repression, as happened two years ago."
"In particular, something which, in our view, is part of the heritage of mankind, namely Tibetan culture and spirituality, is disappearing."
"Obviously, China's Communist Party knows very little of spirituality and cultural identity."
"In this respect, if we accept what could be defined as cultural genocide in Tibet, we will have to be prepared to accept many more episodes of this kind in the future."
"We must not give up."
"What we are asking, first and foremost of the Chinese, is to accept Tibetan culture for what it is."
"They accepted the specific nature of Hong Kong being a country with two systems, so they should accept being a country with three systems."
"China's shoulders are broad enough to enable it do so."
"We are asking the European institutions, from Baroness Ashton to the Council, not to let down the European citizens who have shown their attachment to the Tibetan cause in many ways."
"We are also supporting - as is Mrs Andrikien- the creation of a coordinator for Tibet."
"This is a battle for freedom which therefore concerns the identity of our continent."
"When it comes to whether or not to renew the arms embargo on China, I think we should take this matter into account too."
"(FI) Mr President, I, too, strongly condemn the Spanish Presidency for walking out of this House."
"They did not even listen to what Mrs Andrikienwas saying."
"She asked the Council to have the courage to be present during this debate and express their view of the Tibet question."
"Mr President, you made a mistake: you said that Spain had stated that they could be here until 18.50."
"This is not true."
"They had originally said that they had to leave at 17.00, but they were obviously able to be here for almost two hours longer when the citizens' initiative was being discussed."
"There must be no repeat of this."
"I assume that the Commission, whose VicePresident is Baroness Ashton, is in earnest and will do what it just said it would."
"That is, our relations with China are so important that we must also be able to discuss difficult issues such as the Tibet question."
"I take the view that now is just the right time to renew the European Union's support for Tibet."
"We must do something about the fact that nine rounds of negotiations between China and the Tibetan Governmentinexile have not led to any outcome, and I completely agree with Mr Rinaldi here."
"It would appear that China does not want anything from the talks."
"China wants to continue to violate Tibetan cultural, religious and language rights."
"We cannot accept cultural genocide of this sort."
"A month ago, I went to Dharamsala and I met the Dalai Lama."
"I talked with him for an hour just before he left for the United States to meet President Obama."
"I was convinced that I had to propose in Parliament that we should discuss the situation in Tibet."
"The Dalai Lama is a calm, peaceful person, and it is quite wrong for China to claim continually that he is a dangerous separatist and that he caused the unrest and riots we witnessed in Tibet two years ago."
"On the contrary, the Dalai Lama has said that representatives of China are welcome to study documents in the archives of his governmentinexile in order to assure themselves that he had not fomented violence."
"Despite this, the claims persist."
"I am calling on the European Union to condemn these remarks and raise the matter with China."
"If the European Union is not bold enough to defend Tibet, not many others will."
"We can take a leaf from President Obama's book: he had the courage to receive the Dalai Lama."
"In my opinion, it would be a very normal gesture if the European Union's High Representative also did something similar, as has been proposed here."
"We need to keep this matter alive in the European Parliament."
"Reference was also made here to the fact that we need a special representative for Tibet."
"We have all kinds of special representatives."
"Why could we not have a special representative for Tibet, for whom there is even cash in this year's budget?"
"It is quite intolerable that the Council should walk out of this debate."
"The Council is cowardly and does not have the courage to face up to this problem, which is a question of defending human rights."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the fate of the people of Tibet and their remarkable Buddhist culture remains uppermost in the minds of those of us in this House who believe in human rights."
"Since the Communist forces of the People's Republic of China (PRC) invaded 61 years ago, Tibetans have faced a systematic suppression of their unique way of life."
"The mass migration of Han Chinese and the arrival of the high-altitude railway at Lhasa have further consolidated Beijing's hold on Tibet."
"Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama, from his Indian exile, continues his peaceful campaign to highlight the situation faced by his people."
"Uighur jihadists have also exploited recent unrest in Tibet to foment their own violence against the Chinese Government."
"Tibet should be given the maximum possible autonomy and we know that this is possible under the 'one country, two systems' mantra that applies not just to Hong Kong but also to Macao, so why not Tibet?"
"Beijing will undoubtedly dismiss our concerns in this Parliament as an unwarranted intrusion into their internal affairs, but a fresh and more relaxed approach to Tibet by the PRC could well pay dividends for China's internal security as well as its external image in the world."
"I would also like to add my voice to those who deeply regret today the fact that there is no presence from the Council or from the rotating Spanish Presidency, or that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs is not present."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was stunned by Commissioner Šefčovič's words just now when he said that we respect the territorial integrity of China."
"This means that the Commission recognises China's right to occupy Tibet, which is a very serious matter."
"While the Tibetan people continue to be threatened, the Dalai Lama, in the 2008 Memorandum and in the Notes attached to it this year, has confirmed his commitment not to seek the separation and independence of Tibet, but effective autonomy for the Tibetan people within the framework of the constitution of the People's Republic of China: a compromise policy of mutual benefit aimed at preserving Tibet's culture, based on compassion and non-violence."
"The Tibetan people expect responses from the Chinese Government; for example, talks with the Dalai Lama's representatives and consenting to the request made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to send a delegation to uncover the harsh reality."
"The European Parliament should also listen to the Tibetan community."
"By strengthening national synergies, it could try to establish a European coordination network for the Tibetan people who, without robust action on the part of the international community, are in danger of being wiped out."
"Madam President, Tibet is a beautiful country and its people are devout, they are patient and they are oppressed - probably the most oppressed by the Chinese in that whole region."
"I think that the debate this evening has shown an extraordinary consensus of view around Parliament on, for example, the appointment by the EU of a special coordinator for Tibet."
"Events push us towards making some decisions in this House."
"This week, Google has abandoned China."
"We have the continuing problems of human rights in China, with the disappearance of the Christian human rights lawyer, Gao Zhisheng."
"All these things highlight the attention we need to pay to China, and indeed Tibet, and I would like to remark that, with the Shanghai World Expo opening in May, all people doing business in China should have regard to the United Nations Global Compact for businesses, some 4 000 of whom have signed up to it."
"Finally, can I just say that, if the EU will not appoint a special coordinator, I believe Parliament should appoint a rapporteur for Tibet."
"(PL) Madam President, the matter of Tibet and of the Tibetans continues, unfortunately, to be an important problem."
"The situation is not as bad as it was two years ago, when the anniversary of the Tibetan uprising was accompanied by brutal persecution, murders and torture."
"On the other hand, we cannot say that the situation is good."
"Several days ago, some schoolchildren were arrested for attempting to celebrate the anniversary of the uprising in Gansu and Kanlho."
"Tibetans are forbidden from doing anything to rescue their own culture, identity and religion."
"The Chinese authorities say that the Dalai Lama is a private person."
"This reminds me of the efforts of Polish Communists, who, 25 years ago, said the same about Lech Wałęsa."
"I hope the Tibetans' struggle will end with the same success as the Poles achieved, and that truth will be victorious this time, too."
"Today, the 21st meeting of the Tibetan Task Force for Sino-Tibetan Negotiations begins in Dharamsala."
"This is an institution which operates under the auspices of the Tibetan government- in-exile and is intended to help in this dialogue."
"It seems to me that the European Union, too, should do something to ensure that the dialogue is genuine."
"Sometimes, we complain that not much can be done, but in this case, we can take specific measures, and this has already been mentioned, today."
"This is why the absence of the Council is so important - our appeals are directed to the Council, which appoints special coordinators."
"I, too, subscribe to this appeal, because this request has been expressed many times in the European Parliament's resolutions on Tibet - the request for a special coordinator, who will have a real influence on the dialogue which is taking place between the Tibetans and the Chinese."
"One more thing: I cannot understand how it is that in 2014, China is going to host another Olympic Games event - this time it will be the Youth Olympic Games - while we are unable to force China to make advances in the field of human rights."
"This is sad, indeed."
"(HU) Madam President, I am convinced that our image of the Tibetan processes is an oversimplified one."
"The area is undergoing a process of modernisation while, at the same time, the criticisms that have been expressed are justified."
"It is clear that the only lasting solution would be autonomy, and indeed an expanded, true autonomy."
"As I pointed out in Beijing, during our visit, when the European Parliament's delegation was there, by analogy with the 'one country, two social systems' approach, this autonomy could be developed along the lines of 'one country, two religious systems'."
"It is not enough to formulate criticisms."
"China would be open to dialogue, open to an official representative of the European Union, be it Romano Prodi or Benita Ferrero-Waldner or Margot Wallström, serving as a mediator between the Dalai Lama and the Beijing leadership."
"It would be good if the Commission, Ms Catherine Ashton and the Council thought this through."
"At the same time, we are talking about Chinese relations, but do my fellow Members know that the European Council has never in the course of its history put the relationship between the European Union and China on the agenda?"
"Nor was it ever debated in the Council of Foreign Ministers."
"Therefore, in order for us to succeed, criticism on the matter of Tibet is not enough."
"We also need a conception and mediation."
"(PL) Madam President, I greatly regret that this important and necessary debate is being held in the significant absence, or perhaps I should say the insignificant absence, of Mrs Ashton."
"She, in particular, should be here, today, and should not only participate in theatrical performances as she did yesterday, when she spoke to the Members of six Committees about her plans on the subject of the European External Action Service."
"After all, Tibet is also an important challenge."
"We may agree or disagree on Tibet, but, really, Mrs Ashton should be here."
"It seems to me that this shows the European Union wants to wash its hands, because it is easier that way, because, in fact, many Member States, whose representatives are Members of this Parliament, prefer to do business with Beijing, and it would not be convenient for them to express an opinion or speak about China."
"Today, Mrs Ashton is like Pontius Pilate, who washed his hands."
"This is embarrassing."
"(DE) Madam President, recently, we have heard time and again of serious violations of human rights in Tibet, of torture, of cases of arbitrary arrest and detention without trial."
"When the occasion of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Chinese rule in Tibet is used to espouse a view of a liberation of the Himalaya region, it is a little bit rich!"
"This shows, once again, that history is written by the victors and that there is always great invention in the justification of acts of war."
"That is also an art, by the way, that is being exploited in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and one in which the United States has also found some support amongst a few Member States of this Union."
"Nonetheless, we must still, in my view, continue our efforts to obtain better living conditions for oppressed minorities such as the Tibetans, the Uighurs and the Mongols."
"It is not enough to offer minority rights in the form of purely folkloristic performances for foreign tourists."
"I believe the fact that, over recent years, China has spent approximately EUR 15 billion on developing the region and that, in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games, it also stated that it was willing to hold talks, shows that international pressure absolutely can bear fruit."
"(RO) Mr Kaczmarek spoke earlier about the protests in 2008."
"Two years have passed since then and we do not even know today how many people were detained, how many were arrested and, subsequently, how many were perhaps released."
"We do know what these people were doing: they were participating in a peaceful demonstration, waving Tibetan flags or distributing pamphlets."
"It is shocking that two years after these protests, we do not know exactly how many of these people were involved in the action and punished by the Communist Party."
"Indeed, I am concerned about the Chinese Communist Party's interference in the independent operation of the justice system by requesting people's arrests and rapid convictions."
"National security cannot be used as grounds for abolishing fundamental civil rights."
"I also want to take this opportunity to emphasise the need to adopt a common European position on human rights and the protection of minorities in China."
"If we fail to adopt such a position, we know what happens."
"We have seen it in the past where Chinese Communist leaders try to intimidate EU Member States individually."
"I would like to end by reiterating the position which I also expressed during the January plenary, namely, that dialogue on human rights is an instrument which has proved to be ineffective and inadequate."
"I believe that this issue must be dealt with during summit meetings."
"In fact, Catherine Ashton admitted yesterday during the meeting we had as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the approach based on human rights dialogues needs to be reviewed."
"I agree with the High Representative in this regard."
"(PL) Madam President, I can understand why businesses and private entities put profit above respect for human and civil rights."
"I can even understand why individual countries behave this way, but I cannot understand why the European Union is doing this, because the European Union was established on values which, today, we call European values."
"What is the European Union's reaction to the very events which we are talking about at the moment?"
"The absence of Mrs Ashton - we have spoken about this - the exit of the representative of the Council at precisely the moment when we began to talk about Tibet, and, finally, the Commissioner's initial speech."
"Mr Šefčovič, you said you are appealing to both sides for dialogue."
"Was that a joke?"
"Do you really mean to appeal to the representatives of Tibet for that dialogue?"
"I was under the impression that they are willing for this."
"If you have the courage, please appeal, principally, to the Chinese authorities, because it is they who are making this dialogue impossible."
"Madam President, Tibet and its cultural heritage is our common treasure."
"It is in our common interests that the Tibetan identity, religion and language be preserved and developed under the best possible conditions."
"Sadly, this is not the case."
"Under the cover of industrial development, there is cultural genocide taking place and Tibetans are on the verge of becoming a minority in their homeland."
"This can be prevented only by granting them a genuine autonomous status."
"The EU can be influential in contributing to the start of an unprejudiced and constructive dialogue that would respect both sides."
"I would note, Commissioner, your statement that Tibet is our legitimate concern."
"As a result of such a dialogue, and through opening up Tibet to foreign media and UN human rights experts, the Chinese Government has everything to gain, not only domestically but, most of all, internationally."
"China can become truly great only by showing respect towards its minorities."
"As a goodwill gesture, the Dalai Lama, whose authority is recognised worldwide, should be allowed to visit his homeland."
"The EU should take full advantage of the Lisbon Treaty in showing active solidarity - through concrete acts - with the fate of a nation whose existence is under threat and whose natural right to autonomy and safeguarding its culture is being harshly repressed."
"I support the idea that Baroness Ashton should meet with the Dalai Lama and that the EU should provide for a special representative for Tibet after all."
"(SK) On 10 March, we commemorated the 51st anniversary of the uprising in Tibet, but also the second anniversary of the protests, both violently suppressed by the Chinese armed forces."
"The main issue is the unwillingness of China to hold a dialogue with the legitimate representatives of the Tibetan minority, and the attempt at gradual assimilation and the destruction of culture and religion in Tibet."
"I know personally what a godless and materialistic communist regime is capable of."
"One of the oldest cultures and one of the oldest religions, which have survived for many millennia, are in grave danger."
"The global public cannot remain silent."
"I myself am a member of the Friends of Tibet group in the European Parliament."
"Such groups now operate in many of the world's parliaments, for example, in the US, Germany, Australia, India, the Czech Republic and elsewhere."
"I am proud to announce that, from 9 March, a Friends of Tibet group will also be operating in the National Council of the Slovak Republic."
"I believe that together, we can help to solve the Tibetan problem by mediating negotiations between top Chinese representatives and His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama."
"This is also a possible way to successfully conclude and resolve the problem of Tibetan refugees, most of whom live under difficult conditions in neighbouring countries."
"I appeal to the Commission not to forget this hard-pressed group of people in its programmes."
"(PL) Madam President, we are optimistic about today's debate, because it seems to me there is a great deal of unanimity here."
"However, on the other hand, there have, in fact, already been very many such debates here, and we are very good at talking."
"I do not want to fly into a holy rage because I am a hypocrite, just like basically everyone in this Chamber."
"A hypocrite who is dependent on something - on those cheap goods from China."
"However, at this moment perhaps, we ought to have enough self-respect to speak categorically and oppose certain things, and to respect those ideals which are dear to us."
"Perhaps the first and most important step will be something which has already been mentioned here, something we have talked about."
"I am referring to the appointment of a special coordinator for Tibet."
"Someone who will guide the process, someone who will take responsibility on our behalf for the challenge related to the problem of Tibet, so that we will not sit on the fence, and so that we will say firmly and resolutely that human rights and civil liberties are important to us."
"Let us do this."
"Let us do it now."
"(ES) Madam President, talking about Tibet here today is a matter of justice and a matter of responsibility."
"I therefore disagree with those who think that this issue 'was not of concern'."
"We have been reporting this matter for many years and I am concerned to see that, despite the enormous efforts being made by the Tibetan delegation, and especially the Dalai Lama, to promote dialogue, to move closer to the Chinese authorities, to find a fair and lasting solution to this conflict, the blockade situation is continually caused by the Chinese authorities."
"We in the European Union cannot go on putting up with this game, far less fuel it."
"I therefore consider it essential not only to once again remind you of the urgency and relevance of this debate, but also to remind you anew that the one currently standing in the way of a solution is China."
"We must also be clear in this respect."
"The only way in which the European Union can be consistent when it says that it is committed to human rights is by accepting that it must also bear a cost in terms of business and in economic terms."
"Otherwise, nothing will be credible in terms of human rights."
"Madam President, on 10 March, we celebrated the 51st anniversary of the popular uprising in Tibet."
"Since then, through his consistent and persistent commitment to represent genuine autonomy for his people, the Dalai Lama has offered the world a model on how to pursue democracy through non-violent means."
"We Europeans keep learning from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama."
"Recently, he voiced his solidarity with the ethnic Uighur minority and he took the side of Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratic dissidents."
"Here in the European Parliament, we are committed to ensuring the protection of human and minority rights around the world."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, I will go straight to the Commissioner for clarification."
"For me, Tibet is an occupied country, and I believe that many other Members in this House, across all the groups, share this view."
"Even you, Commissioner, cannot render international law null and void."
"I believe this to be a concern that really pulls on the heart strings of every European citizen."
"Everyone knows of the sorrows and the cultural genocide in Tibet, and everyone feels sympathy, and it is only right to ask the important question: where is the EU in all this?"
"We are very quick to judge small countries that commit transgressions."
"We react strongly, and we pass our judgment on small countries very quickly."
"Yet, when it comes to judging large countries, economically important countries such as China, we are very careful politically."
"We tread on eggshells, both politically and diplomatically."
"It is no sign of courage and backbone for us to tear into the minor offenders only to screw our eyes shut when it comes to China."
"We are likewise unable to put pressure on China through millions in development aid."
"I therefore expect the High Representative..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SL) I am one of the few who recently had an opportunity to visit Tibet."
"Progress of some sort has come to Tibet, but this progress has resulted in more bad than good, because it has broken down traditional cultural values, marginalised traditional Tibetan architecture and imposed a modernised image on Tibet's spiritual life."
"Rivers have been polluted and motorways which blot the Tibetan landscape have appeared."
"However, there is some progress under way in Tibet."
"We cannot deny that and I think that our demands on, and expectations of, China should go hand in hand with a demand that Tibet should also benefit from this progress, and that life there should not just go on as if in a museum."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I think that the debate today once again has clearly shown that we have genuine concerns over the situation in Tibet."
"I think that the interventions have underlined that these concerns remain real and legitimate more than 50 years after the Tibetan uprising on 10 March 1959."
"Moreover, our discussion has underlined the necessity for both parties to promptly resume dialogues."
"I can inform you that the European Union welcomes the resumption of the dialogue between the envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government, which was restarted again in September 2002."
"Since then, we have strongly supported this dialogue and hope that this process will lead to positive results and to resolving outstanding issues in a peaceful and sustainable way for Tibet."
"In its political dialogue and in its further contacts with China, the EU's representatives regularly encourage China to use this process pragmatically in order to address all outstanding issues relating to Tibet."
"While China considers this to be an internal matter, it took note of EU views and concerns and informed the EU of its own point of view on the matter."
"I have to underline that the EU also raises the human rights situation in Tibet in its political dialogue and in its human rights dialogue with China."
"Moreover, the EU consistently stresses the importance that it attaches to the respect of freedom of expression and of religion in Tibet."
"We closely followed the latest development in this dialogue, and the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is taking its course."
"I can inform you that during the past month, we have been debriefed by both sides on the latest round of talks and have encouraged them again to make substantial progress."
"To conclude, let me express my belief that the debate here today has also confirmed our continued commitment to the involvement with China on this issue and the work we will be pursuing together with the aim to achieve improvement of the respect of human rights and freedoms in Tibet."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two years ago in Lhasa, peaceful protests were made by a number of monks, to which the Chinese authorities responded with brutal intervention from the police and the army."
"Dozens of civilians were killed and several hundred were wounded."
"Since that time, the Tibetans have held over 200 peaceful protests, with the involvement of a variety of social groups, including teachers, students and intellectuals."
"In the previous parliamentary term, the European Parliament adopted eight resolutions on Tibet and debated the matter many times."
"The results of these efforts are still not satisfactory."
"Recently, the Chinese authorities detained 30 pupils from a school in Machu, who, on the second anniversary of the events in Lhasa at the beginning of March, gave expression once again to their convictions and began a peaceful protest."
"We have, doubtless, not even heard about many similar incidents."
"Therefore, I propose that this problem be included in the responsibilities of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and given a broader perspective."
"This would be followed by specific action and, I hope, visible results. Thank you for your attention."
"The media, today, are full of information about China."
"Reports, articles and books write unremittingly about China's development and modernisation, and about the economic miracle which is taking place there."
"In this context, the media have, recently, also been writing about Tibet."
"The American magazine Newsweek stated in a recent report that 'China is doing a lot of good for the Tibetans', because it is helping what is one of the world's poorest regions to emerge from its backward state."
"The report points to Chinese investment in transport and telecommunications infrastructure, education, health and access to water and electricity."
"So it seems that President Hu Jintao's plan is being put into effect, which, while improving Tibetans' standard of living, is attempting to force them to relinquish their freedom of speech, freedom of religion and aspirations for autonomy."
"However, can his strategy be successful?"
"The unrest in Lhasa, which broke out two years ago on the anniversary of the anti-Chinese uprising, as well as the events of two weeks ago, have shown most emphatically that the Tibetans feel persecuted in their own land."
"The history of my own country has taught me that any price would be worth paying for liberty and dignity."
"Economic interests cannot be made a reason to forget the persecuted and the suffering."
"It seems to me that the European Parliament is a body which should call particularly strongly for the right of the Tibetans to preserve their identity."
"We represent, here, the people of the European Union, and on their behalf we should assure the Tibetans of our solidarity."
"On 10 March 1959, the Tibetan people, in a revolutionary mood, defended their leader, but their initial enthusiasm was mercilessly crushed by the Chinese communist regime's 'peaceful liberation' that claimed several thousand civilian victims."
"Since then, the Dalai Lama, forced into exile, has been conducting his peaceful protest for half a century."
"Since that time, Tibetans have not been allowed to commemorate that day freely."
"In Eastern Europe, where I come from, the story is a familiar one."
"Although here, it seems that we have done away with similar practices on the part of communist systems, I think that we should not forget the lessons: in every people's history, there are events whose commemoration should not be forbidden."
"However, what we are talking about here is more than that."
"As a representative of a national minority community, I empathise with the plight of the Tibetan people, and ask my fellow Members to support with their votes Tibet's peaceful efforts along the path to autonomy."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150."
"Rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item."
"We had more than 74 requests to speak under this item."
"That will clearly not be possible."
"Thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work."
"Therefore, we have, for the first time, selected in advance the Members who will be granted speaking time using clear criteria, namely that those who requested speaking time in another debate with one-minute speeches but did not get chance to speak will now be granted speaking time where possible, whereas those who have already spoken in other debates will not be granted any speaking time."
"All of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e-mail."
"Therefore, they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time."
"I hope that you understand that."
"This was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner."
"Therefore, those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away."
"(SV) Madam President, on 11 April, Sudan intends to elect a president and a parliament as well as regional assemblies."
"These are the first elections in Sudan in 24 years and we are following developments in the country with a great deal of interest."
"The International Criminal Court in the Hague has issued a warrant for the arrest of Sudan's President, Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, who took power in a coup d'état, for crimes against humanity."
"We all know how Sudan has suffered under his rule of violence."
"In just the first few months of this year, no fewer than 400 people have been killed in southern Sudan."
"It is difficult to say how free the election will be."
"On Monday, al-Bashir threatened to expel the international election observers."
"He said that if they interfere in Sudan's affairs, he would cut their fingers off."
"We know that Sudan is a country in need."
"At the International Donors' conference in Cairo last Sunday, Egypt's representative said that the countries of the world will need to find a little over EUR 1.4 billion for the reconstruction of Sudan's Darfur region."
"It is my hope that the election in Sudan will create the conditions for a ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(LT) Recently, there has been much talk about the recovery of the EU economy, but the majority of Member States have yet to see the end of the crisis."
"In public, discussion of the crisis is limited to the state of public finances, although the rapidly increasing unemployment in some Eastern European Union Member States has already reached a critical level."
"It is strange to hear EU and EP high officials praising some governments for their excellent work when, each month, the number of unemployed in those countries is growing at a catastrophic rate, social guarantees are being reduced and the number of people living below the poverty level is increasing."
"It is becoming very difficult for the people in such countries to understand whether the European Union is implementing a policy of poverty reduction or actually increasing poverty in the social area."
"In my opinion, governments that have been unable to resolve unemployment stabilisation problems should not receive praise."
"The European Commission should take greater responsibility and responsibly supervise the implementation of national government crisis management plans, especially in the area of social reforms, and assess the effects of such reforms on the people."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 16 people convicted of various types of crime have been elected to the Italian Parliament and, at the last European elections, Italy sent three MEPs who have been convicted by final judgment."
"There is no law in Europe prohibiting people who have been convicted by final judgment, or who are awaiting further legal proceedings, from standing for election; everything is left to the discretion of the Member States."
"Italian citizens have come up with the 'Clean Parliament' programme."
"We therefore call on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to amend the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage to make it a condition, in order to stand for election to the European Parliament, not to have any criminal convictions, including those that have not become final."
"The Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the last Parliament, Mr Leinen, undertook to do this, but everything was left to his successor, Mr Casini, who has already stated that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will not pursue it."
"We would point out that not only is this the responsibility of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but that Article 223 (formerly 190) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union actually stipulates that the European Parliament should implement a uniform electoral procedure throughout the European Union."
"(FR) Madam President, Hondarribia airport is classed by the civil aviation authority as one of the most dangerous in the country."
"Its runways are located above the town centres of Hendaye and Irún, and the Franco-Spanish Treaty stipulating the number of authorised flights is being flouted."
"Yet the airport's extension is being planned against the advice of the riverside residents and of the elected representatives on both sides of the border, who are already against maintaining the current level of traffic."
"Does the European Commission approve of the destruction of the protected nature areas of the Bay of Chingoudy, the site of the Ramsar Convention and a Natura 2000 site, the regeneration of which it itself financed?"
"Moreover, the Basque Eurocity of Bayonne-San Sebastián already has an underused international airport, which is far away from any vulnerable nature areas."
"Would it not be better to improve the services provided in Biarritz by introducing non-polluting forms of transport?"
"I should like to know which measures the President is going to take with regard to this extension."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to raise the problem of the murder of the Russian journalist Maxim Zuev."
"Mr Zuev was killed about a week ago in Kaliningrad."
"He was a well-known journalist and blogger."
"This is not the first case of a journalist being killed in Russia."
"Since the year 2000, there have been at least a dozen such cases."
"This is a disturbing phenomenon, because we know that if there is no freedom of speech, and if journalists are not able to work, there is no freedom at all, and there is no democracy."
"In our dialogue with Russia, we should always draw attention to this."
"I hope to organise a seminar in the European Parliament this year, provided I obtain the consent of my delegation for Russian affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I think every one of us, in talks at various levels with our Russian partners, should emphasise that freedom of the media and freedom for journalists to do their work is the foundation for dialogue and freedom both in Russia and in the European Union."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to report to you on the fact that recent articles state that US public prosecutors have filed charges against the German company Daimler for bribery of foreign officers in a bid to win and sign government contracts."
"The bill of indictment states that the company has been involved in a long-term bribery process."
"The same issue arose with Siemens, which applied the same practice and corrupted the governments of thirty countries in a bid to win contracts from public corporations, a scandal which is still rocking Greece."
"As a result, apart from the financial crisis, we also have a moral crisis."
"Until recently, the German Government did not prosecute bribery outside its borders and pretended that it knew nothing of these events."
"Finally, instead of acting, instead of activating the Fraud Prevention Committee, the European Commission does not defend the legality and, in numerous cases, does not safeguard European citizens' money."
"(EL) Madam President, I must announce to the European Parliament that, at 02.15 this morning, the Turkish corvette Bafra violated Greek territorial waters, coming within just 18 miles of the Athens coast, and even asked to board and search a Greek merchant vessel sailing alongside."
"This proves that everything said in the first part of the debate about Greece's so-called economic problem is not wholly accurate."
"Greece's problem is mainly political."
"It comes from the fact that this neighbouring country is threatening Greece with a casus belli and is systematically provoking the Greek armed forces, not only with violations of its waters, but also of its airspace."
"(The President noted that there was a problem with the microphone)"
"... I must tell you that Greece has taken strict measures which, in the final analysis, are literally throttling Greek households and Greeks are now at the end of their tether."
"It has worn down the resistance of Greek society and the economic strength of the Greeks."
"As I said, its problem is mainly political."
"We are not asking for money from any European citizens."
"We are asking for the support of the European Union as an entity, so that we can overcome these irregularities in the markets which are attacking the euro."
"(DE) Madam President, around ten years ago, the then 14 other EU Member States imposed their so-called 'sanctions' on my country, Austria."
"For seven months, there was an 'ice age'."
"Austrian ministers were no longer permitted to take part in informal Council meetings, but Austria was still allowed to continue to pay fees as a net contributor."
"Apart from sanctions, there was also a result."
"The independent report from the Wise Men clearly established that the Freedom Party's involvement in the government did not pose any danger to democracy and human rights."
"The conclusion was that the EU sanctions that were disguised as bilateral measures had no valid legal basis."
"They were an unwarranted encroachment on Austrian sovereignty."
"I do believe, however, that the EU learnt from this to have respect for the political opinion of others and for the national sovereignty of the Member States and their citizens, and that is certainly a good thing."
"Moreover, in view of the peace in the east, I also hope that one of the main investigators, the current MEP, Louis Michel, will feel that, after ten years, he can once again go to Austria on holiday."
"(FR) Madam President, yesterday, France paid tribute to one of its police officers, Jean-Serge Nérin, a French brigade leader who was killed in the most cowardly way by ETA on 16 March, during a shoot-out in the Paris region."
"Although responsible for the deaths of almost 830 people in 40 years, this is the first time that this terrorist organisation has attacked a French police officer."
"Mr Nérin's death reminds us of our duty to cooperate in the fight against terrorism."
"Very early on, Franco-Spanish cooperation proved to be a model of its kind within the European Union."
"France and Spain were the first Member States to introduce joint investigation teams within the European judicial area."
"Implementing European arrest warrants also proved very effective."
"Unfortunately, these cooperative efforts between our police officers and our judges were unable to prevent Mr Nérin from being killed."
"We shall therefore have to increase our cooperation if we are to combat terrorism more effectively."
"Madam President, a major campaign of people power in Val di Susa in north-west Italy seeks to stop a high-speed train project known as TAV being built."
"Stretching from the French border to Turin, the very beautiful Val di Susa is only one to two kilometres in width but already has a major motorway, another main road and a railway line."
"The 'NO TAV' campaign has clearly shown that there is no justification for TAV."
"Only 38% of current rail capacity is used."
"It would be massively damaging to the environment, destroying or polluting aquifers and releasing dangerous concentrations of asbestos and uranium from tunnel excavations."
"Only big business and major construction interests stand to gain."
"Tens of thousands of people have mobilised in opposition and, scandalously, police violence is being used to intimidate the campaign."
"I call on the EU to withdraw all funding for TAV and for the cancellation of TAV."
"The 'NO TAV' campaign's motto is 'Sarà dura'."
"They will not flinch."
"A victory for people power in Val di Susa would be a victory for common sense and for the environment."
"Madam President, I am increasingly concerned about the way local councils in my constituency in the North West of England are using car parking charges to top up their revenue."
"Take the small town of Congleton, for example, which is a local semi-rural community."
"The introduction of car parking charges will severely damage local industry and a fall-off in trade will result in a loss of revenue, forcing already hard-pressed SMEs into bankruptcy and possible closure."
"People are blaming the British Government, some blame the Unitary Council and others point the finger at the town council but, as always, the dark hand of the European Union lies in the background, for they are all working towards the framework set out in the EU's European transport policy for 2010."
"You see, this is the genius of the EU: it is always one person removed."
"Whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections, the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of Brussels does not appear on the radar."
"Madam President, I come from the West Midlands, and 20% of the West Midlands is classified as green belt."
"The green belt has successfully protected the beauty of our countryside and blocked arbitrary urban sprawl."
"However, encouraged by the European Union, the UK Government has increased house building, endangering the green belt, which is particularly close to my heart because it is near to where I live on the Meriden Gap."
"This shows a lack of respect for our culture and traditions, but what do you care?"
"Since the UK joined the European Union - or the European common market, before that - you have blatantly disrespected our culture and traditions, and there is nothing less to be expected of you."
"(RO) I am standing up to speak today before you and my fellow Members in order to express my view that Europe needs a new, much better integrated strategy for resolving the problem of violence against women."
"This issue has been dealt with in an ever-increasing number of European states on a bipartisan basis by parties which have a very different view of society in general."
"The reason for this suggestion is that the problem of domestic violence extends beyond the area of ideology and is a direct and immediate part of the human and political vision of a more just and balanced society."
"I wish to emphasise the need for action to prevent psychological violence as well against women."
"Recent studies have shown that this kind of violence always precedes acts of physical violence."
"I welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has taken up the battle against the various types of violence against women by means of the European Union's political priorities."
"However, these measures must continue."
"Setting up a European inter-gender violence monitoring centre and introducing protection orders and an emergency telephone number are intended to restrict the occurrence of this phenomenon in the European Union, while providing support in the battle against violence outside the EU as well."
"(LT) I am delighted that the European Union and the Member States have made a commitment to combating poverty by declaring 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, since almost 80 million of Europe's inhabitants are living below the poverty line."
"Many Europeans, even those in employment, are struggling with poverty every day and do not have opportunities to enjoy a decent life."
"EUR 17 million has been earmarked to implement Europe's planned action in 2010 and this budget will be used to organise information seminars, work groups and public consultations in order to overcome poverty stereotypes."
"This is an excellent initiative, but how do we ensure that these funds will be used effectively and transparently and will directly reach those citizens who need that aid most."
"I would like to stress that it is impossible to curb rising poverty in a year."
"Therefore, I would like to call on EU structures and Member States to take concrete action and make long-term commitments at all levels of authority to ensure the transparent and targeted allocation of funds intended to directly help people experiencing poverty."
"(EL) The decision by the Israeli Government to push ahead with its plan to build 1 600 new homes in East Jerusalem, to extend the settlement on the West Bank, to maintain the isolation of the Gaza Strip, and to generally step up the attacks by the Israeli army in the occupied Palestinian territories reveals to even the most ardent disbeliever the criminal plans of Israel and of the imperialists in general against the Palestinian people and the people in the area as a whole."
"Israel is unleashing a new round of murderous attacks against the Palestinian people and has secured the support of and upgraded its relations with the European Union, the USA and NATO under conditions of escalating infighting between the imperialist Quartet."
"This support was repeated with particular emphasis and zeal by the United States of America during the recent visit by the Israeli Prime Minister to the United States, which stressed that Israel is something more than a top priority for US geostrategic imperialist plans in the area as a whole."
"We are fighting with all the workers to create ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) After the Second World War and the redrawing of boundaries, about 400 000 Slovaks remained in Hungary and a similar number of Hungarians in Slovakia."
"The Hungarian minority in Slovakia still exists in the same numbers today, but in Hungary, the situation is different."
"The Slovak minority has been decimated from the original 400 000 Slovaks to less than 33 000, in other words, not even one tenth of the original number."
"This is because the Slovak Government provides the Hungarian minority with education in the mother tongue at more than 700 schools, while the Hungarian Government allows the Slovaks in Hungary just one single elementary school."
"That is why the recent criticism concerning the education of Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries by President Sólyom, a man who looks on complacently and passively while his administration stifles the ethnic minorities in his own country, can only be described as an obnoxious, hypocritical and malicious provocation of the Serbs, Romanians and Slovaks who, in contrast to the Hungarians, genuinely look after the ethnic minorities on their own territories."
"After all, the Hungarian ombudsman for ethnic minorities also warns that Hungary is continuing to work towards the total assimilation of ethnic minorities."
"(RO) The European Union has extremely stringent food safety regulations and producers are obliged to invest huge sums of money in order to comply with these regulations."
"Nevertheless, more than 75% of all chickens slaughtered in the European Union are contaminated with bacteria, according to a recent study carried out by the European Food Safety Authority."
"Salmonella and Campylobacter, two of the most toxic bacteria, are present in the carcasses of three quarters of chickens reared on European farms."
"Once studies of this nature get into the mass media, they naturally raise concerns among consumers."
"Against this backdrop, we must ask ourselves two questions."
"Firstly, what can we continue to do to ensure that Europeans have access to safe, good quality food?"
"Secondly, is it possible that the rules which are currently in force, although they are stringent and, incidentally, extremely bureaucratic, are not the most suitable?"
"(HU) The new Member States are now implementing the 2007 European Union wine market organisation."
"In the process, the European Commission acted in contravention of the law - too bad there is no one here - when it unlawfully registered the Tokaj label, upon Slovakia's request, both as a Protected Designation of Origin and as having Protected Geographical Indication."
"This is contrary to EU regulations because this wine can belong to either one category or the other."
"The Slovak request is now no longer in the Community's E-Bacchus database among the protected designations of origin."
"The Commission has thus put an end to this illegal situation, and I thank them for it."
"There is, however, another irregular situation, because the Slovak national law on which the registration is based does not exist, since Slovakia has repealed it."
"For this reason, I ask the Commission to remedy this irregular situation."
"(PL) Madam President, the European External Action Service is going to be the diplomatic corps which represents the Union and assists the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs."
"In the work of this service, consideration must be given to the cultural and national differentiation which exists within the Union."
"Every country must have the feeling that its own interests, its own culture and its own experience are being properly represented in the service."
"For this objective to be achieved, what is needed is sharing, or participation, on an equal basis."
"Meanwhile, how is the corps of the European External Action Service being created?"
"It is to be composed of staff from the appropriate services of the General Secretariat of the Council and the Commission, as well as personnel delegated by national diplomatic services."
"Diplomats put forward by the Member States are to make up only one third of the whole corps."
"However, irrespective of the background of the staff and their route into the service, the principle of proportional representation of all the citizens of the Member States should be adopted."
"After all, staffing in all the Union's institutions is managed according to this principle."
"I see no reason for things to be done differently in this case."
"(PT) Recently, the European Union concluded an agreement with the countries of Latin America under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation in which it committed itself to substantially and progressively reducing the tariffs on imports of bananas from those countries."
"I would like to call your attention to the fact that this agreement has directly negative effects on European banana producers, particularly those in Madeira, Portugal."
"It will be even more detrimental to banana producers on the Canary Islands, Spain."
"I would remind you that the situation of producers in these regions is already seriously hampered by the physical characteristics and mountainous terrain of the islands and by the size of their holdings, which mean that they face permanent difficulties that impede their development."
"Urgent measures therefore need to be taken to help banana producers from Madeira and the Canary Islands, in view of the serious and immediate impact that the new Geneva Agreement will have on the European import market and, as a result, on the production and commercialisation of bananas that come from these outermost regions."
"Madam President, it has now been over a year since the aircraft maintenance firm SR Technics announced that they were closing their facility at Dublin airport, with the loss of over a thousand jobs."
"In an effort to compensate for those losses, an application was submitted in October 2009 to the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) on behalf of SR Technics workers."
"However, this form was rejected as 'incomplete' by the Commission and I can confirm that, almost five months later, the Irish Government has still not submitted a complete application."
"While the Irish Government has been distracted by an economic collapse of its own making and a spate of ministerial resignations in the last few months, an application form with the potential to transform hundreds of lives has been left sitting on a minister's desk."
"This House is aware that the Irish state coffers are bare."
"A cynic would be forgiven for thinking that the government's inaction may be down to its own difficulty in meeting its end of the bargain if the EGF payments are finally secured."
"Would the Irish Government be prepared to do something about that?"
"(PL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address you all and, in particular, Mr Potočnik, on a matter which is troubling people who are involved in speedway, a sport popular in many EU Member States."
"The matter concerns implementation of Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise."
"Implementation of this directive means that riders are being forced to fit new silencers to their bikes."
"These silencers mean, on the one hand, a reduction in attractiveness of the spectacle itself, because the noise is an inherent feature of the sport."
"On the other hand, the silencers mean greater danger, danger for the riders themselves, the danger of damaging their health or losing their life."
"In connection with this, I would very much like to ask Mr Potočnik to consider putting forward a proposal for an amendment to exempt speedway from Directive 2002/49/EC."
"(HU) Madam President, in the province of Vojvodina in Slobodan Milošević's country, Serbia, Hungarians continue to be assaulted."
"The perpetrators are either acquitted or sometimes charges are not even brought against them."
"Decades ago, there were some 400 000 Hungarians living in Vojvodina, making up one third of the population."
"Compulsory emigration and massive settlement of members of the majority have reduced their numbers to 290 000 over the years, and their proportion of the population has dropped to 13%."
"The method by which mass assaults on minorities are carried out was introduced by the famous Serbian secret service, the UDBA, aimed at ethnic Albanians in particular."
"The spontaneous legacy of this practice continues today against Hungarians."
"Madam President, the European Parliament should take decisive action to stop the anti-Hungarian terrorism in Serbia."
"A condition for the latter's accession to the European Union should be to do justice to the many tens of thousands of victims of mass murders since the Second World War, as well as a ban on the violence against Hungarians that continues to this day."
"(PL) Madam President, women are under-represented in science and scientific research."
"In Europe, they account for 30% of researchers and only 18% of professors."
"Among those involved in the management of science, we account for 27%."
"Poland, where the share of female board members in institutions of higher education and scientific institutes is 7%, is in second-to-last place among the 27 Member States of the Union."
"This is why the 'Women in Science' research project, prepared by the Polish-based Academic Enterprise Foundation, is so important."
"The project concerns research into the causes of discrimination and the search for effective anti-discrimination measures."
"Citizens' projects, which come from citizens themselves and are directed at citizens, have the greatest chance of success."
"I appeal to the European Commission for special support and practical help for social organisations which take up such matters."
"When the citizens of the Union write to the Commission, their letters must not go unanswered."
"(GA) Madam President, as I was saying, I was very pleased when I heard former Commissioner Kuneva state that a review of Council Directive 90/314/EEC is needed."
"And why is that?"
"Because it has many faults."
"It does not take into account people who are booking their holidays themselves on the Internet without using a travel agency."
"The directive does not give any protection to consumers who are based in one country and who purchase a product or flight or accommodation in a country outside the European Union."
"As well as that, the directive does not mention scheduled flights."
"It has many faults and I am extremely pleased to say that former Commissioner Kuneva was correct when she said that there is a real need for a new directive."
"Madam President, 20 years ago, the Romanians were dying for freedom, including in education, which, until then, was subject to tight political control."
"As a result of their sacrifice, universities have gained their freedom too, which they have enjoyed ever since."
"It would therefore be sadly ironic if the current attempt by the Romanian Ministry of Education to speedily pass new legislation which practically eliminates that freedom and opens the door to the repoliticisation of the system were successful."
"For instance, in the draft, the rectors elected would have to be confirmed by the Minister, who is himself a political appointee, and universities would be forced to merge on arbitrary criteria, or could even be closed and their assets repossessed."
"As a professor myself, and as an MEP, I consider it my duty to my fellow professors in this House to expose such intended undemocratic practices that are openly opposed to the Lisbon Strategy on education and cannot be tolerated in an EU Member State."
"That concludes this item."
"Thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceedings."
"I hope that all of those who did not have an opportunity to speak this time will get the chance to do so next time."
"Priorities for the 2011 budget - Section III - Commission - Budget guidelines: 2011 - other sections (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mrs Jędrzejewska, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on priorities for the 2011 budget - Section III - Commission and"
"the report by Mrs Trüpel, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2011 budget procedure, Section I - European Parliament, Section II - Council, Section IV - Court of Justice, Section V - Court of Auditors, Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee, Section VII - Committee of the Regions, Section VIII - European Ombudsman, Section IX - European Data Protection Supervisor"
"Madam President, the budget procedure for 2011 is a highly specific and exceptional one because it concerns the first budgetary year which will begin and be approved in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It might be said we are pioneers in this exercise, which is why, of course, a particular responsibility rests upon us."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament additional powers in the area of the budget."
"It is up to us as to how we use those powers, and we are counting on a constructive dialogue both with the European Commission and with the Council, so that the new possibilities provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon can be used in the best and most effective way."
"A very significant new feature introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon is that we will not now have two readings of the budget."
"This means that both Parliament and the Council will only have single readings."
"This, of course, poses a particular challenge - that of discipline."
"As Parliament, we have to be disciplined, because we are going to have - to put it simply - only one chance."
"There will not be a repeat - a second chance."
"We have to establish very many things at the conciliation meeting."
"For the new budgetary procedure to proceed efficiently in the autumn, we must work together and be disciplined."
"This year is also exceptional, because in view of the late election of the European Commission, the Commission has not had the opportunity to present its annual policy strategy."
"It is, therefore, both highly exceptional and interesting that it is the European Parliament which is expressing its thoughts first, and that the first opinions on the budget for 2011 come from the European Parliament in the form of this report, and not from the European Commission, as was the case in every 'ordinary' year."
"Why else is 2011 so special? The budget for 2011 is the fifth budget in the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"As you know, the Multiannual Financial Framework covers the years 2007-2013."
"We have already learned a great deal during the four previous budget procedures."
"In Polish, we say we have reached the wall."
"In English, they say they have reached the ceiling."
"However we say it, we are in a situation where the Multiannual Financial Framework is becoming exhausted."
"We are, in fact, reaching the wall, the moment when the margins are very small and Parliament's room for manoeuvre, of any kind, is radically reduced."
"The margins are very small."
"Particularly worrying are the margins in Heading 1b - around EUR 1 million, and in Heading 3b - around EUR 9 million."
"For this reason, of course, our options are limited, and this is why the report of the Committee on Budgets which I have drafted so strongly demands, expects and requests an ambitious review and revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, not just because those margins are coming to an end, but also because when the revision is carried out, it will be necessary to take into account the significant budgetary consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives new powers to the European Union in areas such as space policy."
"What is significant is that it also establishes the European External Action Service."
"Reflection on the budget is also essential, and on how we intend to realise the EU 2020 strategy."
"None of these undertakings was provided for in the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"We must, now, begin a discussion about how to finance these new plans and ambitions."
"I would very much like - and the report of the Committee on Budgets carries this message - the guiding principle of the budget for 2011 to be youth."
"Young people are already the driving force and future of Europe."
"Education and investment in youth is also an investment in the present and the future of Europe, society and the economy."
"I would like to stress how important a moment in everyone's life is the transition from the environment of school, academic learning and education to the first job."
"This is a very difficult moment, especially during a crisis."
"I would like to mention some statistics: 21 people between the ages of 15 to 24 are unemployed."
"It is very important that the European Union should not be indifferent to this difficult aspect, either, and that we work together so that the difficult moment of transition from education to the labour market will be made easier for young people."
"I would like to emphasise that in an era of rapidly advancing technological change, and also of demographic change, we must create a society based on knowledge, with citizens who are able to change their qualifications during their life and professional career, who are given the possibility to make such a change and who also receive the support of the European Union in this process."
"The support of the European Union should include programmes of international exchange at an academic level, as well as for practical experience and training, and also at professional level."
"This will, at the same time, increase the level of social integration and the flow of knowledge, and will make it possible for the citizens of the European Union to be truly mobile."
"Mobility, as you know, is, quite rightly, a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the treaties and a foundation of an efficient internal market."
"I will now switch to English because I am now going to be replacing Mrs Helga Trüpel."
"So I am now playing a different role, not only concerning the European Commission's budget, but now the other institutions and the Parliament's budget."
"I have prepared to speak in English which accounts for the change of language."
"At this stage of the procedure, the purpose of the resolution is to paint a general picture - in a budgetary context in particular - and to issue some guidelines for the administrative budgets of different institutions, including the European Parliament and excluding the Commission, about which I spoke earlier."
"The general context is that the circumstances under which the budget for 2011 will be adopted are very challenging because the margin under heading 5 is very limited and because the successful implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon is the priority for all the European institutions."
"The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty changes the procedure for the adoption of the budget and therefore requires even closer cooperation and dialogue among the institutions."
"Interinstitutional cooperation covers several aspects - such as translation capacities and recruitment - and exchanging best practices and improving effectiveness could be achieved for areas that have so far not been considered in this context, such as EMAS, non-discrimination policies and teleworking."
"The development of a medium- and long-term building strategy has been a concern of the Committee on Budgets for a long time, not only as regards the Parliament, but also regarding the other institutions."
"Uncertainties as to the size and the shape of the budget for the External Service and the Court decision on pay adaptation make the financial situation in heading 5 even more unpredictable."
"Turning specifically to the European Parliament's budget, the Bureau's guideline document contained the following objectives for Parliament's budget: developing expertise to Members, as far as research capacities and library briefings are concerned, and adapting institutional aspects deriving from the Lisbon Treaty."
"Therefore, the committee emphasises legislative excellence, which is a top priority."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am in a listening mood this evening."
"I am listening to Parliament's priorities for 2011, just as I was listening to the guidelines the Council accepted on 16 March."
"I can agree with the major points and I can agree that this is not the routine annual procedure for two reasons mentioned by Parliament's rapporteur."
"The first is that we are adjusting to the post-Lisbon Treaty environment."
"We have partly adjusted, but some work remains to be done."
"Good cooperation between the institutions is needed more than ever, because of a single reading in Parliament."
"What has been already agreed are some transitional period arrangements agreed at the November conciliation."
"A pragmatic timetable permitting predictability in the budget has been in place since 1975 and has also been confirmed."
"What remains are the modalities in the Conciliation Committee."
"This is essential now, given there is a single reading of the annual budget."
"Therefore, tomorrow, in the course of a trialogue, the Commission is going to present the modalities for discussion and how we can agree the conciliation technicalities before starting the real procedure for 2011."
"The second reason for the annual procedure not being routine is that we are in a post-crisis Europe where many Member States are struggling with budgetary deficits and indebtedness, and many with even more challenging problems."
"Therefore, more than ever, we should attach importance to sound financial management, to accurate forecasting and the rational implementation of a budget."
"The budget headings which appear to be under-financed are easy to detect."
"Here I am referring to heading 1a and heading 4."
"It is due to this spirit of cooperation that we are able to modify the financial perspective four times in the course of a procedure, i.e. four annual procedures."
"Our conclusions should be presented in the framework of a report on the functioning of the interinstitutional agreement which will be issued on the same date as the draft budget, 27 April, and sent to Parliament."
"Our rapporteur, not my rapporteur this time, but the parliamentary rapporteur, Sidonia Jędrzejewska, (my services are now being trained on how to pronounce the rapporteur's name properly) rightly places youth and the opportunities for youth at the centre of her report."
"In other words, the report on priorities is clearly upgrading heading 3."
"This concerns education and the place of youth on the labour market and is justified in this respect when we see the numbers of unemployed."
"But it is equally important that we should deliver promises of a recovery plan."
"That is also what is important for the citizens of Europe."
"What is important is implementation."
"That should be at cruising speed by 2011."
"Efficiency in administration is also important and in this respect, I have to underline that the Commission, despite the adjustment to the Lisbon Treaty, will not request any new posts this year."
"We are to adopt the draft budget in the college on 27 April and, as is the custom, present it immediately on the same day to the members of the Committee on Budgets in Parliament."
"Therefore, I am looking forward now to starting the procedure for 2011."
"I am promising a good spirit of cooperation, which will really be needed this time, given the prototype procedures to be tested this year."
"Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, in the economic crisis, the EU budget, too, inevitably comes under pressure; this is only natural."
"Brussels, too, must watch how it spends every public euro."
"Nevertheless - and I am speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Development - investment in developing countries must remain a priority."
"Sustainable growth in poor countries will afford people opportunities they do not currently have."
"Not only that, but their development forms part of the solution to our crisis."
"Developing countries are a market, and a fast-growing one at that."
"Europe will just have to spend its funds more shrewdly, for example, using a combination of subsidies and loans for micro-finance support."
"Better access to financial services in poor countries will enable people in those countries, too, to achieve their ambitions."
"We must protect the development cooperation budget, however hard that may be."
"European Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, must continue to bear responsibility for his own budget, rather than High Representative Ashton doing so, as currently seems to be the intention."
"After all, choices relating to poverty reduction must never be dependent on our diplomatic interests."
"I welcome the fact that we can deem the 2011 budget the 'youth' budget."
"As such, it contributes to the adoption of the proposals that we submitted to help young people, for example, in access to employment, as is also the case with the so-called Erasmus first job initiative."
"Promoting entrepreneurship among young people, providing incentives and strengthening innovation and the digital agenda are other proposals that will contribute to sustainable economic development in Europe, and will result in the creation of new jobs."
"With regard to Parliament's budget, it is worth noting that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports a budget that is both sustainable and rigorous, in which every expenditure item is justified."
"We believe and recommend that Parliament should abandon a budgetary model that is purely incremental."
"Instead, it should move towards a zero-based budget, which makes efficiency, and therefore savings, possible."
"A long-term building policy needs to be set out as a matter of urgency in order to make this concept of sustainability, rigour and efficiency a reality."
"We still need to find out more and more thoroughly about what our fixed expenditure is."
"This must still be followed by a cost-benefit analysis of the various policies implemented."
"We would stress once again that excellence in lawmaking should be Parliament's main priority, and that our institution must have at its disposal all the resources necessary for this to be achieved."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which requires a single reading of the budget, will call for greater cooperation and more dialogue."
"For our part, this dialogue must be honest."
"We are committed to seeing that it is."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget guidelines are the first step towards the next European budget, a very definite step."
"In the Committee on Budgets, we have made a great effort to establish the main identifiable priorities that highlight European action."
"The first priority is young people, not only because they are the resource on which to focus for innovation, research and development, but also because they are the basic starting point for farsighted social policies."
"However, the 2020 strategy is also a main priority: tackling unemployment, climate change and, above all, the need to genuinely and practically implement this new strategy for the future, allocating sufficient resources to it, without compromises and without cuts."
"However, these guidelines are also a very realistic first step."
"There is much less leeway in the financial perspective and this means that there are insufficient resources to carry out what is most important: new actions."
"This is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading, the heading on competitiveness, growth and employment."
"There is, however, another important issue: the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens' needs, to people's needs and to changing needs."
"So there are priorities, but there are also essential conditions in order for the budget to really be a useful instrument to help Europe grow."
"These include sufficient resources, clear-cut implementation of future strategies, above all, the 2020 strategy, and lastly a definitive solution for a flexible instrument that - alone - can enable us to face future challenges."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to stress three points."
"Firstly, concerning the Structural Funds - approximately 35% of the budget."
"We are doing only half as well as we did in 2000-2006."
"The current absorption rate in all funds is 14% and it was 25% before."
"So the question is how to take into account, how to deliver, how to fulfil this part of the budget."
"Otherwise, we will have a situation where the money is not used."
"On the other hand, it could be a reserve."
"Secondly, we have to reimburse some claims from the earlier period and the Commission has planned five billion to provide this."
"However, in some countries which have not claimed more than six months' reimbursement, I do not think that all the money will be asked for."
"There is also the question of whether this money will be used or not."
"I also have to say something about two very serious matters regarding roll-over budgets which go from year to year."
"In the agriculture budget in 2009, payments were EUR 2 billion less for rural development than in 2008."
"Now much more money is due to be paid out but the question is whether all projects will be fulfilled in 2010 or not."
"Lastly, regarding the Seventh Framework Programme."
"If we look at heading 1a concerning the Seventh Programme for R&D, payments in 2009 were significantly smaller than in 2008."
"So the question is whether delivery will be satisfactory."
"Then we can plan the budget according to the situation."
"We have so many needs in other areas as well."
"So are those reserves or not?"
"Mr President, the motion for a European Parliament resolution on priorities for the 2011 budget contains a paragraph which reminds us that the financing of priorities must not be detrimental to fundamental areas of European Union policy, such as cohesion or structural policies or the common agricultural policy."
"That paragraph has the nature of a stipulation which would appear to be necessary, in view of the previously defined budget priorities."
"Indeed, those priorities leave much to be desired."
"The panacea for the disease of the crisis which is eating away at Europe is supposed to be, first and foremost, innovation."
"However, the motion overlooks the fact that the poorest regions of the Union often do not have at their disposal the conditions for the development of innovation."
"There are countries where the foundations of a modern economy are, as a matter of fact, only just appearing."
"If Europe is to be a continent of equal opportunities, the answer to this state of affairs is, principally, cohesion policy and structural policy."
"Especially during a crisis, we should remember this aspect of EU policy, particularly the solidarity aspect, so as not to perpetuate the division of the continent into poor and rich parts."
"Today we are beginning the debate on the broad guidelines for the 2011 budget, and the suggested priority is youth."
"This prioritisation is particularly important at the moment or during the period of life that marks the transition between studies and the labour market."
"In itself, this choice of priority is something to be welcomed."
"One proposal, for example, is the creation of an Erasmus first job programme."
"The problem is that in politics, the devil is in the detail."
"What are we talking about when we talk about an 'Erasmus first job'?"
"How are we to implement it?"
"By diverting Erasmus funds to students, or by creating a new programme with fresh money?"
"This is not a mere detail, and neither is the matter of whether Erasmus is aimed at insecure jobs, or rather at decent jobs that will represent a real future for young people."
"Is it, ultimately, a programme that will combat youth unemployment, as it is intended to do?"
"Or will it end up being a programme that is simply aimed at covering up unemployment?"
"I believe that these questions go to the very heart of the debate."
"The most pertinent issue in 2011 will still be the unemployment that is rampant in the EU."
"It is our responsibility to tackle unemployment."
"This should provide a challenge for the European budget, but the 2011 budget is being held hostage by a financial framework which has been agreed for seven years, and which has not been altered, despite the crisis."
"Without a thorough and rigorous review of this financial framework, the budget that we are set to approve at the end of the year will be condemned to stagnation and mediocrity even if we adopt the best priorities in the world."
"They will not go beyond mere intentions and will only have a minor bearing on the structure of the budget."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the proposed 6.5% increase on the Parliament budget for 2011 is yet another indication of how far this House has departed from the real world and the interests of its voters."
"How can we explain to our constituents in normal times, let alone in times of crisis, that the total cost they are paying for each one of us exceeds GBP 2 million per year?"
"How can we tell them that if they want a high-level parliament - which some take pride in - this is the bill they have to pay?"
"How do we explain to all those who are losing their jobs that we, the MEPs, need more staff because of the Lisbon Treaty?"
"Or that the officeholders in this Parliament need an increase in their allowances because they work harder?"
"The 15% of youth who are unemployed in the UK, or worse, the 45% of youth who are unemployed in Spain, will not be able to see how this increase will help them get a job."
"Many of them are fairly well educated."
"They only lack job opportunities."
"I, frankly, would not be able to respond if they asked this question."
"Can somebody explain to my voters how the fact that this Parliament has two seats, one in Brussels and one in Strasbourg, will help them pay the mortgage, feed their children and educate them, because this is a big part of the GBP 2 million cost that I spoke about before."
"As regards the Commission, it is all very nice to talk about noble objectives such as investing in youth and education, promoting the study of languages and fostering innovation for economic development and job creation in Europe, but the Auditors' report gives no comfort on how European Union funds are being spent, nor do the outstanding commitments show the EU is very good at planning."
"No proposal for an increase in the budget should be tolerated ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the priorities for the European Union's 2011 budget revolve around the economic and financial crisis."
"Associated with this are the positive joint efforts to implement an exit strategy that is as comprehensive and socially just as possible."
"I would like to concentrate on two aspects."
"Firstly, a central element of the 2011 budget is the focus on young people."
"They will certainly play a key role in Europe's future."
"Investment in youth means thinking today about the Europe of tomorrow."
"Secondly, the current situation demonstrates very clearly how quickly jobs can be destroyed, even in a strong economic area."
"The 2020 strategy also focuses on innovation."
"The hopes that are legitimately associated with this will create new jobs and alleviate the social difficulties."
"(HU) Fellow Members, we all know that the European Union's budget needs serious reforms."
"We also know, however, that these reforms cannot be put through within the framework of a one-year budget."
"What is our problem?"
"Our big problem is that this is an extremely inflexible budget."
"We cannot rise adequately to the daily challenges, or even to the annual challenges except with difficulty."
"And there is, of course, little room for manoeuvre, the options are limited."
"The rapporteur has produced a balanced proposal."
"She has taken into account the realities of the situation and formulated sound targets."
"I hope that Parliament will follow and support the text and proposal before us."
"It is a particularly good thing for us to turn towards young people, for otherwise young people will turn away from us, away from the concept of Europe."
"I would like to speak for a few more minutes about the cohesion policy."
"The cohesion policy is not a form of do-goodism."
"True, there are enormous gaps between the developed and the underdeveloped regions."
"We seek to eliminate these differences, or at least to shrink them."
"But when we raise a region up, it is the competitiveness of all of Europe that is increased, and we grow stronger and better in the face of global competition, assuming, of course, that the Member States take advantage of the opportunities, the money does not remain unused and moreover, the money spent brings results."
"Otherwise, there is no greater waste."
"The waste is even greater than that caused by the fact of there being two seats, if programmes are run that do not produce the necessary results."
"I hope that there will be progress in this regard."
"The Committee on Budgets is very keen to see that we get value for our money. Thank you for your respectful attention."
"Mr President, I welcome this report on Parliament's budget guidelines and I welcome the discussion on what our priorities are to ensure that Parliament can do its job."
"The initial report was perhaps understandably vague and general."
"However, the amendments at committee stage ensured we are now clear on what is important."
"The Committee on Budgets tried to balance the need to recognise our responsibilities following Lisbon with the need to keep increased spending as low as possible and that is particularly important with margins and public finances being so tight."
"I am sure all Members will take that point on board."
"That is why deciding our priorities in these guidelines is crucial and, of course, it is not just about spending money."
"It is also about looking for savings and it is about spending the money in the best possible way."
"Therefore, I am pleased that, for example, the need for an integrated knowledge management system that would bring together all the different sources of information for Members and citizens is widely accepted."
"The analysis of Europarl TV, to see if it is effective or not, is also welcome."
"An evaluation of a secretarial allowance and the global cost of employing more staff, including accommodation, I believe is also vital, as is a medium- and long-term building strategy for the Parliament and other institutions which perhaps we should be working with much more closely than we are already."
"And, of course, there is always the difficult issue of the 20% threshold agreed so many years ago."
"I and the Committee on Budgets believe that any changes to that 20% should be the subject of a discussion between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau and eventually between all the different institutions."
"It should not be a unilateral decision."
"The S&D Group have tabled a few more amendments to be voted upon tomorrow which we believe will improve the guidelines even further."
"One amendment points out the difficulty of putting all administrative expenditure under heading 5; another amendment calls for the early publication of the guidelines and estimates to ensure we can make our decisions in a proper and timely way."
"I hope tomorrow, colleagues will support these and other amendments which are aimed at improving the guidelines."
"I would also hope that colleagues would recognise that, following the agreement of these guidelines, we will have to undertake difficult discussions on the estimates recently published by the Secretary-General."
"Only then will we begin to talk about our priorities and only then will we have the proper discussion to achieve the balance between functioning as a Parliament and keeping our expenditure as low as possible."
"(SV) Mr President, in hard economic times such as these, budgetary issues are difficult and sensitive."
"The guidelines for the 2011 budget also include the European Parliament's own budget."
"The expenditure in heading 5 has traditionally been apportioned in such a way as to give Parliament a share of less than 20%."
"As a consequence of the Treaty of Lisbon, people are now saying that Parliament should devour a greater proportion of the money."
"A review of the increased need for resources that Parliament's new powers may give rise to is certainly justified, and we have already received more money for 2010 precisely as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"At the same time, the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be used as some kind of new money-dispensing machine for Parliament."
"We also need to be able to make our own organisation more efficient and to try to make savings where possible in order, by doing so, to also be able to finance any additional needs."
"Now people are also calling for increased appropriations for the staff that support Members of the European Parliament in our work."
"The intention is surely a good one, but it is interesting, for example, that the MEPs in my group more or less unanimously feel that there is no urgent need for this and that it is not necessary in these economically meagre times."
"The guidelines that we are to approve today are good, and I think we should view them as a challenge to examine our own expenditure with a critical eye."
"(NL) Mr President, we are living in financially and economically difficult times."
"Everywhere, belts are being tightened, and public authorities, too, are having to control expenditure and make economies."
"In addition, citizens have little confidence in European policy, and this concerns me greatly."
"I wish to present two proposals relating to the examination of the next budget, therefore."
"Firstly, we MEPs must all be just as accountable for our general expenditure allowance of EUR 4 200 per month as we are for all our other allowances."
"This is not the case at present, which is not what I would call transparent."
"Moreover, I shall be tabling an amendment in this regard when we discuss the report by Mr Staes during our April part-session."
"Mr President, my second point concerns the budgets of the national Information Offices of the European Parliament."
"I consider these particularly generous, and take the view that they must be cut by a third over a three-year period."
"I call on my fellow Members to support these proposals."
"This would demonstrate our desire for transparency and our intention not to give ourselves special treatment."
"(NL) Mr President, the 2011 budget brings us face to face with the priorities of the European Union."
"At this economically difficult time, the Union must first realise that its financial resources come from Member States, who face having to make drastic cutbacks."
"It is not only Member States who must make cuts, then; the EU should also trim down its public funds and spend these in a more targeted manner."
"I have a substantive question regarding the priority the rapporteur gives to youth."
"As a rule, social and youth affairs can be handled very well by Member States."
"Yet I would draw attention to one issue where EU support is truly indispensable."
"The report mentions young people's transition from education to the labour market."
"I would ask the rapporteur whether she also means to devote attention to the specific needs of vulnerable young people."
"Here I have in mind young people who have grown up in children's homes and who suffer from a severe lack of vocational guidance."
"Last month, on a visit to Bulgaria, I saw a truly inspiring example of this."
"I welcome European support for such Member State initiatives wholeheartedly, for example, within the framework of the Structural Funds."
"I am counting on you."
"Mr President, the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money."
"Spending someone else's without their permission is not budgeting, it is theft."
"British taxpayers are fleeced to the tune of GBP 6.4 billion in direct payments to the EU annually and we are still denied our referendum."
"Taking that money, without a democratic mandate, is not a victimless crime."
"Fifty thousand of our pensioners died of cold this winter because they could not afford to heat their own homes."
"Our soldiers are killed by Taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast-proof vehicles."
"Thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life-saving drugs."
"GBP 6.4 billion would right all those wrongs and still leave change to build eight new hospitals and 50 schools."
"There should be only one budget priority - slash spending and stop robbing Britain."
"Our pensioners, soldiers and cancer victims need the money more than the EU."
"To you, it is a budget."
"To them, it is a matter of life or death."
"(ES) Mr President, I welcome Mr Lewandowski, an old friend of this House who now sits on different benches to those of the Members."
"I also want to welcome the return to the traditional system of budgetary guidelines."
"I believe that this is a good thing, because in this way, the Commissioner can listen to Parliament's budgetary priorities before drawing up the draft budget."
"The things the Commissioner is hearing or will be hearing today are very different to those he undoubtedly hears every day from the various general sides that put pressure on him to let them have a bigger budget."
"We in Parliament are not going to put pressure on him for the time being."
"As he knows, we will be doing that from September onwards."
"For now, we just want Mr Lewandowski to be very clear about what the budgetary priorities of Parliament represent."
"They represent our suggestions."
"New challenges for the 2011 budget arise every day."
"We already have new pressures in category four, where we are allowing for a very tight margin that will be made tighter by the need to include the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"We shall have pressures in agriculture, not only because we are using codecision for the first time, but, above all, because we are intending to use it through Parliament and we will not agree to further cuts to the agricultural budget to fund other areas."
"We shall also, of course, need to resolve the ever-problematic issue of category five: administrative costs and greater transparency."
"One last thing: this House is very open to saving money from both the EU budget and from Parliament's budget."
"What we political groups are not open to, I believe, is putting up with the demagogy of certain people who make it their way of conducting politics."
"(SV) Ladies and gentlemen and, in particular, our former fellow Member, Janusz Lewandowski, who I would like to welcome back."
"I would like to comment briefly on both reports."
"Firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Jędrzejewska, who has produced an excellent report."
"However, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have tabled amendments to a couple of paragraphs that we think are important."
"Firstly, we need to make it clear that climate change is still a major priority."
"We must not ease the pressure on this issue on account of the failure in Copenhagen, but instead must work hard to carry out our own task, namely to find solutions to the problem of financing."
"Secondly, with regard to the Europe 2020 strategy: our strategy requires the Union to also invest in and improve the implementation of the strategy."
"We must fight proactively to develop the economy and for an ambitious social agenda, and these are political areas that quite simply require more substance."
"Among other things, we need to send a clear message to the Member States and the Council that it will be necessary to review the budget ceilings for the next three years, particularly in heading 1 of the budget, which is the heading dealing with growth and employment."
"When it comes to Parliament's own budget, even if we have significant needs, we must take account of the economic situation and impose major constraints on ourselves."
"We need to strengthen Parliament and especially the capacity of the political groups to be able to fulfil the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In all other respects, however, we need to look for ways to make savings and increase efficiency."
"This is particularly relevant, as heading 5 of the budget, for administration, is severely stretched."
"We recently discussed the new External Action Service, for example, which will certainly require extra resources."
"We must focus on Parliament's core task and elsewhere employ a great deal of constraint."
"Mr President, in times of economic stringency, faced with cuts in public spending right across European countries, all the EU's institutions should be looking at how to cut costs and waste."
"Parliament should be taking a lead."
"Instead, it continues in a self-indulgent manner, with its costs and staff numbers constantly increasing with no thought of constraint."
"In any other organisation, new priorities would be met by compensating reductions elsewhere, but not in this House it seems."
"MEPs bear the brunt of public blame, but it is the overinflated bureaucracy, needless excesses and the redundant buildings which cost the money."
"How can you continue to justify Parliament's GBP 94 million annual self-promotion budget with eight million spent on the superfluous Europarl TV and this bizarre scheme for a GBP 2 million House of European History?"
"It is ridiculous that you maintain so-called information offices in every Member State, at an annual cost of 40 million, when it is the job of 736 MEPs to answer any questions their constituents may have."
"It is a continuing scandal that this Parliament has not demanded that Member State governments stop the Strasbourg circus once and for all."
"We need to send a clear message to our governments on this and save 200 million a year."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by talking about the Commission's budget."
"The European External Action Service is something that I take a particular interest in."
"However, this is not yet included in the budget that the Commissioner is soon to present."
"However, the question of how much it will cost is of key importance for us."
"I am in favour of us including this service within the Commission, as that is where it belongs."
"One thing is clear: what happens in this service will have significant consequences for the budget, including in relation to the multiannual programmes."
"We cannot have administration of multiannual programmes outside the Commission."
"We cannot allow this under any circumstances."
"Our choice of legal construct for this service will be very important, as the budgetary consequences will be directly dependent on this."
"For that reason, what is most interesting about this budget is what it does not include."
"We very much hope that the Commissioner will soon be able to supply figures to show what the whole thing is expected to cost."
"In 2011 - this much is already clear - the areas where we will have the largest expenditure - including for this service - particularly in the administration lines, are the areas where we have the least amount of leeway."
"Everything is accounted for, down to the last cent."
"I am therefore in favour of us taking an immediate look at the staff regulations for ways to make savings."
"I also have a suggestion in relation to special leave for officials and assistants working in the Member States, where travel to their home countries for special leave is based on travelling by rail."
"This rail journey basis should be scrapped, with the focus put on airline tickets and flying time instead."
"I now turn to Parliament's budget."
"Anyone who works in this Parliament - and that, unfortunately, cannot be said of all the Members - needs staff."
"I would therefore like to ask specifically that we provide ourselves with appropriate means to enable us to work."
"However, I do not think that creating a connection with the buildings is appropriate, because we also have electoral districts and can conclude service contracts."
"The Bureau should be so kind as not to trouble the Members on this account."
"I have one further request."
"The President of the European Council is not yet accounted for in the budget."
"It would be nice if we could acknowledge his existence in the budget, too."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a different EU and we also need a different EU budget."
"I think we need the courage to make big decisions."
"We should certainly not get bogged down in minute technical details."
"I would like to say three things about the EU budget."
"Firstly, we need transparency where the EU budget is concerned."
"How high is administrative expenditure, for example?"
"The current EU budget does not provide any realistic information on this."
"My second point is about savings."
"It is very easy to save billions in the EU budget without reducing the quality of the services provided by the EU institutions."
"For example, we could shut down a large number of the EU's agencies."
"Then there is the second seat in Strasbourg."
"We should perhaps discuss the usefulness of the bodies that lack an area of competence, such as the Committee of the Regions or the Economic and Social Committee."
"Thirdly, how is the money used?"
"The money should be given, or given back, to where it comes from, namely the taxpayers."
"Of course, we should also use it to support sound projects - I am thinking, for example, of a genuine Erasmus programme for trainees."
"I think we need courage."
"We would all do well to take note of this."
"(PL) Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has acquired significant additional competences."
"The time has come for decisions about spending money from EU coffers to be made jointly."
"However, time is also needed for this mechanism to begin to work."
"It is certain that this year and the next few years will be crucial for the establishment of the final form of the new budget procedure."
"Only with Parliament, the Council and the Commission working together as partners will it be possible to develop a procedure which will comply to the greatest degree with the provisions of the new treaty."
"I would like to express support for the appeal to increase the Community budget in view of the new responsibilities facing Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"There is no doubt that for Parliament to perform its duties effectively, it needs the appropriate means."
"The responsibility of Parliament is growing, which is why we, as Members, need more advice, expert opinions and support from a variety of professionals, and someone has to pay for this."
"Another priority which is presented in the report, and which is deserving of full support, is the need for greater investment in youth, and so in education, which is the foundation of a modern and innovative society."
"Europe is still behind in the technology race with the USA, Japan and other new world powers."
"However, this can, certainly, be changed, but it requires significant outlays."
"As part of the fight against poverty, we should finance programmes such as the free distribution of food among the poorest."
"We should develop programmes such as those which make milk and fruit available at schools."
"We must not tolerate undernourishment among children and young people, since we are saying so much about education and a knowledge-based economy."
"Work is currently under way on the strategy for the economic growth of the Union over the next 10 years (Europe 2020)."
"In relation to this, it is necessary to take account of expenses which will be incurred as a result of the strategy, and this needs to be done now, at the stage when we are working on the budget."
"For the strategy to be successful, greater outlays are needed on cohesion at regional and European level, promotion of employment and combating the effects of the crisis."
"Finally, I would like to thank fellow Member, Mrs Jędrzejewska, for a very substantive and innovative preparation of the priorities of the budget for 2012."
"(PT) Young people, science and innovation are at the heart of the priorities of the next European Union budget."
"Investing in young people is investing in the future."
"Education, professional training and the transition from the educational system to the labour market are the central concerns of this budget."
"Young people with degrees are increasingly affected by unemployment."
"That is why I consider the Erasmus first job mobility programme to be a strategic commitment to the future, because it establishes a clear link between the education system and the labour market."
"The proposal for the creation of the Erasmus first job programme, which I presented alongside Mr Fernandes, is based on the following principles: firstly, additional funding for existing programmes in the fields of education, science, training and innovation; and secondly, each case will have a training component and a component in which the trainee will have a contract with an innovative European company and will be cofunded by the European budget."
"Of the other priorities of this budget, I would pick out the areas of scientific research, innovation and the digital agenda."
"This budget also concentrates efforts on supporting the development of green and innovative technologies, thus making an essential contribution to economic recovery and giving impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Commitment to young people, innovation and science is the key to making Europe a world leader once again."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, Mrs Jędrzejewska, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid report."
"Of course, the economic situation in the European Union is still not satisfactory, but the report does, in large measure, tell us how to create European added value."
"I think giving particular attention to youth in mid- and long-term priorities is an excellent idea for helping to solve our problems."
"I think maintaining trends related to innovation and the emphasis on digital technology are good examples of the rapid development of the European Union."
"The support for small and medium-sized enterprises, mainly in the weakest regions, is also interesting."
"However, it is also worth emphasising that, on the question of mobility, the policy of investment in the Trans-European Transport Network, and so questions of transport, will arise."
"I think investing in youth is crucial, and so I would like to express my thanks, and also the thanks of the Committee on Culture and Education, for all efforts whose objective is to support measures relating to investment in young people."
"(RO) The 2011 budget must take into account the European Union's new powers, as well as the consequences of the economic and financial crisis."
"Our priority must be to preserve existing jobs and create new ones."
"I believe that the European Union must invest in an intelligent and ambitious industrial policy."
"It is not acceptable that in 2010, industry accounts for only 14% of GDP in prominent Member States."
"This is why the 2011 budget must consider redefining budget priorities, a task which Member States can only carry out in 2010 during the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial outlook."
"These priorities must focus on transport infrastructure, energy efficiency, industrial policy and research, agriculture, education and health."
"We are expecting the Commission to put forward this year a firm proposal for setting up a European fund specifically for developing the transport infrastructure, and the EU's contribution to this will also feature in the 2011 budget."
"(PT) The economic and social situation in the EU calls for a substantial change to be made in 2011 to the priorities that have guided previous budgets, including the current budget for 2010."
"The budget needs to be at the service of policies that are distinct from those that led to 23 million people losing their jobs and put 85 million at the risk of poverty."
"The objectives of the multiannual financial framework which reduced the structural funds to 0.37% of the EU gross national income need to be reviewed, as these meant cuts in social and environmental programmes and in the fields of research, education and culture."
"Future budgets must be instruments at the service of economic and social cohesion, rather than mere padding in the treaties."
"They must be at the service of full employment with rights, investment in public services, protection of the environment, cooperation and peace."
"They should not be an instrument at the service of the commercialisation of more and more aspects of social life, freedoms, lack of job security, structural unemployment, external interventionism and war."
"The thrust of the amendments that we have tabled to the report is in showing that there is an alternative, and one that is not only possible, but also necessary."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to refer to heading 5 and to the buildings strategy in particular."
"A medium and long-term successful buildings strategy is important."
"It needs to be environmentally friendly, energy efficient and particularly cost effective."
"We also need to have an open discussion about how sensible it is to have three working sites for the European Parliament."
"The horrendous expenditure for the different sites can hardly be justified to EU citizens and taxpayers, particularly during the economic crisis."
"It is time we had a detailed and thorough cost analysis carried out and made it available to every EU citizen."
"The European Parliament should therefore concentrate on one seat, and, personally, I would prefer Strasbourg on account of its historic and socio-cultural bridging role and, in particular, on account of the fact that Brussels is sinking into crime, parts of the city are descending into anarchy and the police have given up."
"Even municipal politicians like the Mayor, Freddy Thielemans, admit this."
"(RO) I urge the European Union's 2011 budget to provide a better reflection of, and support for, youth policy."
"Young people must be supported both at EU and national level."
"In this regard, one of the projects which the Romanian Government is using to support young people is the construction of 100 000 homes for them in the next three years."
"At the same time, I welcome the European Commission's target of awarding 3 million Erasmus grants to students by 2012."
"However, it is also vitally important to increase the funding for Erasmus Mundus grants."
"This will allow even more students and researchers from third countries - and in this case, I am thinking specifically of the Republic of Moldova as well - to study in the European Union."
"As a young MEP, I support the Erasmus initiative, which is the first workplace providing young people with access to the labour market."
"Finally, I would like to thank the European Commission for its promptness in approving the funding for the four energy projects which Romania is also involved in."
"(LT) Taking into account the complicated economic situation in the Member States, next year's budget should be planned very thoroughly."
"Job retention and creation should receive most attention."
"Support for and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises would be of service here, since these companies employ a large proportion of European Union citizens."
"Financial support measures must be provided in a more flexible manner and must be more accessible if newly established companies or those that have experienced financial difficulties are to survive."
"We also should not forget areas providing added value, not just to individual Member States, but to the Community as a whole."
"Amongst these areas, we could mention transport, the priority of which should be the creation of a sustainable and safe transport system and the development of trans-European networks."
"Suitable funding for energy link projects, ensuring energy independence, must also remain one of the priorities of the 2011 budget."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank Members for their comments, which have deepened and enriched my understanding of Parliament's priorities for 2011."
"What was clear to me when listening - and I am in a listening mood this evening - was that many speakers stressed that we are shaping the budget for 2011 in the extraordinary environment of post-crisis Europe, with many countries struggling with real fiscal challenges."
"This is putting a real pressure on the budgetary figures and is also putting pressure on sound management, on transparency in the budget - that was clear from Mr Van Orden, Mr Berman, Mr Fernandes, Mr Haglund - but, if resources are scarce, what is really needed is to set priorities properly."
"My feeling after the debate, is that youth, i.e. heading 3b - upgraded by the rapporteur - has the support of younger and older members of this room so it seems that this priority for 2011 is rightly placed, according to a majority here in the Parliament."
"What is also needed is quality and good implementation and we immediately - for example, Mr Godmanis and Mr Surján - think about cohesion."
"Yes, that was low-level in 2009-2010."
"It should go at cruising speed by 2011, as should anti-crisis delivery."
"But we also have underspending on research and that deserves much more user-friendly financial regulation."
"We should be disclosing it at the end of May-June this year."
"What was also clear to me, when listening to your debate, is that Parliament is conscious of room for manoeuvre in the budget being very limited."
"Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo, Mr Färm and others stressed the very limited room for manoeuvre, but the conclusion could be more flexibility in the shaping and implementation of the budget."
"I can only share this conclusion."
"As usual, Ingeborg Grässle is right in saying that no budget has been included as yet for the External Action Service, but to draw up a budget you need figures."
"We do not have the figures as yet and without figures, it is very difficult to establish the budget."
"But, of course, this should come this year if the External Action Service is to be operational."
"I am really looking forward to tomorrow's discussions in the informal trialogue and then to launching the real debate."
"Let us hope also for a fruitful conciliation of the 2011 figures."
"Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your speeches, and would like, most of all, to say I am very pleased that the priority related to the main change to the budget for 2010, the priority related to youth, which I proposed and which the Committee on Budgets adopted, has also met with your support and interest."
"I am very pleased and motivated by this."
"I would, of course, like to stress once again what you rightly noticed in the discussion, that we have little room for manoeuvre."
"This means there is all the more reason for the appeal to the European Commission to show ambition, imagination and courage in starting a review and possible revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"As you know, the year 2011 is the fifth year of the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"Surely it is time we learned something from those four years."
"The fifth ought to be decidedly better."
"Of course, it is clear we are fighting a financial and economic crisis which, and this is obvious, is different in different countries."
"Some countries are showing signs of coming out of the crisis, but this does not alter the fact that we should be ambitious, especially because, if we are looking at the budget of the European Community, funds designated for innovation, research, youth, realisation of the common market and realisation of the freedoms of the common market, are, in fact, a small part of the European Community budget."
"So, any savings made should not, in my opinion, affect this part of the European Union budget."
"Many of you said something which I agree with - that young people are the European Union's future."
"However, I would like to add that they are not only the future, because the young people are alive here, now, today."
"They are in education today and they are looking for work today."
"Young people are not only our future, they are our today."
"Investing in young people is an investment not only in what will happen one day, but is about what is happening here and now."
"We should keep reminding ourselves of this."
"I would also like to say a few words on this extended thinking about the European Union budget."
"It is not only about youth, but is also about a wider understanding, which includes, too, issues related to young people, as well as, in a broader perspective, issues related to education and training."
"I think that, here, the European dimension, the European dimension of added value, is very clear."
"We should not forget, however, that we are operating in a united Europe, where mobility of thought and the mobility of people is, in fact, one of our more important values, and we should look after it continually."
"I would also like to say a few words to summarise the debate on the European Parliament budget."
"It is true I am standing in, today, for the rapporteur, but I will permit myself to say a few words and to emphasise something which is already contained in the report of the Committee on Budgets."
"That is, of course, that it is important to think about savings all the time, and always to think about whether those expenses which do take place are justified, if they are the best possible."
"That process of reflection is continuous, and should concern us all."
"This reflection is certainly to be seen in the report on the European Parliament."
"I hope very much that this debate, which has taken place at such a late hour, has not been a waste of time for any of us."
"I very much hope that Mr Lewandowski will listen to everything which has been said, here, and that he has not forgotten that not long ago, he was a Member of this Chamber, and I very much hope that this debate will be reflected in the draft budget which the European Commission has promised to present on 27 April."
"I will, of course, gladly repeat this all again, and again, and again, throughout the spring and until the autumn, but, nevertheless, I would be very happy if some of the proposals which have already been raised, here, were now included in the draft from the European Commission, so that it will, after all, be necessary to repeat less. Once again, I would like to thank you for your attention."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - First of all, I wish to recall that, although the EU was able to react collectively to the financial and economic crisis by adopting a European Economic Recovery Plan, the overall economic situation in the EU is still not satisfactory."
"It is inevitable that the following priorities for the budget guidelines 2011 have to be taken into account: the implementation of FP7, which will have reached its maturity in 2011, should be closely monitored; the development of the newly established European space policy and the promotion of scientific and technological advance, supporting innovative technologies and sustainable development; the challenges relating to sustainable energy and the fight against climate change must be reflected in the EU budget priorities; these priorities will require additional budgetary resources, particularly for funding the ITER and the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan and promoting energy efficiency; the importance of the Galileo project, of the GMES programme and of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology; the proper implementation and evaluation of ongoing pilot projects and preparatory actions should be the priority."
"I trust that these key issues will be taken into account in an appropriate way during the forthcoming 2011 budget procedure."
"This year, the budgetary procedure will undergo the biggest reform since the introduction of the Multiannual Financial Frameworks in 1988."
"While the budgetary procedure reform is going on, strictly speaking, the whole budgetary framework will have to be adapted to the new institutional realities introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, primarily to the European External Action Service."
"However, I believe that the main objective of the future budget will be to support the policies from the new Europe 2020 agenda."
"This project will only have a chance of success if we provide the necessary funding for it."
"Otherwise, this agenda will end up just like the one before it too, the Lisbon Strategy, wide of the mark in terms of achieving any of the objectives set."
"In this respect, I wish to share the sentiments of the rapporteur and emphasise how important the policies on young people, education, research and innovation are."
"In my view, they provide the cornerstones on which we will have to build both the 2011 budget and our vision for the future."
"The European Union budget for 2011 should give clear support to the main trends in the Community's strategy for the next decade."
"This includes technological innovation, sustainable development, combating climate change and care for biodiversity."
"Support for the development of educational systems, with the assistance of interdisciplinary investment, is also strongly justified."
"The money must be invested in enterprises which guarantee that graduates will find employment."
"If we do not give our backing to youth, today, we will face the bleak prospect of a slowdown in economic growth, and perhaps even another crisis."
"We do not need to be reminded of the need for intensive development of the information technology sector and that we must ensure that our citizens have access to digital technology."
"This will facilitate education in the area of information technology, as well as making it easier to obtain information, especially for people who live in rural areas."
"I would like to add my comments to those made by the rapporteur and fellow Members during the debates on the priorities for the 2011 budget."
"As was also announced by the European Commission in January, ambitious plans are in the pipeline for the Galileo project."
"The first services offered by this system will be launched in early 2014: the open service, regulated public service and the search and save services."
"Testing will also start in 2014 on the Safety-of-Life service and commercial service."
"Let me remind you that Galileo is crucial to the future of high-tech industry in Europe."
"It will create new markets and enable Europe to become a global competitor in the field of technology."
"The TEN-T policy has supported the preparation of this major European project until now, and once it becomes operational, it will be possible to use the transport infrastructure much more efficiently."
"In conclusion, I believe that Galileo must receive sufficient funds from the European Union budget in the future so that this ambitious project can become a reality."
"The circumstances in which the 2010 and 2011 budgets will be adopted are exceptional and pose a particular challenge."
"For these reasons, the ideal solution must be found for successfully implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, which is itself a major financial challenge."
"Solutions also need to be found aimed at mitigating the effects of the financial crisis which are still being felt in many Member States."
"Parliament must engage in an open discussion about the expenditure ceiling in heading 5 for 2011."
"We must find a balance between providing funding for all the requirements and maintaining budgetary discipline, even if it means restricting expenditure, in order to comply with the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"Firstly, we need to standardise administrative expenditure by including it entirely under this heading and carry out a suitable, realistic review of the expenditure ceiling."
"Above all, it is vital that interinstitutional cooperation is established to promote the exchange of good practices and to continue to explore the opportunities for making them more efficient."
"In addition, particular importance must be attached to monitoring and analysing sets of areas with direct budgetary implications, and every way of distributing and saving resources must be identified."
"Work on the 2011 budget is under way."
"One subject of discussion is that Parliament could make amendments to the financial perspective 2007-2013 in areas such as 'competitiveness and cohesion for growth and employment'."
"In addition, we are in the course of work on the Europe 2020 strategy, which should concentrate on promoting innovation, supporting enterprise and investing in science, new technologies and regional development."
"I would like to draw particular attention to the question of economic, social and territorial cohesion, which is the key to ensuring lasting economic growth in the EU and full integration of Member States."
"Article 174 of the Treaty of Lisbon mentions policy with regard to mountain regions as a particular type of regional policy, alongside island and cross-border regions."
"In order to promote its harmonious development, the Union shall pursue actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"In particular, emphasis must be placed on reducing disparities in levels of development of regions which are characterised by specific natural and geographic conditions."
"Mountainous and sub-mountainous areas make up almost 40% of the territory of the EU and are inhabited by nearly 20% of the EU's citizens."
"The specific economic and spatial problems of mountainous regions require supra-national legal regulations to be put in place governing the objectives and principles of pursuing specific mountain policy in Member States and, more importantly, they require that a suitable level of financing be ensured for projects and programmes for those regions in particular."
"I think financial support for mountain regions should be included in the new financial perspective and the Europe 2020 strategy."
"in writing. - (HU) Next year will be the first year in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which can represent a new phase in the development of the European Union."
"As a result, the 2011 budget year will be extremely important from the perspective of financial planning for subsequent years."
"The budgetary priorities must contain the European Union's response to the challenges of the global crisis."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is, from this point of view, a very important factor."
"The priorities contained in the proposed budget for 2011 cannot, however, lead to a modification of the EU's basic policies."
"In the future, close attention needs to be paid to the cohesion and structural policies, as well as to the agricultural policy, and also to the support given to SMEs, since the capacity of Europe to become a sustainable and competitive economy depends on the latter."
"We must not lose sight even for a moment of the fact that the policies mentioned are the expression of the solidarity that constitutes the fundamental value of European integration."
"Request for the defence of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes"
"Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow? (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Scottà, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with market globalisation and the severe crisis now affecting Europe, including in the agricultural sector, one possible response on the part of the agricultural market is to place emphasis on product quality."
"I believe that a good EU quality policy can enhance competitiveness and create added value for Europe's regional economies, since, for many rural areas where production alternatives are few, it is often the one and only opportunity for development."
"By supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas, we will create an economy and jobs there."
"Furthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society."
"In my report, I emphasised the importance of keeping the three systems for registration of geographical indications separate, since they represent the link with European regions, representing their traditions, history, taste and unique knowledge handed down over time."
"I therefore believe that, by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate, they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production."
"Consumers often confuse the geographical indication of where a food product was processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product as such, and are often not aware of how the food chain operates."
"I therefore consider that only the compulsory indication of the place of production of the primary products can provide consumers with full information on the quality of the products they are buying, since products are subject to a production cycle which exerts considerable influence on their characteristics in terms of quality and food safety."
"Let us remember that it is our duty to protect what our fellow citizens, who voted for us, produce and eat."
"Another two issues that I considered important to include in my report are as follows: the importance of an intensive campaign of consumer education and information, which the European Union should undertake concerning the various European labels and the guarantees they represent, and the inclusion in international registries and international recognition through the WTO system of geographical indications."
"This last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Cioloş for his attendance and remind him of the importance of sufficiently protecting quality systems, which are our future, and remind him too that the economy of disadvantaged rural areas can be boosted by agricultural sector aid, to safeguard all those niche products that are typical of these areas and that keep the people connected to the locality, which would otherwise be abandoned."
"This would support respect for the environment and for the landscape and would create, where possible, a tourist and oenogastronomy economy linked to the various regional, cultural and historical differences in the European Union."
"I would like to thank my colleagues for the support they gave me in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I hope that the European Parliament will also give its support during the vote tomorrow."
"Madam President, Mr Scottà, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the key element that gives stature to the European agricultural and agri-food model at international level is precisely its policy of quality and diversity."
"That is why quality policy in the agri-food sector will be one of the priorities of my mandate, one of my main priorities straight after the common agricultural policy post-2013 reform."
"Agri-food quality policy is not only proof that European farmers are responsive to the expectations of European consumers, but it may also pave the way for the European agri-food sector to assert itself on the international market."
"If quality policy is to achieve its objective, we need a framework that is clear, comprehensible, well structured, easily identifiable by consumers and, as far as possible, comprehensive and sufficient."
"My aim is to be able to structure the content of quality policy and to make it more accessible both to farmers, who must be the beneficiaries of it, and to consumers, but without sacrificing its substance or emptying it of all content."
"Quality policy represents a guarantee for consumers, but it also represents added value for farmers;"
"I am in full agreement with Mr Scottà on that."
"It can help to maintain the diversity of our agriculture, and can do so in a competitive way, because farms that can sell their produce are competitive."
"If they can make a living from what they produce, they are competitive, and, if they can sell high-value-added products, they are even more competitive, even if, at times, they are small in size."
"I therefore believe that, in some regions, quality policy can also help to make our farms more competitive."
"In this way, quality policy and the development of local markets, the reduction in food miles, and direct and closer contact between consumers and producers can achieve good results precisely in order to increase the competitiveness of certain types of farming that currently have a relatively small share of the market."
"European farmers are already making efforts to supply safe products, using techniques that respect the environment and animal welfare."
"The debate on how to make this more evident by means of the labelling system is useful and welcome, and the report contributes certain elements and certain ideas along these lines."
"I believe that these links between the standards maintained by farmers and labelling quality policy should also be the subject of debates that we are going to hold on the common agricultural policy post-2013."
"That is my intention, in any case."
"I believe that we need to develop and evolve our instruments in relation to communication policy, communication both with European farmers and with European consumers, and, above all, at international level."
"It is my belief that our quality system can be a good ambassador for our agri-food model, and even for our common agricultural policy."
"Having said all that, I would like to conclude with the fact that Mr Scottà's report comes at just the right time."
"As you know, the Commission intends to present a legislative package on quality policy by the end of 2010."
"The report that Mr Scottà is presenting today and which will be debated includes certain questions, ideas and proposals along these lines, and I shall strive as far as possible to take account of these ideas when I come to present the legislative proposals to you."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and the members of the parliamentary committees who have worked on this report, and I shall be very happy to hear your views and your proposals."
"Madam President, to be honest, the first thing I wanted to do this evening is to thank Mr Scottà for his excellent skill in negotiating this report."
"It has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups."
"We are proud of the position that will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote in Parliament and on a report such as this, which defends quality and which commits to the development and enhancement of rural areas, not only as mere evidence of a traditional European culture, but as true wealth- and job-creation agents."
"These are jobs that we currently need so much at this time of economic crisis and such a dramatic situation in terms of levels of employment in some Member States."
"In addition, we are pleased with the protection maintained by Parliament and the position already maintained by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it has made clear, in committing to quality of the highest standard."
"With regard to that highest standard, moreover, we naturally commit to maintaining that differentiation between Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication."
"Of course, we reject ideas of levelling quality downwards and we want EU production to receive attention and be valued."
"I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say."
"It was, of course, pleasing to hear him speak about commitment to the future of the European farming environment."
"We naturally hope he will listen to Parliament's voice, which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote."
"Finally, I would like to say let us hope that it never happens again that the European Commission gets ahead of Parliament by prohibiting things such as, for example, marketing standards for fruit and vegetables, that have caused such damage to European free competition."
"We want the imbalances in the market corrected and we also want to commit to quality, variety, food safety and the right quantity of production."
"In addition, we want EU production and the quality of that EU agricultural and food production to be defended in the World Trade Organisation."
"We are, of course, also relying on the work of Mr Cioloş for that, because neither our European producers nor our European consumers can go on being defenceless."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Scottà, for the outstanding work that he has done, and I should like to emphasise how quality policies are not only of great external value because of what we are able to offer consumers; they are also of great importance because of what they are able to give producers."
"As you have all observed, competition can take many forms on the markets."
"In a continent as large and as multifaceted as Europe, but which is characterised moreover by costs of production a good deal higher than those of the competition, it will be difficult to compete in terms of price, and we shall be able to compete only in terms of product differentiation."
"It is exactly from the perspective of differentiation that we must view quality policy, which is capable of offering a product and of placing on the market a product that differs from that of the competition, a product that can also be sold without precise and specific reference to a price that is lower by comparison to the competition."
"We are therefore in favour of continuing with the practice of Community marking, which is already under way, while emphasising the need to maintain the distinction between geographic indications and origin marking."
"However, we should also still stress that, internationally and at the level of international trade negotiations, the Union must play its part by defending origin marking and origin-marking policies so as to avoid an inevitable policy of exchange of markings, which would cause damage to our products."
"Before concluding, I shall take the liberty of making one final point, which concerns labelling."
"We have already requested and shall request again tomorrow, via a specific amendment, that Parliament vote on the possibility of indicating the origin of raw materials, not only for fresh, non-processed products, but also for processed single-ingredient products; that is, those in which the characteristic element is substantially the raw material."
"Commissioner, fellow Members, on behalf of the group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, we consider the report drawn up by Mr Scottà to be extremely important, and fundamentally we agree with it."
"The report had four, or rather five points for debate."
"First, the joint European Union logo."
"Many people fail to understand that the joint EU logo is not some sort of step towards federalism, but demonstrates to the consumer that a product fulfils the EU's specific food safety requirements, while at the same time differentiating it from the world beyond the EU boundaries."
"I therefore ask that we support the specific EU logo."
"The second point is the question of the place of origin."
"It is a very good thing that the EU now has, in the person of Mr Dacian Cioloş, an agriculture commissioner who has understood and supports the importance of local markets, since this is the only way we can preserve local flavours, regional flavours, and the diversity of food in Europe, and it is also clear that a key role is played in this regard by food quality policy, the place and designation of origin."
"There was an argument with the Commission, and I very much hope that the new commissioner no longer supports the earlier position that we should combine all Protected Designations of Origin with Protected Geographical Indication."
"Occasionally, this causes concern, most recently in the case of Tokaj wine."
"I thank the Commissioner that these problems have, in part, been remedied, while some of them await remedy."
"The fourth element: the organic logo."
"On this there is complete agreement."
"And finally, the fifth element: that some members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development called for the reintroduction of the previous strict standards for vegetables and fruit."
"I would like to return to the original form of Mr Scottà's report."
"Let us not go back to the days of overregulation, when we determined what the curve of a cucumber should be."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, can I, too, add my congratulations to Mr Scottà on his report."
"There is much in it that is to be commended."
"Unfortunately, I and my ALDE colleagues cannot support it as it currently stands without seeing one or two changes made to it."
"We cannot support paragraph 19, the so-called 'wonky fruit' paragraph."
"I believe it is nonsense for bureaucrats in Brussels to be telling consumers that they can buy only straight bananas or straight cucumbers."
"Surely it is up to consumers to make these decisions as to what they want to buy, so I hope that Parliament will use its common sense and back the joint amendment that has been submitted by the Greens and the ECR Group to throw out the straight banana rules and leave consumers free to chose whether they want to eat bent or twisted fruit and vegetables or whether they do not."
"It is surely a decision for consumers."
"Marianne Fischer-Boel, the previous Commissioner, did decide to abolish the standards and I would hope that we would continue to support that decision."
"I would also like to see some changes in paragraph 16."
"I understand the call for an EU logo but, unless it means something to consumers and adds value for farmers, in my view, it is a pointless exercise."
"It has to resonate with consumers and give some sort of return to the farming community."
"Otherwise, it is worthless."
"It is not worth pursuing it and I see no evidence to suggest that European consumers are looking for an EU logo."
"Finally, in paragraph 62, there is some criticism here of private certification systems which, in Scotland, have been very successful."
"It seems to me a good thing for farmers on a voluntary basis to add value to their produce through quality assurance schemes, and we should be supporting them, not discouraging them."
"I hope we can see some changes to this report in the votes tomorrow, and if so, we will be able to support it with the changes voted through tomorrow."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would echo many of the comments of my Scottish colleague - albeit not Group colleague - George Lyon."
"There is much in this report to admire and a couple of things where I think we could do a little better."
"We have brought forward a number of points and I will focus on two of them only."
"I and others believe that our consumers want to know where their food comes from."
"We believe that the provision of that information should be compulsory, so Amendment 4, on precisely that point, replaces some rather weak wording with a much stronger requirement that, where we can actually have information on 'place of farming' labelling, it should be compulsory, because that is what our consumers want to see."
"I would also pick up on Amendment 3 - as my colleague did - which deletes the attempt to reintroduce cumbersome and unworkable rules on the direct sale of fruit and vegetables to the consumer."
"We agreed only last year to repeal those rules and, while the consumers have not noticed much of a difference, our producers have noticed and still notice."
"Any attempt to bring those rules back would essentially be another stick for the processors, the multiples and the supermarkets to beat the producers with, and the consumers would not benefit directly."
"So there is much in this report to like."
"I would echo Mr Lyon's comments on the EU logo."
"I think that is more to do with the ambitions of this building rather than what our consumers want."
"If it does not resonate with the consumers, we should not do it and we should replace it with a compulsory origin labelling scheme, which is what our consumers want."
"The amendments are constructive;"
"I hope they will be successful and that colleagues will support them tomorrow."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, can I also express my appreciation to the rapporteur for a very good report."
"I think there are very many good ideas in this report and I agree entirely with the rapporteur, Mr Scottà, when he talks about how important it is for European producers to add value and maximise the potential of their products."
"We must always strive to achieve the maximum potential of Europe's agri-food industry."
"This will ultimately serve to increase our competitiveness and strengthen the economy in rural areas."
"In this regard, I am happy to see that Mr Scottà dealt with the future of the PGI and PDO systems."
"These instruments have proven popular with consumers and producers alike."
"However, I agree with the rapporteur that their management and application must be simplified."
"Also, if we are serious about their value abroad, we must ensure more protection from third countries."
"I would like to see more products from my own regions applying for a PGI and hopefully, the Commission will take on board some of the suggestions to simplify the application procedure so we will see more applications from my own region of Northern Ireland."
"However, I must point out that there are some elements of this report which I do not support."
"I am against the introduction of an EU quality logo."
"What I support is country of origin labelling."
"In effect, I feel an EU logo would be meaningless, a waste of time and money and I feel the same way about the EU logo for organic produce."
"Another concern for me are the amendments which were passed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development calling for the reintroduction of the marketing standards of fruit and vegetables, which some MEPs are desperately trying to get back on the table."
"The fact is these rules were dismantled by the Commission last year."
"I wholeheartedly supported this move and now we can let the market set its own standards."
"In this regard, I would urge colleagues to support the plenary amendments tabled by my own group and other groups, which are very clear and simple, and to delete these elements."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Cioloş, thank you for the encouraging words you have just spoken, and thank you to Mr Scottà for the sensitive work that he has done on this important report."
"I consider that with the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow, the intention is to protect and to enhance the value of the crops and the produce characteristic of every region and Member State of the European Union."
"Suffice it to say that I come from a country, Italy, that has 4 500 characteristic products, and these are assets from our land that we wish wholeheartedly to preserve."
"We fully understand that the road to excellence is still a long one, but the message that we must convey is that it is only through the quality of European produce that our farmers will have the chance to compete meaningfully on the world market."
"Bearing in mind also the widespread crisis that we are unfortunately experiencing, we can do nothing other than to sustain the quality, traceability and transparency of information associated with agricultural produce."
"It is important to know what kind of processing is used for each crop, and where the crop originates."
"It is important, because it is right that consumers know whether they are eating an apple grown, for example, in my region - Verona or in the Veneto - and that EU rules have therefore been observed throughout the entire production chain, or whether they are instead eating an apple produced in China, where the only thing that we do know is that, on many occasions, China has not even come close to observing the regulations and good practice observed by European farmers."
"Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this very important point."
"Consumers are, quite rightly, demanding that the food they purchase is safe, traceable and produced to a high standard."
"I would support a country of origin labelling system which promotes such standards and I believe that this will be widely acceptable to most consumers and to most within the industry."
"Obviously, promotion and marketing will be the hallmark of the success or failure of such a policy."
"We must take firm action against the potential counterfeiting of products which are wrongly labelled."
"I - like many colleagues in this Chamber - would be against an EU logo."
"I feel it would be largely meaningless and would not be helpful to consumers."
"Country of origin labelling, and even geographical indicators, are important because they promote locality, local heritage and conservation of local techniques, and they protect areas which rely on the production of a particular product."
"I come from Northern Ireland, a net exporter of agricultural products."
"Therefore, I want any labelling system to create a level playing field."
"Anything that impacts on the export of products from countries like my own would have a detrimental impact on the industry."
"Like other colleagues, I would support the quality assurance schemes that are available and encourage those as part of the general local indicator."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the production of high quality produce is fundamental to European farmers."
"I am in no doubt that there has be to a link between the quality of the product and the origin of the raw materials."
"I therefore consider mandatory quality labelling to be an important opportunity for our farmers."
"Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European food producers."
"The production of high quality foods has a long tradition and is often the only employment and sales opportunity in many rural areas with limited production alternatives."
"In order to guarantee this high quality standard, controls and objective criteria are certainly needed."
"However, the fact is that financial considerations on the part of the consumer also have an effect."
"Quality costs, and farmers need a fair income."
"Nevertheless, consumers have the freedom to opt for an attractively priced product, although they often decide on a product that is not of such high quality."
"One thing must be clear, however, and that is that consumers must have this freedom and they must genuinely be able to make a decision on the basis of objective and transparent criteria."
"We also need to raise the general awareness of consumers in this regard."
"We need protected geographical indications and designations of origin."
"We need the introduction of a regulated and protected designation for products from mountain areas and from GMO-free areas."
"However, we also need the 'Traditional Speciality Guaranteed' and 'Organic Farming' indications."
"Whatever happens, these must be retained."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new phase of reflection has opened in Europe today on the issue of quality, which is intended not only as a guarantee for consumers but, above all, as a stimulus for our producers to be more competitive in a market that is far larger and far more competitive."
"Our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality-related aspects associated with their products."
"In this sense, as Mr Scottà's report intends - and I, too, thank him for my part - we are making progress in guaranteeing, first of all, more information on the origin, composition and characteristics of production processes."
"At the same time, Commissioner, it is fundamental that European regulations allow organisations designated for the protection and promotion of quality products to plan their product supply and to adapt their production potential to market needs on the basis of fair and non-discriminatory principles."
"We hope that the approval of this report will signal the definitive establishment of quality as the lynchpin of the European strategy for the agri-food sector, and that the Commission will seriously consider our committee's proposals, so that one of the principal strong points of European agriculture can be transformed into a precious competitive advantage."
"Madam President, first, may I declare an interest?"
"I am an egg producer."
"Regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard."
"That is essential."
"An EU-inspired crisis will shortly hit the UK egg industry."
"From 1 January 2012, the production of eggs in battery cages is banned."
"The ban does not apply to eggs from Romania or Bulgaria, and perhaps others, who have a temporary immunity under their accession treaties."
"As long as they are processed, these countries may legally export battery-cage eggs produced after the ban to the UK."
"UK egg producers who have invested very heavily in alternative systems will be expected to compete at a disadvantage against imported products which can be produced far more cheaply."
"I must insist first that these imported products are clearly labelled and secondly, and most importantly, that we introduce with immediate effect an additional number 'four', for eggs produced using colony systems."
"Only then can consumers make an informed choice."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Scottà, I find it truly symbolic, Commissioner, that your first speech before this House should be on the very subject of quality policy."
"I believe that we take the same approach to these quality products."
"Yes, they represent an opportunity for our most fragile regions."
"Yes, they are a means by which to make the operators of a region and, in particular, farmers, more dynamic."
"Yes, they represent a strong signal sent out to European consumers, but also to consumers throughout the world, with regard to our agricultural model."
"Burgundy wine, Parma ham, certain Spanish meats - they have meaning far beyond the borders of each of our countries, far beyond the borders of Europe."
"The resolution that we shall no doubt adopt tomorrow offers you, Commissioner, a greater degree of ambition with regard to this policy of quality products, of products identified by different signs."
"European policy must be clearer; it must stop producers from being taken over by certain large industrial or distribution groups, which would clearly like to deprive producers of the benefit of the added value that these products give them."
"During the hearing, I drew your attention to the need to give organisations that bear, in particular, designations of origin overall responsibility for managing their products."
"Management of production rights is a fundamental part of quality production policy."
"Moreover, almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines."
"I should like to respond to our UK fellow Members with regard to paragraph 19 on the fruit and vegetables sector."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must not go backwards, but neither must we allow the huge vacuum in fruit and vegetable policy that means that, today, distributors are the only ones calling the shots."
"Let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way."
"Commissioner, you can very quickly convince us of your enthusiasm for this specific policy, which gives consumers a different image of agriculture."
"Now present us with a good text."
"Do so quickly; we have faith in you."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the quality of agricultural production is a crucial factor in the food chain and represents a vital asset for supporting the competitiveness of European producers."
"All this is reflected in the Scottà report, in which other considerations are also highlighted which the Commission will need to take into account when implementing this policy."
"The EU quality logo, as an expression of the agreement of our producers on production requirements within the Union, must be reserved exclusively for agricultural products produced in the European Union."
"It must grant greater protection to Protected Geographical Indications, both in the World Trade Organisation and in the bilateral agreement negotiations."
"European legislation on integrated production must also be drawn up that affords visibility to this more sustainable method of production and harmonises the existing criteria in each Member State."
"Finally, we must take into account the imbalances produced in the marketing chain, the importance of relying on sectoral marketing standards and the need to draw up EU guidelines for best practice for the operation of the systems related to agricultural product quality and their mutual recognition."
"I refer, in particular, to the control of private certification systems which are often used as a requirement for accessing large-scale distribution outlets."
"(FI) Madam President, it is very important to go to the heart of this matter and say that agriculture based on farming families is local in nature, provides employment, strengthens regions, is humane and also takes account of animal protection issues."
"The individual product resulting from this and the quality of the goods are what succeed in Europe and the world at large."
"Where a product comes from is important."
"Local specialities are of immeasurable value."
"The region that I come from in Finland produces a delicious goat's milk cheese."
"I can recommend it to you all."
"There are special products like this all over Europe."
"We have to ensure that they find their way onto the market."
"As we have a new Commissioner here, I would like to say to him that it must be possible to practise agriculture everywhere in Europe."
"If we remember this, we will have an excellent future, with safe and pure food originating here."
"(DE) Madam President, many thanks once again to the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"High quality agricultural products provide European agriculture with a major location advantage, allowing it to hold its own in the face of international competition."
"As a result, they play an important part in the development of rural areas within the European Union."
"The European Union's agricultural products already meet high quality standards."
"European standards have a global reputation for being very high."
"Unfortunately, not all consumers are aware of this."
"It is therefore important for the European Union to improve its quality policy and, at the same time, improve its information policy."
"This will be an incentive for producers to focus more on quality and food safety."
"Consumers have a right to enjoy agricultural products in the EU without concern and without compunction."
"Voluntary 'Made in the European Union' labelling and mandatory regional labelling, as well as mandatory proof of origin, are not mutually exclusive."
"On the other hand, when it comes to packaging sizes and the geometric shape of agricultural products, we need to take a sensible approach."
"The purpose of the European Union is not to be concerned about the curvature of cucumbers."
"The same applies to the size of pizzas."
"I would seriously warn against overregulation here."
"If we want regional economic cycles, we need to focus on quality and not on degrees of curvature."
"If the industry wants uniform cucumbers in uniform jars of uniform weight, that is up to the industry and not the European Union or the European Parliament."
"Therefore, let us focus on quality and not packaging units."
"In this regard, I trust in the common sense and wisdom of the European Parliament and of our new Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Cioloş."
"(RO) Let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur for tackling this issue of agricultural product quality."
"The demands of the market are diverse and are increasing all the time."
"In the European Union, the majority of aspects relate to food hygiene and safety, health and nutritional value, as well as certain social requirements."
"In addition, consumers are becoming increasingly more aware of the contribution made by agriculture to sustainability, climate change, food safety, biodiversity, animal welfare and the water shortage."
"Faced with these new commercial challenges, the European farmer's main asset is quality."
"The European Union offers the benefit of quality, which is attributable to an extremely high level of safety, guaranteed by current legislation, throughout the entire food chain which not only farmers but producers, too, have contributed to."
"However, there are a few aspects capable of enhancing quality."
"I believe that it is the European Union's duty to promote good quality products, along with taking action to protect them globally."
"In this context, I think that tighter control must be exercised with regard to those organic products originating from third countries, thereby guaranteeing fair competition between organic products produced in Europe and those from third countries."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the quality of agricultural products constitutes a priority for consumers by increasing competitiveness for producers and by strengthening the area in which they are produced."
"That is why efforts are being made to safeguard them, including with labelling."
"Today, however, Community legislation restricts compulsory labelling of the place of production to just certain products, thereby vouchsafing them special treatment and leaving out agricultural products of major nutritional value and priority for consumers."
"We therefore call on Parliament to adopt a more consistent and logical stand, in order to defend consumer interests by favouring compulsory labelling of the place of production for all agricultural products, including processed products containing just one ingredient, such as milk."
"(RO) The agricultural product quality policy may provide a solution for many farmers."
"The focus on quality rather than quantity may entail long-term benefits for many households."
"This is why the European Union needs coherent policies in this area, which, at the same time, will offer European farmers the opportunity to be competitive on the global market."
"Against this backdrop, the Scottà report is welcome, as is the package announced by Commissioner Cioloş."
"At the same time, we will also need something else to enable us to achieve the quality objectives, namely, a strong common agricultural policy in the future, along with a consistent budget."
"An agricultural product quality policy and a reduction in the European agriculture budget are two incompatible ideas."
"We also need to make sufficient instruments available to farmers so that they can develop their own quality policy and, last but not least, we need farmers from Member States in the West and East to enjoy equal opportunities."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing quality logos and mandatory designations of origin for food, we must not forget that our political decisions need to be implementable in practice."
"I cannot see how Amendments 4 and 5 can be implemented in practice and I will therefore be rejecting them."
"Quality logos should, in principle, be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary."
"They give producers and processors of goods the opportunity to be successful in niche markets."
"However, we need to take account of the fact that, through the market dominance of a few chain stores, many voluntary private logos are interpreted as quasi standards."
"This robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers."
"There is a similar situation with regard to the mandatory indication of the place of origin for agricultural products, such as milk."
"Implementing this requirement in agriculture and in the processing industry would scarcely be possible from a technical point of view."
"We need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to call attention to the pertinence of item 9 of the Scottà report, which emphasises that, in the WTO negotiations, the Commission must seek to secure an agreement on the 'non-trade concerns' which will ensure that imported agricultural products meet the same requirements, in the areas of food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection, that are imposed on agricultural products produced inside the European Union."
"The problem is that this is probably the 150th time the European Parliament has said that the same requirements should be applied to importers as those applied to producers within the European Union."
"There has been no response, and we are still dealing with a situation in which our producers, farmers and manufacturers are having to comply with high, expensive standards, while importers do not meet these standards."
"This leads to unfair competition."
"As was rightly emphasised in the report, this has to change."
"(DE) Madam President, the control of foodstuffs is a utopian fantasy."
"The pressure for control and the consequences are, too, it seems."
"We are thus in a right old stew!"
"In the case of health risks, authorities should put out warnings, but they are not obliged to."
"We have seen the result of this recently in the listeria-contaminated cheese scandal."
"Food inspectors often have to battle with deficient labelling - and it is not only the inspectors; consumers have the same problem."
"They are completely overwhelmed by the labelling jungle."
"For example, 'farmer' can be stated on the packaging, even though the product has been industrially processed, or it might say 'of Austrian origin' even though the ingredients come from all over the place."
"Quality-conscious customers are prepared to pay more for high quality foods."
"The question is for how long, if rogue traders are also operating in this area."
"If control systems are geared to small holdings and hardly any attention is paid to what large eco-holdings are doing, then something is wrong with the entire system."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, you said today that products with a designation of origin are a spearhead for our industry."
"You are right about that."
"It is particularly true of products that are produced under difficult circumstances, for example, in mountainous areas, and which require higher margins."
"The designation 'mountain produce' is therefore particularly important."
"I would like to address two points."
"I think that, with regard to these products, we should give farmers the opportunity to organise themselves into inter-professional committees and support consortia where they can also take market decisions."
"That would not contravene competition law and, if it did, it would, in any case, be a much smaller contravention than the concentration of chain stores we have seen over the last few years."
"With regard to quality standards, about which much has already been said, I am aware of the discussion in the press and also the talk about curved cucumbers."
"However, producers want and need these rules."
"We should take that into account in our debate and also in the vote tomorrow."
"(PT) Certification mechanisms could constitute a contribution to increasing the value of farmers' work, improving their income and promoting quality and food safety."
"However, since the current certification procedures are complex, time-consuming and, above all, expensive, their results have been negative, especially for small and medium-sized farms."
"Increased production costs and the distribution of income throughout the value chain becomes even more unfavourable to the producer with the inclusion of yet another business agent in that chain."
"Given this, and as an effective guarantee of transparency, quality and security for customers, certification must be carried out by public bodies and must not incur a higher cost for producers."
"Above all, however, if there is to be a good policy, there needs to be another agricultural policy, a profound reform of the common agricultural policy which supports local protection, the right to produce and the right to food sovereignty, which will protect farmers and consumers from the consequences of the deregulation of world trade and the unchecked liberalisation of the markets, locking them either within the framework of bilateral agreements or within that of the World Trade Organisation."
"(LT) The European Union's agricultural produce is well known in the international marketplace and valued for its high quality."
"In terms of the future prospects of the common agricultural policy, I am convinced that product quality must remain the essential goal in the future."
"High quality agricultural products are not simply our business card on a global scale; they are also a very important part of the economic and social life of the EU's region."
"Policies on quality should be developed by providing more clarity with product certification and labelling that can be understood by all European Union consumers."
"In order to safeguard the production of quality agricultural products, we must lay down clear rules for labelling products that may contain genetically modified organisms."
"This problem has become particularly relevant since the Commission's decision to allow the use of genetically modified potatoes for animal feed."
"Until we lay down labelling and certification standards for such products, there is a threat to future EU food quality policy and the health of us all."
"(PL) Madam President, thanks to the instruments of the common agricultural policy, the agricultural market in the European Union is characterised by the supply of agricultural and food items of high quality."
"High standards, suitable food quality and sufficient supply are components of food security, something which is so important."
"It is important that information on the quality of goods reaches the consumer."
"We know that every product allowed on to the market must meet minimum standards."
"Special quality which exceeds minimum standards must be detailed on the product to improve its competitiveness by drawing attention to its additional qualities, for which the consumer must pay."
"Other important information which should also be on food products is the place of origin and processing of the raw product."
"Consumers must know what they are buying and for what they are paying."
"The absence of this information weakens the competitiveness of agricultural and food items produced and processed in Europe in comparison to imported goods produced without regard to animal welfare, environmental requirements or the social standards of employees."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Scottà's successful report is very much in the interests of consumer protection."
"The safety, including from the point of view of health, of agricultural products really must be a top priority."
"I would like to point out the key importance of improving designations of origin for foods."
"Every agricultural product in the EU must be clearly labelled with the origin of the raw materials."
"Consumers must not be duped by fraudulent labelling."
"Take China, for example."
"Imported seeds arrive in Austria and then the so-called 'pressed seed oil' is sold there."
"Worse still, fattened animals are transported across Europe under deplorable conditions in order to produce so-called 'Tyrolean bacon', for example."
"We therefore need to focus on regional supplies, and, in the interests of our consumers and our farmers, we need to support local farmers and small butchers."
"Madam President, I do not propose to go over all the issues raised here, especially since there is going to be a vote tomorrow, but I would nonetheless like to highlight certain points that have been made repeatedly in the speeches."
"With regard to the merging of the various geographical indication systems, I fully understand the concern of certain Members."
"I can assure you that it is not my intention to destroy something that works, that functions, something to which consumers are attached."
"We just need to make the quality protection system clearer and more consistent, all the more so given that we are trying, by way of international negotiations, to gain recognition for these systems."
"Therefore, it is important that these systems already be clear and easy for our partners to understand so that they can be recognised."
"It is therefore not my intention to merge for the sake of it."
"The end result will be a system by which we can make simplifications, without touching things that are already easily identifiable by consumers."
"As regards the European quality logo, we must also discuss and decide in this Chamber which objectives we want it to achieve."
"Is the aim simply to reflect compliance with the basic standards that all European farmers meet and that imported goods also meet?"
"Indeed - I wish to point this out - all imported agri-food products must meet minimum food hygiene and safety standards which are met by our own products."
"We therefore have to see which is the best way to successfully differentiate our products from the others."
"Do we need a European Union logo, or should we instead indicate the places of origin, the locations of production?"
"The best mechanism needs to be identified, and we shall, in any case, give consideration to this."
"With regard to geographical indications at international level, rest assured that my concern is to ensure that this system is recognised by our partners."
"We are trying to ensure this in negotiations conducted by the International Labour Organisation, but also whenever we have an opportunity to do so when negotiating bilateral agreements."
"We are therefore going to pursue this approach and, moreover, in my mandate, I want to be able to strengthen the policy for communicating and promoting these quality signs internationally, since quality is an asset and, as such, it can give us a greater presence on the international stage."
"With regard to the reserved terms 'mountain', 'island' and so forth, we are looking into the possibility of introducing these kinds of systems."
"Here too, we need to decide how to proceed so as to ensure that they do not represent an additional cost for those farmers who want to introduce them."
"As regards interprofessional organisations and their role in the management of protected designations of origin, or PDOs, it is our intention, particularly as regards milk - since the majority of PDOs and protected geographical indications (PGIs) are concentrated in that sector - to carry out a study to see what impact the ending of quotas will have on the smooth functioning of these quality protection systems, and I hope that, on the basis of this report, we shall see which measures will have to be taken should the need arise."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Thank you, Commissioner Cioloş."
"I should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land."
"The land is that from which we harvest our products and which we must preserve for the future and for those who will have to do the same."
"That is why, taking this simple thought as a starting point, I should like to move on to producers, to those who work the land, who must be recognised also by those who subsequently enjoy the commercial produce they find in the supermarket or some other shop."
"It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer."
"I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers, and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not: why not ask consumers what they want to know?"
"In this way, we will know which potential label consumers are able to read and to understand, and thus perhaps make it much simpler than the complicated labels we have today."
"Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil?"
"It will be for them to choose whether a litre of Brazilian milk is better than a litre of milk produced in the European Union."
"Be that as it may, I consider and I hope that this report will be useful for Commissioner Cioloş by providing further details to help grow that thread I referred to earlier: the land, the producer, the processor, if any, the consumer, safety and, above all on the issue of safety, quality."
"We have all spoken about quality, and I believe that we are all in favour of raising the quality of our produce even more if it means eating well and eating healthily."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The issue of an agricultural product quality policy has found an authoritative and unanimous response from the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby making the existing legislation more complete."
"European agricultural producers have finally gained recognition in European legislation on the quality of their produce linked to the region of production."
"This represents a guarantee for sheltering them from market globalisation and for ensuring that the 'informed' consumer can reject produce that does not bear the obligatory geographic indication of origin, that is not certified clearly, and that does not comply with marketing and anti-counterfeiting rules."
"Consumers will be able to make their purchasing choices in full knowledge of the rules relating to their desired product."
"The European Parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers."
"The health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former."
"An amendment of mine on the protection of product characteristics, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved, recognises that the regions have an essential role as producer partners, in particular, of the producers of traditional and organic products, and calls for regions to be involved in the recognition and promotion of products with a geographical indication, traditional products and organic products."
"I am pleased to note the recognition of this indication."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the quality of agricultural produce is of fundamental importance when it comes to informing the purchaser and the consumer of the characteristics of products and as regards continuing to guarantee that purchasing products from the European Union is synonymous with high quality derived from the various regional traditions within the Union."
"Over the years, agricultural product quality policy has evolved in a fragmented way, characterised by a succession of sectoral instruments."
"Market globalisation and the economic and financial crisis that has struck Europe have not spared the agricultural sector."
"To emerge from this, we need to focus on the quality and safety of our produce."
"The continuing search for quality must form an essential component of the strategy pursued by the EU's agri-food sector on the world market."
"I believe, furthermore, that serious consideration must be given to the Commission's proposal to introduce a European quality logo for products originating and processed wholly within Europe."
"This logo would, in fact, represent formal recognition of the efforts made by European farmers to maintain high standards of production."
"Finally, it is definitely a good idea to simplify legislation in order to reduce the bureaucratic burden on businesses while, at the same time, guaranteeing that the quality standards achieved by European producers are maintained."
"The agricultural product quality policy is not a static policy, separate from the other policies connected with agriculture."
"On the contrary, the reform of the common agricultural policy should also include policies dealing with adaptation to climate change, the preservation of biological diversity, secure supplies of energy or water, ensuring decent living conditions for animals, and European fisheries."
"The product quality policy can help to increase the competitiveness of European farmers and to maintain economic profits in rural areas in a time of crisis precisely by targeting the quality of agricultural products and high quality foodstuffs."
"It must continue to apply without exception that purchasing products from the EU means purchasing high quality products, which are produced on the basis of various European regional traditions while following the highest production standards in terms of food safety."
"I support the Commission proposal for introducing a European quality logo, which would be used for products coming from and also exclusively processed in the EU."
"Consumers confuse the designation of the place where food is processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product."
"It is necessary to emphasise that the production process itself can dramatically influence the quality and characteristics of a product in a negative way."
"I also welcome the retention of the systems of registering geographical indications and traditional specialities, as these indications are significant for European agriculture not only from an economic perspective, but also from an environmental and social perspective."
"G20 labour and employment ministers meeting (Washington, 20/21 April) (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the G20 labour and employment ministers meeting (Washington, 20/21 April)."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the latest projections from the ILO and the OECD show that unemployment rates in the industrialised countries are still rising and will not reach their climax before 2011."
"In turn, more than 200 million workers in developing and emerging countries are at risk of being pushed into extreme poverty."
"This would result in nearly 1.5 billion working poor worldwide."
"These figures speak for themselves."
"Indeed, the current crisis highlighted the most painful weaknesses of our increasingly interconnected global economy."
"There is now a clear consensus on the need for global actions to solve global problems."
"Last year in Pittsburgh, leaders of the G20 pledged to ensure that when growth returns, jobs do too."
"Accordingly, the G20 leaders agreed to build an employment-oriented framework for future economic growth."
"This is all very welcome."
"The Commission lends full support to any framework for actions that put quality jobs at the heart of recovery and help people back to work worldwide."
"This approach reflects the unmistakable reality that employment is the bottom line in the current global economic crisis, and that a jobless recovery is not an option."
"In Pittsburgh, the leaders invited the US Labour Secretary to convene a meeting of G20 labour and employment ministers."
"Their mandate will be to assess the global employment situation and discuss the impact of policy responses to the crisis as well as the possible necessity of any further measures."
"Moreover, ministers are to consider medium-term employment and skills development policies, social protection programmes and best practices to ensure workers can benefit from advances in science and technology."
"This unprecedented meeting will take place in Washington DC on 20 and 21 April."
"The Commission and the Spanish Presidency will also participate."
"The Commission is working closely with the ILO on the preparations for the meeting which will offer us, in particular, an opportunity to promote decent work worldwide on behalf of the European Union."
"The application of the ILO's internationally recognised core labour standards and efforts to achieve the objective of a basic social security flow are crucial here."
"Moreover, the G20 mandate includes the development by the ILO and other international organisations of a medium-term global training strategy."
"The Commission is making a significant contribution to these efforts through the New Skills for New Jobs initiative."
"This is part of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative on an agenda for new skills and jobs."
"The key challenge here is to move forward with a strategy to reskill and upgrade the global workforce and facilitate transitions between jobs, and from education to work, for young people."
"Social partners' involvement can bring tremendous added value."
"We all know here how effective the European Social Dialogue can be when it comes to improving the design of various measures in the employment field."
"The Commission is ready to share this experience with the European Union's international partners."
"The Commission will keep Parliament informed about the progress made at the Washington DC meeting."
"The G20 Labour Ministers' meeting will be an opportunity for us to develop new measures which will shape the post-crisis policy framework."
"These new measures and policies can contribute to a balanced exit from the crisis in putting jobs at the heart of the recovery and can overcome the legacy of the crisis."
"The aim is to give the necessary input and orientation to the G20 leaders' summits in Canada and in Korea later this year."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis, this G20 summit forces us to conclude that the first objective that we must achieve is that of making workers more employable."
"This is a necessity, because there can be no social integration without integration via the workplace."
"Therefore, today, as we prepare for this G20, the only motto and the only objective that we can share is that of combating unemployment."
"As you said just now, Commissioner, unemployment has risen significantly in the European Union and the world, but it is quite clear that inequalities are increasing and that they are increasing even more sharply among young people, temporary workers, migrants and women."
"Thus, when we see today that 21.4% of young people are unemployed, compared with the 14.7% - an already substantial percentage - that were unemployed two years ago, the speed of the increase is very worrying."
"We therefore need to build together, within European and globally - since the response can only be global - convergence and integration strategies that explicitly recognise the fact that dynamic social and cohesion policies are the foundations for the development of our society."
"I would also like to remind you of the World Trade Organisation's Global Jobs Pact, which offers an appropriate series of strategic options to enable us to emerge from the crisis."
"Where do we stand with regard to the European Commission's proposal to base the framework of the new post-2010 strategy on the social market economy, integration and transparency?"
"I hope that our European ministers for labour and employment do not forget, during this summit, that they will have to account for the rise in unemployment to all the millions of people who, one after another, have lost their jobs in recent months."
"Commissioner Andor, the European Union therefore expects you to act so that we can reassure our fellow citizens and get them back into work."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am very glad that we are able to have an opportunity to have this debate this afternoon, in preparation for the summit that will bring you all together in Washington on 20 and 21 April."
"This meeting we are having today owes much to the Chair of the Committee on Employment, Mrs Berès."
"An act of God prevents her from being here today."
"I am going to speak on behalf of us both."
"I shall speak in her language, French, using the papers she had prepared, because I am sure you will be very interested in hearing her own words:"
"(FR) That is why, Commissioner, at a time when the unemployment rate in Europe is going to exceed the 10% mark, when there are more than one and a half billion poor workers in the world and when the crisis is hitting a further 200 million poor workers, it is time for the leaders to focus on the social consequences of the crisis and to give priority to employment."
"We commend the preparatory work that you have carried out in close cooperation and in a spirit of dialogue with the social partners."
"The meeting sought by the Heads of State or Government gathered together in Pittsburgh has the virtue of finally reconciling macro-economic issues with the social dimension."
"In order to avoid a repeat of the mistakes that led to the crisis, we absolutely must ensure that the crisis does not further increase the social inequalities within our countries, between EU Member States and at international level."
"We must ensure that a hasty strategy to end the crisis does not result in the dismantling of our social model, for the origins of this crisis - which we have been going through for three years now - are well and truly social."
"It is not enough to regulate financial products; we must get to the very bottom of the wrongdoing."
"Unfortunately, we fear that, in spite of numerous reports by organisations such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) highlighting the worsening social inequalities, there is still a lack of political will where the social dimension is concerned."
"Proof of this is the very poor visibility of social issues, which are not even mentioned on the G20's official website."
"Similarly, the recent decision by the ECOFIN Council to put a stop to the exceptional employment support measures designed to restore public finances quickly is unacceptable."
"A dangerous game is being played between ministers for finance and ministers for employment and social affairs."
"Commissioner, we are counting on you and on the Spanish Presidency to go against this short-term approach and to place social issues at the heart of European and international action."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, it is absolutely crucial that the G20 employment and labour ministers put quality jobs at the heart of their economic recovery plans."
"For many workers - as you are aware, Commissioner - the picture is a dismal one, with unemployment increasing, working hours reduced, substantial pay cuts, the working poor you spoke of, and inadequate or non-existent training opportunities."
"At the same time, workers see the banks being recapitalised, while small and medium-sized businesses - the drivers of economic growth - are being starved of funds and jobs are being lost."
"Fiscal discipline and retrenchment must not take the place of a job stimulus plan, yet that is happening in many countries, including my own, Ireland."
"The Commission praises our fiscal discipline but we are haemorrhaging jobs."
"We are balancing the books but our workers are paying the price."
"The G20 ministers have to make a firm commitment to supporting decent work and prioritising job growth, alongside minimum income, social protection and training or re-training for those who do not have work."
"Finally, I agree with you that they must commit to implementing policies consistent with ILO fundamental principles and rights and they must not allow the current economic crisis to be used as an excuse to weaken or disregard internationally recognised labour standards."
"It is high time that the leaders of the European Union recognised the part that they, too, played in the serious social crisis that is happening all over Europe and the world."
"This is a consequence of the financial and economic crisis which they facilitated by deregulating financial and trade markets, and pushing through free trade agreements with third countries, without heeding the interests of workers or the public."
"The rise in unemployment and precarious and poorly paid work increases poverty and is a direct consequence of neoliberal policies and the crisis of capitalism."
"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development believe that unemployment has not yet reached its peak in industrialised countries, and that soon, more than 200 million workers could be thrown into extreme poverty."
"This means that the number of poor workers could reach 1.5 billion, with women and young people worst affected."
"It is time to put an end to the regression of social and labour rights that we are seeing."
"Quality jobs with rights need to become a priority and made to comply, at the very least, with the ILO conventions."
"Without the creation of new jobs with rights, there can be no way out of this crisis."
"(HU) I think we are all pleased that ministers for employment and social affairs now meet in the G20 gathering, and that they have thus become equal in rank to the finance ministers, which had hitherto not been the case."
"It seems that it took an economic crisis for it to be possible to speak of global economic measures, not only with regard to the economy and finance, but also with regard to social and employment issues."
"This is especially important now, when it seems that the economic pressures of the crisis are receding, while unemployment and poverty continue to grow."
"We know that this will have long-term social as well as political consequences."
"Around the world, this goes hand in hand with extremism, which poses a long-term threat as well."
"It is important for ministers for employment and social affairs to develop sectoral policies that can remedy the employment situation and reduce poverty."
"Let me give a concrete example, which was mentioned at the G20 summit, that of the instrument of micro-finance, which not only increases social cohesion, but also self-sufficiency, and can be important for this reason as well."
"It is regrettable, however, that Parliament cannot adopt a position and submit it to the G20 meeting, but can only send our verbal messages."
"However, I believe that even this is more than anything we have done in the past."
"Madam President, as we are all saying, the financial crisis has hit ordinary people very hard."
"That is why we have to make sure there are positive outcomes from the G20 Employment Ministers' meeting, the first to be called, as has just been mentioned."
"I just hope we do have those positive outcomes."
"I am glad they are not going to concentrate just on the financial sector but will look at the social impact on people as well."
"We know there is record unemployment in many countries across the world."
"We have got to look at the real way of getting people into work - into real jobs."
"Training programmes, for instance, have to be adequate to actually cover the needs at the moment."
"We ought to be looking at identifying best practice from countries that have already brought in various measures, and trying to roll that out to other countries, to try to help the most marginalised in society."
"Work has been done in those other countries, so why are we not learning from them?"
"We must make sure the core ILO conventions are actually implemented."
"We must make sure the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is implemented."
"We must make sure that those who are not protected at the moment are protected in the future."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model."
"It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority."
"I therefore call on Europe's labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures."
"That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty."
"Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe's labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner."
"(EL) Madam President, Commission, there will be a premiere in Washington on 20 April: for the first time, the Ministers for Employment of the 20 wealthiest areas on earth are to hold a conference."
"The voice of Europe needs to be heard loud and strong there."
"Four-and-a-half million jobs are in danger of being lost in Europe over the next three years and this will impact on growth, damage social cohesion and cause social unrest."
"Creating jobs must be a priority for Europe."
"Realistic, specific, quantifiable targets, both long-term and immediate, urgently need to be set."
"We urgently need to be able to safeguard decent work for the citizens of Europe."
"We urgently need to be able to safeguard the employment and pension rights of workers."
"We are close to forgetting the obvious: that work is a lever for growth."
"I think that we ultimately need to understand that we cannot talk of economic policy without keeping the employment parameter constantly in mind."
"I should like to close by saying that, otherwise, instead of talking about a Council of Ministers for Employment, we shall be talking about a Council of Ministers for Unemployment."
"(FR) Madam President, in my view, there will be no lasting solution to unemployment and underemployment unless we reverse the current approach, which prioritises capital over labour, and unless we introduce a new form of wealth distribution that includes an increase in pay, in social protection levels and in minimum benefits."
"This is what will create the conditions for a sustainable recovery that provides a wealth of jobs."
"Social progress is a prerequisite for ending the economic crisis, not the other way around."
"The G20 should act as an incentive to mobilise the international banking sector in favour of selective credit that would help employment, job-creating investment and promoters of a new, environmentally friendly economy."
"At the same time, speculative capital flows should be taxed so that they can be redirected to the fight against poverty."
"I propose that we examine and trial a vocational and training-related social security system for the jobs of the future, at the same time as developing public research, which is crucial to a new lasting and sustainable economy."
"(RO) The G20 leaders established in Pittsburgh in September 2009 that the main priority in the economic recovery plans must be to preserve existing jobs and create new ones."
"In spite of the International Monetary Fund's forecasts for 3% economic growth, the OECD and ILO forecasts indicate that the unemployment rate will continue to rise rapidly right until the first half of 2011."
"The economic and financial crisis has hit European companies hard, not to mention, by implication, Member States' budgets."
"The G20 labour and social welfare ministers should ask for the support granted to companies in difficulty, as a result of the economic crisis, to be extended until when the unemployment rate starts to fall again."
"In addition, I believe that these ministers must find measures to support both civil servants and employees paid from public funds, such as teachers and doctors, who are losing jobs as a result of the reduction in the budgets allocated to public institutions."
"(LT) We must welcome the fact that for the first time, labour and employment ministers are meeting at the G20."
"At the 2009 G20 leaders' summit in Pittsburgh, the countries' leaders agreed that the emphasis in national economic recovery plans should be on the retention and creation of jobs."
"However, since this summit, the situation has worsened, both in the European Union and on a global scale."
"In some Member States, the number of unemployed that grows daily has reached a critical level and some national governments' crisis management plans are making people's situation significantly worse, since pensions and other important social guarantees are being reduced."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are shutting down en masse."
"I think that the main emphasis of the G20 summit should be agreement on concrete measures to stabilise the unemployment level, since the disillusionment and fear of the people will not contribute to the speedy economic recovery of our countries."
"(LT) First of all, I really welcome the fact that for the first time at the G20, ministers of the world's most powerful countries, labour and employment ministers, will meet to discuss the most important problems, in other words, how to overcome unemployment and increase employment."
"In fact, this meeting will take place in a very difficult environment, as in the European Union alone, around 5.5 million young people are out of work."
"The number of long-term unemployed is also growing constantly."
"This week, in my country, Lithuania, 300 000 people were registered unemployed."
"My country has never experienced this before in the 20 years since it became independent."
"Therefore, it is very important that, once they come together, the ministers of the most powerful countries set out concrete measures that should be taken so that people in EU countries do not just have any work, but suitable work, quality work, decently paid work, from which they make a living and not live in poverty."
"Therefore, I hope that such concrete decisions are taken at this meeting."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am glad this discussion on the labour and employment ministers' meeting in Washington DC took place today because it is not going to be the only summit where the voice of the Members of Parliament will be heard on such an important subject."
"There is another summit coming soon that should also get to hear what you said today: I have in mind the summit tomorrow in Brussels, which has the opportunity to support the Europe 2020 agenda with a strong inclusive pillar and flagship initiatives to boost employment and reduce poverty and with serious targets included in this strategy."
"It has to be appreciated how serious a crisis the world economy has faced in the last two years and it is not only about deteriorating statistics."
"I fully agree with Mrs Göncz that we also have to appreciate the political risk, the risk this crisis poses for European civilisation."
"And I hope that the leaders who meet tomorrow will understand this and draw very responsible conclusions from this situation."
"Without that, it would be very difficult to represent European values worldwide; it would be very difficult to represent with credibility the commitment to addressing unemployment and poverty in the G20 context."
"It is a major step forward that labour ministers are meeting in the G20 context."
"Whether we are emancipated to include finance ministers is still to be seen but it is very important that this step has been made and there is the opportunity to exchange experience and exchange views."
"It is true that the financial crisis has been first addressed by the governments and the fiscal power of the state has been directed to the stabilisation of the banking sectors."
"The banks have been recapitalised and financial stability has enjoyed priority."
"Now we have to prioritise job creation."
"We have to prioritise an exit strategy that does not harm existing jobs and does not undermine the capacity to invest."
"Therefore, we first have to make a decision to create financial order, to restore stability and to eliminate the pressure on Member State governments to make unreasonable cuts that affect the social sector and employment."
"I fully agree that the ILO is the cornerstone in producing ILO standards and making reference to them in the international discussion is of key importance."
"This is a sound standard for us in moving forward on employment and social relations."
"The G20 context is a great opportunity to link up with discussions in the outside world and they are connecting us not only to discussions on labour relations, but also on financial regulation and on issues such as transaction tax that are more boldly discussed in other corners of the world and sometimes deserve more serious attention inside the European Union."
"So I am grateful for the comments I have heard and for the messages I can convey to other partners in the G20 group."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) In my view, it is essential to recognise that the decision makers of today are not keeping pace with developments in the world, the economy and technology: soon, even an energy company will be able to plan farther ahead than international political actors."
"Unfortunately, a failure to recognise this reality is evident in the current EU 2020 strategy."
"The European Union should look farther and should also be willing to make sacrifices in the interest of a more sustainable society."
"We need to concentrate increasingly on infrastructure and on job creation rather than on a growing consumption that relies on imports."
"Unconditional free trade dishonourably takes away jobs, ruins the environment, endangers consumer health and increases obstacles to accessibility, solely in order to guarantee the price of a product or service."
"We cannot go back to the extremes of the days of rampant capitalism - the world of Oliver Twists!"
"Otherwise, the EU 2020 strategy, just like the Lisbon Strategy, will end in failure."
"Fight against tuberculosis (debate)"
"The next item is the statement from the Commission on the fight against tuberculosis."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome this opportunity on World Tuberculosis Day to underline the Commission's commitment to addressing the challenges caused by this disease."
"We had believed that our successes in past decades had eliminated the threats related to this serious public health concern."
"However, for too long, we have mistakenly lowered the guard against tuberculosis."
"In 2008, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported around 83 000 cases and close to 6 000 deaths due to tuberculosis in the European Union and EFTA countries."
"This amounts to about 16 deaths a day."
"This is simply unacceptable and requires action by all concerned sectors and stakeholders."
"It is unacceptable because tuberculosis is a preventable and curable disease that should not lead to such dramatic consequences."
"Tuberculosis is a cross-sector issue and it is linked to many of the public health challenges we face in the European Union, including the spread of anti-microbial resistance, the lack of new effective tools to diagnose and treat tuberculosis, the steep rise of co-infections such as with HIV, and the inequalities, with tuberculosis disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups."
"The Commission has launched a number of initiatives over the past years to strengthen capacities to tackle tuberculosis."
"In 2000, tuberculosis was included in the list of priority diseases under EU-wide surveillance."
"In this context, the Commission supported several projects that have helped coordinate the surveillance of tuberculosis in the 53 countries of the WHO European Region."
"This has improved our shared knowledge and monitoring of the epidemiological situation."
"In addition, through its research framework programmes, the Commission supports the development of new treatments, vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tools against tuberculosis."
"Since 2002, more than EUR 124 million has been allocated to these efforts."
"But, as tuberculosis is not constrained by borders, we have to support countries beyond the European Union."
"The Commission supports developing countries in their tuberculosis control programmes through the European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through External Action (2007-2011)."
"The main channel for financing this support is the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, to which the Commission has contributed EUR 870 million since 2002, with an annual contribution that amounts to EUR 100 million since 2008."
"In addition, it supports clinical trials and capacity building in sub-Saharan Africa through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP)."
"Finally, the setting up of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has enabled us to raise our efforts against tuberculosis to a new level."
"In March 2007, following a request from the Commission, the Centre developed an action plan to fight tuberculosis in the EU."
"This addresses the key cross-sectoral challenges we are facing today in tuberculosis prevention and control and strengthening epidemiological surveillance: ensuring prompt and quality TB care for all, developing new tools for diagnosis and treatment, decreasing the burden of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection, and addressing the threat of multi-drug resistance."
"However, the Commission cannot succeed in this challenge alone."
"The contribution from civil society to reach out to the most vulnerable, and the Member States' commitment are key towards achieving our objective to support the global fight against this disease."
"'The cause of death in the age of antibiotics' is what a group of researchers called tuberculosis, a word which many of us thought had disappeared from everyday usage, but a disease which still kills a huge number of people."
"Tuberculosis is the seventh most common cause of death in the world."
"Unfortunately, the current situation is highlighted by the rise in the number of cases involving a strain of tuberculosis resistant to standard drug therapy."
"Globally, there were 9.4 million new cases of tuberculosis in 2008 and 1.8 million deaths."
"A person is infected by tuberculosis somewhere in the world every second."
"We need to hear these figures stated as clearly as possible in an important forum of the European Union so that we can all realise as much as possible that this disease is still ravaging our societies and killing a large number of European citizens."
"I come from a country which, unfortunately, features among the top places in the European Union in the dismal ratings for tuberculosis cases."
"Although we can talk about a slightly downward trend in recent years and an increase in the percentage of people cured of chemo-resistant tuberculosis, the absolute figures remain alarming and they reflect a tragic reality."
"We need to wage a consistent, integrated battle, based on the best possible planning, in order to keep this scourge under control."
"We have to continue at European Union level the work we have done so far to ensure that in all Member States, we raise the level of detection of diseases, the level of access to adequate treatment, the quality of treatment monitoring and the quality of medical care given to patients."
"We also need all governments to realise the importance of this battle and to work alongside social partners as effectively as possible in order to reduce the number of Europeans suffering from this disease which we thought had been banished in previous centuries."
"Above all, we need to wage this battle together, as a family, without considering the differences between us, but helping each other to overcome this problem."
"Ultimately, we are the European Union and our strength lies in unity."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, in this day and age, no one should be dying from TB."
"(SV) That is what Ban Ki Moon said today, on World Tuberculosis Day."
"He is right, of course."
"Nevertheless, very many people around the world are still dying of tuberculosis today, particularly the young and the poor."
"We therefore need to increase our aid to the global fund that is responsible for a very large proportion of the work to combat tuberculosis, malaria and HIV in the poorer areas of the world."
"However, as the Commission pointed out, people in Europe are also dying of tuberculosis."
"We need to increase our cooperation to stop the spread of multi-resistant TB and to find effective treatments which reach all of the vulnerable groups in society."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, based in Solna in Sweden, has a very important role to play here and I am pleased that the Commission has made it a priority to come here and hold a debate on this important subject today."
"Mr President, medical progress has not yet overcome tuberculosis."
"Consequently, it is wrongly considered to be a disease that affects only poor countries."
"This underestimates the way in which it is spreading, especially in Central and Eastern Europe."
"In truth, no country is safe from this dreadful disease, which has been around for many thousands of years."
"Furthermore, the multiple-resistant strains offer little hope of an end to this scourge in the short term."
"The need to fight on several fronts by means of prevention, medical supervision, research and the dissemination of precautionary and hygiene measures encourages us to act in a coordinated and determined manner."
"In short, we must be able to rely at all times on the best possible strategies in this area."
"When it comes to financing the measures, it is advisable to distinguish between two scenarios."
"Firstly, the social security systems in our countries should, in principle, be able to guarantee sufficient medical cover."
"However, patients in developing countries still rely on solidarity which, since 2002, has materialised in an exemplary fashion under the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"If the aim is indeed to halve the number of cases of tuberculosis between 2000 and 2015, one of the three scenarios put forward by the President of the Global Fund, Michel Kazatchkine, will have to be endorsed."
"I should like to ask the Commission which of the three scenarios it is using as a basis for making proposals to our Member States regarding the future financing of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"(PT) World Tuberculosis Day, which takes place today, is an occasion to call for the strengthening of political dialogue and the involvement of governments and civil society in this cause."
"The number of cases of tuberculosis has been decreasing within the EU."
"There has also been a marked reduction in Portugal, but the incidence rate is still above the EU average."
"This reduction is linked to the success of the National Plan to Fight Tuberculosis."
"In some countries, however, it has recently been shown that the disease is resurgent."
"The various action plans promoted by the European Commission are steps in the right direction."
"I would like to highlight the partnership between Europe and developing countries in carrying out clinical trials."
"The support of the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is also important in the field of life science."
"Strengthening the role of clinical and scientific research is vital in the fight against tuberculosis."
"This makes it crucial that work continues to discover new and better instruments to combat tuberculosis and which promote innovative diagnostic technologies, along with medicines and vaccines."
"I therefore call upon the Commission and the Member States to join forces and ramp up the fight against tuberculosis in order to succeed in controlling and eradicating this disease."
"(LT) We must combat tuberculosis, since every year, many people in the world die from this disease and almost one in three inhabitants of the world are infected by it."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that tuberculosis is the most widespread infectious disease in the world, which is closely linked to social and economic problems, in other words, poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, drug addiction and HIV/AIDS, as well as the inadequate state of health care systems in poor countries and delayed diagnosis."
"In order to overcome these factors causing tuberculosis, the European Commission and the European Union Member States must take concrete and swift action with the aim of establishing joint measures to combat this terrible disease, find joint political dialogue on financial support and adopt a joint action plan to combat the disease."
"In spite of the fact that tuberculosis is included in the list of priority diseases, the fight against tuberculosis still receives insufficient funding and therefore, we must review the European Union budget allocations in this action programme."
"I also call on you to encourage greater investment in scientific research in the fight against tuberculosis."
"(CS) Today is World Tuberculosis Day and it provides an opportunity to mention that, despite the successes achieved so far in the battle against this disease, tuberculosis remains a serious global problem."
"More than 2 billion people are infected with the tuberculosis bacillus and one in ten of these people fall ill with the active form."
"The incidence of tuberculosis and, in particular, the varying levels in the treatment and monitoring of the disease, are connected with the varying socio-economic conditions in different regions and also in different social groups."
"The early diagnosis of tuberculosis and the thorough and fully-monitored treatment of the disease, in other words, treatment that is uninterrupted and of sufficient duration, are the basic pre-conditions for reducing the risk of extensive treatment resistance and multi-resistant forms of TBC developing, the treatment of which is extremely expensive and difficult to obtain in many countries."
"Of similar importance is the adaptation of health systems and everyday practice, including monitoring the disease in high-risk groups and providing qualified health workers and adequate supplies of equipment."
"WHO estimates talk of the need to spend USD 44.3 billion at the national level over the next 10 years on the fight against tuberculosis, yet barely half of the resources required will be available."
"The EU's task is therefore to join forces with the WHO and individual countries, together with their national health systems, and to make the battle against tuberculosis one of the priorities of development aid to third countries."
"I took great pleasure and interest in listening to the speeches of the honourable Members."
"I would like to assure them that the Commission is treating this disease very seriously and also gives significant weight to what has been said today."
"We are determined to achieve our targets in order to control the tuberculosis disease."
"These kinds of discussions are of particular importance in order to concentrate all attention and focus on this disease."
"Parliament's contribution and support is essential in contributing to our endeavours in fighting this disease within the European Union as well as in other countries."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - While tuberculosis is viewed by many in the past tense and seen as a 19th century affliction, it continues to have a serious impact, both directly and indirectly, on the lives of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the EU each year."
"Though TB in its human form has been contained in most EU countries since the middle of the 20th century, it continues to spread aggressively among livestock and affects 5% of cattle herds in my Ireland East constituency each year."
"I recently received correspondence from a dairy farmer in County Westmeath, whose herd of prized dairy cows has been all but obliterated since he first discovered TB on his farm less than a year ago."
"The badger-spread disease was first discovered on the day he was due to leave on a two-week holiday last June, and he has since lost 64 of his 82-strong herd."
"Though TB in humans has been rightly tackled with full force by the EU in recent times, the bovine form of the disease, which results in millions of euro of lost revenue each year, should be seriously considered as we draft TB legislation for the future."
"The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Enrique Guerrero Salom, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation -"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the financial and economic crisis is producing the bitterest, severest effects on emerging and developing countries, especially on the lower income ones."
"This crisis has slowed down the sustained growth that has been occurring in many of these countries over the last decade: economic growth that was creating jobs, helping to straighten out their public accounts, making it possible to bring down their foreign debt, encouraging the expansion of their business activity and, in addition, helping them to obtain more official development aid."
"These countries had already been suffering in the years prior to the crisis, however: firstly, the food crisis, which endangered the survival of hundreds of millions of people; then, the energy crisis, which used up many of the resources of those that did not produce oil or gas; finally, the climate crisis, the effects of which on harvests and infrastructure harm the poorest countries most of all."
"The financial crisis added to this fragile situation in which these countries found themselves."
"As the European Commission itself points out, having affected the developing countries and emerging countries, the third wave of the financial crisis damaged the poorest countries, turning this crisis, in theory an economic one, into a development, social and humanitarian crisis."
"In fact, all areas of activity in these countries have been damaged."
"Economic growth, which will be much lower in 2009 than in previous years, has been damaged."
"Trade has decreased, which will weaken these countries' current account balances."
"There is less foreign investment and little access by these countries to international funding, and we are seeing a growing protectionist reaction from the developed countries."
"At the same time, emigrant remittances have fallen and Official Development Assistance has also been reduced."
"As a result, hundreds of millions of people have been added to the list of the poorest and hundreds of thousands of children will die at an earlier age on continents such as Africa."
"In the face of this reality, the European voice must make itself heard by requiring us to uphold the Official Development Assistance undertakings made; by requiring new sources of additional resources to help these countries; by requiring charges and taxes on emigrants to be lightened; by requiring that attempts at protectionism should be resisted and support for a Doha Development Round to be held; by requiring action against tax havens and tax evasion; and also by working for a debt moratorium or debt cancellation for the poorest countries."
"As rapporteur for this report, I wanted to obtain the greatest possible consensus and I agreed, in negotiation, to amendments by all the parliamentary groups, but I am still willing to submit an oral amendment to Section 34 of this report tomorrow, with the aim of adding further votes."
"This would be further authority for something I believe to be vital: that the European voice should be united and strong as regards aid to developing countries."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur for this very comprehensive report."
"As rightly emphasised in this report, developing countries have been affected by the crisis much harder than initially expected."
"In fact, they have been hit through several transmission channels, such as volatile commodity prices, declining export revenues and tourism earnings, as well as falling capital flows and remittances."
"One common feature is the increase in the financing needs of many countries."
"Many developing countries were often obliged to cut social expenditure (notably in nutrition, health and education), entailing severe social and political consequences and threatening not only the achievement of the MDGs by 2015, but also undermining past progress observed in recent years."
"Despite some first signs of global recovery, developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, will certainly lag behind."
"The EU has shown leadership and unity through a joint EU response to the crisis framed within the global response, namely within the United Nations, the G20 and G8."
"We have acted quickly and efficiently to translate pledges into concrete commitments to help developing countries cope with the crisis."
"Last spring, the EU adopted a set of comprehensive, timely, targeted and coordinated measures to cushion the human impact of the crisis, boost economic growth in developing countries and protect the most vulnerable."
"The EU response comprises not only the Community response but also the EU Member States' response (their respective bilateral responses as well as their contributions to the resources of the international financial institutions as called upon by the G20)."
"Moreover, close collaboration with the World Bank and the IMF has enabled us to ensure the consistency of our respective analyses and the complementarity of our assistance."
"As highlighted in the report, the Commission has set up and is currently implementing a very concrete and short-term ad hoc mechanism, named the Vulnerability FLEX, to support the most vulnerable countries with poor resilience capacity, with a view to enabling them to maintain priority spending, notably in the social sectors."
"Other measures include reallocations following ad hoc country reviews and the advanced Mid-Term Review of the 10th European Development Fund, which is currently ongoing, support under the traditional FLEX instrument, frontloading of aid where feasible, etc."
"Official Development Assistance (ODA) has played, and will continue to play, a critical role in supporting our partners' efforts in coping with the crisis."
"In this context, the Commission welcomes your support in urging Member States to stay committed to achieving by 2015 the 0.7% ODA/GNI target."
"Other donors should take similar ambitious targets for ODA increases, and we must call upon the entire donor community to live up to their commitments in terms of aid volumes and effectiveness."
"On 21 April, the Commission will publish its yearly spring development package of proposals to Member States."
"This year, the focus will be on the actions that remain necessary to achieve the MDGs."
"The package will adopt a comprehensive approach and define an action plan for accelerated progress towards the MDGs."
"It will also provide an opportunity to make an ambitious EU contribution to the forthcoming UN High-Level MDG Review in September."
"In doing so, the EU will remain credible about its commitments and continue to play a leading role in international development."
"(RO) The economic and financial crisis has also hit Moldova, a developing country, very hard."
"This country's economy declined by 9% last year according to IMF estimates, and the unemployment rate has passed the 6% mark."
"Direct investment needs to be encouraged."
"I should point out that Moldova has employed for a period of one year nine senior European advisers who will provide assistance to the main ministries in Chişinău."
"Bearing in mind that we speak the same language, our neighbours from across the River Prut can benefit from Romania's expertise in absolutely every area."
"The cost of money transfers made by emigrants from the countries they work in must be reduced."
"The commitment made by the G8 leaders to cut these costs from 10% to 5% in the next five years is a first step in this direction."
"I would like to welcome today the record financial support amounting to USD 2.6 billion which has been granted to Moldova for the 2011-2013 period."
"The agreement was reached today by Prime Minister Vlad Filat during the Donor conference."
"(ES) Mr President, although the epicentre of the crisis is not located in the developing countries, they are the ones that have been seriously and deeply affected by its huge wave."
"The credit crunch, the uncertainty produced by the depression and the fall in international trade, investment flows and remittances from emigrant workers have been the main channels for the spread of a crisis preceded by a great deal of volatility in the prices of basic products and foodstuffs, and generated in circumstances of massive global imbalances."
"A concerted response to the crisis must take the developing countries into account and their agenda must form an essential component of global economic cooperation."
"Through the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have asked that the International Monetary Fund consider the burden that the crisis has produced on the public finances of the developing countries in the report it is to prepare for the forthcoming G20 meeting, and that the Commission issue a communication in which an assessment is made as to how a tax on financial transactions might help to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, correct the global imbalances and promote sustainable development."
"I am glad that Mr Guerrero has taken up these proposals and I congratulate him on his splendid report."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his important report."
"I am convinced that the best way to counter the crisis is with more free trade and globalisation, not with protectionism."
"Europe must therefore keep its markets open in order to combat the recession, stimulate growth, both in Europe and worldwide and, in so doing, combat poverty."
"In a few days' time, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will meet in Tenerife."
"My colleagues from the ACP countries always tend to point out the problems that the EU's subsidised agricultural products create on their markets."
"They need trade, but our policy counteracts the establishment of healthy markets for agricultural products in developing countries."
"The EU has shown leadership says the Commissioner, but we can do much better."
"It is a matter of fair trade, Commissioner."
"(PT) The food, energy, climate, financial, economic and social crises referred to in the report are nothing more than different incarnations of the same structural crisis that has been dragging on for decades."
"In some regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, wealth per capita has been continuously diverging from that of other regions in the world over decades."
"Despite the disparities that exist at present, developing countries tend to have certain characteristics in common: dependence on exports of a few raw materials, a lack of economic diversification, a strong focus on agriculture, the energy and extractive industries or tourism, and a strong field of foreign capital."
"A progressive export and liberalisation model for trade has been pushed on these countries, if necessary, by resorting to blackmail."
"As shown by the negotiation process for economic partnership agreements, this leads to the exacerbation of the dependency of these countries, thwarting any possible indigenous development."
"Yet it is foreign debt that continues to be the principal drain on the resources of developing countries."
"It is paid many times over, yet as it is always growing, the debt has reached a colossal amount and self-perpetuates the overexploitation of these countries, thus maintaining the tenor of their relationship with the countries of the northern hemisphere."
"Cancelling the debt is simply a matter of justice."
"Keeping to the speaking time, too, is a matter of fairness."
"(DE) The biggest financial and economic crisis since the 1930s has, as we know, not only hit Europe hard."
"The developing countries are suffering particularly badly from the effects of the crisis, and they are least able to do anything about it."
"Irresponsible speculation, greed for quick profits which are completely unrelated to the real economy, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon countries, and a financial system that is coming apart at the seams have brought the world to the brink of a financial abyss."
"Another cause of the crisis is a globalisation concept that has made complete deregulation its highest priority."
"The countries of Europe are getting themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart their economies."
"However, in many cases, it is not possible for developing countries to do this because of their poor financial situation."
"Therefore, they must be given the opportunity to protect their own national economies more effectively against imported goods which are sold at dumping prices and which destroy local markets and local people's livelihoods."
"We must give the developing countries the chance to emerge from the crisis under their own steam."
"Traditional development aid can probably be considered to have largely failed in its purpose."
"Ultimately, we have to tackle the root of the problem and impose strict regulations on the financial markets, prohibit speculative practices and quickly introduce a tax on financial transactions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 March 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The EU has a duty to help developing countries overcome difficulties linked to the global economic crisis and poverty, which came about through no fault of their own."
"It is very important that the European Commission determinedly strives for the implementation of international development cooperation reform and that together with the Council, it improves the coordination of bilateral and multilateral development cooperation, since gaps in this area are the main reason why the effectiveness of aid for development may suffer."
"Developing countries need aid to reduce poverty and isolation, measures that contribute to development and measures necessary to exit the crisis, especially in this difficult period."
"We will be able to implement the broad commitments adopted by generally having better coordination and action that is administered more effectively and transparently, striving for broad agreement between the main aid providers, partner countries, financial institutions and civil society."
"By implementing these actions, the European Union must be the leader and act more resolutely."
"To that end, all European Union institutions must make greater commitments and on this matter, Parliament has undoubtedly made its opinion very clear."
"The developing countries have ended up the main victims of the financial crisis, in spite of the initial predictions which maintained that the developed countries would be hit hardest."
"The theory suggesting that developing countries are not tied in strongly enough to the global economy to be seriously affected by the crisis on the financial markets has been disproved by reality."
"We are seeing the crisis deepening in many developing countries, with unprecedented unemployment rates and exponential growth in government debt and budget deficits."
"While all this is going on, developed countries which have not felt the impact of the crisis very strongly or have had available effective instruments for mitigating its impact have experienced economic growth, albeit tentative."
"The economic crisis is already affecting the population directly, while unemployment is on the rise in developing countries."
"The efforts being made to bring about economic recovery by the states which continue to feel the effects of the crisis could affect whole social groups, as the recovery measures can only have a painful impact."
"EU funding programmes are the most comprehensive and inclusive among the financial aid schemes available globally."
"The Member States affected must benefit as appropriately as possible from the money allocated for tackling situations which restrict economic activity and have social ramifications."
"in writing. - The global financial and economic crisis has hit the developed world so deeply that we are now struggling with a social and unemployment crisis."
"But in the least developed countries, such problems, for which they are not responsible, are compounded by the consequences of food and climate crises, with dramatic implications for a sixth of the world's population who suffer from hunger."
"As the largest combined aid donors, the EU Member States must fulfil their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, improve aid effectiveness and coordination and strengthen their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015."
"The extent of the damage caused by speculation in the financial sector highlights the importance of preventive measures such as taxation of financial transactions and warrants considering compensation from the sector for the costs of the crisis."
"As tax havens and off-shores deprive developing countries of multiples of the amounts raised through ODA, inaction in this field is unacceptable."
"Although today we can already speak of an improvement in the economic and financial crisis in some EU Member States, we should recognise that for the developing countries, this crisis, with all its cruel effects, is still in full swing."
"Without a doubt, we should consider economic development to be the key phrase for resolving the current global crisis."
"However, while undertaking the revitalisation of our own economy, we should not forget that the continuation of the crisis in the developing countries also hinders global economic growth very significantly, and therefore also hinders our own development."
"I think that the Member States of the European Union must continue to give aid to reduce poverty and exclusion in the developing countries, continually adapting this to new circumstances and conditions."
"Considering the severe effects of the global crisis on the developing countries in particular, I support those who say that, despite the crisis, all the EU Member States could increase their collective development aid by 0.7% of their GNI by 2015."
"It is important to take measures to promote development and to get us out of the crisis today - in 2010."
"Therefore, I support those who say that, in the current situation, highly-developed countries both within and outside the EU should take steps to reform international development cooperation."
"We cannot allow a lack of intervention on our part to cancel out previous achievements in the areas of poverty and exclusion, and we cannot allow a situation to arise in which, instead of the current hundred million people living in extreme poverty, we have a billion people in such a position."

"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 23.15)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, sad news has reached us of the recent shooting of French policeman Jean-Serge Nérin by ETA."
"This makes us aware that the problem of terrorism in Europe has not yet been solved."
"On behalf of Parliament, and for my own part, I would like to offer our condolences to the family of the murdered policeman."
"I hope the Spanish and French police will bring to justice not only the killers themselves, but also those who ordered the killing."
"There is a second piece of disturbing news: the arrest in Cuba of 30 participants in a demonstration by the 'Ladies in White' group."
"The 'Ladies in White' are mothers and wives of imprisoned opposition activists."
"In 2005, the European Parliament awarded the 'Ladies in White' the Sakharov Prize."
"We join today with those heroic women, and we are thinking about them and their difficult situation."
"ECB annual report for 2008 - Report on the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report by Mr Scicluna, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the ECB annual report for 2008, and"
"the report by Mr Giegold, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the last two years have certainly been the most challenging for the ECB, in its role as guardian of financial and price stability, since its inception."
"My report on the ECB's 2008 annual report was drafted in this context."
"The report focuses on the ECB's continued response to the crisis, its exit strategy proposals, the increasing imbalances within the eurozone, the reform of the EU's financial architecture and, finally, issues related to the governance and accountability of this institution."
"I hope that a good balance has been found."
"The financial and economic crisis has seen the worst global economic decline since the 1930s."
"After a relatively benign period of economic growth enjoyed across most of Europe, most Member States have had their economies stress-tested, not through a simulated model but in real time and with painfully real consequences."
"The result has been GDP growth of a meagre 0.7% in 2008, followed by a 4% contraction in 2009."
"Meanwhile, Member States across the EU have forecast a very sluggish and uneven return to growth in 2010 and 2011."
"Most Member States are experiencing rising budgetary deficits and debts."
"The Commission's economic forecast in autumn 2009 predicted average budget deficits across the eurozone of 6.4% and average government debts of 78.2%, figures which, in turn, are both expected to increase in 2010."
"It will take years for these figures, brought about by the financial and economic crisis, to return to the pre-crisis levels."
"I believe that the ECB has responded fairly well to the crisis."
"The primary function of the ECB is to maintain price stability."
"Although inflation was far above the ECB's self-imposed ceiling when it peaked at 4% in June and July 2008, inflation rates have since tumbled."
"The ECB has also steadily cut interest rates from a peak of 4.25% in June 2008 down to the current rate of 1% in May 2009, in a bid to reinvigorate lending and to kick-start the European economy."
"The ECB's additional role during the crisis has been to expand liquidity provisions through the use of non-standard measures."
"Without such financial life-support, many financial institutions holding the savings and pensions of many European citizens would undoubtedly have collapsed."
"Of course, it could be suggested that the ECB's interest rate cuts were not as radical as those taken by the likes of the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England."
"Similarly, while the ECB's massive cash injections have kept many institutions from collapse, the reality is that many banks have not passed on the liquidity to customers, particularly to the detriment of the small and medium-sized businesses on whom economic recovery rests."
"Instead, many banks have used the liquidity to buttress their own position."
"To justified public revulsion, it has allowed them to make bonus payments as well."
"I also cannot avoid making a quick reference to the policy responses needed to the current fiscal imbalances, a subject which is surrounded by a lot of confusion and which requires timely and decisive action."
"However, I will leave it to my colleagues here perhaps to amplify on this."
"Like previous rapporteurs, I believe that the dialogue between this Parliament and the ECB is constructive and is developing positively."
"This is something to build upon."
"I believe that Parliament should be more closely involved in the appointments of the ECB Executive Board members - including the next President of the ECB - by following the precedent that has recently been set by the procedure taken for the appointment of the new Vice-President of the institution."
"The ECB is accountable to the citizens of Europe through the European Parliament."
"We must strengthen that accountability."
"Above all, the crisis has demonstrated that markets left unregulated do not always self-correct and are prone to systemic risk."
"For this reason, it is important to support and complete the comprehensive set of reforms to the financial architecture of the EU and, in particular, the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board, a body designed to act as a watchdog, giving an early warning of any systemic risks of instability in the financial..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the report on the 2009 annual statement on the euro area and public finance was drafted during a period when the euro area was facing huge challenges and this period has not yet come to an end."
"The economic situation is a matter of major concern for the citizens of Europe and for all of us."
"At this time, the report was adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in a highly cooperative spirit and by a large majority."
"I would like to present the report against this background."
"On the one hand, it is very clear, both from the relevant Commission proposal and from the recommendations which Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are presenting here in the plenary session, that the economic situation must be stabilised."
"On the other hand, the crisis, which has achieved a certain level of stability as the growth figures have recovered slightly, has entered a second phase represented by huge public budget deficits."
"This is the price which we have to pay in order to emerge from the crisis."
"The report's message in this respect is very clear."
"We must return to the path taken by the Stability and Growth Pact as quickly as possible."
"We cannot pass on this level of debt to our children and grandchildren."
"However, the report also states very clearly that the rules in the Stability and Growth Pact are not enough."
"There are no corresponding measures for improved coordination in the euro area and it is important to resolve the imbalances within the euro area and increase the coordination of budgetary and fiscal policy."
"Those with responsibility for these areas in the euro area are now faced with the significant challenge of finding a responsible solution for these problems."
"This means that it is out of the question for every country to continue to insist on its individual privileges against a background of parochial politics."
"The Commission, in particular, and also the euro area countries, have a huge responsibility for introducing the necessary measures in this situation."
"I would like to summarise briefly our proposals in this respect."
"Firstly, we need effective instruments for economic coordination."
"Secondly, the structural dependency of the euro area on finite resources must be brought to an end."
"We cannot afford to slip back into recession the next time that there is a rise in oil and resource prices, which is already under way."
"Thirdly, it is essential that the financial markets are effectively regulated after this crisis."
"However, we are currently seeing individual Member States ensuring that sensible proposals are not even being made by central authorities, such as supervisory bodies."
"Fourthly, it is unacceptable that in a crisis of this kind the focus is not on the objective of social cohesion, contrary to the values of the European Union."
"Instead, individual Member States are expected to use ridiculous interest rates in order to finance their debts."
"This is why we are calling in the report for eurobonds or similar measures to be applied, in order to help the weaker Member States by means of solidarity."
"Most importantly, the necessary changes to fiscal policy must not be made at the expense of mass purchasing power."
"The simplest solution which would allow us to make good progress in this area is effective cooperation in the field of taxes."
"At long last, the Commission must quickly come up with some proposals for a common consolidated corporate tax base."
"The report also calls for the implementation of a country-by-country reporting system for corporate income."
"We are asking you to submit a corresponding proposal."
"In general, the principle of tax cooperation must take priority over tax competition, in particular, in the context of the work done by Mr Monti and the reinvigoration of the internal market."
"We need you to come up with effective proposals so that we do not come out of this crisis with even higher debts."
"Strong economic cooperation between the Member States will help us to ensure that we do not leave behind debts for our children, but instead a euro area in which the countries cooperate with one another rather than being dragged down by competition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be here with you on the occasion of the debate on the resolution concerning the European Central Bank annual report for 2008."
"As a result of the parliamentary elections last year, this year's debate has been postponed for a long period."
"However, this gives me the opportunity to discuss the current situation at the end of the debate."
"(FR) Mr President, as you know, the European Central Bank welcomes the very close links with Parliament, which incidentally go far beyond the obligations provided for by the treaty."
"Over the years, we have established very fruitful dialogue, and I would say that the excellent reports that we have just heard from Mr Scicluna and Mr Giegold are further evidence of this."
"Today, in my statement, I will briefly review the economic developments observed in the past and the monetary policy measures taken by the European Central Bank."
"Then I will address a few points that were raised in the proposal for a resolution and I will say a few words about the current situation."
"First, on the economic developments and monetary policy over the past year."
"In 2009, as was said very eloquently by Mr Scicluna, the European Central Bank was operating in an environment that future economic historians are likely to describe as the most difficult one for advanced economies since the Second World War."
"Following the profound intensification of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, 2009 started with a continued synchronised freefall in economic activity worldwide."
"Until around April last year, economic activity was declining, month after month."
"During this period, the trade-mark which was vital for maintaining confidence - and it was the trade-mark of the ECB - was the ability to take the immediate and exceptional decisions that were necessary whilst, at the same time, remaining inflexibly attached to our primary objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term."
"Overall, our non-standard monetary policy measures, which are known collectively as enhanced credit support, have served, we trust, the euro area economy well."
"They have supported the functioning of the money market, contributed to improving financing conditions and allowed for a better flow of credit to the real economy than could have been achieved through interest rate reductions alone."
"By and large, banks have been passing on the sharply lower key ECB interest rates to households and businesses."
"The guiding principle is that, to the extent that the situation returns to normal, keeping these measures in place for longer than required risks changing the behaviour of financial market participants in an undesirable manner, and we do not wish to breed dependency."
"This is why, in December 2009, we began to gradually phase out some of our extraordinary liquidity measures, taking account of improvements in financial markets."
"In particular, we scaled back the number, frequency and maturity of longer-term refinancing operations."
"At the same time, we have committed to maintaining fully accommodating liquidity support to the euro area banking system until at least October this year."
"The Governing Council is of the opinion that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate, and that the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations bodes well for price stability in the medium term."
"Let me now turn to some of the issues you raise in the resolution and which were mentioned in the report."
"On the issues of accountability and transparency, we very much appreciate the regular dialogue with the European Parliament and the constructive spirit with which this exchange is conducted."
"I therefore welcome the repeated support by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for our quarterly monetary dialogue."
"I think, as it was said again very eloquently by the rapporteur, we are accountable to the European people, which means to Parliament."
"We consider the ECB to be one of the world's most transparent central banks."
"Our practice of holding a press conference immediately after the Governing Council meeting on monetary policy each month remains a pioneering initiative that has not yet been replicated by our major sister institutions."
"With the publication of our comprehensive introductory statement in real time, we explain policy decisions and their underlying rationale."
"During the crisis, as you know, we have further intensified our communication efforts and thereby helped to smooth financial market reactions, to build confidence and lay the foundations for recovery."
"You have also requested the views of the ECB on the establishment of a clearing house for instruments such as credit default swaps (CDSs) within the euro area."
"I would like to say that the robustness of euro-denominated CDS markets is of direct relevance for the Eurosystem as regards control over its currency and financial stability in the euro area."
"Central counterparty clearing is very important, not only for delivering transparency, but also for diversifying and sharing risk exposures and reducing the incentives to take excessive risks."
"Certain financial instruments which were introduced for hedging should not be misused for speculation."
"Regulators should be able to undertake effective investigations into possible improper conduct, and there it seems to me that we are very much in line with Parliament's concerns."
"Let me say just a word on the outlook for EMU during challenging times."
"An economic recovery is in progress, but this does not mean that the crisis is over."
"For one thing, we know that the pace of recovery will be uneven and we cannot rule out setbacks."
"For another, we are still facing numerous challenges regarding the reform of our financial system."
"Finance must play a constructive role, and not a destructive one, in our economies."
"The litmus test for a constructive role is that finance serves the real economy."
"To ensure such a role, we still need to improve the functioning of financial systems considerably further."
"Thus far, a great deal of attention has been focused on the banking sector."
"Effective reforms also have to look very closely at non-bank financial institutions and at the set-up and functioning of financial markets."
"We have to devise mechanisms and incentives to ensure that finance does not spiral out of control in the destructive way that it did just prior to the crisis."
"We have to contain systemic disruptions that lead to economic hardship for the people of Europe."
"Setting up the European Systemic Risk Board, legislation for which is currently being considered by the Parliament, is part of the correct response to this challenge."
"There are other challenges facing the European economy, and they are associated with public finances, as was again stressed by the rapporteur, and sovereign financial health."
"Within Europe's economic and monetary union, there is a clear allocation of responsibilities."
"With respect to that allocation of responsibilities, everyone can count on the commitment of the ECB to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole over the medium term."
"Based on our last projections for this year, we will have at the end of this year, after 12 years of the euro, inflation at a yearly average of 1.95%."
"That is in line with our definition of price stability: less than 2%, but close to 2%."
"The commitment of the ECB, the strategy of the ECB and its track record are consistent."
"The smooth functioning of Europe's economic and monetary union does not rest only on monetary union but also on economic union."
"Policy makers at the national level must keep public finances sound and their economies competitive."
"In the current circumstances, where Europe faces pivotal decisions, it is more important than ever to recognise that a prosperous union requires determined action by all."
"Monetary union in Europe is far more, in my opinion, than a monetary arrangement."
"It is a union of shared destiny."
"(The speaker added in French and German: 'We share a destiny in common.')"
"This destiny is for our common good, and it is the vision of our founding fathers."
"Monetary union is not a matter of convenience."
"It is part of an overarching process of advancing the integration of the people in Europe that began after the Second World War."
"I believe we often play down the achievement that Europe has attained."
"We are often too quick to criticise our institutions and processes."
"But they have generally worked well, even in the most difficult times."
"I trust that European institutions and processes have remained effective during the financial crisis."
"On this side of the Atlantic, we have avoided dramatic events that could have triggered a new intensification of the crisis, which started in the United States in September 2008."
"It is within this present context that I appreciate the commitment of euro area Member States, made on the occasion of the last European Council meeting, to take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area."
"I would also take advantage of my presence in front of the European Parliament to lay out what I have already mentioned at the hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday."
"It is the intention of the ECB's Governing Council to keep the minimum credit threshold in the collateral framework at investment grade level (BBB-) beyond the end of 2010."
"In parallel, we will introduce, as of January 2011, a graded haircut schedule, which will continue to adequately protect the Eurosystem."
"I will provide the technical details when reporting on the Governing Council decisions of our next meeting on 8 April."
"Let me conclude."
"The introduction of the single currency just over a decade ago represents the greatest achievement, in my view, in the history of European integration to date - a process that has ensured peace and prosperity in Europe."
"The global financial crisis has brought fresh challenges to which we in Europe have risen."
"Our monetary union and our very close ties, inside the single market, with all EU Member States' economies have prevented the crisis from being compounded by currency crises, as was the experience in the early 1990s."
"Today, Europe faces further pivotal decisions."
"Our common task is to continue to ensure peace and prosperity, to make our union an even more attractive place to live and work in."
"For this we need strengthened surveillance as again was said by the rapporteurs, and strengthened cooperation."
"We also need to revive the sense of common purpose, the shared ideals that motivated our founding fathers."
"Their endeavour was visionary and all that we see in today's world confirms their lucidity."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you for the chance to discuss the 2009 Annual Statement on the euro area."
"When we prepared our Annual Statement, we knew that the selected issues would be topical."
"They might, however, have become somewhat too topical recently."
"Let me congratulate both rapporteurs, Edward Scicluna and Sven Giegold, for their excellent reports."
"In order to respect the independence of the European Central Bank, I will focus on the Giegold report, which makes a very substantive contribution to the current debate on economic coordination and economic governance within the euro area."
"In my view, the broad support the Giegold report enjoyed within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is indeed a testimony to the relevance and balance of his approach and issues."
"I fully agree with Mr Trichet that the euro is not only a technical monetary arrangement but is rather the core political project of the European Union, which must be defended and developed in this European spirit, not least today and tomorrow, as the European Council is convening at a very critical moment."
"Since 1999, the euro area has mostly been an area of economic stability."
"It has shielded our citizens from economic turbulences."
"However, since the end of 2008, the euro area has been hit hard by the global financial crisis."
"Despite the economic recovery policies and strong fiscal stimulus, financial markets still remain volatile and the degree of uncertainty remains exceptionally high."
"Recent waves in the market have seriously tested financial stability and economic governance in the euro area, especially in relation to Greece."
"I would like to say that Greece is now on track to meet the 4% target of deficit reduction this year, following the bold and convincing measures that the Greek Parliament decided earlier this month and which are now in force."
"This moment may indeed be a turning point in Greek fiscal history and economic development."
"However, neither Greece nor the eurozone are completely out of the woods yet as there are still concerns regarding financial stability in the euro area."
"Therefore, the Commission has strongly encouraged the euro area Member States to take a political decision on a mechanism to ensure financial stability in the euro area as a whole, a mechanism which could be swiftly activated if needed, in conformity with the treaty and its bailout clause, and without any automaticity built into this mechanism."
"On our side, I can assure you that the Commission is ready to put such a European framework in place for coordinated and conditional assistance, which could be used if needed and if requested."
"We are working closely and intensively together with all euro area Member States and the ECB in order to reach such a solution this week in the context of the European Council."
"However, in addition to the immediate crisis management, we need to look at how similar situations can be avoided in the future so that we never again have cases similar to the Greek case now."
"The Greek crisis has demonstrated the need for enhanced economic governance."
"This was already recognised and the legal base provided in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Therefore, we are currently preparing proposals for the implementation of Article 136 of the Lisbon Treaty and the Commission will make a proposal for enhanced economic policy coordination and reinforced country surveillance in the coming weeks."
"Like you, Mr Giegold, in paragraph 28, we regret the lack of binding commitments among governments to enforce coordination in the euro area."
"Therefore, an integrated and forward-looking approach focused on policy action and clear operational arrangements is needed."
"First and foremost, we needed to prevent unsustainable public deficits and therefore we need to be better able to monitor the mid-term budgetary policies of the euro area Member States."
"We need to be able to issue broader and more stringent recommendations to the Member States to take corrective measures."
"I also count on your support in this matter."
"We can also make better use of existing instruments."
"It is possible for the Council to address recommendations to a Member State whose economic policies risk jeopardising the proper functioning of economic and monetary union."
"This has been used in the past, probably too rarely."
"With the new Lisbon Treaty, under Article 21, the Commission can issue similar early warnings directly to a Member State."
"This is something we must do in order to help Member States to address emerging economic problems at a much earlier stage."
"As I seem to be running on injury time, I will continue on macro-economic imbalances in my concluding remarks."
"That is the second core element of reinforced economic governance."
"By and large, I share the views of the rapporteur in this regard."
"I just want to conclude by saying that the financial crisis has harshly demonstrated that the continuous economic growth of past decades cannot be taken for granted."
"Today, the worst may be over."
"The economic recovery is now in progress but it is still fragile and not self-sustaining."
"Unemployment has not yet changed for the better."
"The same applies to the consolidation of public finances, which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth."
"No matter how important fiscal stimulus was for the economic recovery, the two years of the crisis have wiped out over 20 years of consolidation of public finances."
"These clouds will overshadow our economic landscape in the coming years."
"We must do our utmost to clear the sky and bring back growth."
"Therefore, this is indeed no time for business as usual."
"Instead, this is time for a change in step to promote sustainable growth and job creation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me firstly congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mr Giegold, who has proposed a work of high quality and has shown himself ready to listen to the rapporteurs from other groups."
"This report, the European Parliament's response to the European Commission annual statement on the euro area and public finances, is rich in analyses and proposals."
"Of course, it is, to a great extent, marked by the big event of 2009, the economic and financial crisis, which is without any doubt the most serious crisis the European Union has faced since it was created."
"I have learnt two main lessons from this crisis."
"On the one hand, the Economic and Monetary Union has shown how useful it is."
"The euro, a stable common currency, has played the part of a real monetary shield."
"Belonging to the euro area has enabled more than one country to avoid a devaluation of their national currencies, which would have further exacerbated the consequences of the crisis."
"The euro area has therefore become more attractive, as the case of Iceland shows."
"Moreover, the active and flexible monetary policy conducted by the ECB, increasing its injections of liquid funds into lending establishments, has played a significant role in keeping European banks afloat."
"The first lesson then is that while we often say that Europe was built on crises, this one has shown that economic Europe is both effective and necessary at the same time."
"From this I draw the second lesson, which is that we should strengthen European economic governance."
"Today, the only genuine European economic policy is monetary policy."
"There is limited coordination of budget policies."
"However, the euro area, which - as mentioned again by this report - is intended to integrate all the Member States of the European Union, must establish effective governance in every aspect of economic policy."
"It must begin with macro-economic as well as financial monitoring, something we are busy working on in the European Parliament."
"It must be carried forward within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact as a real instrument of fiscal coordination."
"At this time of crisis, the considerable drop in revenue, the tax incentive measures taken within the framework of the recovery plan and the operation of economic stabilisers have led to a deterioration of the budget balances of the Member States."
"Reducing public debt remains a fundamental commitment, as it concerns our children's future."
"Let us be austere, but let us also be inventive."
"Let us think about a new European fiscal policy, let us think about eurobonds, and let us be bold in European economic governance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giegold's report is particularly significant given the current macro-economic debate."
"This report is all the more relevant given the fact that its author is a German MEP who wanted to draw the attention of Europeans to the distorted effects, for the countries of the euro area, of the German strategy of reducing labour costs in the single currency system."
"The German Government is, in fact, about to drag the euro area and the whole of the European Union into generalised wage deflation with damaging macro-economic consequences."
"Particularly in the absence of consistent structural funds and sufficient budgetary resources, and faced with the impossibility of devaluation, Member States with current accounts in deficit are condemned, in order to resist, to trim their wages and reduce the perimeter of their social security systems."
"The result is firstly a slowdown in internal demand which, since the second quarter of 2008, has led to negative growth, and this was even before the start of the liquidity crisis."
"Secondly, we are seeing a rise in the personal debt of households with modest incomes and means, whose purchasing power is no longer increasing."
"Their debt to acquire homes was fed by the whole deregulated financial machinery, in Spain, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, with the disastrous consequences we have observed in the subprime crisis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, listening to the debates in committee, a significant number of MEPs would seem to be forgetting the lessons of this crisis."
"This crisis is far from behind us."
"The current recovery is all the more fragile given the fact that Europe is continuing with wage deflation and the Commission, but also the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank - whom we heard on Monday - are calling on the Member States to prematurely adopt exit policies that are comparable to real austerity plans."
"These policies risk nipping growth in the bud when it has barely become positive again, even though capacity utilisation rates remain low."
"These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece, in Spain and elsewhere, because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also."
"They will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions."
"The Giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro-economic imbalances."
"Unfortunately, the final version, amended by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, refuses to condemn wage deflation."
"However, on the whole, the debate opened by Mr Giegold may be beneficial at a time when neoliberal dogma thrown into doubt by the crisis is back in force in Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs Mr Scicluna - who knows a great deal about central banks - and Mr Giegold."
"We held long discussions with them and in the end, agreed on many compromise amendments."
"I would like to talk to you today about the euro."
"I would like to point out to you all that I am new to politics: until nine months ago, I was giving classes on macro-economics at the University of Barcelona."
"In the autumn of 2008, my family and I were living in London for academic reasons and I was a direct witness of the pound sterling's sudden drop of 30% over the course of a few weeks."
"All of a sudden, all my English colleagues had become poorer, and the pound has still not recovered today."
"In light of how much the pound has dropped, I do not even want to imagine what the value of the peseta would be today if we still had that in our wallets."
"These two years of terrible global economic crisis have shown that the euro has firmly anchored us to stability."
"It is, in fact, the only major Western currency that has not made its users poorer."
"The euro has been a secure port against the huge waves of the global financial storms, to borrow the evocative image of the British financier David Marsh."
"A convinced Eurosceptic for many years, 12 months ago, this respected public financier published a book praising the euro, acknowledging it as a success and as the future global currency."
"The euro is not in crisis today: it is the fiscal crises of certain Member States that are causing the single currency difficulties."
"The euro is a shining example of monetary union that is being studied and admired by the economic elites of China, India, Brazil and Russia."
"The euro poses no risk to the Mediterranean economies."
"The euro is the opportunity for their economies to be permanently integrated into the good, reforming and advanced practices of the countries of Central Europe."
"The report that we are debating today includes severe criticism of the practice of state intervention in the Chinese currency."
"Its artificial devaluation has contributed to the creation of the huge global imbalances that are one of the causes of this crisis."
"We in the euro area must not penalise the countries that export the most."
"The history of financial crises shows us that, once financial health has been achieved, economic recovery comes hand-in-hand with exports."
"It is true that Germany needs to begin consuming again and do more as the motor for European economic growth."
"Nevertheless, under no circumstances must its export strength be weakened."
"I am a liberal Member from Catalonia, and my region - which is the source of 28% of Spain's exports - also has a very high ratio of exports to gross domestic product: almost 30%."
"Those who do best cannot be penalised."
"Finally, the euro now has a great deal of prestige worldwide, but it needs to make a little more effort to be transparent."
"Mr Trichet, the verbatim records of the debates of the European Central Bank should be published, as is the case in the United States, Japan and Sweden."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, since I would like Commissioner Rehn to understand me loud and clear, I will speak in English."
"I would like, starting from where we are today, to take a look forward."
"Where are we?"
"We have huge and unsustainable public deficits and, mind you, the Greens do not support this kind of deficit."
"Second, we cannot ignore the fact that we already have huge and deepening social inequalities."
"16% of Europeans below the poverty level is not a small figure; 40% of young Spaniards under 25 unemployed is not a small figure, and I could carry on."
"Then we are facing climate change and resource scarcity, and all this means there is a need for investment in infrastructure, in education, in research and innovation, etc."
"So what we believe is that we should really switch gear."
"Herman Van Rompuy said, after the February summit, that coordination of macro-economic policy needs to be considerably increased and improved."
"Of course."
"What does that mean?"
"It means, of course, that in terms of budgetary expenditure, we need to have more peer review, more ex ante control."
"Greece has 4% of its GDP going to military spending."
"They have got an air force that is as big as the Luftwaffe."
"I mean, how come?"
"It is such a tiny country and they are arming themselves like hell."
"But if we just look at the expenditure side, we will not succeed."
"We need to look, and to take a hard look, at coordinating our tax revenue because, what do we need to do?"
"We need to rebalance tax income away from labour income towards other forms of income, including capital income."
"We need to make sure that we have an effective corporate contribution - effective, not just on paper - and that means CCCTB country-by-country reporting, etc."
"We need to implement the financial transaction tax; we need to implement the carbon tax, both to shift behaviour and to provide income."
"And we cannot do that just by asking countries to coordinate their policies."
"We need more integration."
"If we do not do that, our governments will prove incapable of reconciling the need to balance budgets and to meet social needs and investment needs."
"So I believe that Europe is now at a critical juncture."
"The choice is between a higher degree of integration, not just coordination, and decline."
"The lesson that I take from Copenhagen is not just that we missed the climate agreement."
"It is that Europe has proved to be irrelevant if it is not acting together."
"We spend too much time coordinating, too little time acting together."
"So that would be our contribution to this debate."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, coming from a non-eurozone Member State, I am not sure whether my opinion holds much weight with my colleagues in this debate."
"Currently, many would claim that the eurozone problem is one which should be solved by eurozone members."
"However, the euro does not sit in isolation."
"It sits in the global market and has been affected by the global financial and economic crisis just as those outside the eurozone have."
"How we manage our states' finances during the good years entirely affects how we are able to react and recover today."
"As many have pointed out, there is a reason why Germany faces a very different government deficit to Greece."
"While they may be united by a common currency, attitudes towards saving and spending vary considerably."
"Joining a monetary union did not unite completely different cultures and traditions of fiscal policy."
"The UK perspective has a lot to say on differences in fiscal policy."
"We also bloated our public sector, spent and spent in the good years, borrowing more and more to create debts we could not even admit to when it looked as though the good times were gone forever, and creating a culture where a supposedly respected economist from the UK even last week stood up in front of one of our committees and claimed that governments can magic money."
"Fundamentally, money to fund the public sector does not magically appear."
"It comes from tax receipts from the private sector."
"Germany realises this."
"Its policies in the recent past have focused upon using government spending and incentives to help stimulate the private sector."
"Hence, it is now in a strong position for recovery."
"Ultimately, the public sector has done its job in the crisis."
"It bailed out the banks and stepped up when the private sector failed."
"Now it is the turn of the private sector to replenish the coffers."
"The downside of austerity measures, which will put hardworking people out of public sector jobs, must be turned into an upside for start-up companies, taking advantage of entrepreneurial spirit by reducing start-up costs for businesses so that they can create the profitable private sector that is required to dig all of our countries out of the holes we now find ourselves in."
"All of those countries that have practised unsustainable economic policies for the past few years - including my own - need to realise that change is essential and inevitable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of this opportunity to take another look at the situation in Greece, because I believe that the crisis in Greece gives us an insight into the political status of the euro area."
"Firstly, however, I would like to make a remark about the calls from the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, to exclude Greece from the euro area, if necessary."
"My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, believes that this proposal is absolutely absurd."
"On the one hand, we are talking about a community with a common destiny."
"If we mean this seriously, then we cannot call, on the other hand, for a Member State to be excluded during the first large or moderate crisis that we have encountered."
"That is preposterous!"
"Most importantly, this would be an admission of failure which would amount to kowtowing to the financial sector."
"The financial sector has shamelessly allowed itself to be bought out of the crisis by taxpayers, but we are now being asked to deny help of this kind to Greece."
"It will be difficult to explain to the pensioners and the workers in Greece and also in the other countries affected - according to the media, Portugal is the next country to come under scrutiny - why they are now being asked to pay up, having already supported the banks with their taxes."
"Taking this route would be the equivalent of driving the EU project into a wall."
"Despite all the justified criticism of Greece - and the Greek Members will realise that there is much to be done in their country - the crisis is by no means solely the responsibility of Greece."
"I would just like to point out that the majority of decisions on financial policy in the euro area have been handed over to the European Central Bank."
"The euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies."
"Major exporters such as Germany are forcing Greek economic policy to its knees."
"Therefore, this also represents a crisis in EU economic and competition policy."
"This is why we are calling for the ban on financial assistance for EU Member States to be lifted."
"The Member States in the euro area should make euro loans available, the European Central Bank should buy up debts in the same way that the Federal Service in the USA has done and credit default swaps should be banned."
"This is what we are calling for."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, 25 March is the birthday of both Europe and Greece."
"On 25 March 1957, the European Union was born under the Treaty of Rome."
"On 25 March 1821, Greece was born."
"Today, on their birthday, Europe and Greece are being tested; Europe on cohesion and Greece on its economy."
"Everyone in this House knows that, of the 15 countries in the euro area, 6 have high public debts and financial deficits."
"Everyone in this House knows that all 30 countries which belong to the OECD have debt of over 100% of GDP and 30% higher than in 2008."
"Even the United States of America is trying, in this huge economic crisis we are experiencing, to resolve its problems primarily by printing money."
"We also know that Greece has introduced severe austerity measures to the point at which it has exhausted its citizens."
"Many people will say it serves Greece right and it should pay for its mistakes."
"Yes, certain people must be called to account for this."
"However, we must not forget that Greece imports EUR 15 billion more products from other European countries, especially Germany, than it exports."
"I would therefore ask the leaders of the European Union to bear in mind that addressing speculation will create a geopolitical situation in the wider policy."
"Thank you, sir."
"Your time has run out."
"I would respectfully ask that you abide by the speaking time allotted to you."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order."
"The Members want to vote on this later and we will be in serious difficulties if we do not keep to our speaking times."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Trichet, firstly, I would like to congratulate you on what you have achieved in recent years."
"However, at the same time, you must be aware that hundreds of millions of people are currently holding their breath because they are worried about the euro, which is something that we did not expect to see in this generation."
"Firstly, we are worried about what will happen next with the six-monthly and yearly refinancing operations and whether you will succeed in withdrawing from this package of extraordinary liquidity measures."
"Only those people with a masochistic tendency when it comes to financial policy could fail to wish you luck in this respect."
"However, inflation is also a cause for concern and you are making good progress in this area."
"As an Austrian, I would like to advise against the Germany-bashing that has been taking place here."
"Everyone should be aware Germany has been the source of a great deal of stability in the past."
"It should not now be punished because it has achieved better results in many areas than other countries."
"It is not possible to show solidarity with people who have been responsible for mismanagement, waste and excessive administrative measures."
"(DE) Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for the European Central Bank annual report for 2008, I am very happy with the report that is in front of us now."
"As a result of the close and effective cooperation with the rapporteur Mr Scicluna and, above all, with Mr Tremosa from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I believe that we have produced a very balanced commentary on the ECB annual report for 2008. Mr Trichet and Mr Rehn were of the same opinion."
"I think that the ECB was faced with particularly difficult tasks in 2008, which was the first year of the crisis."
"Given these challenges, in my view, the ECB has acted effectively and, above all, very prudently."
"Mr Scicluna's report reflects this approach."
"However, the ECB is not in a simple situation and this is not likely to change in the near future."
"On the one hand, we are very far from having overcome the crisis and, on the other hand, the planned regulatory measures present new challenges and problems for the ECB."
"It is important for the ECB to continue to ensure the stability of the euro area in the months and years to come."
"Like a tanker on the high seas, the ECB must stay on the correct course."
"On the other hand - Mr Trichet, I have already mentioned this in the last but one discussion on monetary policy - the independence of the European Central Bank must be maintained, in particular, given its future inclusion in the European Systemic Risk Board."
"This is of paramount importance because you, as President, and other members of the ECB will become heavily involved in this area."
"This should be an important criterion for future assessments of other measures taken by the central bank."
"It is essential for us to bear this point in mind when considering other reports in the next few years."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the king has no clothes!"
"The gravity of the situation has been accurately described."
"Now it is useful to concentrate on the treatment, and the first step of this treatment can only be European economic governance, in the absence of which the economic system will not grow and the debt will become even less sustainable."
"Greece must be supported and helped, and a potential domino effect must be avoided in the case of those European countries with economies characterised by a weak level of competitiveness and elevated levels of debt."
"Real European governance must guarantee three objectives: 1) a policy of growth; 2) financial instruments suitable for sustaining that growth; and 3) a policy for managing emergencies."
"This morning, I have heard so many speeches exalting the virtues of the euro."
"Very well, I am obviously in agreement, but why not think of the euro as a currency that saves us not only from inflation but, by means of a little virtuous and guaranteed debt, also secures us greater liquidity to launch a major European investment programme by issuing Eurobonds?"
"As far as managing emergencies is concerned, I agree with the idea of establishing a European Monetary Fund, which would be a sensible solution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what I should like to say in conclusion, and say it clearly, is that at this stage it is no use temporising, drifting, waiting for the long night to end."
"A 'Don Abbondio Europe' is of no use to us."
"If Europe does not show courage today, when will it have to show courage?"
"Mr President, we have had a heavyweight week in committee with the President of the ECB, the President of the Euro Group and the nominee for ECB vice-president."
"We all agree that stronger surveillance of Member States, with accurate statistics to enable early intervention, is a key requirement."
"Work on this has started, including audit powers for Eurostat, and the committee is impatient to assert its enhanced role to help."
"But there are indicators beyond the Stability and Growth Pact that need respecting too."
"Greater fiscal coordination linked to macro-economic stability is an option."
"But this has been tried, of course."
"Remember the row in 2001 over the Ecofin warning to Ireland during a time of fiscal surplus."
"So we know the lesson: exerting discipline in times of surplus is even harder than policing deficit."
"And, just like in the financial markets, failure to do so ends in crisis."
"On imbalances between Member States, the focus should be on loss of competitiveness, often hand in hand with foot-dragging on the single market and failure to address structural reforms, including pensions."
"This, too, does not necessarily have a deficit trigger."
"And finally, as Mr Scicluna said, liquidity provision by the ECB has been a valuable tool through the crisis, but it has not been passed on to the real economy."
"Often, it has simply been reinvested in assets bearing higher interest."
"And I dare say some of these were even recirculated on repo to the ECB."
"No doubt in some quarter, such activity is even viewed as deserving of a bonus."
"So I say: should we really listen to the pleas of such banks on new capital adequacy implementation dates?"
"(EL) Mr President, may I start by saying that this is an important report, which strikes a worthy compromise between the tensions in the European Parliament."
"It identifies elements of social cohesion which are not present in similar debates in the European Parliament."
"We should also like it to signal an important turning point in the policy of the European Union as a whole."
"Of course it refers to 2009, while in 2010, important developments are taking place which, of course, concern my country, Greece."
"One might conclude that, apart from monetary union, we also need economic and political union, as many have said."
"The euro should be accompanied by a minimum social security indicator for social cohesion."
"That is clear from the various things being said in Greece, much of which is inaccurate."
"For example, I cannot but highlight the fact that productivity in Greece was not much lower than the average of the EU of the 27."
"That is clear from Eurostat statistics: it was approximately 90% in both 2007 and 2008."
"The increase in the budget deficit and public debt in Greece over the last two or three years was the result of the collapse in incomes, the reduction in income from abroad, such as tourism and shipping, due to the crisis, and the increase in public spending."
"Of course there is wastage, but people are also being recruited to the public sector in various forms."
"Certainly all this needs to change; we also need to request this social protection indicator and not content ourselves with general calls not to do anything that will overly affect low incomes."
"Spending and arms need to be controlled, as does everything that has increased significantly over the last two years, but especially incomes, which have decreased equally significantly."
"The income of large sections of the population, who are on the verge of poverty, must not fall."
"Obviously, there are matters which also concern the summit under way today here in Brussels."
"However, the Giegold report must also signal a more general change and the incorporation of these positions in the Stability Pact."
"Above all, we do not need to take any recourse to the unacceptable policy of the European Monetary Fund which, apart from anything else, also has a viability deficit."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Rehn and Mr Trichet were quite right to talk about the situation today."
"The Greek position in the euro area is very shaky and, as far as I can see, the answer lies with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"These days, the IMF is the right organisation to help Greece out of the crisis."
"If that does not work, then we need to be decisive and cut the Gordian knot."
"Countries that are not playing by the rules of the euro area must leave the game."
"Mr President, let us try and learn from this situation."
"When it joined the euro, Greece was as unpredictable as the Oracle at Delphi."
"The figures it submitted were unclear and unreliable."
"It is not right for the Greek Government to keep on insisting that other States in the euro provide the solution because they were supposedly partly responsible for the current crisis in Greece."
"That is turning the world on its head."
"Anyone who submits unsound figures cannot point accusing fingers at anybody else."
"Allow me, therefore, to ask Mr Trichet and Mr Rehn a specific question: were you aware of the fact that the figures Greece submitted when joining the Euro area were inaccurate and incomplete?"
"If not, should you not have known that?"
"I hope you can give me a straight answer to that question."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to start by wishing my fellow countrymen the very best for 25 March."
"The capitalist crisis has resulted in a spiralling deterioration in the living standards of the workers."
"At the same time, it has given capital an opportunity to step up the application of anti-labour policy choices."
"Under state terrorism of the workers, the plutocracy started a real war against fundamental wage and social rights, in a bid to increase the profits of capital."
"The basic pillar of the anti-grassroots policy being exercised by the European Union and the governments of the Member States is the ECB."
"It is a harsh policy exercised solely on the basis of the criterion of the profitability of capital."
"The constant calls since it was founded for wages to be cut and capitalist restructurings to be speeded up found fertile soil in the capitalist crisis."
"The ECB has acted as the bourgeois assistant of the plutocracy in shifting the burden of the crisis on to the workers' shoulders."
"It has channelled over EUR 1 trillion to the banks and monopoly groups."
"Today, however, it is calling on the workers to pay for the damage and to repay that money."
"That is why the anti-imperialist fight needs to be stepped up, the fight to get out of the European Union, the fight for people power and a people's economy, the fight for socialism."
"Mr President, I appear to have been living in some sort of parallel universe here, hearing about the success of the euro."
"Let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we?"
"Unemployment, youth unemployment in the Iberian Peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic."
"It has been at 30-40% for years."
"Nothing to do with the crisis at all."
"A complete disaster."
"GDP per capita in the USA is miles ahead of the European Union."
"GDP in the Pacific Rim is miles ahead of the GDP in the Union."
"No, the euro has not been successful at all."
"It is already failing."
"It is already crumbling before our eyes."
"Just look at some economic basics."
"There is no lender of last resort, which is why we have this Greek crisis and a Portuguese crisis round the corner."
"There is no lender."
"This is impossible in global, in currency management, whether it is an optimal currency zone or not."
"There is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak."
"Let me just remind everybody here about something else if I may."
"There are two sorts of people: wealth creators, those people that go out and work in the private sector and create wealth, and there are the others who spend wealth, which are politicians and bureaucrats and there are too many of us."
"Far too many of us."
"We are the monkey on the economies' back and, until these currency zones start cutting down public sector spending, it is going to get worse and worse and worse."
"(RO) The mafia is the major cause of the crisis."
"I will give you a few examples from my own country, Romania."
"Believe you me, as a writer and historian who runs a daily newspaper and a weekly magazine, I know very well what I am talking about."
"Since 1990, approximately 6 000 companies valued at EUR 700 billion have been privatised fraudulently."
"Unfortunately, only EUR 7 billion, or 1% of this money, has been received so far."
"In many cases, it was not even privatisation being carried out, but the transfer of assets from the ownership of the Romanian state to the ownership of other states, in other words, nationalisation."
"This is no longer a market economy, but a jungle economy."
"This situation is being repeated in several Balkan countries where the local mafia has joined forces with the cross-border mafia to form an organised crime cartel."
"Just like 100 years ago, the Balkan Peninsula is sitting on a powder keg."
"The flame of social protest may quickly spread from Greece to the other countries in the region."
"While in the 20th century, we spoke about exporting revolution, in the 21st century, we can talk about exporting bankruptcy."
"Starvation is the most powerful electoral factor in history."
"We must switch the focus from the fight against corruption, which is some abstract notion, to the fight against the corrupt."
"The population's mood is becoming increasingly gloomy and if we fail to put an end to the fraud in our countries, the European Union's noble project will collapse like a sandcastle."
"However, there is one hope of salvation: radical solutions are required at such an historic crossroads."
"It is not under control the mafia needs to be, but under the ground."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, warmly for his very successful work over the last six years."
"Of course, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for submitting a report that has been given majority support."
"Mr Rehn, I would like to remind you that you have some huge tasks ahead."
"I hope that the Commission finally has the courage to look at the deficiencies of the Stability and Growth Pact in a new proposal."
"The model of economic governance led by the finance ministers is not a possible solution in this case, because these finance ministers have failed in the past."
"We need a more automated system."
"We do not need economic governance under the control of finance ministers."
"Instead, we need an automatic system that responds in the case of violations, with the support and leadership of the ECB and the Commission."
"This could be the result of the summit."
"I would like to make two remarks about what Mr Trichet has said on the euro area."
"I very much welcome the fact that you have referred to the need for us to be competitive throughout the world."
"This is not just about one euro country competing with another, but about us being able to hold our own against the USA and Asia."
"Secondly, the EU has largely succeeded in balancing its accounts, thanks to the countries in surplus."
"If that had not been the case, the ECB would have had to put much stricter policies in place."
"Thirdly, there are no examples in economic history of countries with a falling population generating long-term growth in the internal market."
"They have to export their goods."
"As far as Germany is concerned, it made a poor start in the Economic and Monetary Union, but it has caught up and is now an example to many other countries."
"That is not sufficient."
"We have enough to do ourselves with the budgetary consolidation."
"It is important not to underestimate the work involved."
"Who came up with the idea of punishing those countries that have largely succeeded and excluding those that have not fulfilled their obligations?"
"This is not a true European policy."
"Therefore, I would like to wish the Commission courage and give my warm thanks to the ECB."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs on the excellent work they have done at a particularly difficult juncture."
"The work of one of the most crucial summits is due to start shortly and there is still much talk raging around the so-called Greek issue and around if and to what extent we shall adopt a European mechanism that will operate, in times of need, as an economy protection indicator needed for the stability of the euro area as a whole."
"Without doubt, the basic responsibility for this situation lies with Greece and it has fully assumed it."
"However, there are other - collective - responsibilities."
"The common currency has provided a great deal, but it also has serious weaknesses."
"In 11 years of EMU, we did not want to see and to acknowledge that the competitiveness divide and the significant inequalities and imbalances between the economies in the euro area are not compatible with either the viability or the stability of the euro area."
"The speculative attacks which, so far, have been directed mainly at Greece - but which also resulted in Portugal's credit rating being downgraded just the other day and which have already been directed at other countries, such as Italy and Spain, and no one knows what the consequences will be - have made that much clear."
"If, therefore, we want to show that we can deal with the situation, we should immediately move towards a new, enhanced model of economic cooperation and economic governance which, Mr Langen, respects the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, but which, at the same time, will be able to go beyond financial coordination in the narrow sense to economic coordination with additional criteria attached and attain the objectives of the EU strategy for employment and sustainable development."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Trichet, the euro is ten years old and it has largely passed its tests, even though the current turbulence is not over yet."
"I am certain that, already today, we will see the first important step towards a European solution, with or without the International Monetary Fund."
"We share a common destiny, as Mr Trichet so rightly said."
"The alternative, if it fails, would, of course, be a frightening prospect."
"The ECB has been a bastion of strength when the financial storms have hit."
"It is worth repeating that the euro has been a success during the financial crisis and it has been an anchor in Europe, including for countries outside the euro area."
"The euro has provided stability and the conditions for creating millions of new jobs, and that must not be forgotten in these days when everyone is talking of a crisis. Greece's problems and those of other euro area countries cannot be blamed on the euro."
"Careless expansion of public expenditure will result in problems regardless of the choice of currency."
"On the contrary, the economic crisis would have been considerably worse if we had not had the cooperation that the euro involves."
"We would have had to deal with speculation and competitive devaluation among more than 20 national currencies."
"Many of us have experienced this and I myself sat on a Swedish finance committee with a 500% interest rate."
"The crisis in Greece naturally demonstrates the fact that the pact for keeping the budget deficit at a low level must be tightened up."
"The deficit is still extremely large."
"We need better supervision and coordination of economic policy at EU level, in other words, financial coordination that is worthy of the name."
"I would like to finish by saying something about speculation."
"Sometimes, when countries are subject to speculation, as my own country was in the 1990s, it actually provides us with a good opportunity to organise the measures we take."
"When we were in a difficult situation, as a result of George Soros, among others, we knew what to expect and so we took the necessary measures."
"That is something that those of you in the countries that are currently experiencing difficulties will have to think about."
"(PL) Mr President, I shall avoid the military language which the previous speaker used."
"The language of war does not suit the style of banks."
"I am a representative of what is probably the only political group in this Parliament which has attracted the majority of its members from outwith the euro area. Only two are in euroland."
"My point of view, therefore, will be different."
"Mr Trichet's speech can be summed up by the number 36, because this is how many Members of the European Parliament were listening to his speech."
"Does this mean we are lazy?"
"No - it means, in fact, that MEPs do not really believe the European Central Bank can be a solution, a remedy, to the crisis, or that it can be a lifebelt."
"Mr Rehn said the euro area is something of value in itself, and then spoke about the crisis in Greece."
"There is a certain contradiction here."
"Greece is currently going through a crisis because it entered that oasis of stability too soon."
"We should avoid such inconsistency."
"(EL) Mr President, I agree with my fellow members who said that the crisis is not over."
"The economic situation in numerous countries is clearly negative."
"Unemployment is increasing in most countries."
"The measures being taken to address deficits are exacerbating the crisis."
"Mr Trichet and Mr Rehn - and I am speaking institutionally - did you not see the crisis coming?"
"The signs were there."
"When the crisis broke, you hid behind the perception that everyone had to resolve their problems on their own."
"Now, here you are repeating monotonously the words 'monitoring deficits' and 'austerity in the Stability Pact'."
"In my opinion, the problem in the European Union and in Greece is not one of sound finances."
"You know that, in order to cover borrowing, countries such as Greece are prey to speculators but, at the same time, they reveal the institutional and political gaps in EMU."
"As such, I would say to you that what is needed is a change to the Stability Pact."
"Insisting on the application of the Stability Pact, especially in a recession, will clearly increase and exacerbate regional and social inequalities, increase unemployment and wipe out any prospects of growth."
"(NL) Mr President, the situation in which Greece and the euro area have deservedly found themselves is regrettable."
"Financial assistance for Greece should come primarily from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"The IMF has itself said that it is in an excellent position to help Greece."
"The establishment of a European Monetary Fund (EMF) seems to be motivated by political considerations, in particular, that is, to save Europe's face in case Greece appealed to the IMF."
"However, let us not rush headlong into establishing a new body as a remedy against non-compliance with the existing rules."
"The necessity and desirability of setting up an EMF are dubious."
"The penalties provided for by the Stability and Growth Pact must be implemented more actively in order to enforce compliance with the rules."
"It is really up to the Council now to make a move."
"Eurostat needs to be given the scope to carefully inspect the budget figures of the Member States of the euro area and thereby monitor compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report has one serious flaw: it does not name those responsible."
"And yet, we will not be able to put an end to the economic crisis in Europe until those responsible have been identified."
"Let us finally tell it like it is: the crisis was not caused by people living off their wages or salaries, but by those banks, multinationals and insurance companies that milked European societies dry."
"At the moment, if a multinational company wants to establish itself in Hungary, the way to proceed is as follows: it receives free land from a local municipal government, is given a reduction on taxes and contributions, employs people for minimum wage and does not even allow them to unionise."
"These are the conditions that have led to a crisis for job seekers in Europe."
"We demand that multinationals, banks and insurance companies play their part and shoulder the task of solving and putting an end to the economic crisis."
"(ES) Mr President, the crisis through which we are struggling is the worst in eight decades and the most significant since the launch of the Community project."
"It started with the North American subprime mortgage crisis and, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is now in its third phase, after leaving Europe with a 4% drop in GDP in 2009, more than 23 million unemployed and a sharp deterioration in the state of the public finances, with debt in excess of 80% of GDP."
"The European Central Bank played a decisive role in maintaining liquidity in the system, using non-conventional mechanisms to counteract the credit restrictions and cooperating closely with the main monetary authorities."
"Now that a moderate recovery is expected and there is no inflationary pressure, it must continue to contribute to the reestablishment of credit and avoid compromising the economic recovery through the early or indiscriminate withdrawal of the extraordinary measures."
"The crisis has shown us that the monetary and economic pillars - the basis of monetary policy - need reinforcing."
"One eye needs to be kept on the progress of the prices of the principal financial assets and private debt in order to guarantee the stability of prices and the economy in general."
"Twenty Member States currently have excessive deficits."
"The true meaning of consolidating public finances - an unavoidable task, that must be done in a coordinated and intelligent way - is restoring demand, promoting investment, and favouring reforms that will allow the economy to be revived, increase the potential for sustainable growth and create jobs."
"Greater economic union may make the difference."
"Global imbalances need to be corrected."
"The European Union is one of the most balanced regions."
"That could come under threat unless its competitiveness is strengthened and there is greater international monetary cooperation."
"We will only improve our ability to compete globally if we strengthen internal economic cooperation in the areas of competitiveness and the balance of payments, in order to correct the imbalances and differences within the euro area."
"The efforts and courage of Greece deserve clear and resolute support."
"It is a question of common interest and uncertainty harms all Europeans."
"Subsidiarity and solidarity are two sides of the same coin: the European currency."
"As Mr Trichet said in English, French and German, the euro is more than just a currency: it is our common destiny."
"I have repeated it in Spanish, which is one of the European Union's global languages."
"I will finish by saying it in Greek, which is the language that best expresses our universal vocation: Το ευρώ είναι το κοινό μας μέλλον."
"(GA) Mr President, the economic crisis has had a negative impact on Member States all over the European Union."
"Unemployment rates have increased dramatically all over the Union, and it is young people that are suffering the most."
"The public funds of many Member States have declined as a result of this crisis."
"To deal with this issue, the Irish Government took decisive action in the years 2008 and 2009."
"Unchecked, Ireland's deficit was heading towards 14% of GDP."
"The government's action stabilised the deficit at 11.6% of GDP in 2010."
"The action taken by the government has gained recognition in international markets."
"Since its last budget, in December of last year, the cost of Irish borrowing, relative to benchmarking, has stabilised."
"In fact, I understand that at the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs this week, the President of the Central Bank recognised and praised the actions of the Irish Government."
"In many ways, Ireland is ahead of many other countries in its fiscal adjustment."
"Countries such as the UK and the US, both with deficits in excess of 10%, will have to undergo significant adjustment in order to restore sustainability to their public finances."
"Can I say in conclusion that Ireland is still a good location for business as the fundamentals of the Irish economy are in place and we will retain our 12.5% ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, the widening crisis in the euro area shows the dangers which may face economic projects that are not backed up by economic calculation, but are based on ideological assumptions, especially when integration includes the economic integration of different Member States which have different economic conditions."
"We have to ask whether some states should have entered the euro area as early as they did."
"At a certain point, the euro project became, primarily, not so much an economic project as a political one, aimed at accelerating European integration."
"European taxpayers in many countries may, today, pay a great deal for this haste."
"It would be good if we could draw some conclusions from this lesson for the future."
"The euro is not an answer to the structural problems of individual economies, or to excessive debt or a lack of financial discipline."
"It is the Member States which are responsible for the state of their finances, and these problems should be solved in the countries where they arose."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have read the reports with some surprise, and the speeches I have heard this morning only strengthen my beliefs."
"With a few exceptions, it is still a matter of budget restrictions, containing inflation, and the Stability and Growth Pact, even though 20 of the 27 countries no longer meet all the criteria."
"It is true that many are demanding economic governance."
"However, we want a political Europe that ensures control of both its economic and its social choices and that is able to intervene with regard to monetary choices."
"The Greek crisis is telling: it is Germany that has control and is imposing its demands."
"In the United States, the central bank has just intervened directly to finance the state budget by buying treasury bonds."
"In Europe, the European Central Bank flew to the banks' assistance, but in terms of Greece and more generally of the PIGS, it is still the same ones who have to pay, in other words, employees, civil servants and pensioners, even though their countries have also been victims of financial speculation."
"It is not minor reforms that we need, but a different Europe, an economic and social Europe for the benefit of the majority, not just of a few."
"(SK) The report on the annual management of the euro area and of public finances in 2009 analyses in detail the management of the EU during the global financial and economic crisis."
"The decline of economic output in various EU countries has led to a dramatic rise in unemployment and a growth in the debts of European countries."
"The impact of the crisis on individual countries has varied and the measures through which individual countries have tackled the crisis have consequently differed from one another."
"Despite the efforts of EU bodies to adopt coordinated and collective measures, it appeared that in certain countries, populist governments with no proper sense of responsibility for the administration of public finances were courting disaster."
"That is why the European Union as a whole has found it harder to deal with the impact of the crisis than other major economic centres, such as the United States, China, Japan and India."
"It has become apparent that the European economic environment as a whole may be diverse and extensively regulated but, compared to competing economies, it is very cumbersome."
"In the forthcoming period, we must therefore, along with efforts to consolidate the public finances of the euro area, also strive to restructure and greatly simplify the rules of the internal environment."
"We should not forget that it is the productive sector alone that generates the resources on which the whole of society lives."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of its activities in 2008, the European Central Bank was faced with unprecedented challenges as the world economic crisis wound its way into Europe in September 2008."
"The financial crisis turned into a crisis of the real economy as the capital markets froze up due to mistrust, and financial institutions would not extend credit to each other or to businesses."
"The ECB reacted quickly and, in my judgment, appropriately to these financial events, but when we evaluate the crisis relief measures, we cannot overlook one deplorable fact, namely, the discrimination towards countries not in the euro area."
"I am convinced that the ECB acted contrary to the spirit of the European Union when, at the height of the crisis, in October 2008, it did not set equal conditions for drawing on liquidity facilities."
"The ECB arranged currency exchanges with the Swedish and Danish national banks in order to ensure proper euro-liquidity for the banking systems of these two countries."
"By contrast, with the Hungarian and Polish central banks, it was prepared to do the same only against collateral."
"This course of action on the part of the ECB contributed, unfortunately, to a growing uncertainty on the markets, further aggravating these countries' situations."
"Now, when we are in the process of designing a new financial system, we have to take measures to ensure that in future, similar inequalities will be eliminated."
"We cannot, therefore, introduce regulations that treat certain parts of the Union less favourably than others."
"I would carry this idea further, when talking about the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board that we are all working on now. The ECB will have an important role in this area."
"The presidency of that Board will be held by the president of the ECB, and we will need to ensure that countries within the euro area - as well as those outside it, such as the Central and Eastern European states - receive equal voting rights in the new organisation."
"There is a danger that if we do not raise our voices against the discrimination we have already experienced during the crisis, inequality will become the practice in the new financial supervisory bodies, and this is something to be avoided at all costs."
"The ideal of reunification must not be allowed to be whittled away by replacing the former political disunity with economic division."
"(RO) It comes as no surprise that the exceptional measures which had to be adopted by the European Central Bank at a time of crisis feature at the heart of its annual report."
"Against this backdrop, I think it is appropriate for the European Central Bank to continually increase liquidity provisions to banks in the euro area."
"However, we must not forget that Member States outside the euro area were also themselves among those hit hard by the crisis and that intervention is required from the European Central Bank in this area as well, in the form of liquidity-enhancing measures."
"In addition, an increase in budget deficits, government debt and the unemployment rate among young people under 25 is being seen in most European Union Member States."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is going through an identity crisis and losing credibility, thereby making it impossible to apply its principles effectively."
"I think that what is required is a less automatic and uniform implementation of the pact and an approach which takes into account the circumstances of each Member State where the emphasis is placed much more on the long-term sustainability of public finances and less on the government deficit."
"The pact's main aim was prevention."
"It was meant to provide multilateral supervision of budgetary development using an early warning system."
"This is why, in keeping with the spirit of Mr Scicluna's report, I feel it is absolutely necessary to set up a European Systemic Risk Board, which will meet the objective of providing a rapid warning against systemic risks or imbalances threatening the financial markets."
"The current financial crisis and its recent deepening in general must produce a prompt explanation of the mutual support mechanisms available at EU level, while also strengthening the coordination instruments between Member States in support of common economic governance."
"One of the main lessons of this crisis is the need for greater fiscal responsibility and, by extension, for economic monitoring procedures for maintaining budgetary balance."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President and Commissioners, last December, in Strasbourg, Mr Almunia, who was then Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, said that barring any significant developments, next summer, Estonia would be invited to join the euro area, with effect from 2011."
"Well, there have been some significant developments, not only for Estonia, but also for the euro area."
"Estonia is practically the only EU Member State that currently satisfies the Maastricht criteria."
"What sort of signal will it give if Estonia is not accepted into the euro area, in accordance with the rules?"
"To my mind, it would signal to the financial world that the malaise in the euro area is so deep that it is incapable of accepting a small but fiscally responsible country."
"In other words, a sign will be put on the euro area club door, saying: 'The club is closed for major refurbishment'."
"What sort of signal would it be, however, for the new Member States, such as my country, Latvia, which is under an IMF programme and maintains a fixed rate of exchange against the euro, and which, in order to introduce the euro, devalues its economy with a double-digit fall in GDP and extraordinarily high unemployment?"
"The signal would be why should we do our utmost to repay private debt with a high exchange rate for our national currency, when this debt has been issued as euro loans by EU banks against, for example, immovable property?"
"Thank you."
"Mr President, 2008 was an extremely important year for the European and indeed the global economy."
"It was the year that was characterised by a great deal of uncertainty as regards the extent of the crisis, which only seemed to worsen."
"A great deal of uncertainty was also present with regard to the time it would take for the European economies to recover as well as the tools that we should use to stimulate such a recovery."
"This was no easy year for the ECB, which had to face a number of challenges."
"During 2008, the ECB engaged with other major central banks to form a coordinated approach in order to provide the banking system with plenty of short-term liquidity, and this approach by the ECB proved to be extremely successful."
"In this respect, I must support my colleague in the conclusion he has come to concerning the performance of the ECB."
"I agree that 2008 was instrumental and that those responsible have risen to this occasion."
"I also share some of the rapporteur's concerns with regard to the lack of transmission of interest rate cuts from the bank to the consumer and I feel that this should be further looked into, so please take note, Mr Trichet."
"All in all, I feel that this is an extremely well-balanced report, an excellent piece of work by my Maltese colleague, Edward Scicluna."
"(FR) Mr President, unfortunately, due to another engagement President Juncker is unable to join us as usual."
"Quite clearly, I am sorry to hear this."
"Here we have two very good reports that enable us to go more deeply into our discussion at a critical moment for the euro area."
"Mr Scicluna's report allows us to lay the foundations of a number of elements of the debate, in particular, relating to the conditions of appointment of your successor, Mr Trichet."
"In terms of democracy, the monetary dialogue is an important element, but also with regard to the very functioning and running of the European Central Bank."
"The report by our friend, Mr Giegold, asks questions of you, Mr Rehn, which come under your responsibility and not that of the European Central Bank."
"The risk we face, as regards the functioning of the euro area, is the dismantling of our social model."
"When your predecessor, Mr Almunia, gave an assessment of the euro area's 10 years of operation, one factor was blatantly obvious, namely, the increasing divergence between the Member States of the euro area."
"That is where we are and that is what the very authors of the treaty and the authors of the Stability and Growth Pact underestimated."
"This is what we must take into account."
"We must take this into account for two reasons."
"Firstly, to understand that, even if the sustainability of public finances is a key element, it is not enough."
"Faced with national competences, the Member States do not have a natural appetite for sanctions and therefore their coordination, their cooperation is not good cooperation."
"This is the spirit that we have to discover."
"This is the magic panacea that we need."
"The second pillar which cannot be overlooked and which we cannot do without is the matter of fiscal harmonisation."
"As you know, I deplore the fact that, from this point of view, the 2020 strategy does not even mention the work in progress on the harmonisation of the tax base for corporate taxation, which we absolutely must continue with determination."
"(FI) Mr President, in the wake of the financial crisis, public debt has become rapidly worse, even if, in many countries, they are beginning to turn off the taps of recovery."
"Having dealt with an acute economic crisis, we need to focus very closely on the long term and serious imbalance in public finances."
"We have had the Stability and Growth Pact, but the problem lies in the fact that the Member States have not complied with it, and so we now have acute deficits in public finances to deal with."
"Attention has been given to incorrect statistical information in the case of Greece, but the core of the problem is a badly managed economic policy."
"We politicians are faced with very difficult decisions, amid slow growth, an ageing population and an employment situation that is improving only sluggishly."
"There are only a few cures for public finances: to increase revenue from taxation, to boost economic growth or to cut expenditure."
"In the search for remedies, key indicators are the sustainability of public finances and the deficit."
"The sustainability deficit is a reflection of how much the tax rate should be raised or the rate of expenditure lowered for public finances to be on a sustainable basis over the long term."
"To achieve a balance, we have to continue to recognise that accrued debt will increase by the difference between interest rates and the growth in Gross National Product, and an ageing population will cause the cost of pensions and care to rise substantially in the years to come."
"In order to boost income in public finances, it is absolutely essential to have growth and employment, increase the productivity of public services and implement the structural measures that can guarantee the sustainability of pension schemes, for example."
"In the long term, an increase in the birth rate and preventive health care will be of significance for the balance in public finances."
"In the midst of the economic crisis, we called for better coordination of public finances, and I would like to ask how Commissioner Rehn intends to bring this about."
"I believe, however, that this economic crisis cannot be used as a way out of the back door for the economies of the Member States to be brought under control."
"We just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finances."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to highlight three main points in the reports that we are discussing."
"Firstly, we should not devote the debate on public finances to issues relating to austerity alone."
"We also need to focus on what we can do to initiate growth and combat unemployment."
"In many countries, cuts in public expenditure are needed."
"At the same time, however, it is also important to increase revenue via positive growth, by getting more people into work and paying taxes."
"Secondly, I appreciate the fact that Mr Scicluna takes up the issue of increased transparency in the financial sector in his report."
"There is still much to do in this regard."
"Transparency is not only an excellent way to counter harmful risk-taking behaviour on the financial market."
"Enhanced transparency is also necessary for supervision to be effective and for the public financial institutions to have the public's trust, which is extremely important."
"The ECB should lead the way in this area and take immediate measures to make its work more transparent."
"A good first step would be to begin to publish the minutes of the ECB Council meetings."
"Openness should also be a key principle in the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)."
"In order for the Systemic Risk Board's recommendations to have an impact, the guiding principle should be that they be made public."
"Thirdly, I am pleased that, in his report, Mr Giegold emphasises the importance of having a clear environmental and climate perspective, even in times of crisis."
"We must not allow the financial crisis to slow down the switch to a green economy."
"We should instead promote economic recovery by investing in renewable energy sources, environmentally friendly transport systems and the development of green technology."
"Only by making these kinds of investments can we create growth that is sustainable in the long term."
"(FR) Mr President, 2009 was, without doubt, the most difficult year for the euro since its introduction, but it was also the most useful."
"Without the euro, the European Union would have sunk into a war of competitive devaluations against the backdrop of the crisis."
"In 2009, monetary instability could have weakened the political solidity of the European Union."
"Thanks to the euro, we have been spared the pain of a continued imbalance of exchange rates and monetary policies."
"But for how much longer?"
"Today we are hoping and praying for better governance of the European currency - more restrictive, more visible and more responsive governance."
"The fact is, the attempts by countries to take back control of the euro's ground rules do not contribute whatsoever to the emergence of proper European economic and monetary governance."
"Only solidarity can curb the speculative activities of which Greece is a victim today and which may hit other countries in the euro area at any moment."
"Solidarity goes hand in hand with solidity in the emotionally charged context of sovereign debt markets."
"The political prevaricating of recent weeks has not only damaged Greece. It has seriously shaken confidence in the euro."
"Non-assistance to countries in danger is undermining the monetary stability of the whole of the euro area."
"Beyond emergencies, let us finally give the euro the instruments it needs."
"We need a coordinated European bond market to avoid bottlenecks with too many sovereign debts in too many countries coming to maturity at the same time."
"We need representation outside the euro area at all levels, in all bodies, including international financial institutions."
"Why is the President of the Eurogroup not in the G20?"
"Let us also accept that the new members want to join the euro area as quickly as possible."
"We must welcome them with enthusiasm, not with petty-mindedness."
"Contriving to exclude euro area members amounts to abandoning the ambition of a strong Europe in the world."
"The expansion of the euro area must go hand in hand with the implementation of the instruments needed for genuine economic union: coordination of budget policies and harmonisation of economic and fiscal policies."
"This is the price of the euro's continued success."
"(PL) Mr President, a crisis is a disease which usually ends not only in recovery, but also strengthens and creates mechanisms of resistance."
"It may also lead to what are known as complications, and even to certain kinds of permanent impairment of the body."
"Let us think about how this illness, which we call the crisis, arose."
"In most cases, an illness is the effect of the various ways in which we neglect our bodies, or it has an external origin."
"The cause of the crisis was activity which was contrary to market principles - speculative activity."
"The market itself is not able to reject, counteract or limit these factors if there is not suitable supervision and monitoring of the progress of processes, particularly in situations which are not typical for the market."
"Until now, financial markets were monitored and supervised mainly by state and national institutions."
"Globalisation has led to the establishment of world financial institutions and a global finance market."
"However, adequate world, regional and, in our case, European institutions for supervising and monitoring these markets have not been established."
"The market is not guided by values, but, above all, by the need to achieve profit at any cost."
"The crisis did not begin in 2008 with the collapse in the financial markets, but in 2007, with the crisis in the food markets, as well as the undermining of the energy market, which is controlled by political instruments."
"The situation in the European Union is the sin of not observing the universally established and accepted principles of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is a pity that the warnings from the Commission were too gentle."
"Some Member States were allowed to get away with more, because, after all, they were not going to let some Commission or other lecture them."
"Some Member States behaved like children, hiding their misdeeds."
"This kind of behaviour cannot be the basis of Community or our integration."
"It is important to admit the mistakes which have been made, to tell our citizens, to apologise to them and to ask for understanding and cooperation as we emerge from the crisis."
"We must take action so that the costs of the crisis do not fall on the weakest and poorest."
"European Union solidarity obliges us also to support the countries which have been worst hit by the crisis."
"Recovery will not come from outside, if the body, or the state, does not take up the fight."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Trichet, I would like to thank you very much, not only for what you have done in recent years, but also for your approach in recent weeks."
"You have been competent, independent and consistent."
"You and your staff have been a calming influence in troubled times."
"Mr Rehn, you have made some very encouraging statements over the last few days."
"We should do everything possible to continue on the path that you have taken."
"The euro is a stabilising force, even in times of crisis."
"We must put an end to the myth that the euro and the Stability and Growth Pact are the cause of the problems experienced by Greece and other countries."
"Last week, the Greek Prime Minister said very clearly in this House that the euro is not to blame."
"On the contrary, it is part of the solution."
"There can be no reform without the euro."
"There can be no appropriate restrictions on the objectives that we can set ourselves without the euro."
"We must not make the euro weaker, if those countries which are affected feel that the euro protects rather than weakens them."
"I would also like to add that Greece is not begging for money, which is the impression often given by the daily press."
"It would be a good thing if many members of the Council stopped focusing on popular opinion on the domestic political front when they talk about this subject but instead worked with us to find common European solutions."
"Greece cannot be given subsidies, but it wants support for implementing its reform and savings plan."
"The President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, has also stated very clearly in a three-step plan what is possible and when the measures can be taken."
"No one has said that nothing could be done."
"We have a monetary union, but we do not have an economic union."
"To achieve an economic union, we need the political will of the Member States rather than advice."
"The economic union includes the coordination of budgetary policy, the harmonisation of taxes and the coordination of education, economic and social policy."
"This is what we are calling on the Member States to do and we expect them to show commitment."
"We must continue on this route in the interests of the euro."
"(PL) Mr President, last year was an extremely turbulent one for the euro area."
"It began with Slovakia's entry to the Eurogroup, and ended with huge economic and financial problems in Greece."
"During this period, the world experienced its biggest economic crisis for years."
"Discussions are currently under way on how to cope with the new challenges, what direction the global economy should take and what European Union policy should be."
"The resolution we are considering at the moment is part of this debate."
"I would like to draw attention to one aspect of it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis, the problems in Greece, and also the current debate on assistance for Greece, show that the division into the new and the old Europe is still a reality."
"Last Friday, the head of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, referred to the idea of creating a mechanism of support for countries in the euro area which are struggling with financial problems."
"According to the head of the Commission, the principles and conditions which would govern the use of this instrument should be established only by members of the euro area."
"I would like to take the opportunity of this debate to give my strong support to the position of the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Mr Lewandowski, and Professor Jan Rostowski, the Polish Minister for Finance."
"I would like to add my voice to their appeal, and also to the opinion of many fellow Members, that all Member States, including those which are outside the euro area, should now, already, take an active part in measures to strengthen the euro area and create aid instruments for its members."
"Poland, which is one of the countries outside the euro area, will soon adopt the common currency, and we would like, today, to be responsible for the future form of the Eurogroup."
"Therefore, let us not exclude the new Member States from such an important debate."
"We have had the 'two-speed Europe' slogan."
"Let us not now divide Europe into a Europe in the euro area and a Europe outside the euro area, because we are a single Union."
"Finally, I would like to give my wholehearted support to all parts of the resolution which call on the European Central Bank, the European Commission and members of the Eurogroup to support the process of euro area enlargement - enlargement based on the current criteria."
"I would also like to thank the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, for his good work, especially this year, which has been such a difficult one for Europe."
"(HU) I am grateful to the Commissioner, to the President of the ECB and to the rapporteur for having taken an open and highly professional approach to this problem that concerns us gravely."
"Indeed, it is alarming that despite all our efforts, the rate of unemployment and the level of state indebtedness keeps rising in almost all Member States of the European Union."
"My country, Slovakia, is no exception to the rule."
"Unemployment has risen above 13%."
"Slovakia was the last state to join the euro area, on 1 January 2009, and this had positive repercussions on economic as well as political and social areas."
"The vast majority of the population still feels positive about the euro."
"We think it is important therefore to maintain the strength and prestige of the euro."
"Parliament must help the Commission and the ECB in their efforts in order to avoid failure in this endeavour."
"The first thing to do is to bring the integration of the European economy to a higher and sustainable level."
"This is, however, a strategic question, in which the Council's committed support is indispensable."
"(LT) The way out of the complicated economic and financial crisis was not as effective as we had hoped."
"When the crisis began, the Member States' programmes of support for banks were not coordinated with joint conditions set down at European level and some banks used additional funds allocated from the European Central Bank to cover their losses."
"Support for economic activity, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, was not coordinated either."
"The impact of these actions is clear: when they failed to receive loans from the banks on time, small and medium-sized businesses folded en masse."
"It was easier for the countries of the euro area to overcome the difficulties, as the European Central Bank ensured the provision of liquidity to these."
"If we believe in European solidarity, if we operate in one open market with the same competitive conditions and the main goal is to exit from this complex situation as soon as possible, I think that the European Central Bank should have ensured and must ensure the provision of liquidity to Member States not in the euro area that were hit particularly hard by this crisis."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Scicluna, said that the ECB had tried to expand liquidity, but that liquidity had not been passed on by the banks to their customers."
"That is true outside the eurozone as well as inside it."
"My party is pleased that the UK remains outside the eurozone."
"A state's currency must reflect the condition and needs of its own economy and not the average needs of 27 different economies."
"However, keeping our own currency is only part of the answer."
"The central problem is that credit creation and distribution is in the hands of private companies - the commercial banks - and that is true outside, as well as inside, the eurozone."
"The function of credit creation - in effect, money creation - must be removed from the hands of private companies."
"Extra spending power, when it is needed - either to distribute existing or imminent growth or to finance large infrastructure projects - must be created by the government and spent into circulation, not created by the banks and lent into circulation."
"(RO) We have been able to observe during this crisis that the fluctuations triggered by interest and exchange rates have come up against a single currency which has properly shielded the euro area."
"The single currency has not provided a solution to all the internal and external imbalances which have occurred."
"However, the benefits provided through allowing national financial institutions to have access to the European Central Bank's liquidity and the elimination of the risk of exchange rate fluctuations have increased the interest shown in it by the Member States outside the euro area."
"The efforts made by these states through improving their own economies and fiscal policies in order to adopt the single currency must be welcomed."
"I call on the Commission and European Central Bank to further encourage the expansion of the euro area as quickly as possible in order to provide them with greater protection against the effects of the economic and financial crisis."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Trichet, I would like to thank you very much for the part of the report which warns against excessive cuts in wages with the aim of reducing deficits, because low incomes result in a fall in economic growth."
"I want to thank you for this paragraph, because I believe that this not only slows down economic growth and reduces the competitiveness of Europe, but also restricts the opportunities for European citizens to play a full part in society."
"It is essential for us to draw up our budgets according to the guidelines, but it is equally important for the Member States to have room for manoeuvre in an economic and social context."
"If we have a Europe where there is no longer any investment in education, health and research, we will also have a Europe that is unstable and cannot compete with the rest of the world."
"Those groups which are not responsible for the crisis must not now be made to bear the cost."
"If we do not invest in people, we will not have a future in Europe."
"This is why I am calling for the emphasis to be put on the social aspect in future."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic and financial crisis, which is also a structural crisis, is forcing us to impose long-term controls and to introduce cautious budgets."
"Globalisation is compelling the euro area to play an effective role with regard to financial policy."
"However, this must not happen at the expense of the ordinary citizens and I would like to remind everyone that caution and responsibility are needed."
"Mr President, I have to say that I have been addressing Parliament for six and a half years now, and this is the first time that I have noted so many speeches, so many analyses, so many suggestions and so many proposals."
"I am very impressed by the wealth of what we have just heard and very impressed also by the diversity of views that have been expressed."
"I will try, if I may, to summarise my main points after hearing these remarks, which were all interesting and relevant, and to which the European Central Bank will, of course, attach the utmost importance."
"First of all, I would say that I have heard a lot on the challenges the ECB faced and praise for the ECB for having been able to react in real time in very difficult circumstances."
"Let me tell you that I think my colleagues and I tried to do our best in very exceptional circumstances: the worst since World War II, and it would have probably been the worst since World War I if we had not acted promptly."
"The challenges were faced by all; many of you have said that the challenges existed for other central banks in Europe and in the rest of the world."
"So we all had to face up to enormous responsibility and I fully agree with those who have said that we cannot say that the difficult times are over."
"We are not over the difficult times."
"We are not going back to business as usual."
"We have to remain extremely alert."
"I also got the message on growth and jobs, which is a very strong message from Parliament. I fully agree with that."
"By delivering stability, by being credible in delivering stability in the medium and long run, we trust that we are contributing to sustainable growth and sustainable job creation."
"But you know that our message is structural reforms; structural reforms to elevate the growth potential of Europe and the job creation capacity of Europe are absolutely essential."
"A firm message coming from you, which we fully share in the ECB is - and I do not want to respond in the place of the Commissioner - governance of Europe of the 27, governance of the 16 members of the euro area is of the essence."
"We call for the utmost level of responsibility from countries, whether members of the 27 or of the 16, to exert their responsibility, to exert surveillance on the peers."
"We absolutely need full and complete implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Surveillance of fiscal policies is at the heart of EMU, and I must also include surveillance of structural reforms and implementation of structural reforms, and surveillance of the evolution of the cost competitiveness of the various economies, particularly, members of the euro area."
"This is a key issue."
"I do not want to elaborate more on Greece and the various issues at stake."
"I have already had occasion to respond to many questions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in front of Parliament."
"Let me only say that Greece has a role model, and the role model is Ireland."
"Ireland had an extremely difficult problem - this was said by one of the MEPs here - and Ireland took its problem very seriously ex ante, with extreme determination, professionalism and capacity, and this has been recognised by all."
"I want to stress that."
"That being said, I repeat: the judgment of the ECB on the new measures which have been taken by the Greek Government is that they are convincing and, I would add, courageous."
"A word on the long-term situation inside the euro area: during the next 10 or 20 years, we will deliver price stability in line with the definition we have delivered since the inception of the euro."
"You can trust us."
"We can prove that."
"This is not theory."
"These are facts; these are figures."
"(FR) And I must stress this: all the members of the euro area know that average inflation in the euro area will be less than 2%, or close to 2%, in the medium and long terms."
"They must draw consequences from this nationally."
"They benefit from belonging to the euro area."
"They must not put themselves in a national context, in terms of national inflation, since that would be far from what we guarantee, because that has been asked of us, because we are faithful to our remit and because it is a contribution to the prosperity and stability of Europe."
"Mr President, allow me to conclude - if I can, in a few words - on the matter of transparency."
"As I have often said to MEPs, we are the most transparent in the world when it comes to the immediate publication of our studies, the introductory statement."
"We are the most transparent in the world when it comes to the press conference that immediately follows the Governing Council."
"The only area where this decision does not stand - and we have a good reason - is that we are not giving the names of those who are voting for this and of those who are voting for that, because we consider that our message is that we are not a collection of individuals."
"We are a college."
"The Governing Council is the pertinent entity."
"It is the Governing Council which counts."
"I have already said that it is not business as usual and we must absolutely reform the financial markets in a very profound way, in order to be sure that we do not start another crisis of the kind that we have had to cope with."
"A last point on Poland and Hungary: one MEP mentioned Poland and Hungary and told us that they were not treated as they should be by the ECB."
"I think the MEP is not well-informed;"
"I would encourage her to go to the national central banks of the two countries and it will be demonstrated to her that the ECB has a very intimate cooperation with those two central banks to the benefit of all of us."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first, I would like to say thank you to the Members for a very serious and substantive debate."
"I have listened to your views very carefully. I can conclude from them that there is strong and broad support for an effective reinforcement of economic governance in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole."
"In my view, today's debate has been a very worthy and valuable setting of the scene for the European Council today and tomorrow."
"I also welcome the opportunity to continue discussions on economic governance soon in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, preferably as soon as possible after Easter."
"I would like to consult you and move forward soon with concrete proposals."
"There are two lines of action in reinforcing economic governance which are of the essence."
"First of all, its cornerstone will be a truly credible and better preventive fiscal and budgetary surveillance that is stronger and more rigorous, also covers the mid-term budgetary policies, and uses recommendations and, if needed, warnings to the Member States."
"Its second building block will consist of more effective preventive and more systematic and rigorous surveillance of macro-economic imbalances and divergences in competitiveness between the Member States of the euro area and of the European Union."
"Binding policy recommendations will also be used in this regard."
"This is needed to prevent an accumulation of imbalances."
"It is self-evident that without a doubt, the most pressing and urgent need exists in the countries with large deficits and weak competitiveness - not only in Greece, but, of course, starting in Greece."
"It is equally self-evident that we cannot - and will not - mean by this that anybody would weaken the export performance of countries with current account surpluses."
"In other words, the aim is not to make Bayern München play worse against Olympic Lyon but to improve both export competitiveness where needed and domestic demand where needed and possible, thus making both Bayern München and Olympic Lyon play better as a European team by making both offensive and defensive strategy ever stronger."
"That is what the euro area - and, in the final analysis, the European Union - is all about."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, a few points first."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank the ECB for its cooperation and availability in responding to my various queries."
"Secondly, I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs for their joint team work in agreeing to amendments to this report and thus widening the agreement on it."
"We have seen that the recent recession is proving to be a challenge."
"However the tensions in the euro area are not new and are well known."
"We know we are not yet an optimal currency area."
"However, that is why we have to be innovative."
"We have to follow sensible economic principles and policies."
"Of course, they must be couched in line with European social cohesion principles."
"Some observers have stated that the ECB cannot help Greece because this is forbidden by the 'no bail-out' clause of Article 103 of the EU Treaty."
"Nevertheless, it is one thing to implement a bail-out and another, very different thing to provide temporary financial assistance."
"We know that there are several options before us."
"Some can be executed in the short term and others in the medium term."
"As my colleagues before me pointed out, and as Europeans, we all look up to the euro and we all want it to succeed."
"We can make it succeed, so let us all - Parliament, Commission, Council and the European Central Bank - put our heads together and find a successful path forward."
"Finally, we must restore public confidence in financial institutions through measures which include greater transparency, better risk management and appropriate regulation."
"We need to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude does not occur again."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, following this debate, I would like to make three quick points."
"Firstly, looking at the different opinions here in the House, we do not have the same opinion on the question of imbalances."
"There were differences which were quite clear and I think we have to be careful."
"In particular, I would like to address that to you, Mr Trichet and Mr Rehn, and ask you not to be blind in one eye, because the central problem, as we agree in principle, is that costs should grow according to the inflation target plus productivity."
"Some countries had cost increases which were too high, and it is good that you are acting."
"On the other hand, there are several countries which use tax policy as well as their wage-setting arrangements to ensure they fall below this threshold."
"If you do not act on those - and I know that some in the Ecofin do not agree with this approach - then we will be setting fire to the economic basis of the eurozone and that is very dangerous."
"I urge you not to be blind in one eye and I urge my colleagues likewise."
"Look at Greece and the stability programme, which was praised."
"I would like to stress that there is a major problem, and I refer to what I learnt during my visit to Greece last week."
"Most people in Greece feel that during the last 10 or 20 years, a lot of people became very rich under circumstances which were not just."
"If you praise the Irish efforts, you cannot compare it to the situation in Greece."
"People in Greece feel they should not suffer because of things they have not caused."
"Therefore, I urge you, Mr Rehn, also to put pressure on the Greek Government to get serious on illegitimate wealth which has been accumulated in the past."
"Otherwise, the programme will be not accepted and it will also fail for economic reasons."
"We have to make sure that the programme is socially just - and it is not yet socially just."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 March 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - There are lessons to be learnt from the current eurozone crisis."
"The economic crisis is also responsible for the eurozone difficulties, but I believe there are also structural weaknesses of EMU that we should address in order to avoid future crises."
"For the ECB to be able to take efficient action supporting employment and growth, we have to provide it with the necessary tools."
"The ECB does not have the same tools as the Fed, which is why it could not have an active monetary policy supporting growth."
"The ECB is bound by its main objective of ensuring price stability, which prevents it from efficiently stimulating growth."
"I also believe that we need greater coordination of economic and fiscal policies, so that we avoid unfortunate situations like the Greek one."
"Better coordination would enhance euro area stability."
"The SGP needs to be respected strictly, but I think it should be revised."
"The preventive arm should be strengthened."
"The punitive arm is not an efficient one since paying fees only increases budgetary deficits and prevents compliance with the rules."
"On the other hand, sanctions should not be decided by the Council, because Member States will always be reluctant to punish each other."
"in writing. - We should proceed from one central fact - during the most severe economic crisis that Europe has known, the euro has been an anchor of stability and credibility."
"Without the functioning eurozone, overcoming the crisis would have been much slower and uneven."
"This applies also for those Member States which have not yet joined the eurozone."
"Now it is especially important to realise that the European common currency is a common value for which every member of the eurozone bears individual responsibility."
"There is a general agreement that the economic crisis was a logical outcome of a widespread crisis of values."
"Those who have joined the eurozone are expected to bear higher responsibility for balancing their expenses and incomes."
"It does not make sense to take the role of supposed victims of financial speculation or economic mafias."
"Almost all European economies have sinned against the principles of sound and balanced fiscal policy."
"The lesson has to be learnt - we need much tougher supervision and better coordination of financial policies with the establishment of a European Monetary Fund."
"But, first of all, each and every member of the eurozone must slow down in living at the expense of tomorrow."
"The activities of the European Central Bank have, since its inception, been a subject of constant criticism from the left, and not only throughout the EU."
"The first cause of this justified criticism is the objectives of the bank."
"Since the main objective of the bank is to ensure that inflation does not exceed 2% and the budget deficits of the EU Member States do not exceed 3% of GDP, then everything is clearly fine in times of growth, when unemployment 'falls by itself', the liquidity of the banks is 'secured by itself' and the ECB is able to 'press governments' in individual Member States to reduce their debts."
"From the moment when an economic crisis erupts, however, it is a very different story."
"The badly formulated objective of the central financial institution has the effect of making fundamental divergences from the objective necessary."
"The report, which is concerned with assessing the ECB's annual report and performance in relation to solving the financial crisis, nonetheless stubbornly insists on this badly-formulated pivotal objective."
"The report also states, among other things, that it is necessary to draw back from the policy of stimulation packages and from securing the liquidity of the banks, which was the main so-called unconventional measure for overcoming the crisis."
"The report does not concern itself at all with the critical state of the finances of at least five EU states, and it seems that the authors of the report are also indifferent to the meteoric rise in unemployment."
"All of this only confirms the harmfulness of the current concept of the European Central Bank."
"The report must therefore be rejected."
"The European Union as a whole and the euro area in particular are in a grave situation."
"Greece is on the verge of bankruptcy and Spain and Portugal are also in difficulties."
"Because of the seriousness of the situation, new proposals are constantly being made."
"On the one hand, people are talking about giving the European Monetary Fund extensive rights of intervention."
"On the other hand, the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Policy, Mr Rehn, is calling for Brussels to be involved in the budgetary planning of the Member States."
"The European Union obviously wants to use the current crisis to strip the Member States of their financial autonomy, which is one of the last core areas of national sovereignty remaining to them."
"However, taking another huge step towards a centralised European superstate will not solve the existing problems."
"On the contrary, it will further exacerbate them."
"The alarming state that the monetary union finds itself in and the fact that the euro has become a high-risk currency are a result of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, on the one hand, being brought together with states such as Greece, Italy and Spain, on the other, with a deliberate disregard for the existing differences between them concerning their economic development and the ethos on which their financial policy is based."
"These historical differences, which not only relate to the economy, must be taken into consideration, instead of further tightening the existing centralist constraints on the European nation states."
"In the context of the European Central Bank annual report, I would like to highlight the disturbing change in financial policy which has resulted in far too many dollars being printed without it being possible to come anywhere near covering their value."
"The accompanying current or forthcoming devaluation of the dollar by the United States as part of its currency reform programme would have a severe negative impact on the European market."
"In order to avoid this risk, the European Central Bank and other European institutions should seriously consider moving away from the dollar as a key currency."
"The euro is much stronger, and famous economists, such as Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, have said that the leading role played by the dollar has been the cause of many financial crises."
"The European Union should stop exposing itself voluntarily to the problems of US financial policy."
"Mr President, the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area."
"I am convinced that the strength of the single currency will be guaranteed if the rules we have agreed upon are followed in every single Member State."
"It has been said that, as well as Greece, there are other European Union Member States which can expect serious financial difficulties."
"In addition to the soaring national debt, some Member States have also reached almost dangerous levels of government spending, something which the European Central Bank was already concerned about a couple of years ago."
"The euro is an anchor to which the Member State economies are tied."
"Actions by any Member State which weaken the euro are unacceptable."
"I consider it essential that every country fulfils the conditions set up for the euro area."
"At the same time, I support the collective approach to looking for solutions, including compiling an aid package for Greece, tightening the regulations concerning the single currency and carrying out stricter supervision."
"The idea of the possible creation of a European Monetary Fund, which was raised as a result of the Greek crisis, is an approach which could prevent potential problems, but we should not forget the overseas factors operating in a globalised investment market, which necessarily have an impact on the euro area."
"It is, therefore, clear that at a national level, we should henceforth concentrate more on creating legislation which would protect the euro from the influence of dangerous factors, both internal to the European Union and outside it."
"Second European Roma Summit (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"* * *"
"(FR) Mr President, through a ruling given on 19 March, the Court of Justice of the European Union has just declared that the majority of our Parliament violated a clear rule of law by refusing to defend my immunity on the basis of Article 10 of the international protocol, as requested by my foreign colleagues, led by Mr Romagnoli."
"This request was made when I was the victim of violent political, professional and legal persecution for the crime of 'telling journalists who were interviewing me on revisionism and the history of the Second World War that these questions were a matter for historians to debate'."
"This is in paragraph 108 of the ruling."
"The Court states, and I quote: 'Since the aim of the protocol is to grant rights to the Members of the European Parliament, it follows that by failing to give a verdict on the basis of Article 10, Parliament violated a rule of law in a sufficiently clear manner'."
"It is true that the Court is not complying with my request for indemnity because it believes that the French Court of Appeal and its 11 judges found me totally and definitively innocent."
"Consequently, it believes that I can no longer cite prejudice."
"The fact remains that it is ordering our Parliament to pay two thirds of the legal costs."
"This decision therefore constitutes a scathing rejection of the partisan tactics that deprived me of parliamentary immunity."
"Under pressure, the rapporteur resorted to a crude procedural trick."
"This decision sets a precedent of which members of the national right in the European Parliament, whose freedom of expression is constantly under attack, will be able to take advantage in future."

"Second European Roma Summit"
"Before the vote:"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph 7a (new)."
"It is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution."
"It becomes the consequence of paragraph 7."
"So the new paragraph 7a would read: 'Hence, calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe'."
"Mr President, thank you very much."
"We have two amendments, one of which is an amendment to the amendment."
"I would like to introduce both of them."
"We would like the words 'the Council and' to be deleted."
"The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be:"
"'calls on the Member States to refrain from forced repatriations of minorities if they face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment once they have been forcibly returned'."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, we have also rejected a previous amendment because it was worded rather too strongly."
"However, there is a problem with some countries where Roma people are being repatriated and where the conditions are unsuitable for them to be able to live in freedom and safety and with human dignity."
"Our wording is more restrained, among other things, because we have seen that in some countries, visa liberalisation is being misused for the purposes of asylum applications without the prerequisites being in place."
"Our text would read:"
"to countries in the Western Balkans 'where they might face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment'."
"(DE) I hope that the Members who initially rejected the other amendment can vote in favour and accept this more restrained wording."

"Schengen Borders Code with regard to surveillance of external maritime borders"
"Before the adoption of the draft resolution:"
"Mr President, I just wish the House to know that I was the original rapporteur on the decision on FRONTEX and I recommended that we adopt this because of the exceptional measures that are necessary to deal with intervention and rescue at sea, especially in the Southern Mediterranean."
"The committee did not back me and therefore I removed my name from this report, and I will be recommending to the House that they reject the resolution that is now before them."
"We need an absolute majority of 369 for it to be adopted, but I would recommend that the House reject the resolution that we are about to vote on."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Members have for their consideration a draft decision supplementing the Schengen Borders Code as regards the surveillance of the external borders in the context of FRONTEX operations at sea."
"This is a necessary decision and it will help Member States and FRONTEX to manage our external sea borders more efficiently."
"As you know, the number of boats will increase very soon as they always do at this time of year in the Mediterranean."
"The proposal contains a set of very important principles and clarifications of rules that border guards must apply when controlling sea borders, for example, the principle of non-refoulement and the obligation to treat vulnerable peoples and unaccompanied minors with special care."
"It also clarifies what assistance should be provided to persons in danger at sea and where to disembark persons that are rescued."
"Many of you in this House have asked for these principles and rules for years and now finally, they are within our reach."
"The changes that we are proposing will also reduce the risk of lives being lost in the Mediterranean by making sea border operations more efficient."
"The draft decision is the result of very hard and long discussions with Member States and with experts from, for instance, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration."
"It will provide our institutions with a better framework for exercising a proper monitoring of these operations where significant European funds are involved."
"On the legal aspects of the proposal, the Commission has chosen Article 12 of the Schengen Border Code as the legal basis because the rules concern border surveillance patrols during FRONTEX operations, not border checks as I think Parliament's legal opinion argues."
"At the request of Members of this House, the Commission has made an investigation of alternative technical solutions that would allow for, firstly, not reopening the discussions on the substance and, secondly, having clear rules adopted in time for FRONTEX operations this summer."
"Unfortunately, we have not found such an alternative so I therefore recommend the honourable Members not to reject these long-awaited new rules."
"We cannot open a debate on that now, Mr Busuttil."
"You have the floor, but we cannot open a debate."
"Mr President, we have had two speakers addressing this House to reject the resolution but no speaker to speak in favour of the approval of this resolution."
"So I think it is only fair that someone who can speak and urge Members to speak in favour of the resolution should be able to do so."
"If you allow me just one minute, may I say that the reason why the LIBE Committee rejected these rules and therefore put forward this resolution is very simple."
"We have been told by our legal services - not once but twice - that the Commission exceeded its powers in bringing forward these rules."
"This is why we rejected them."
"We definitely want these rules - I myself come from a country that wants these rules - but we do not want the European Commission to exceed its powers."
"That is why we should support this resolution."
"Just for the sake of clarity, if you vote against this, you are supporting the measure that enables interception at sea."
"If you vote for this, you are not."
"It is pure clarity."

"'Considers it appropriate, therefore, to explore the grounds for an agreement with creditor countries to establish a temporary moratorium or debt cancellation for the poorest countries to enable them to implement countercyclical fiscal policies to mitigate the severe effects of the crisis; proposes that efforts be made to facilitate arrangements for transparent debt arbitration'."

"- Before the vote on paragraph 22:"
"(FR) Mr President, we have brought to your attention an oral amendment concerning paragraph 22."
"I would point out that paragraph 22 relates to global governance and, in particular, to the composition of the G20, which, unusually, does not include in its ranks any representatives from the least developed countries."
"The oral amendment aims to fill this gap, and the text that I propose to the European Parliament meets this need."

"Now we have been allowed to have individual votes on an own-initiative report."
"We need to resolve this or all own-initiative reports will have individual votes in future."

"Otherwise, the interpretation made by the House's services will defeat the whole object of the reform."

"(SK) The adopted draft resolution of the European Parliament on the second European Summit on Roma opens a new path for resolving the problems of the Roma population in the European Union."
"It has become apparent that the individual efforts of various countries to settle the integration of the Roma into society have not produced a satisfactory result."
"The causes of this situation are varied."
"I therefore welcome the efforts of the European Union to get involved in solving the problem of the Roma and to improve the integration of this community into society in an organised way."
"Mr President, while I deplore discrimination against any group in society on whatever grounds, I cannot support this resolution."
"However, this resolution seeks to place the responsibility for fighting discrimination into the EU context whereas I would argue that attitudes and approaches in Member States are so varied that the interests of minority groups would be better addressed by Member States and particularly by those Member States who do not share the ideal of tolerance and equality that we British take for granted."
"I am aware, for example, that one Italian MEP, a member of the EFD Group, has been prosecuted for taking part in a vigilante raid in which he set fire to the belongings of an immigrant."
"This is unacceptable."
"Please do not associate the British people with such behaviour by suggesting that minority groups in our country need the same levels of protection as the same poor soul that I have just referred to."
"(NL) Mr President, it is a matter of fact that anyone who denies a problem, who denies the truth, will obviously be unable to solve that problem."
"That is a fact. We ought to be aware that, with our resolution on the Roma in Europe, which is a document full of politically correct nonsense, we will not be able to come up with or offer a single solution because what we are doing is denying the problem."
"We should, first of all, observe that we are indeed facing major problems with large numbers of Roma who position themselves completely outside of our society and who are also very often responsible for very serious crimes, small and large."
"Many values and standards, or the lack thereof, espoused by Roma communities are directly at odds with the values and standards that we wish to see respected in our European countries."
"What I am saying might sound a little one-sided, but the resolution that we have just adopted is a great deal more one-sided in the opposite direction."
"In any case, I think that each Member State should itself have the right to decide how to tackle this very serious problem."
"(NL) Mr President, this report is an extremely politically correct one, the type of report, indeed, for which this House appears to have obtained a patent."
"The economic and social disadvantages of the Roma have yet again been ascribed to so-called intolerance and discrimination."
"If we just lay down new quotas and muzzling laws and if we just turn on the money tap again, everything will be fine."
"The experience from the Netherlands has clearly shown, of course, that the majority of the Roma community refuses to adapt and integrate, whatever we do."
"It is not our fault, but the fault of the Roma community itself, that the Roma are disproportionately represented in crime statistics."
"Their values and norms are directly at odds with our own."
"I also oppose any attempt by Europe to meddle with this issue and I wish to repeat that each Member State is entitled to remove from its territory people who systematically refuse to adapt and who resort to criminal behaviour."
"(LT) I voted for the resolution on the priorities for the 2011 budget for many reasons, but mostly for the attention given to the matter of youth unemployment."
"The current economic and social situation in many European Union countries requires a special approach to the increasing gap between youth and the labour market, although it is acknowledged that investment in young people and education is investment in the future."
"Experience shows that during an economic slowdown, young people would rather remain in the education system or begin studies than look for work."
"We can observe similar tendencies in our countries now."
"Therefore, I would like to say that the planned measures, a more active labour market and the coherence of the education system are very important."
"Development of entrepreneurial skills and special programmes are very necessary whether we are talking about ERASMUS's first work, or other measures."
"I very much hope that the European Union has sufficient political will to not simply adopt very important documents, but to implement them as well."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against this report primarily because I totally disagree with the priorities which this Parliament has proposed to the Commission, including the harmonisation of immigration policy."
"I know what this means; harmonising immigration policies of all the Member States is being pushed forward as a clear priority."
"I disagree with that."
"However, I voted against this report, first and foremost, because it has already made it very clear that this Parliament is not in favour of the much-needed slimming down of European bureaucracy."
"The contrary is true."
"We should thoroughly reconsider abolishing all kinds of institutions and agencies which have, in effect, become, or always have been, superfluous."
"However, this Parliament is calling for even more so-called decentralised agencies."
"I repeat that, as I see it, we have too many of these already."
"There are some that should be abolished before we go creating a new one."
"I am thinking of the Committee of the Regions, the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Institute for Gender Equality."
"How much does all of that cost our taxpayers and what use are they all, for heaven's sake?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in extraordinary times such as these we are living through, we must adopt extraordinary measures."
"Next year's budget must not be drawn up as if these were ordinary times."
"Unfortunately, the economic crisis is not yet over, and we cannot ignore it."
"My group and I voted for the budget priorities today, but in the near future, we must have the political responsibility to take more important decisions."
"We must give consideration to a reform of the Union budget so as to put Europe in a fit state to steer economic policy in a more incisive manner."
"A fully implemented internal market, more resources for research and infrastructure, more investment in security and families must be the next objectives, or else we risk ever more conservative actions by the Member States."
"To conclude, we must be more European and less nationalist, and bring into play a genuine European policy."
"(ES) Mr President, allow me to say that it is a pleasure to see you in the chair once again."
"Mark Twain observed that, when all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail."
"The European Union is very good at spending money - at spending other people's money."
"It was, I think, Milton Friedman who observed that there are two kinds of money in the world: there is your money and there is my money."
"We are much more careful with the latter than with the former."
"That explains what is happening in Europe today."
"All of the Member States are looking for budget reductions."
"In Greece, there is a public sector cut of around 10% being proposed, in Ireland more than 7%, Germany is looking at raising the retirement age, Spain - your country - is looking for savings of 2% of GDP, but our budget here in the European Union continues to rise inexorably."
"Why?"
"Because there is no link in the European Union between taxation, representation and expenditure, so there is no external constraint from the taxpayers."
"It was too much spending that got the world into this mess - too much spending by individuals, too much spending by corporations and too much spending by governments."
"If, instead of spending these trillions on yet further aggrandisement of our debt, if we had given that back to the people in tax cuts, think what a stimulus effect that would have had."
"(SK) European agricultural products meet the highest quality standards in the world, which should, of course, make them more competitive on international markets."
"EU citizens and discerning consumers must therefore be fully informed as to their advantages."
"It is, above all, necessary to praise the fact that European products not only fulfil strict hygiene, safety and veterinary standards, but also respect the principles of sustainable development, climate change prevention, biodiversity and animal welfare."
"I therefore fully support the introduction of a European quality logo for products originating exclusively from the EU."
"The logo officially recognises the efforts of European farmers and provides protection for intellectual property at the international level."
"I firmly believe that this will help many rural areas which have no other development opportunities."
"The EU must provide financial support for modernising agricultural enterprises and developing micro-enterprises, especially in rural areas, in order to achieve high quality agri-food products by means of the Union."
"(LT) I voted for this document, since I think that ecological and clean farming is our future and we must promote it."
"We also have to promote people's interest in ecological farms and ecological products, both at EU level and in the Member States."
"On the other hand, as we want to ensure and promote ecological farming, we must not rush to legalise genetically modified organisms."
"Some countries have set a very good example, severely restricting the growing of genetically modified organisms around ecological farms."
"There should be a clear divide."
"Consumers must also be provided with all the information and results of scientific research linked to genetically modified organisms and the impact of genetically modified feed on the environment and people's health without hiding anything from them."
"Only then will we create a genuine common market of ecological products, which is very important for all our lives."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank Mr Scottà for the work he has put into this report."
"I consider that the protection and strengthening of a quality policy for our agricultural produce is a priority for the European Union, because it involves and is bound up with a series of other fundamental subjects at European level, such as ever greater consumer protection, support for SMEs, the preservation of the cultural and traditional heritage of many European regions and the competitiveness of European food producers on a global scale."
"These are the reasons why I voted for this report."
"(CS) I appreciate the fact that the report on agricultural product quality policy ties in with the steps taken previously towards strengthening the policy on quality."
"I consider it particularly beneficial to develop the system of geographical indications and designations of origin while retaining the demanding criteria for obtaining protection."
"I agree with the retention of the instrument for guaranteeing traditional specialities, with the proviso that the rules for registration should be simplified."
"In view of the fact that it involves a lower standard of protection, without the need to prove the specific geographical characteristics of the product, I see no reason why the handling of applications should take the same length of time as for geographical indications and designations of origin."
"In my view, there is a weak point in current practice in the power of the Commission to reject applications it considers to be incomplete on a discretionary basis."
"This often happens haphazardly and arbitrarily, without knowledge of the special characteristics of the product and the geographical area."
"It is also necessary to establish measures against the circumvention of deadlines in the registration process in the form of the Commission coming up with more and more comments and supplementary questions."
"Mr President, may I also thank Mr Scottà for the work in this important report."
"I want to refer specifically to Amendment 4, which asks for the maximum amount of information to be made available to the consumer."
"It also supports the introduction of comprehensive and compulsory legislation for 'place of farming' labelling."
"Whilst these are laudable aims, I believe the amendment is too restrictive and would perhaps be better as a voluntary piece of information."
"In Northern Ireland, we rely heavily on the ability to export produce to the rest of the UK and other European countries."
"This amendment has the potential to affect Northern Ireland's ability to sell products in certain markets where currently there is no difficulty, and I feel that it is important that new labelling does not create barriers which prevent trade between different Member States."
"Whilst Amendment 4 poses some difficulty, I recognise the important work of the report and I recognise the importance of producing traceable, high quality and safe products."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this vote, we have provided ourselves with a means by which to protect consumers and to add due value to agricultural produce: a goal that we have sought to achieve for a long time."
"From today, the origin must be clearly indicated on the label of meat products, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, poultry and other processed single-ingredient products."
"As far as animals are concerned, the place of origin must be given as a single defined location only where the animals are born, reared and slaughtered in the same country."
"This is an intervention by which due recognition can be given to agricultural producers and to those who process agricultural produce."
"We have shown that the European Parliament has just one goal where its action on agricultural foodstuffs is concerned, and that is to guarantee the quality and accessibility of the information available to consumers."
"We have done a good job."
"My compliments to those Members who have worked on this dossier."
"Mr President, in principle, I have no problem with the idea of quality logos."
"We see quality logos in a number of areas of our life."
"Just so long as this is not being used as an excuse to override the choices of the consumer."
"If food does not meet certain size restrictions or aesthetic restrictions, we should not be throwing it away, throwing it onto the heap, as we see happen with 30% of European agricultural produce that is often wasted because it does not meet strict European standards."
"We should also not be using our quality standards as an excuse to ban imports from farmers in developing countries, throwing those farmers into poverty, and then taking our taxpayers' money to throw at corrupt governments when the farmers fall into poverty."
"Surely, rather than quality marks and gestures like this, we should be trusting the market, we should trust the consumers and we should trust the people."
"(SK) I voted against this report because, as is often the case with other reports, in this own-initiative report, Europe again advances its own concept of so-called reproductive and sexual rights, which it forces on people in developing countries."
"It must be made clear once and for all that, according to the World Health Organisation definition, this concept includes abortion as a method of family planning."
"Human life is sacred from conception until natural death, and therefore I could not support this report. On the other hand, there are some good ideas there, which might, of course, help people in developing countries, and it could therefore be said that, as hundreds of millions of people in developing countries have to face the consequences of rising prices of basic products and foodstuffs, they will confront the problem of survival in these ways."
"I am alarmed by the estimates of international financial institutions that the billions of people already on the planet will increase by hundreds of millions more and that in sub Saharan Africa, child mortality will increase by between 30 000 and 50 000."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the effect the financial and economic crisis is having on the poor countries of the world."
"Although the report does not give a sufficiently radical response to the problems of poor countries, at the same time, we can agree with many of the things that it includes."
"It is poor people and poor countries that are suffering the most as a result of the economic crisis."
"We should give all the help we can with regard to public investment, particularly in these countries."
"However, it must also be said that the trade agreements the European Union has with poor countries are not really favourable to them."
"Large European companies benefit most from these agreements; small producers, small farmers and working people do not benefit from them and, as such, we must change the way we work with these countries."
"Mr President, I voted against paragraph 7 of this report and I was disturbed to see, yet again, this Parliament using a report of this nature to covertly introduce the right to abortion and also the linkage of sexual and reproductive health to that of public health in developing nations."
"It is not for this place to determine whether access to abortion is a right or not."
"It is a matter for national governments to legislate."
"I, and the vast majority of my constituents in Northern Ireland, remain firm in the belief of the right to life of the unborn child."
"(NL) Mr President, as Parliament, we ought to think twice before making proposals."
"We ought to be making proposals for policies that will solve problems, not exacerbate them."
"Now, as far as development aid is concerned, there are many serious studies that have actually demonstrated that granting development aid in too automatic a fashion invariably results in delays to economic reforms and thus in delays to opportunities for economic growth in developing countries."
"Despite this, we as Parliament keep taking as our starting point the credo or the so-called axiom that granting ever more development aid in the first instance will help get African countries back on their feet."
"Despite huge injections of development aid over so many decades, there is, regrettably, no clear evidence that most African countries are not in a far worse position today than immediately after decolonisation."
"That was my first point."
"I will be very brief with my second point."
"It is, of course, true, as the report states, that developing countries are further undermined by brain drain, but why do we keep on insisting on the 'blue card', which exacerbates this problem even more?"
"(SK) I cannot understand why reproductive health has again been incorporated into a report on the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis for developing countries and development cooperation."
"Reproductive health organisations support abortion as one of the ways of controlling the birth rate."
"This industry is also financed at the European level from the taxes of citizens who oppose abortion and who are involved in protecting life."
"For decades now, international institutions have been giving their views on birth rate control as a way of combating poverty, but developing countries still live in extreme poverty."
"In my opinion, the EU wastes financial resources on birth control, which does not solve poverty."
"I honour life and I also respect the principle of subsidiarity in relationships with developing countries."
"That is why I have voted against paragraph 7 and against the entire report."
"Mr President, it was predictable, perhaps inexorable, that the European Union would leap on the financial crisis in Greece in order to advance its well-laid plans for the harmonisation of fiscal policy."
"We have seen repeated calls for a European debt agency, for a European Monetary Fund, for pan-European taxation, so as not to have to go to the national electorates for a bail-out."
"Mr Van Rompuy and the other Commissioners are, as honest federalists, exactly agreeing with the case that was made by British sceptics, which was that you cannot have monetary union without fiscal and economic union."
"I think it was John Maynard Keynes who wrote 'He who controls the currency controls the country'."
"I promise that is the only time I am going to quote Keynes approvingly."
"In fact, let me give you a higher and better authority even than John Maynard Keynes."
"I refer you to the Gospel of St Matthew, Chapter 22."
"I am sure you will remember this."
"Our Lord is asked whether it is proper to pay taxes to Rome."
"He says: 'Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?"
"Show me the tribute money'."
"And they brought unto him a penny."
"And [Jesus] saith unto them, 'Whose is this image and superscription?'"
"They say unto him: 'Caesar's'."
"And saith [Jesus] unto them: 'Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's'."
"Now I am not arguing that Our Lord was on one side or the other of the debate about the euro."
"The point is that, when looking for the supreme symbol of temporal authority, the absolute sign of sovereignty, it is the coin!"
"And so we have seen that the euro leads to common economic government."
"Thank heaven we had the foresight to keep the pound."
"Thank you for blessing this morning's session, Mr Hannan."
"Mr President, when you look at this report, you see many of the old, tired phrases about how the developing world is suffering as a result of the economic crisis."
"Clearly there are people who will be suffering as a result of the economic crisis in these countries, but quite often they are not necessarily the people we want to help."
"Quite often, they are the governments who are worried about their aid budgets being cut because, with less aid money coming to them, it is more difficult to keep corrupt and inefficient governments in power."
"When I was in Africa last year talking to many centre-right politicians, they complained to me that aid budgets actually keep corrupt governments in power and it makes it more difficult to improve economic and political governance in those countries."
"But let us look at some of the things that we propose."
"We talk about more investment in developing countries - and everyone would agree to that - yet we have a proposal going through this House, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which will reduce investment in developing countries."
"We talk about helping developing country farmers, yet we continue, even in today's budget, to vote for more resources for the common agricultural policy that does so much to damage farmers' livelihoods in developing countries."
"Let us really tackle the real source of the problems in these countries - bad governance, and protectionism in the EU."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against this report for two reasons."
"Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach."
"Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism."
"Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to 'reproductive medicine' when they mean abortion."
"This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child."
"Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism."
"Mr President, I voted against this report because it is a silly report."
"It is an irrelevant report."
"So: all the assets are in all the stock exchanges in New York, London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, etc."
"If you sell all the properties which are extra-legal, the slum-valued properties which are not part of the legal system in the developing countries, you will achieve USD 7 trillion."
"There is a great deal of capital waiting in the developing countries which is outside the legal structures of those countries, from the slums to those millions of businesses you see on the side of the roads which are not part of the formal economy."
"Secondly, if you ask how much money is coming out of the developing countries every year through the financial systems of the world, it is USD 800 billion."
"Why are we not working to keep that capital in those countries making those countries richer?"
"No, what did we go and do just now?"
"We voted for a Tobin tax to hammer already weakened financial institutions in the west and give the money to a whole bunch of people who will probably steal it."
"Mr President, like previous speakers, I, too, had an objection to the inclusion of paragraph 7."
"We were given a free vote by our group, but our delegation decided to vote against because - as speakers have said - talking about reproductive health rights is another way of saying abortion."
"If that is what is intended by it, it should be spelt out and not brought in under an economic crisis plan."
"So, like other speakers, we objected to that and voted against that section."
"(DA) Mr President, we in the Danish People's Party voted against this report."
"However, I actually feel the need to express my thanks for a number of the observations that were presented in the report."
"I am thinking in particular of paragraph 27, which very honestly states that the euro should quite naturally lead to closer coordination of economic policies within the euro area."
"I am, of course, entirely opposed to this statement, but I would like to express my thanks for the clarity and honesty that the rapporteur displays in relation to the euro."
"Thus, the euro is a construction formed with the intention of creating much greater economic unification in Europe. In other words, finance policy, labour market policy, structural policy - all economic areas, everything that has any significance to the economy - is to be unified."
"This is what we are currently seeing in Greece, where economists in Frankfurt are telling the Greeks what sort of economic policy they should pursue, and this is what we will see in a few months' time with regard to Spain and Italy and a whole list of other countries."
"In this way, the report demonstrates, with all the clarity we could wish for, why Denmark - and my party, the Danish People's Party, in particular - wishes to remain outside the euro area."
"We want to decide for ourselves what economic policy we wish to pursue."
"It is the Danish electorate and not economists in Frankfurt who should decide this."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - We approved of the proposal that the existing rules relating to the importation of live animals, meat and meat products should remain in force until replaced by measures adopted under the new regulatory framework."
"Whilst we should prefer such laws to be the laws of each member country rather than of an EU superstate, there must be laws covering such matters."
"However, the report also provided for a list of third countries or parts of countries from which Member States shall authorise importation of bovine animals, swine and fresh meat."
"This will involve the United Kingdom being given a legal obligation to allow imports from these countries."
"This will involve competition for our farmers and a further erosion of sovereignty."
"As a result of this pairing of good and bad proposals, we decided to abstain."
"Article 3(1) of Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine and fresh meat or meat products from third countries states that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, would approve a list of third countries from which the Member States shall authorise the importation of bovine animals, swine and fresh meat."
"Although this directive has been repealed, the procedure is still carried out and the aforementioned list has been modified over the years."
"The Commission is now proposing to create a regulation that codifies all the relevant modifications carried out over the years, and which is due to be modified frequently, meaning that it is continually updated."
"I believe that this procedure introduces clarity and transparency, not only for Member States, where there are modifications, but also for third countries that export the products in question to the EU."
"I welcome the adoption of this report on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine and fresh meat or meat products from third countries."
"This report is based on Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972, which led the Council to approve a list of third countries from which the Member States shall authorise the importation of bovine animals, swine and fresh meat."
"Although this directive has been repealed, the procedure is still carried out and the aforementioned list has been modified over the years."
"The Commission is now proposing to create a regulation that codifies all the relevant modifications carried out over the years, and which is due to be modified frequently, meaning that it is continually updated."
"I believe that this procedure, as well as strengthening the EU public's food safety, introduces greater clarity for Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU."
"The food safety of the European public is a fundamental issue that must be of concern to all of us."
"Establishing health policy criteria for the importation of certain live animals and their fresh meat from third countries must be very rigorous and such products must be systematically monitored so that we can see if these criteria are being met."
"It is therefore essential that a list be drawn up of the third countries that meet the animal health, public health and veterinary certification criteria allowing them to export live animals (bovine, ovine and caprine animals, and swine) and their fresh meat to EU countries."
"In the merciless price war that is currently raging, companies are using outrageous methods to improve their profit margins."
"Imported meat is being sold as domestic produce, rotten meat is often on sale and then there is the case of the fake ham."
"Now, imitation products must be clearly labelled."
"However, the mandatory labelling of feedstuffs containing genetically modified organisms was not supported by the majority of Members, despite the fact that the citizens of Europe have a very critical attitude towards genetic modification."
"It is important to put in place provisions relating to animal health and hygiene."
"However, there has been a failure to address the issue of genetic modification in the import regulations, which is why I have abstained."
"in writing. - I voted 'yes' at the final vote on this resolution."
"It needs to be said that there has been an informal meeting with the Council and the Commission, where it became clear that Parliament could agree to the procedure."
"The draft report submitted to vote by Jo Leinen takes over the COM proposal and amendments have been tabled in the ENVI Committee."
"The Council already agreed it would approve Parliament's position; thus, a first-reading agreement is to be assumed."
"We Greens agree with the procedure."
"Changes to the law which are intended to improve animal welfare are essential, and I am very pleased by the fact that the European Commission does not now intend to make these changes without the participation of the European Parliament."
"Therefore, I endorsed the Leinen report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Decision 79/542/EEC drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat."
"Despite the fact that I am not a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I shall continue to be involved in the amendment of legislation, especially where the intention is to bring about a radical improvement in the transport of horses."
"There are many motivations to this but, principally, Christian ethics compel me to care about bettering the existence not only of people, but also of animals and our natural environment."
"The European Union can do a great deal here."
"I supported both reports on the allocation of funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to unemployed workers in Lithuania."
"In Lithuania, the economic and financial crisis has affected many different sectors and many people have been left without work and a source of livelihood."
"The EGF's rules on the allocation of funds were simplified, taking into account the complex situation in the labour market and the growing number of unemployed."
"Therefore, Lithuania must exploit all possible opportunities to obtain the funds requested, in order to help unemployed people as much as possible."
"It is also very important that we ensure the effective use of these funds and that they provide a real benefit for the people of Lithuania."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"From 1 May 2009, the scope of the EGF was broadened to include support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the economic and financial crisis."
"At this time when we are facing this severe economic and financial crisis, one of the principal consequences is an increase in unemployment."
"The EU must use all the means at its disposal to respond to the consequences of the crisis, particularly in terms of the support to be provided to those who have been facing the day-to-day reality of unemployment."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this proposal on the mobilisation of the EGF to assist Lithuania, with the objective of supporting the workers made redundant in the 49 firms operating in the furniture manufacturing industry."
"I voted for this report, as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's (EGF) financial support will be allocated to the unemployed workers of companies in the furniture industry since, following the reduction in furniture industry exports, many workers were made redundant."
"EU support will be earmarked to help workers requalify, search for new jobs or set up their own businesses."
"I am delighted that the European Commission approved Lithuania's application to receive EU funding since, during the recession, there is very little opportunity for the redundant furniture company workers to return to the labour market, and the mass redundancies from 49 companies is having a very negative impact on the country's economic situation."
"I would like to call on the EU institutions to ensure the smooth and swift adoption of decisions when considering matters concerning the provision of financial support, because the delaying of such decisions may only exacerbate the already difficult situation facing workers."
"I would like to stress that financial aid from the EU will help workers who have suffered from major structural changes in the economy and trade to reintegrate into the labour market."
"Similarly to Lithuania's construction sector, which we have analysed before, that country's furniture industry has also felt the effects of globalisation, as it is now exposed to the products of vicious competitors, whose production is on another level."
"As the requirements for application and mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund have been met, I think that such a mobilisation would be of help."
"Just two weeks after Parliament approved the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in response to the redundancies in Lithuania and Germany, we are once again approving its mobilisation, this time in response to the redundancies that have taken place in 49 companies in Lithuania's furniture manufacturing industry."
"As we said then, it has already been some time since the number of workers made redundant significantly exceeded the initial estimates of the Commission regarding the number of workers who would come to benefit from the fund."
"We would remind you that this is an industry that has been struggling through serious difficulties in Portugal too, particularly in municipalities where it has an especially large presence, such as Paredes and Paços de Ferreira."
"This has been leading to redundancies there too, exacerbating the region's social situation."
"With every new request for action, it becomes clearer that what are needed more than palliative measures - which are certainly necessary - are urgent measures to protect the productive sectors and jobs: specifically, those that are most vulnerable to the crisis and those that are involved in exploiting each country's development potential, promoting public projects, and supporting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the cooperative sector ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"From 1 May 2009, the scope of the EGF was broadened to include support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the economic and financial crisis."
"At this time when we are facing this severe economic and financial crisis, one of the principal consequences is an increase in unemployment."
"The EU must use all the means at its disposal to respond to the consequences of the crisis, particularly in terms of the support to be provided to those who have been facing the day-to-day reality of unemployment."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this proposal on the mobilisation of the EGF to assist Lithuania, with the objective of supporting the workers made redundant in the 45 firms active in the clothing manufacturing industry."
"I am delighted that today, there was a vote on the provision of financial support to the Lithuanian clothing manufacturing industry, as this sector has been hit particularly hard by the recession."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that mostly women work in the clothing manufacturing sector and, due to redundancies caused by the crisis, in the year leading up to July 2009, the number of unemployed women in Lithuania doubled."
"I voted for this report, since the financial support received from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) will be used for employment stimulation measures to employ redundant workers as soon as possible, study and requalification payments, as well as benefit payments for minors under eight years old and the care of disabled family members."
"Thus, this financial support is very necessary in the clothing manufacturing industry since, with the dramatic fall in demand for clothes in Lithuania and export areas, there has been a marked reduction in the amount of clothing manufacturing."
"I would also like to stress that the dismissal of these workers is not just having a negative impact on the country and the local economy, but is also adversely affecting the lives of individual workers."
"The Lithuanian clothing manufacturing industry is joining the country's construction and furniture manufacturing industries in losing out from globalisation, with a significant number of workers having been made redundant."
"The large majority voting in favour in the competent parliamentary committee confirms the measure's apparent soundness."
"Given this, I see no reason to vote against the mobilisation of the fund in this case."
"Just two weeks after Parliament approved the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in response to the redundancies in Lithuania and Germany, we are once again approving its mobilisation, this time in response to the redundancies that have taken place in 45 companies active in Lithuania's clothing manufacturing industry."
"It is worth remembering that this industry is also enduring a serious crisis in Portugal, where it is suffering the effects of the liberalisation of world trade particularly intensely, without any of the actions necessary to safeguard it having been taken."
"Every new request for mobilisation of this fund makes the measures that we have been advocating all the more urgent: unemployment must be tackled effectively, and jobs must be created and promoted with rights based on the development of economic activity, simulation of public employment, job security and reduced working hours without any reduction in salaries."
"Measures are also required to combat companies moving offshore, beginning with making public subsidies - particularly Community subsidies - conditional on meeting obligations such as the protection of jobs and local development, measures that impose a clear break with the neoliberal policies which are causing an economic and social disaster in the countries of the European Union before our very eyes."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is born out of that purpose."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocations that occur in the context of globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of companies and, in order to achieve this, it is essential that these workers have access to new jobs in the future."
"The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, so we should now grant this aid to Lithuania."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of two reports by Barbara Matera on financial support for redundant workers in Lithuania from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I would also like to thank those colleagues who voted in favour as a qualified majority and three fifths of the votes cast were necessary for the adoption of the reports."
"Both reports on the situation in the furniture manufacturing sector and in the wearing apparel manufacturing sector represent one of the most acute unemployment cases in Lithuania."
"The sums are not big for the EU but they will alleviate the hardships Lithuanian workers are facing."
"This is the case for those who worked in the 49 enterprises in the furniture manufacturing sector, where redundant workers will be paid EUR 662 088 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, as well as for those who worked in the 45 enterprises in the wearing apparel manufacturing sector, where the sum is EUR 523 481."
"Even though this might be only the tip of the iceberg of the unemployment problem in Lithuania, the financial support will help those most in need."
"in writing. - We are not in favour of the European Union being responsible for help to redundant workers (or for anything else)."
"We would oppose money being allocated to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as we would oppose money being allocated to all EU funds."
"We believe that Member States should help their own redundant workers."
"However, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has money that has already been allocated to it and that money has come from Member States."
"If it were proposed that money from the EGAF should be allocated to redundant workers in Britain, we would vote for it to be allocated and we would be criticised if we did not."
"We must therefore vote for the fund to be used appropriately for other Member States."
"Nevertheless, we intend to ensure that future money will be allocated to British redundant workers and, if we find that they are not eligible, we shall vote against all future mobilisations of the fund."
"It is the thought of the Lithuanian workers sacrificed on the altar of globalisation that prompts me to abstain."
"As they have been plunged into this situation by the consequences of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could feel justified in voting against the beggarly sums that the European elite want to give them."
"However, what little is given may relieve their pain."
"The logic of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is still intolerable nonetheless."
"In the kingdom of Eurocrats, a clear conscience comes cheap."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giegold's report makes some interesting points concerning the current economic crisis, the worst since the process of European integration began."
"I should like to emphasise that in a question I recently addressed to the Commission, I raised a question concerning the scope of the Stability and Growth Pact, which may be exceeded in certain exceptional cases, such as the implementation of public building and social housing projects."
"Such works are, in fact, intended for social purposes and are a response to housing emergencies experienced in particular in large cities, and it might therefore be advisable to tackle this type of problem by resorting to exceptional measures."
"I therefore consider it desirable for the Commission to adopt a very clear position so that it may issue directives in respect of the Member States with reference to budget and spending limits imposed by the parameters of the Stability and Growth Pact on local authorities, which, particularly in the case of large authorities, need substantial infrastructure investment."
"I voted in favour of the report on the annual statement of the European Commission on the euro area and public finances."
"What I recall, above all, from this report, which is rich in analysis and proposals, is its call for enhanced European economic governance and, in particular, for better coordination of budget policies."
"Growth and solidarity: those are the two key words that must guide our European economic strategy."
"Growth, because, without it, we will be unable to take up the social challenge."
"Solidarity, because it is the raison d'être of European integration and will be its future."
"The Fianna Fáil members of the European Parliament, Pat the Cope Gallagher and Liam Aylward, strongly oppose what is proposed in this report regarding the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB in English)."
"A Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in Europe would not improve the competitiveness of the European Union or the operation of the single market and, on top of that, the CCCTB could interfere with small open economies, like that of Ireland."
"The question of taxation is within the competence of the individual Member States and the Irish Government has the right to use its power of veto in relation to any tax measures, including CCCTB."
"This right is enshrined in the treaties, including the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I supported this report, since I think that it highlights at length the problems of the euro area and public finances."
"There has been a further decline in employment in European Union Member States and it is forecast that this will continue."
"The chaotic structural reforms of some Member States, which are implemented without a concrete plan, threaten the stability of the entire EU."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are going through a particularly difficult period, since both the Member States and the European Central Bank were unable to control and ensure that funds earmarked for the banks were allocated for the main goal - the provision of preferential loans to small business."
"It is also very important to support the development of the euro area and to take appropriate measures to create suitable conditions for Member States aiming to become members of the euro area."
"I voted for the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances."
"I support the proposal made in the report, calling on the Eurogroup to facilitate entry into the euro area for those Member States wishing to join and meeting the specified conditions."
"I think that it is vital to improve the regulation and supervision of the financial markets, as well as limit external and internal deficits in order to facilitate the successful development of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"Furthermore, we must pay particular attention to the problems associated with fiscal discipline."
"The future EU 2020 strategy must consider policies for creating jobs and promoting sustainable development so that we can prevent new economic crises from being triggered."
"At the same time, Member States and the European Commission must work together to reduce fiscal imbalances."
"The consolidation of public finances is a vital prerequisite for ensuring sustainable economic growth."
"After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Commission will play a bigger role in monitoring Member States' economic development."
"In accordance with Article 121, the European Commission will be able to issue warnings to countries which fail to comply with the general guidelines on economic policies."
"I voted for this report since the European Parliament drew the Commission's attention to the fact that while developed states are gradually climbing out of the pit of the global crisis, the situation in developing countries is only getting worse."
"Therefore, the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Commission and the euro area Member States must encourage the process of integration in the area of economic and monetary policy in the European Union and support the expansion of the euro area."
"I am in favour of calling on the ECB to support the efforts of Member States outside the euro area to introduce the euro, especially in cases where Member States prove their ability to maintain reliable and stable fiscal discipline."
"I would like to point out that, in order to avoid financial crises in the future, we must call on the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to better coordinate their actions in the area of currency exchange rate policy."
"Therefore, in spite of the crisis, little progress has been made in the switch to a common international representation for the euro area."
"The greatest concern is that in spite of the fact that every effort is being made to stabilise the area of monetary and fiscal policy, employment in the EU continues to fall and unemployment and social isolation are on the increase."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Giegold report because there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues that arise in this report."
"It is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime."
"However, particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend, to a large extent, on its capacity to attract foreign investment."
"The Irish Labour Party does not support the introduction of CCCTB."
"I abstained from voting on this particular report."
"We must see that the recession is not going away, given that the economic situation in almost all the Member States is clearly negative and unemployment is increasing."
"The specific problem is not one of 'sound' finances."
"Countries such as Greece face problems with public borrowing due to both speculative attacks by the markets and the institutional and political problems of EMU."
"The crisis in public deficits, which is a general phenomenon throughout the EU, is due, among other things, to the massive scale of tax evasion, which is something that the Commission forgets."
"Apart from that, the support packages for the banks from national governments also increased public deficits, as the Spanish Presidency admitted in answer to my question on that point."
"Be that as it may, insistence on the Stability Pact, especially in a recession, is a disaster."
"It exacerbates social inequalities and results in cuts in public investment, it increases unemployment and it undermines countries' growth prospects."
"That is why the anti-growth and anti-social Stability Pact needs to be changed and a different framework needs to be configured for the exercising of economic and social policy, predicated on work and social needs and sustainable, viable growth."
"in writing. - At a time of serious economic and social crisis, we need to increase efforts to coordinate macro-economic and structural reform strategies across national borders so as to tackle the imbalances that hinder the generation of jobs."
"I share the concerns regarding imbalances within the euro area, such as speculation in the construction sector, whose excesses contribute to asymmetric shocks, and call on the Commission to study possible mechanisms to improve the economic governance of the euro area and curb the expansion of such imbalances."
"The need for stricter regulation and supervision of the financial crisis is as urgent as ever."
"Any European discussion on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has to have regard to the needs of geographically marginal regions of the EU such as Ireland and their capacity to attract FDI."
"A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate."
"Taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each Member State."
"The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States, to ease the bureaucratic burden on them to establish compliance with the tax codes of the states in which they are operating."
"The financial, economic and social crisis has caused the Member States of the European Union great difficulties, reflected by the serious situation of their public finances."
"The majority of countries have excessive levels of debt, so measures contributing to stability and growth are needed urgently in order to achieve a more balanced situation."
"The reduction of public debt and the reviewing of Member States' priorities are essential in order for public funds to be applied efficiently and, in particular, to create the basis for policies that foster economic growth and, consequently, social well-being."
"The reviewing of tax policy is essential in order for suitable economic stimuli to be introduced, because only with a strong economy will it be possible to overcome the present difficulties and prepare for the future."
"in writing. - I do not support paragraph 29 as it calls for the introduction of CCCTB."
"One of the things we are told about CCCTB is that it will be more efficient and that it will simplify matters."
"Given that, as it now stands, companies can opt in or opt out, we would end up with 28 tax bases instead of the current 27; that is hardly simplification."
"As it is currently proposed, CCCTB would mean the redistribution of European profits across the EU, so a country like Ireland, which exports a lot of what it produces, would be penalised because the profits, of course, would be at the point of sale."
"It does seem a little bit strange since, at the core of the EU, we have the free movement of goods; therefore we would end up, if we use CCCTB, by penalising exporting countries."
"Its introduction would damage Europe's capacity to attract foreign direct investment, because the rules as such would not apply to the Member State in which it was located but would be by some reference to a complicated formula which can only be calculated in retrospect, which would damage our capacity to attract foreign direct investment."
"I shall vote against this report, which blindly promotes the neoliberal logic that is responsible for the economic, social and environmental crisis, the consequences of which we are all suffering."
"The text proposed to us is not only extremely dogmatic, it also shows contempt for the peoples, in particular, for the Greek people."
"How can Parliament vote for a text that is so shameful that it calls into question Greece's entry into the euro area in the light of the budget deficit created by the policies that it supports?"
"Clearly, this Europe is yet another enemy of the people."
"The economic crisis that has befallen the EU, and which is still being felt quite strongly, has revealed some gaps in Community monetary policy and in the public finances of certain Member States."
"We must learn lessons from the mistakes made so that they can be avoided in the future."
"The EU needs to improve in several areas, particularly regarding monetary policy, improved coordination and cooperation on economic policy, and the monitoring of Member States' public finances."
"It must also devote efforts to tackling energy dependency, and creating an increased number of new jobs in industries that are modern and sustainable from an environmental standpoint."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution; it expresses in a satisfactory and insistent tone to the Council the problem of the anticipated decrease in employment in the European Union, which concerns Greece in particular, while highlighting the extraordinary recovery measures that need to be taken at European level."
"Paragraphs 12 to 18, which refer to improved coordination of cooperation in the field of economic policy, highlight the imbalances within the euro area due to the lack of cohesion between the economic and, more importantly, the trade policies of the Member States in times of recession."
"I also consider that the European Parliament's official recommendation to the Commission that eurobonds be issued and that a common approach be taken to the challenges within the euro area (paragraph 26) is particularly important in light of the policy which the European Union decides to pursue in the immediate future."
"in writing. - I followed our rapporteur's position on this topic, Giegold, and voted in favour of his report."
"The Annual Statement of the Commission on the euro area aims to stimulate a broad debate on euro area economic policies."
"More specifically, it presents the Commission's views on the challenges the euro area economy has to face, on the one hand, and its analysis of the appropriate response of economic policies, on the other hand."
"In my speech, I spoke about the situation in the euro area and public finances in 2009."
"The verdict expressed by my vote has a broader context."
"As predicted by economists, 2009 was the most difficult for crisis-hit Member States."
"The Union's GDP fell by 4%, industrial production by 20%, unemployment rose to 23 million and so on. The costs of fighting the crisis have led to a drastic worsening of the situation of public finances."
"However, some countries, even before the recession, showed a high level of public debt which was in contravention of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"For the euro area, the financial crisis has proved to be the greatest challenge in its history."
"The crisis has ruthlessly laid bare the weaknesses of the common currency system."
"The most serious of these is, without doubt, the existence of huge differences between euro area countries in terms of the stability of their public finances and level of debt."
"It suddenly became apparent that the Stability and Growth Pact, which was, in principle, to be a guarantee of meeting convergence criteria, was being disregarded by national authorities and also by EU authorities."
"The lack of discipline, and the lack of an appropriate system of penalties, led, as a result, to a crisis of the common currency."
"Many politicians who are not in favour of European economic integration have already announced the collapse of the euro area, and are circulating a vision of catastrophe for the whole process of integration."
"I think, however, that these views are not justified and are speculative in nature, for the euro area is faced with an opportunity for thorough reform, which will improve mechanisms of supervision and ensure greater coordination."
"We only need to carry out that process rationally."
"The appointment of an eminent professional like Vítor Constâncio as Vice-President of the European Central Bank will enhance the value of the economic and financial policies advocated by this institution."
"Vítor Constâncio is taking up the post of Vice-President of the ECB at a difficult time for the euro area."
"However, his views on the way in which the European Union must respond to the Greek crisis highlight that he has vision and knows how to protect the European currency."
"Mr Constâncio has an impressive CV."
"The fact that he is Governor of the Bank of Portugal (Banco de Portugal) confirms his credentials as a professional."
"This only serves to remind me of the recent incident involving the political appointment of a vice-president at the National Bank of Romania, anything but the model professional presented by Mr Constâncio."
"Fortunately, the National Bank of Romania also has a huge number of professionals and its course of action during the current economic crisis has been faultless."
"However, national banks should be the last place where appointments are made on the basis of political rather than competency criteria."
"Mr Constâncio had a tough hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"However, Mr Constâncio did not waver once, continually expressing consistent opinions and demonstrating that his vision of the euro area's future is sound."
"Throughout his years as Governor of the Bank of Portugal, Vítor Constâncio has been a faithful follower of the guidelines imposed on Member States of the European Union by the European Central Bank."
"These guidelines have been profoundly damaging to national interests and sovereignty, and constitute an attack on the rights of the workers and people of Portugal."
"It is well known that he has constantly called for wage moderation in a country in which low wages abound and which has jarring social inequalities."
"These are also the result of the unfair distribution of incomes, which punishes the workers in the interests of capital."
"It is also well known that he has failed in the functions of supervision of the banking system that had been assigned to him."
"We will continue to firmly and vehemently oppose arguments for the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact, and for exchange policy guidelines and other macro-economic guidelines, as well as the devaluing of production and labour - in which Vítor Constâncio has played a central role - as we have always done."
"This vote on the Council recommendation on the appointment of Vítor Constâncio as Vice-President of the European Central Bank comes as no surprise to us."
"His actions as Governor of the Bank of Portugal have always fitted in well with the liberal guidelines of the ECB."
"The policies followed by the ECB and imposed in the Member States of the European Union by it, which are profoundly damaging to national interests and sovereignty and constitute an attack on the rights of the workers and people of Portugal, are basically the same as those that Dr Constâncio advocated and still advocates as Governor of the Bank of Portugal."
"We will continue to fight these policies, regardless of who is involved in their management."
"That is why we voted against this report, since the answers that it gives reaffirm the same old ECB line."
"It advocates the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact and exchange policy and other macro-economic guidelines, as well as continuously devaluing the role of production and labour."
"It is in full knowledge of the facts that I refused to give my approval to Mr Vítor Constâncio's nomination as future Vice-President of the European Central Bank."
"He, as an individual, is not in question, nor are his skills which, I might add, he shows off with some talent."
"We would so very much like to believe him."
"Only, the thousands of Portuguese ruined because of his thoughtlessness and his lack of foresight are living proof of his disastrous track record as head of the Portuguese central bank."
"Three such important incidents are a lot for one man."
"How can someone who has failed in his own country now aspire to be in charge of supervision in Europe?"
"I made the provocative comment that this is a bit like giving sticks of dynamite to a pyromaniac."
"These words were echoed loudly in Portugal."
"Like me, the Portuguese cannot understand how someone who has failed in this way can be promoted to the top level."
"Generally speaking, I am sorry that the European Parliament is not going the way of the US Senate and making nominations that are decisive for the future of the European Union."
"I spent several months in 2008 participating in a committee of enquiry for the Portuguese Parliament."
"It discovered and reported serious failures of supervision, which resulted in the nationalisation of a bank in 2008."
"Another consequence still being felt today has been that hundreds of customers of another bank are unable to move the money that they have invested (in many cases, their life savings)."
"I am referring to Banco Português de Negócios and Banco Privado Português."
"At the time, I repeatedly and publicly criticised the way Dr Constâncio carried out his supervisory duties whilst in charge of the Bank of Portugal."
"The fact that he is Portuguese and my loyalty to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) prevent me from voting against."
"However, my conscience and even my intellectual honesty could not permit me to vote for an appointment as a result of which he will end up as supervisor at the European Central Bank."
"I supported the nomination of Mrs Rasa Budbergytas a member of the European Court of Auditors."
"Her nomination is viewed very favourably both in Lithuania and in Europe, since she has extensive work experience and established a high quality, independent auditing system in Lithuania."
"In the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Budbergytė's nomination was very highly rated - almost all of the members approved her nomination."
"She is a competent specialist and her professional experience and personal qualities will allow her to perform all the duties of a member of the European Court of Auditors appropriately."
"Moreover, Mrs Budbergythas pledged publicly to organise her work on the basis of independence and auditing standards, taking ethical requirements into account."
"If appointed to this office, she promises to carry out her work according to two principles."
"Firstly, irreproachable adherence to international auditing standards and the auditing practices and procedures introduced by the European Court of Auditors."
"Secondly, productive work when performing her own personal duties, duties at the Group/Chamber level and those as a member of the college of the European Court of Auditors."
"She is planning to strengthen the interinstitutional cooperation of the European Court of Auditors with the European Parliament, and especially the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I am convinced that the auditor has proved her competence and professionalism in the area of auditing."
"I am sure that her faultless work will be an excellent contribution to the entire European Union."
"The nomination of Mr Fazakas as a member of the European Court of Auditors has caused heated and controversial debate in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Although his nomination has been known since November, just a few days prior to his nomination hearing in the committee, information was spread about Mr Fazakas' possible collaboration with the state secret police."
"I am astonished that the question of Mr Fazakas' competency is only being raised now, as Hungary is preparing for elections, whereas in the five years that Mr Fazakas has been a Member of the European Parliament, Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control and Quaestor, the question of his competency and ability to carry out his duties was not raised."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament is no place for nebulous political games; therefore, I supported Mr Fazakas' nomination."
"I think that there was ample time between November and the hearing for the interested parties to provide suitably substantiated information about circumstances that could have had an influence on Mr Fazakas' appointment to the European Court of Auditors and to ensure an exhaustive parliamentary assessment, but this was not done."
"Objections by anyone who does not wish to see the appointment in question take place are understandable."
"Nevertheless, if we adhered strictly to this criterion, many others - and there are quite a few around Europe - would also be barred from the position because of their militant adherence to the communist or communist-inspired far left, and because they are guilty of acts that are even more worthy of condemnation."
"That being the case, my abstention is justified."
"in writing. - I voted against Mr Fazakas because in his official autobiography, he withheld the information that, during the Communist dictatorship, he was a secret agent of the Hungarian state secret police from 1976 until the collapse of the regime in 1989."
"According to official documents from the Historical Archives of State Security Services of Hungary, Mr Fazakas was recruited in 1976 by the State Security Service, the Communist secret police, 'on a patriotic basis' (i.e. he entered the service voluntarily) for activities of counter-espionage."
"In relation to today's vote on the nomination of candidate Members of the European Court of Auditors, I would like to express my support for the decision we have made concerning the controversial candidate, Mr Fazakas."
"According to official documents, for many years, Mr Fazakas supported the Communist dictatorship in Hungary, as a member of the Hungarian security service."
"The universally known facts cast a dark shadow over his curriculum vitae and should have been taken into account at an earlier stage."
"The EU has always stood in defence of democracy, freedom of speech and freedom of conscience, and those values were, for decades, violated by the socialist regime, not only in Hungary, but also in the many other countries of what was known as the Eastern bloc."
"It is true that times have changed, and today we can all enjoy extensive liberties, but we must also remember those who restricted that freedom."
"in writing. - The vote in favour of Mr Fazakas is disappointing."
"It sets a serious precedent."
"I voted together with the EPP against Mr Fazakas' confirmation as a Member of the Court of Auditors."
"This was no ordinary vote."
"Mr Fazakas is suspected of being an ex-collaborator of the Communist secret services."
"The Hungarian press produced a document regarding this."
"A number of opinions were heard that opposed any 'punishment' against Mr Fazakas."
"They asked for the past not to be revived."
"This is wrong."
"The past is not dead."
"Tens of millions of eastern Europeans still live a life troubled by the Communist horrors."
"If the past is dead, then there is no sense in leading a life guided by norms and values."
"This would be a recipe for the politics of diminished responsibility."
"Public office would lose dignity."
"Anyone, however corrupt or immoral, could stand for public office."
"If there still are politicians unaware of the Communist record in eastern Europe, this does not qualify them for an informed opinion."
"The perpetrators of the Communist indignity should not be part of a democratic order they tried to suppress."
"Mr Fazakas hid his past and lied when asked about it."
"This lack of honesty should not be rewarded."
"During this plenary sitting, we voted on the report on the nomination of Augustyn Bronisław Kubik as a Member of the Court of Auditors."
"He is currently Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Regional Development."
"In the past, he has held the positions of Adviser to the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control and Chief internal audit inspector at the Ministry of Finance."
"Mr Kubik performed very well during the European Parliament hearing, and his candidature has not raised any doubts."
"He has the appropriate professional experience for a Member of the Court of Auditors, and will be the right person in the right place."
"In view of this, I decided to endorse his candidacy."
"The Court of Auditors is an institution that inspects the European Union's receipts and expenses to verify their legality, as well as verifying good financial management."
"It operates with complete independence."
"Within this spirit, the appointment of the individuals of which it is composed must be governed by capability and independence criteria."
"So, on the Council's initiative, several individuals from various EU countries were put forward for the Court of Auditors."
"They all submitted their curricula vitae, responded to a written questionnaire, and had hearings before the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The majority of them argued their cases well enough to justify their appointment to the Court of Auditors, where they will carry out their duties capably and independently."
"in writing. - I fully endorse these recommendations."
"I think that the EU's strengthened external role should be used to enhance dialogue with key partners and to build a stronger EU."
"The EU and its Member States are significant contributors to the UN's budget."
"In order to ensure that the Union's values and interests are represented in a coherent and effective way in the UN system, it is necessary that the EU speaks with a single voice."
"The EU should play an active role in supporting the reform process of the UN system and especially, the reform of the Security Council."
"I believe that an EU seat in an enlarged Security Council should remain a goal of the European Union."
"The report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly has been adopted today, 25 March 2010, without a vote by the European Parliament."
"We would hereby like to state that we do not support the wording in the report that states that the Council should be urged to propose innovative funding mechanisms, such as an international tax on financial transactions."
"in writing. - I was in favour of the recommendation to the Council on the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which calls for strengthened EU visibility at the United Nations."
"The European Union needs to support and encourage global governance reform, particularly as regards the Security Council, whose make up does not reflect the realities of the 21st century."
"The ambition to gain an EU seat within an enlarged Security Council has to be pursued."
"If the European Union is to further multilateral approaches to global challenges, its Member States must act coherently and consistently at the UN level, particularly in light of the forthcoming review conferences for the Millennium Development Goals and the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the review of the Human Rights Council's status and working methods."
"We need to push for deeper involvement of national and transnational parliamentary assemblies in the works of the UN system, so as to strengthen its legitimacy and democratic nature."
"The Member States should make every effort to have this matter included in the Assembly's agenda."
"At a time of serious social crisis, with increased poverty and unemployment resulting from the crisis of capitalism, this 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly becomes even more important."
"There are many issues of interest at global level."
"Of particular importance is monitoring progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals as minimum targets to be hit by 2015."
"Any attempt to reduce, weaken or postpone the promises made must be fought."
"It is therefore important to attempt to reach agreement between developed and developing countries on speeding up progress."
"This must include clear and specific commitments, as the international community is a long way off honouring its commitments regarding the Millennium Development Goals."
"If appropriate measures are not taken, we could have nearly 1.5 billion workers in poverty because of unemployment or insecure and badly paid jobs."
"I would like to say I am pleased by the fact that in the text of the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU's priorities for the 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the rapporteur has included matters relating to the very important theme of cooperation between the UN and the EU in the area of crisis management."
"Very recently, the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile showed how very vulnerable people are to the suffering and harm caused by natural disasters."
"However, in the case of both countries, cooperation between the EU and the UN worked very well during rescue and assistance of the victims."
"It is my opinion that we should now concentrate on optimising this cooperation, in order to make the best use of available resources, so that we can not only rescue as many victims as possible as quickly as possible, but also enable them to survive later."
"In addition, another crucial question is assistance in maintaining order and in rebuilding a disaster-hit country."
"Despite the fact that all Member States of the EU also belong to the UN, and that the European Union has the status of permanent observer at the UN, it is difficult to develop a harmonious position shared by all EU countries."
"I am sure that on matters concerning effective cooperation during aid operations in crisis situations brought on by natural disasters, developing a common, constructive approach is a priority."
"I find it impossible to vote for this text, although I do admit that it has certain qualities."
"It is true that it promotes the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the control of all weapons."
"It is true that it promotes the abolition of capital punishment."
"However, it still promotes the use of and research into civil nuclear power, which everyone knows today must be urgently abandoned; it still supports the existence of the G20, which has no legitimacy; and it still stresses the importance of the 'principle of the responsibility to protect', the definition of which is so vague that it invites all kinds of interference with the peoples' national sovereignty."
"For all these reasons and others that I cannot list here, this text does not seem to me to be worthy of the European Union as I conceive of it."
"The forthcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly is another opportunity for the EU to present itself as the true catalyst for world peace and solidarity."
"We cannot forget that the EU is the main source of funds for the United Nations, contributing 40% of its total budget, 40% of peacekeeping costs and 12% of the troops in conflict zones."
"This is also the first General Assembly at which the EU will be represented by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"That being the case, we must assume our role as principal actors, redefining the role of the EU in the United Nations, and becoming involved in global governance and the reform of the United Nations, in peace and security, and in development and climate change."
"The report drawn up by the German Member, Mr Lambsdorff, is a very comprehensive and competent presentation of the different areas of responsibility and future objectives of the United Nations from the perspective of the European Union."
"There is no doubt that the UN and its role in the international system must be strengthened all over the world by means of appropriate reforms."
"Reform of the development cooperation system, which is covered in the report, must also be supported."
"This needs to be tackled urgently as the current development aid policy can be seen to have failed."
"Therefore, I do not understand why the report calls for the Member States to increase their contributions significantly in the run-up to the reforms."
"Development aid must be reviewed, reorganised and restructured together with the developing countries."
"The statements on climate policy, which involve a stubborn refusal to enter into discussion with the critics of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and which treat the IPCC's findings as dogma, are also problematic."
"For this reason, I abstained during the final vote."
"I recognise and fully support the United Nations' objectives of nuclear disarmament, gender mainstreaming, combating poverty, the Millennium Development Goals and the United Nations' important role in relation to promoting human rights and combating climate change."
"If I abstain from voting, it is because the report seeks to prevent individual Member States from presenting their opinions in the UN, for example, where they are more critical than the EU of various dictatorships."
"Furthermore, the report consistently links civil and military instruments, which is something that I cannot support."
"in writing. - The majority of European Roma became citizens after the 2004 and 2007 enlargements and they and their families enjoy the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the EU."
"However, in some Member States with a significant share of Roma population, the Roma are still faced with numerous problems such as segregation in education, housing, very low employment rates and unequal access to health care and public services."
"The EU and Member States share a responsibility to promote and ensure the inclusion of Roma and to uphold their fundamental rights as European citizens and to increase their efforts to achieve visible results."
"I voted for this resolution since Europe's Roma continue to suffer great discrimination and, in many cases, experience immense poverty and social isolation."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the situation of most Roma living in many EU Member States differs from the situation of other European ethnic minorities and therefore, we must take the necessary measures at EU level and establish a joint strategy to combat discrimination against Roma."
"I agree with the European Parliament's call for the new members of the Commission to give Roma matters a priority in their areas of competence and to devote the required attention to implementing the strategy on Roma inclusion."
"I would like to stress that living in a democratic and free society, we must honour the fundamental rights and freedoms of all people."
"Therefore, the Commission and the Member States must agree and find a common dialogue on the Roma situation and take measures to combat their discrimination."
"Only once we have found a common European approach on European Roma issues will the strategy be actively implemented."
"I also support Parliament's position that we should include representatives of the Roma community in the preparation process for EU policy on Roma issues."
"The European Union is currently aware of the problems faced by the Roma minority, as is also highlighted by the number of reports discussed and implemented, including substantial funding for Roma social inclusion programmes which, however, have not had the anticipated impact."
"We are talking, nevertheless, about a minority of 10-12 million people across Europe who lead their lives according to their own rules dating back hundreds of years and feel that it is natural for them to behave like this, in isolation within a majority."
"In Romania, according to some estimates, the Roma minority amounts to more than 2 million. This is larger than the Hungarian minority and, some would logically say, stronger."
"However, the Roma minority in Romania has failed to appoint its own leader to represent this group in public or in the Romanian Parliament."
"This fact may also be the reason that all the national social inclusion programmes have completely failed."
"At the moment, given that the Roma population is spreading across the territory of several European states and is known for its tendency towards migration and involvement in crime (a fact which has led to the use of the term 'gypsy' to refer to many other citizens as well), the solution to the social inclusion issue has become a Community one."
"It is likely that where Member States have failed (something which they are often criticised for), the European Union will succeed."
"The Second European Roma Summit represents a commitment to dialogue about cultural diversity and what that represents in terms of human wealth."
"Education is the key to the integration process."
"By offering education and training, we are fighting exclusion, unemployment and discrimination."
"We are also guaranteeing a society that is more fair, more creative and more dynamic."
"It is important to integrate ethnic minorities, not just into the labour market, but also into all areas of society."
"Protecting fundamental rights and creating a common area of freedom, security and justice are objectives of European integration."
"I applaud all those who promote integration at local level, including politicians, teachers and associations."
"This is because it is often these people who are responsible for access to housing, health care, education, culture and an improved quality of life."
"I call on the European Union and the Member States to promote concerted efforts, and to commit to political strategies that include clear legislative commitments and credible budgetary contributions."
"It is important to adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding policy."
"It is estimated that there are between 10 and 12 million Roma living in the EU, making up one of the largest ethnic minorities in Europe."
"The majority of these people live in conditions of extreme poverty and on the margins of society, with limited access to employment and health care."
"The members of this ethnic minority continue to suffer discrimination and social exclusion, despite efforts to integrate them."
"The EU has been supporting the Member States in their efforts to implement effective policies."
"In particular, support has been provided for specific projects, and attempts made to ensure that the laws against discrimination are correctly and effectively applied."
"In Brussels this month, there was a conference at which the various EU projects that are being undertaken were introduced."
"There must be discussion of the results in April at the Second European Roma Summit in Córdoba."
"I hope that the results of this summit can contribute to the achievement of a strong European political commitment regarding a future strategy for promoting the inclusion of the Roma people in Europe's economic, social and cultural life, and ensure equal opportunities for everyone in the EU, including the Roma."
"All the countries which have a large Roma population have policies for integrating them, but they are only implemented by sector, while other policies do not consider specific factors, making them ultimately ineffective."
"An analysis must be carried out of all the practices which have successfully achieved Roma integration, using them as a basis to finally draw up and adopt a European strategy for dealing with this group which is, as is well known, the largest minority on EU territory."
"The main emphasis must continue to be placed on education, schooling for children, vocational training, phased entry into work, women's empowerment, streamlining the social insurance system, etc. In this area too, much closer cooperation is required between the European Commission and Member State governments on funding projects through the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, as well as specific programmes which focus more on individual empowerment than on the traditional hierarchy."
"In my view, a broad information campaign aimed at the general public and Roma population, which counters the feeling of Roma exclusion from European social life and puts heavy emphasis on the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination, is a vital component in this synergy of Community actions."
"Roma communities have existed throughout Europe for many centuries and, until very recently, they were subjected to persecution by many of the Member States."
"Their traditional nomadic lifestyle, the activities in which they worked, and the high rate of endogamy and exclusion to which they were committed have all contributed to the labelling of these communities as undesirable, dangerous and antisocial."
"Even today, these prejudices persist, as do the consequences that have historically been inherent to them: even today, the Roma are one of the communities with the lowest levels of schooling and the highest rates of criminality."
"It will fall to sociologists and historians to assess the causes and consequences of the issues surrounding the Roma."
"It is demanded of politicians that they be capable of doing something for the communities that they serve."
"That is why it is particularly important to put forward ways to combat the exclusion of the Roma and to promote their genuine integration in the societies in which they live, and to take concrete measures to that end which are based on serious and detailed studies of the issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution makes reference to certain principles that must not be underestimated, such as the importance of combating discrimination against the Roma people and the need to integrate this minority by means of a global strategy."
"These are all good proposals, but they do not take into account the state of degradation in which many Roma communities in certain Member States, such as Italy, find themselves, often by choice."
"Illegal activities (thefts, bag snatching, begging, prostitution), often increasingly aggravated by the exploitation of children for such purposes, and an almost non-existent desire to integrate and to live a civilised life, are the predominant characteristics of certain Roma communities in Italy."
"The response to this critical situation ought to be the full application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens, which provides for the removal of EU citizens who, after a stay of three months in a Member State, cannot demonstrate a regular source of income and who refuse to embark on the process of integration offered by national and/or local authorities."
"Generic 'integration' is not enough."
"We need programmes to accustom Roma communities to respect the rule of law and social norms, and certain punitive measures for those who exclude themselves from this process."
"Otherwise, the legitimate call for respect for a minority is in danger of turning into a form of reverse discrimination, to the detriment of all those honest citizens who suffer the crimes and abuses of many Roma."
"Integration cannot exist without respect for the rules and the Roma minorities are not exempt from compliance with this principle."
"It is for these reasons that I abstained on the resolution, and dissented from my political group."
"The resolution on the Second European Roma Summit, which takes place in Córdoba on 8 and 9 April, expresses concern about the discrimination suffered by the Roma in education, housing, employment and equal access to health care systems and other public services, as well as the astounding low level of their political participation."
"However, Parliament has asked the Commission to draw up new proposals on the social inclusion of the Roma."
"This House is also calling on the Member States to make greater and more visible measures to respond to the Roma's legitimate rights, taking into account the fact that measures to combat discrimination are not sufficient to facilitate their social inclusion."
"Concerted efforts at Community level are necessary, including financial contributions."
"The resolution recommends that the Council adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding, reflecting the European political commitment to promote Roma inclusion."
"We hope that the Second European Roma Summit focuses on strategic policy commitments that demonstrate a political will to close the gap between Roma communities and majority populations in various countries."
"This resolution is yet another of those texts where absolute priority must be given to such and such a category of people, a category that must, of course, benefit from particular attention and be taken into account in all national and European policies."
"Today, we are talking about the 10 or 12 million Roma in the EU."
"When compared with others, examined here on other occasions, it brings us face to face with a hierarchy of people which henceforth places the Roma minority at the top, then migrants from outside Europe, then Europeans of non-European origin and, finally, right at the bottom, those of European 'origin'."
"If we then add the 'gender dimension' and the reigning cult of youth, we can conclude that in your so-called European Union, it is not great to be a man who is middle-aged, European, and of European origin and not part of any ethnic, cultural, religious or sexual minority that you care to identify as such."
"When will there finally be a policy that serves Europeans first?"
"When will priority be given to these poor workers, to these middle classes crushed by taxes, to these unemployed, and to these families who are simply European and form the vast majority of the inhabitants of the European Union and are the citizens for whom we are responsible and who you only think about on the eve of elections?"
"I supported this resolution, ahead of the Córdoba Summit on 8 April 2010, because the inclusion of Roma in all spheres of society must be one of the priorities to be defended at European level."
"In my opinion, we must not only emphasise the situation of Roma in Eastern Europe, where they suffer significant discrimination, but we must also be aware of the fact that these problems remain equally pronounced, but more insidiously so, in other European countries such as France."
"We must also question the effectiveness of the measures implemented and find out how they could be improved to truly achieve their goals of allowing socio-economic integration and achieving full European citizenship for Roma."
"I voted for the Resolution on Roma integration, based on the view that this European minority needs specific policies which must be implemented quickly."
"Although we are halfway through the decade devoted to Roma inclusion, the problems associated with education, employment, regional development, etc. persist and are even getting worse in some Member States."
"I agree that the principles need to be redefined, but I believe that we should devise instead a transversal, horizontal strategy which will tackle this minority's problems in an integrated, but not exclusive, manner."
"We are using this resolution to ask the new commissioners to give priority to the aspects of their portfolios relating to the Roma and to stop pursuing the current policy, which is long-winded, but devoid of any real action."
"We have great expectations of the summit in Córdoba, but the needs of the Roma, who are expecting results in terms of respect for their rights and anti-discrimination policies, are greater."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the adoption of the motion for a resolution submitted jointly by the six largest political groups in Parliament, in which, reiterating the previous cycle's resolution from early 2008, the European Commission is called upon again to work out an all-encompassing European strategy on the Roma, designed to remedy the social and economic exclusion suffered by the Roma in Europe."
"The motion correctly points out that anti-discriminatory measures are insufficient in themselves to promote the social integration of the Roma."
"Harmonised Community efforts resting on a secure legal foundation are needed in order to bring together all social and institutional actors and, at the same time, exert pressure on the participants to keep their own promises."
"Furthermore, it is extremely important that the resolution unequivocally takes a stand beyond 'soft law' instruments in support of binding legislative commitments and realistic budgetary contributions."
"Finally, let me express my hope that the European Commission, in accordance with Parliament's explicit instruction and the approval of the European Council, will set in motion as soon as possible the complex development programme described in the resolution."
"This can at last put an end to the perpetuation of extreme poverty afflicting the Roma from generation to generation, it can make concerted efforts simultaneously in all related policy areas, and it will be able to intervene promptly in regions struggling with serious structural deficits and which are in the process of turning into ghettoes."
"in writing. - I and my ECR Group colleagues agree with much of this report and we remain wholeheartedly supportive of providing equal rights and opportunities for all people regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation."
"However, whilst we fully support the integration of the Roma people within the European Union, we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states, such as access to health care, education, employment and housing."
"The EU is an area of solidarity and inclusion, so it must do what is required to prevent discrimination against the Roma and to give them the same rights as regards education, employment, health care and housing in all Member States, as well as states that intend to join the Union in the future."
"Decisive steps must be taken to bring an end to discrimination."
"However, if this is to be achieved, the Roma cannot exclude themselves and must help with their own integration into a European area that is intended to be inclusive."
"Many of the beggars in Western countries come from Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria and the majority of them belong to the Roma minority."
"Attempts have been made over a long period to improve the poor social situation of the Roma who live on the fringes of society in shanty towns or tent cities."
"Simply pumping money into the Roma settlements will not do any good, as past experience has shown."
"The key to success lies in education, because this is the only way of opening up long-term opportunities for living a different type of life."
"In principle, the measures for combating poverty in Eastern Europe make sense."
"However, those measures that have been put in place in the past have failed and no new, sensible approaches have been suggested."
"For this reason, I have voted against the report."
"This motion for a resolution is going in a one-sided direction by proposing subsidies and financial support for Roma people in the European Union."
"Of course, we must do everything we can to ensure that marginalised groups, such as the Roma, are better integrated into society and, in particular, into the labour market."
"However, the Roma people must show that they have the will and can make the effort themselves in order for this integration process to succeed."
"They must start by introducing their children and young people into the European school system."
"Too little emphasis is placed on these aspects in the motion for a resolution on the Roma Summit and, therefore, I have voted against it."
"Discrimination against the Roma people was, for years, one of Europe's biggest taboos."
"In recent years, this has been changing."
"Measures taken to combat discrimination against the Roma continue to be insufficient."
"This problem is often neglected."
"A very good example confirming this thesis is the lack of a reaction from the European Commission to the proposal of the European Parliament of 28 January 2008 on developing a European strategy on the Roma in cooperation with Member States."
"The need of the hour is to renew that proposal."
"For during the economic crisis, aggression directed against the Roma has increased."
"This has affected many of the 10-12 million representatives of the Roma community in the European Union."
"I think the issue of the Roma people should be made a priority by the newly appointed Commissioners, so I decided to endorse the motion for a resolution on the Second Roma Summit drawn up by fellow Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"The joint motion for a resolution adopted by Parliament, which I voted in favour of, is extremely important."
"As emphasised in paragraph 7, even though the Roma make up a pan-European community and a collective effort is therefore needed at European level, the European Commission has not thus far responded to the call made by the European Parliament on 28 January 2008 for it to formulate a European strategy for the Roma, in cooperation with the Member States, in order to enhance coordination and improve the situation of this particular community."
"Given that, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States that are competent for the smooth integration of this specific group of the population into their society - and in Greece there is a large, established Roma community - the European Parliament should - and this is the purpose of this specific motion - call for a more dynamic initiative by the Commission and the Council for better coordination of actions with the aim of fully integrating the Roma into European societies."
"I voted for the resolution in the conviction that, during the period that immediately follows, the specific measures aimed at improving the situation of the Roma population will be put into practice rather than remain fine statements."
"The European Structural Funds offer a huge opportunity for achieving the Roma population's social inclusion."
"However, the procedural and content aspects involved have, unfortunately, made it difficult to utilise this opportunity."
"When applied in Romania, it has been noted that a different approach needs to be adopted on the employment issue when the Roma segment of the population is involved, as part of the measures implemented by POSDRU (Sectoral Operational Programme for the Development of Human Resources)."
"Conventional measures involving professional retraining, consultancy and providing information to Roma beneficiaries must also take into account the specific nature of their culture."
"Although beneficiaries from rural areas are most affected, there has never been any kind of programme for the Roma communities as part of the European programmes aimed at rural development."
"The Roma are not included among the target groups favoured by such funding programmes."
"Launching programmes for developing agricultural enterprises, encouraging the setting up of livestock farms, along with a package of incentives such as subsidies for employers in this sector, are solutions to be included in the equation when it comes to integrating the Roma population into the labour market."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, since the inclusion of Roma communities is one of the priorities of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"This resolution shows Parliament's position ahead of the Second European Roma Summit, which is being held on 8 and 9 April in Córdoba under the Spanish Presidency."
"The situation of the Roma population is different from that of other minorities in the EU and their inclusion requires effective policies to curtail the systematic discrimination to which they are subjected."
"All levels of government from the EU to local authorities must be involved and play a role in achieving equal treatment for them, since that is one of the fundamental values of the EU."
"The resolution calls on European institutions to make a coordinated and strategic contribution to including Europe's Roma population."
"The Córdoba Summit must serve to take a step forward, moving from good intentions to concrete policies that allow the problems faced by these people regarding access to housing, education, public services and employment to be overcome."
"in writing. - I am really glad this resolution was adopted (I obviously voted in favour) as it includes crucial statements in terms of promoting non-discrimination against the Roma population."
"More specifically, it once again calls on the European Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe."
"I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the Second European Roma Summit as I believe that the battle against discrimination directed at the Roma, which is a pan-European community, requires a Community approach."
"We must express our concern regarding the discrimination suffered by Roma in terms of education, housing and employment, as well as equal access to the health care system and other public services."
"We condemn the recent escalation in hostility towards the Roma (Romaphobia) in a number of EU Member States, regularly displayed in the form of hate speeches and attacks against the Roma population."
"We call again on the Commission to adopt a horizontal approach to the Roma issue and to draft additional proposals aimed at implementing a coherent policy at European level on Roma social inclusion."
"With this in mind, we ask the Commission to prepare a European Roma strategy in cooperation with Member States to provide better coordination of and promote the efforts aimed at improving the situation of the Roma population."
"Furthermore, I hope that Member States will use the various instruments currently available more efficiently to combat Roma exclusion, such as allocating a maximum of 2% of ERDF resources to be used for housing for marginalised communities or the existing options as part of the ESF."
"in writing. - We are obviously in favour of Frontex exercising surveillance beyond the territorial waters of border EU states."
"There is contradictory legal advice about whether or not it already has such power."
"However, this resolution imposed rules and guidelines that would impede this function."
"In particular, they insisted not only that Frontex should rescue illegal migrants thought to be in danger at sea (a self-evidently moral action to take) but also to impose a duty to grant the rescued illegal immigrants asylum."
"We believe that such rescued illegal immigrants should be taken to the country from which they are believed to have embarked or their home country and left there."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution for reasons which go beyond the draft decision and the content of the Council proposal on supplementing the Borders Code as regards the surveillance of the sea external borders."
"Despite the fact that, especially in the second part which is not binding on the Member States, the decision refers to positive elements for defending human rights, the procedure being used to seek its ratification clearly circumvents the work and competences of the European Parliament."
"In this draft decision, the Council exceeds its executive powers."
"If the European Parliament accepts such a procedure, it will create a very negative precedent for its role and effective operation, whereas it should safeguard its control, law-making and other powers as the only elected institution at European level."
"Recently, moreover, we saw that the decisive vote by the European Parliament overturned the agreement on the transfer of personal data on European citizens to the secret services and government of the USA."
"Facilities such as this should not be set in motion."
"There is an irrefutable need to move forward with the reinforcement of border checks coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union."
"There is also a need for common operational procedures, as well as clear rules for participation in joint maritime operations - mainly search and rescue - and the disembarkation of rescued individuals."
"To this end, the Commission decided to submit a draft decision based on the comitology procedure."
"The Council was not able to overcome its divisions on the subject, preferring to hide from Parliament behind technical arguments and so doing away with our competences."
"The opinion of Parliament's Legal Service is very clear."
"The Commission exceeded its powers of implementation."
"This is not merely a technical procedure."
"According to Mrs Malmström's own words, this is an initiative with great political significance and practical implications."
"Our vote against is not only an affirmation of parliamentary prerogatives, but also an act of solidarity with small countries that are being unfairly penalised by this decision."
"in writing. - Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to 'protect' the EU's borders from so-called 'illegal' migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives."
"However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission's proposal (COM (2009)0658 final)."
"We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant's situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II."
"In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles."
"I voted against this resolution, which would have prevented the adoption of a number of measures that constitute a step in the right direction, even though I admit the situation is far from being perfect."
"This text will make it possible to bring appeals before the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning states that fail to meet their commitments in relation to the principle of non-refoulement on the high seas, whereas currently, they escape this completely. It is important that the Member States operating under the auspices of Frontex provide assistance to migrants who find themselves in distress at sea, regardless of their nationality, their status or the circumstances in which they were found."
"The motion for a resolution concerns the draft Council decision and supplements the Borders Code as regards the surveillance of the sea borders within the framework of operations coordinated by Frontex for measures to rescue people at sea."
"As far as Greece is concerned, and due to increased immigration pressures, these specific measures facilitate the presence of Frontex in Greek seas."
"To be specific, these are measures which consist both of rules and of non-binding guidelines and they focus on the reception, search and rescue of people at sea."
"In essence, these are measures which need to be taken if a ship is identified and it is suspected that there are people on board trying to evade border controls."
"Furthermore, search and rescue should be carried out on the basis of specific principles and the people arrested or rescued must be disembarked on the basis of a specific operational plan."
"That is why I believe that this specific initiative should be supported and implementation of the measures referred to in the Council proposal should be accelerated."
"in writing. - Contrary to our position (I voted in favour), the qualified majority was not reached, and so the resolution to reject the Commission proposal and follow the advice of Parliament's legal services has fallen."
"This means that the Schengen Borders Code will now be amended as proposed by the Commission under the comitology procedure, adding the annex, with non-binding measures on obligations during sea search and rescue operations, to the directive."
"We can only hope that the Commission will indeed use this as an opportunity to monitor more rigorously the operations coordinated by Frontex so we can avoid human tragedy and despair at sea."
"There is a real risk, however, with this result that we will not be able to push for binding measures in the Frontex mandate being revised right now, but of course, we cannot give up and must try our best to obtain a better result in the future work on this."
"in writing. - I and my ECR Group colleagues agree with much of this report, including improving budgetary efficiency, simplifying the application procedures for EU funds, as well as prioritising the completion of the 2020 strategy."
"However, we do have serious misgivings with regard to references to an EU social pillar, an ambitious social agenda, a harmonised immigration policy and restrictions upon an agricultural single market, and stress that areas of education and military and defence are the preserve of Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report on the priorities for Budget 2011."
"As stated in the report, specific support must be provided for entrepreneurship and for micro-enterprises, and these issues should be placed at the heart of European Union policy for youth and innovation."
"The report demands that help be provided to all the programmes and instruments which encourage entrepreneurship - particularly in rural areas - as well as providing help during the start-up phase of new businesses and encouraging information exchange among young entrepreneurs."
"Support should be given to programmes that help young people who are starting a new business."
"I welcome the emphasis this report places on youth policy and on the role young people have to play as we attempt to escape from the current economic and financial crisis."
"I strongly support the demand in the report for increased investment in young people and in education, as was recommended in the 'EU strategy for Youth'."
"The role and the importance of young people in the European Union and in the future of the Union must be recognised, encouraged and supported."
"Young people, science and innovation are at the heart of the priorities of the next European Union budget."
"Investing in young people is investing in the future."
"This investment must be carried out in a way that is coordinated between the various policies."
"Education, professional training and the transition from the educational system to the labour market are the central concerns of this budget."
"Young people with degrees and qualifications are increasingly affected by unemployment."
"That is why I consider the Erasmus First Job mobility programme to be a strategic commitment to the future, because it establishes a clear link between the education system and the labour market."
"Of the other priorities in this budget, I would pick out the areas of research, innovation and the digital agenda: these areas are essential to Europe's sustainable development."
"I would also point out the importance of some already existing programmes that are contributing to this objective, such as the European Institute of Innovation and Technology."
"This budget even concentrates efforts on supporting the development of green and innovative technologies, thus making an essential contribution to economic recovery and giving impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Commitment to young people, innovation and science is the key to making Europe a world leader once again."
"Today, the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the priorities for the 2011 budget."
"We support the general priorities and, in particular, the efforts to combat youth unemployment and to promote research, innovation and green technology."
"Likewise, the Danish Social Democrats fully support the appropriation of the necessary funds for the EU's growth and employment strategy, EU 2020."
"The Danish Social Democrats would like to emphasise, however, that the purpose of the EU's common agricultural policy must continue to be to guarantee market stabilisation and we therefore cannot support permanent subsidies from the EU for the likes of milk and dairy products."
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose today to vote in favour of the priorities for the 2011 budget."
"We largely agree with the priorities stated in the report."
"For example, we believe that it is important to invest in young people, research and innovation and in green technology."
"We also believe that it is important for the EU's new strategy for growth and employment, 'EU 2020', to be given sufficient financial resources to allow it to succeed."
"However, we would like to emphasise that we do not believe that the main task of the EU's common agricultural policy is to guarantee market stability and thus we do not want the EU to provide permanent market support for milk and dairy products."
"In a context of generalised crisis and against a backdrop of the ambitious requirements of the 2020 strategy in terms of innovation, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and economic growth and employment, it is essential to put the challenges of the 2020 strategy at the heart of the budgetary priorities."
"For that reason, I am pleased to discover a clear commitment to education, research and innovation policies in the priorities set for the 2011 budget by the Commission."
"It is also essential to keep economic recovery and emergence from the crisis in mind, so I am also pleased to see support for small and medium-sized enterprises as one of the major concerns of the 2011 budget."
"I would reiterate the need, within the framework of reforming the common agricultural policy, to step up funding for the CAP; this is a priority that must also be taken up by the Commission."
"I would point out that the 2011 budget will be the first to be adopted under the Treaty of Lisbon, with the resulting strengthening of parliamentary intervention."
"The proposed priorities for the 2011 budget, despite the social rhetoric, which is unavoidable in times of crisis, are reasonably clear: the intention is to basically keep to the same priorities that have been giving previous budgets their direction."
"Once again, indications are of a budget aimed at deepening the single market, at the lack of job security known as flexicurity, at liberalisation, and at the commercialisation of the environment and growing areas of social life."
"Although they have been grouped together under the so-called new '2020 strategy', these are old guidelines."
"The stated priority given to young people does not obscure the fact that the intention is to start planning from this point on for future generations of workers for whom unemployment will be structural, seen as a strategic variable to impose the devaluation of their labour power."
"This will oblige even the qualified to flit between insecure jobs, alternating them with the inevitable unemployment."
"These are priorities that also put the 2011 budget at the service of the EU's external interventionism; of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy; of militarism and war; of policies that criminalise immigration; of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union."
"That being the case, our only response to this report can be to vote against it."
"However, this is neither the only way nor inevitable."
"We tried to demonstrate just that with the various proposals that we tabled during the debate."
"Constructing the EU budget during a financial crisis, with a very narrow budget margin and new areas of work relating to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, is not easy."
"It therefore gave me all the more satisfaction, during the vote, to endorse Mrs Jędrzejewska's report on the 2011 budget and the motion for a European Parliament resolution, both of which provide for ambitious budget priorities for next year."
"Alongside the traditional priorities, such as cohesion policy and support for innovative and ecological technologies, the 2011 budget should concentrate on ensuring full operation of the new initiatives in the EU: the European External Action Service, the EU 2020 economic strategy and measures which are part of the Eastern Partnership."
"All three face the threat of becoming a fiasco if the funds designated for them prove to be too 'symbolic'."
"Also worthy of note is the comprehensive approach to the question of young people."
"Faced by demographic problems, the EU must not allow itself to have a low percentage of educated young people, because this would lead to a still greater rise in unemployment in that age bracket, which is something the EU simply cannot afford."
"Therefore, the European budget must have funds reserved to support language learning, intercultural dialogue, increasing the mobility of young people and integration of graduates in the job market."
"If I have understood the words of this report correctly, everything or almost everything becomes a priority, which means that there is no priority."
"Quite simply, what is being asked for is a larger budget; in other words, more taxes for Europeans."
"It is true that the rapporteur's concern to ensure that spending funded by the EU budget is not only useful but effective and that it brings genuine European added value to national policies is worthy of praise."
"However, to be quite honest, this should have been a constant concern over the years."
"On the one hand, I recall that in the last 14 or 15 years, this has not been the case, since the European Court of Auditors did not feel able to approve the execution of the annual budgets."
"On the other hand, I am still looking for concrete proposals in this report that will enable this objective to be achieved."
"In particular, I am looking for the proposals by which to put an end to programmes that are nothing but pure populism, the useless allocation of small amounts of funding, ideological propaganda and attempts to intervene more in areas in which the EU fortunately has only few powers and, above all, is ineffective."
"Although I voted in favour of this report, I would like to underline some critical reservations I have about the priorities for the 2011 budget."
"It is true that I willingly support the EU's commitment to provide assistance for young people, for innovation and for the voluntary sector, as a number of structural elements for our society."
"Even so, the financial framework is not at all adequate, in particular, in a period of economic crisis and unemployment: it does not enable us to fund any political ambition by which to instigate real change."
"EUR 9 million, or 0.07% of the budget earmarked for employment: that really does not represent substantial ambitions to support employment."
"I voted for the report on the European Commission budget as I think it is important for the EU to have a balanced, realistic budget which will effectively meet the expectations of citizens wishing to exit the current economic crisis, have well-paid jobs and a more secure future."
"I believe that financial support for SMEs must be made a priority in Europe because SMEs play a crucial role in ensuring large numbers of jobs, as well as in the development of regions and rural areas."
"I also think that young people are extremely important at the moment and in the EU's future."
"This must also be reflected in the budgetary priorities."
"Young people are at the heart of European social and inclusion strategies."
"The innovative ability of young people is a key resource for development and economic growth which the EU should rely on."
"I firmly believe that investing in young people and education means investing in the present and future, as is outlined in the EU Youth Strategy."
"I welcome the fact that the youth policy must also take into account preparation for the labour market in schools and universities."
"I shall vote against this report on priorities for the 2011 budget."
"The latter implements the dogmatic and harmful Eurocratic policies that I oppose throughout Europe and the world."
"I cannot reasonably vote for a budget that endorses so many potential disasters."
"In the wake of the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, the EU has a new opportunity to be the great catalyst of the world economy with the 2020 strategy."
"In order for this new plan to be a success, it is necessary that the various budgets that will be approved prioritise several areas that are fundamental to the success of the 2020 strategy."
"We are talking about innovation, support for young people to increase social mobility, and consolidated support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the true economic motor of countries."
"It is also essential that there be investment on a very large scale in the areas of climate change, the environment and social policy."
"In order for the 2020 strategy to be a success, therefore, it is crucial that new ways of financing and raising funds for it be found, as we cannot do what we have done in the past and reassign funds intended for the structural, cohesion or common agricultural policies."
"I voted in favour of the report on the priorities for the 2011 budget, one reason being the proposals in terms of funding the CAP."
"In particular, it notes that financing of priorities in connection with the future EU 2020 strategy through a possible reallocation of funds must not be detrimental to fundamental EU policies, such as the cohesion, structural or common agricultural policies."
"It reiterates the concern expressed during the approval of the Community budget for the current year in terms of the narrow margin for agricultural spending and supports the provision for a sufficient margin in the 2011 budget."
"A satisfactory margin for agricultural spending is especially important for dealing with unforeseen requirements in agricultural sectors, especially in light of price instability."
"I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on priorities for the 2011 budget - Section III - Commission, thereby confirming that it must be the priority of political leaders in the European Union and Member States to preserve existing jobs and create other new ones which will allow European citizens to make a decent living."
"The Communication from the Commission entitled 'Europe 2020: a European strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth' provides the basis for an extensive debate on the EU's economic and social strategy for the coming years."
"I also voted for Amendment 5, bearing in mind that unemployment is a key topic in current discussions and that, in order to be able to tackle fully the issue of the already high and ever-growing unemployment rate, the EU must implement an ambitious social agenda."
"The European Union must invest, above all, in research and in the transport and energy infrastructure in order to be able to remain competitive globally."
"Furthermore, both Member States and the EU must invest in education and the development of young people."
"This is why programmes like Erasmus, especially the Erasmus scheme for young entrepreneurs, must feature as a priority which is also reflected in the 2011 budget."
"I was pleased by the result of the vote on Mrs Jędrzejewska's report on the European Union's budget priorities for 2011."
"I did, of course, vote in favour."
"Today's vote was exceptional for two reasons."
"Firstly, it is the first budget adopted under the rules of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Secondly, it was the European Parliament which presented its proposals for priorities first, and not the Commission."
"The rapporteur very pertinently referred, in her document, to the question of young people and education."
"During a crisis, it is particularly important to support young people by, for example, helping them find their first job or set up their own business."
"The lack of sufficient reference to this matter in previous years is, today, particularly visible."
"Employment experts point out that it is not only graduates who are having difficulties in the job market, but also people in their thirties who have been in the job market for several years."
"I support this report since the circumstances in which the 2011 budget will be adopted will be exceptional due to the Treaty of Lisbon coming into force and the continuing economic and financial crisis."
"The budget will have to be accurately balanced to ensure the successful realisation of the goals set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, like the creation of a common internal energy market for example."
"In planning the budget, significant attention must also be focused on the consequences of the financial crisis, still being felt by many countries, and efforts to effectively remove these."
"The main priority must continue to be job retention and creation, which is closely linked to the need for financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises that create a large portion of jobs."
"When approving the 2011 European Parliament budget, particular attention must be paid to evaluating the European Parliament's priority - the forming of high level lawmaking - and all necessary measures must be provided for that goal."
"An appropriate solution must also be found to the question of the effective organisation of the EP's work, including the establishing of one workplace for MEPs."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon means greater powers for Parliament."
"In a globalised world, issues are increasingly complex, and decisions need to be technically sound and backed up by science."
"It is crucial that policy makers are aware of recent scientific developments, as these will allow them to make the best decisions."
"This budget introduces long-term guidelines for building policy, which could lead to reduced costs in the future."
"I call for increased training and technical support for Members, as these provide the necessary resources for Parliament to perform its duties well, with the scientific and technical backing that is so necessary in the 21st century."
"Given the increased responsibilities of many institutions under the new framework, as is the case with Parliament, it is essential that each institution's operational budget ensures that it has the material and human resources necessary for it to carry out its tasks within the institutional framework with accuracy and excellence."
"I advocate a realistic and feasible budget, but one that provides the various institutions with the material means necessary to carry out their duties."
"These considerations must not, however, jeopardise budgetary sustainability and rigorous book-keeping, which are crucial in any institution."
"Additionally, rigour and transparency must be ensured in managing the funds made available to the various institutions."
"in writing. - Planning for the 2011 budget is very important and I agree with the report's call for a carefully considered and transparent discussion."
"It is also correct in asserting that the issue of the budget threshold is a delicate one, and must take into account global costs."
"I am happy with the report's cautionary aspect."
"Approaching this with anything less than caution would be an insult to the people of my home country and of all of Europe who are facing their own budgetary concerns."
"I'd also like to take this opportunity to say that I hope our caution also shows our solidarity and fraternity with our Greek and Portuguese colleagues who are having a notably difficult time at the moment."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament new responsibilities."
"This situation means additional administrative work, with the result that Members need qualified staff to act as advisors."
"This new situation leads to two problems: increased costs arising from the need for more assistants, and additional space required in order for them to carry out their duties in good working conditions."
"This situation leads to increased costs."
"That is difficult to explain during this time of crisis, but if Parliament's work is to be excellent, it needs to have the necessary financial and human resources."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this important report."
"The guidelines are the first step in the budget procedure, giving general guidance to the Secretary-General and the Bureau of the European Parliament for the subsequent step, the preliminary draft estimates, which are currently already before the Bureau."
"The circumstances under which the 2011 budget is being adopted are exceptional and constitute a challenge at the same time."
"The successful implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon is a greater priority, while the effects of the economic crisis, which are making themselves felt in the European Union, make achieving this objective even more demanding."
"In this context, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong, continues to advocate a sustainable and rigorous budget, in which each item of expenditure is justified and in which the rigour and efficiency can be sustainably assured."
"I therefore advocate a move towards a zero-based budget, which allows efficiency and savings."
"In order to better achieve this objective, it is urgent that a long-term building policy be set."
"I agree that it is necessary to promote greater cooperation and strong dialogue at interinstitutional level in order for resources to be better used in various areas, such as translation and building policy, amongst others."
"I would stress the importance of making Parliament's legislative excellence a priority and providing this House with the means necessary to successfully carry out its legislative role."
"That is why I voted for the 2011 budget guidelines included in this report ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I voted in favour of the report on the EU agricultural product quality policy because to me, it seems extremely relevant in two areas."
"Firstly, it stresses the importance for the European Union to protect the quality of products and makes this a major priority of the European agricultural strategy."
"Secondly, it defends the principle of geographical identification and traditional specialities, presenting them as two elements contributing to European agricultural competitiveness and the preservation of cultural heritage."
"Ultimately, this report gives its support to the agricultural products of which we are so proud while, at the same time, advocating necessary administrative simplifications as regards their protection."
"I voted in favour of the report entitled 'Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow?' because quality is a decisive factor in the competitiveness of European products in international markets."
"In this context, I consider the implementation of compulsory 'place of farming' labelling positive, as it makes it possible to provide consumers with information relating to quality standards."
"I also consider how the report deals with environmental protection and animal welfare to be positive."
"It will be necessary for the common agricultural policy to commit to the increased quality of its agricultural produce, which is an undeniable value added for European competitiveness in the global market."
"Quality policy cannot be dissociated from the common agricultural policy as a whole, nor can it stand aside from such new challenges as the fight against climate change, the need to preserve biodiversity, energy supply issues, the development of bioenergies, animal welfare, and water management in agriculture."
"Consumers' growing expectations also need to be suitably incorporated in the future quality policy for agricultural products, not forgetting that quality matters to informed consumers when making choices."
"I would remind you, however, that agricultural product quality policy cannot be so demanding that it endangers small and medium-sized farmers, or the existence of traditional products that are typical of certain regions and whose manufacture cannot be subject to rules that are blindly uniform."
"The purpose of quality policy must be to give the Member States' agriculture impetus in the global market and to defend European products."
"It is there to serve producers and consumers."
"Some elements of the report under discussion are positive: for example, its support for the establishment of tools to allow the promotion and publicising of local producers, as well as traditional and artisanal products linked to specific areas and bearing a geographical name; or its recognition of how slow, cumbersome and excessively costly the procedure faced by small producers is when applying for quality certifications."
"However, it sidesteps issues that are vital to safeguard agricultural product quality and the sustainability of agricultural production in the EU: for example, the consequences of the deregulation of world trade and the unchecked liberalisation of the markets, both within the framework of bilateral agreements and within that of the World Trade Organisation; the various dangers inherent to the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment in the way that it has been done; lastly, the need for a profound reform of the common agricultural policy that supports local protection, the right to produce and the right to food sovereignty."
"I would like to congratulate the fellow Member on his report, and to say that I agree with the view that agricultural product quality policy should not be treated separately from common agricultural policy or the central ideas of the Community's policy for the next few years, such as sustainable development, biodiversity or combating climate change."
"The European Union's citizens expect high quality, healthy products manufactured using innovative technology which takes account of the environmental impact of the production process."
"I also share the rapporteur's opinion on the matter of conducting an information and educational campaign on the subject of all European agricultural product labels which are being and have been approved."
"A campaign of this kind is essential because consumers' lack of knowledge of the full meaning of the symbols puts a question mark over the entire quality policy."
"in writing. - I would like to commend my colleagues in the Agricultural Committee for this initiative report."
"The quality of our agricultural products is something that needs to be capitalised on."
"We devote a lot of time in the European Union to making sure that the highest standards in farming are met; our livestock is well treated and healthy; our produce is safe; our farming practices ethical in relation to their impact on the environment."
"Every step of the industry's chain of production is regulated, 'from farm to fork' so to speak."
"In order to make the most of the industry's unique selling point - the high quality of its output - we need further promotion as pointed out in the Scottà report."
"It is all very well to have products that are labelled according to their area of farming or according status as a traditional speciality, but unless the consumer is aware of its meaning, it is, in fact, like reading an alien language."
"So I agree that the report's recommendation for the Commission to promote awareness of this information will be an effective form of marketing."
"It will help customers and small businesses alike."
"It could be particularly beneficial to our agri-food sector."
"I strongly support the own-initiative report on agricultural product quality policy for which a vote was held on 25 March 2010."
"There is a clear link between product quality and the origin of the raw materials."
"The proposal for a 'place of farming' label will indicate where the raw materials come from."
"This seems to me to represent an important opportunity for the agriculture industry, which produces high quality agricultural products."
"Clear labelling of the origins of products not only guarantees consumers the best product quality but also enables them to make a decision on the basis of objective and transparent criteria."
"Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European agri-food producers."
"The production of high quality foods is often the only employment opportunity in many rural areas with limited production alternatives."
"Therefore, I am very much in favour of the Protected Geographical Indication and Protected Designation of Origin, together with the reintroduction of a regulated and protected designation for products from mountain regions and GMO-free areas."
"The Traditional Speciality Guaranteed and Organic Farming schemes must also be retained."
"I voted for the report because I support better protection for European products globally."
"Geographical indications give agricultural products greater credibility and a higher profile in consumers' eyes, while also providing a competitive environment for producers."
"This guarantees, at the same time, protection for the intellectual property rights for products."
"The geographical indication system is well established in the European Union and in many countries outside the EU, such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand."
"However, the EU has, unfortunately, commercial partners who do not have legislation in this area."
"For this reason, European products are not well protected within these states' national systems, with the risk of counterfeiting occurring."
"Although I am of the opinion that we should take care what we ask the Commission for in own-initiative reports, I am in favour of the report on agricultural product quality policy."
"In particular, I support the call for closer monitoring and more coordination between the Commission and the Member States so as to ensure that imported food products meet the EU's quality and food safety standards, as well as its environmental and social standards."
"In the case of fresh or processed products that have a single ingredient, the country of origin should be indicated in order to allow consumers to make conscious, well-informed decisions about what they are buying."
"I am relieved that my amendment which opposed the standardisation of Protected Designations of Origin and Protected Geographical Indications was accepted in the plenary session."
"Combining this information would have made the existing designations superfluous and would have caused significant harm to producers with Protected Designations of Origin."
"The subject of quantitative production management has been deliberately swept under the carpet in the Commission's communication."
"I am convinced that we still need production control instruments in order to guarantee stable prices for producers and give them the security to plan ahead, so that they can meet the high expectations of the consumers and the legislators."
"This applies not only to milk production, but also to wine growing in particular."
"This report has an undeniable flaw: it includes agricultural policy in the self-serving logic of the pursuit of maximum profit, which is the opposite of the notion we have of agricultural policy."
"Therefore, I absolutely cannot vote for it."
"However, in view of the improvements that it brings, I believe it is wiser for me to abstain."
"In fact, I do not want to help obstruct such anti-productivist ideas as the desire to introduce 'ecological footprint' labelling and to relocate part of agricultural production."
"I noted the intention to move away from the logic of productivism."
"I regret that these are only possibilities outlined in the text and that their actual implementation in a capitalist environment significantly reduces their impact."
"However, I do not wish to overlook the importance of promoting such concepts."
"The quality of European agricultural products constitutes a piece of heritage that is respected worldwide."
"For this reason, there is a sense of the need to protect these products and prevent their confusion with others that are of inferior quality, are less safe and are sometimes counterfeit."
"In order to prevent this, it is crucial that these products are labelled and attempts are made to ensure that consumers obtain trustworthy information relating to these products."
"In order to avoid distortions in competitiveness, it is still important that there is a full understanding that imported agricultural products satisfy the same requirements as those imposed on products produced in the EU."
"That is why I voted in favour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to European regulations that have laid down firm rules on the quality of agricultural produce, the health of citizens, environmental sustainability, and the specific characteristics of crops, we can say today with pride that European agriculture is a model without equal in the world."
"While, on the one hand, farmers who have applied the rules with a great sense of duty must be thanked, we must, on the other hand, ask ourselves why the European Union sometimes tends to become tangled up in bureaucratic knots that are liable to eclipse this excellence and to simply create a great sense of disappointment among citizens."
"Hence why, today, our citizens start their day with a good orange juice without oranges, and for lunch drink rosé wine made by mixing red and white wine fermented by adding sugar with their pizza containing mozzarella made with casein."
"With no sense of fondness, they can always resort to chocolate without cacao."
"Not even children are exempt from the consequences of the schizophrenic destruction of our high quality foodstuffs: in Europe, we run the risk of consuming spoiled products of whose provenance we are unaware; one need only mention the melamine-tainted milk from China."
"Citizens have the right to protection."
"In order to allow consumers to make informed choices, we must insist that labels be complete and comprehensive and that products for mass consumption, such as long-life sterilised or UHT cow's milk and dairy products derived exclusively from cow's milk, carry an indication of the origin of the raw milk used in production, as well as other legally required indications."
"I voted for Amendment 3 because this relates to a point in the motion for a resolution which could be interpreted as encouraging a return to standardisation of agricultural products (shape and dimensions of fruit and vegetables)."
"This report emphasises the central role played by high quality agricultural products in consumer protection."
"It also highlights support for traditional regional products and for small and medium-sized agricultural businesses."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report."
"I voted against Amendment 3, because I am in favour of the restoration of trading standards in the fruit sector."
"I consider the Commission decision to abolish them, despite the opposition of a broad majority of the Member States and the production sector in question, to be unwarranted."
"The EU rightly has the highest standards for agro-foodstuffs, for the benefit of European consumers."
"At the same time, quality policy is of strategic importance, as it is primarily on this that the added value of European agricultural goods on the global markets rests."
"However, compliance with imported products to equivalent quality specifications remains a problem."
"A catalogue needs to be made of all the private quality certification systems and a legislative framework of basic principles needs to be adopted at EU level in order to ensure that these systems operate transparently."
"I am in favour of labelling all primary agricultural products with the place of production."
"As far as geographical indications are concerned, we need to keep the three EU systems for agricultural products and food, alcoholic beverages and wine as they stand."
"Safeguarding enhanced protection for geographical indications within the framework of bilateral trade agreements and the WTO is of primary importance."
"I voted for this report as the strengthening of the quality policy at European Union level is an important incentive for European agricultural producers to step up their efforts in support of quality, food safety and respect for the environment."
"I believe that this policy can result in a significant improvement in the added value of European agri-food production as part of an increasingly globalised market."
"However, at the same time, better information must be provided to citizens through appropriate information campaigns and campaigns for promoting voluntary labels for other production methods which respect the environment and animals, such as 'integrated production', 'outdoor grazing' and 'hill farming'."
"In the vote on the Scottà report on agricultural product quality policy, Amendment 5 was accepted, which called for the mandatory labelling of the origin of foods made from only one ingredient."
"This requirement involves significantly more work and higher costs for the agriculture industry and food processors, without bringing any real added value for consumers."
"For this reason, I have voted against this amendment."
"I voted for the report on the future of food quality policy."
"Let us underline straight away a positive point in the text: the proposal to establish a European logo for organic food."
"This is both a clear demand by consumers and a requirement that must be respected in order to develop the internal market."
"I come to the important question of geographical indications and traditional specialities."
"Essential for European agriculture because of the privileged links established over time between products and regions, geographical indications and traditional specialities are closely linked to tradition and to the history of taste."
"For this reason, we must protect them."
"Consequently, I am delighted that we are opposing the merging of the two concepts of PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) as proposed by the European Commission."
"It is true that simplifying the standards may, at first sight, seem desirable in terms of reducing the bureaucratic burden, but it must not result in a reduction of the standards that our European producers have courageously imposed on themselves."
"Finally, let us not forget the work we still have to carry out to increase the protection, at international level, of geographical indications (in particular, via the WTO)."
"in writing. - I finally voted in favour of the resolution mainly because our Amendments 3 (concerning opposition to standardisation rules for fruit and vegetables) and 5 (concerning mandatory place-of-origin labelling) were adopted."
"in writing. - Whilst we are happy to see that common sense prevailed on misshapen fruit and vegetables, the British Labour MEPs still had some concerns with the Scottà report and have therefore voted against it."
"We are against any attempt to bring in an EU quality logo which would only be available to EU produce, since this would discriminate against farmers from third countries and would not be in line with our development objectives."
"The EPLP is in favour of an EU-wide organic label, but the Commission is already aware of Parliament's support for this, and other parts of the report are of sufficient importance to vote against the whole report."
"in writing. - (SV) The EU should have strong consumer protection."
"Consumers have a right to accurate and clear information on the content and origin of goods and regarding whether or not they have been genetically modified."
"Clear common rules create the conditions for a functioning market on equal terms within the EU."
"When the market is functioning correctly, informed consumers can, through their choices, drive development towards even higher food quality."
"However, I voted against the report on agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow?."
"The main reason for this is that the report violates the principle of subsidiarity."
"For example, it is not the job of the EU to create a 'European knowledge bank for old recipes and historical food preparation methods'."
"In my opinion, protected geographical indications receive too great an emphasis in the report."
"There is also a risk of setting up barriers to trade for countries outside the European Union when there is such a strong emphasis on the goods being produced within the EU."
"Origin marking is important, but, in itself, the origin is not necessarily a guarantee that the product is of high quality."
"The objective of adequate, safe and high quality food is a human requirement and demand of the workers which cannot be safeguarded within the framework of the capitalist method of production and trade in agricultural products."
"The report expresses the EU philosophy of producing foodstuffs in order to increase the profits of the food industry, not to meet the people's food requirements."
"At a time when one billion people are suffering from hunger and poverty is striking broad sections of grassroots society in the capitalist countries, the EU is using food standards as a pretext for restricting production, concentrating land in large capitalist undertakings and ousting small-scale and poor farmers from their land and agricultural production."
"The cases of food scandals that have multiplied in recent years, due to the capitalist conditions of food production being increasingly imposed by the EU and the WTO, will never be effectively addressed with administrative control measures, nor can GMOs coexist with conventional and organic foods."
"Only food sovereignty and security, the safeguarding of safe, healthy, cheap food, support for poor farmers and the establishment of production cooperatives within the framework of people power and a people's economy can meet modern grassroots requirements."
"In the vote on the report on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation, I voted for the amendment of paragraph 31, which calls for the introduction of an international levy on financial transactions."
"Indeed, I am profoundly convinced that a levy, even a small one, on these transactions of huge amounts would mean that significant sums of money could be released."
"Thus, we would be able to devote more funds to combating the ills that affect our planet and would have the funding needed to realise the Millennium Development Goals."
"This is more than a question of justice; it is a question of common sense."
"in writing. - I fully support this report."
"The global financial and economic financial crisis caused great disturbances in developed economies but it had even more profound effects on emerging and developing countries."
"The achievement of Millennium Development Goals is now at stake because the progress that has been made in those counties over the last decade has stalled."
"Financial aid alone cannot ensure economic progress in developing countries."
"Thus, the Commission should urge the reform of international development cooperation."
"Moreover, I believe that assistance to developing countries should be constantly adapted to the circumstances in those countries."
"I voted for this report, since we must help developing countries, particularly during this difficult economic period."
"In many developing countries and, above all, the least developed countries, there has been a reduction in income from exports and there has been a slowdown in the growth and development of southern regions."
"It is especially important to agree on economic partnerships to strengthen the compatibility of EU policy for the good of development and, inter alia, the promotion of suitable work, welfare and job creation and ensure the appropriate implementation of trade commitments and the application of a suitable transition period for these commitments."
"Developing countries need aid to reduce poverty and isolation, measures to contribute to development and measures essential to get out of the crisis."
"In implementing these actions, the European Union must take the lead and act decisively and, to this end, all EU institutions must make greater commitments."
"We cannot allow the crisis to halt the progress that these countries have achieved in the last decade in terms of stable economic growth and therefore I believe that the provision of greater support for development is essential."
"in writing. - We opposed this motion because it purported to place a responsibility on European countries for the plight of the undeveloped Third World, rather than placing the responsibility on those countries themselves."
"Furthermore, it looked forward with relish to the creation of various forms of political and economic world governance."
"I am voting in favour of this report, which introduces key issues about sustainable development and the gradual integration of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries into the global economy."
"It is developing countries that are the most affected by global warming, so it is essential to step up all measures to combat climate change, such as the transfer of appropriate technologies."
"It is equally important that an agreement is reached on the EU's greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme, under which at least 25% of the revenue generated from auctioning carbon dioxide emission licences will be used as aid for developing countries."
"Issues such as sustainable development and green growth must be strategic priorities for the EU."
"I call for additional funds to be earmarked for developing countries."
"These must be sustainable in the medium and long term and come from the private sector, the carbon market, and the public sector of industrialised countries or the most economically advanced developing countries."
"The economic and financial crisis that is devastating us has had disastrous effects in developing countries that had already been the victims of successive crises (food, energy, climate and financial)."
"Those who did not cause this crisis but are the most affected urgently need help."
"The European Union and the developed countries must respond quickly, firmly and effectively."
"I believe that it is crucial that the Member States meet their Official Development Assistance commitments and that they strengthen their commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"The Commission and the Council must also press ahead with the reform of international development cooperation, which is one of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness of development aid."
"I welcome the improved borrowing facilities for the poorest countries conceded by the financial institutions."
"It is not enough, however."
"I support this report's calls for a sustained increase in development aid."
"Developing countries, in particular, the poorest ones already hard hit by the 2007 food crisis, are today suffering the full force of the economic and social consequences of the international financial crisis that began in the developed countries."
"The latter are now inclined to reduce their development aid to face up to their own difficulties."
"Developing countries are thus paying twice for the mess caused by unregulated global capitalism."
"I voted for the Guerrero Salom report, which reminds Europe of its responsibilities and demands respect for the commitments made in relation to official development assistance, in particular, the goal of contributing 0.7% of GDP to this by 2015."
"By adopting it, Parliament is also calling for the implementation of an international levy on financial transactions to fund development, access to Global Public Goods and the adaptation of poor countries to the challenges of climate change."
"It supports cancelling the debt of the least developed countries."
"All of these recommendations are essential as we approach the review of the Millennium Development Goals at the United Nations in September."
"The European Union has a moral duty to implement these new tools of international solidarity without delay."
"For us Liberals, investment in developing countries is dear to our hearts."
"We welcome new ways to get funds to aid-assisted countries, but we would like to make it clear that we do not believe that a tax on international financial transactions is the solution that will enable us to meet the Millennium Development Goals or correct global imbalances."
"It is also important to point out that it will only be possible to implement such a tax if it is a global tax."
"We would instead like to emphasise the importance of the EU Member States meeting the current commitments with regard to levels of aid that have been set."
"In order to generate development and growth in developing countries, we ought to promote free trade and abolish the EU's various direct and indirect barriers to trade."
"I voted in favour of the report on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation."
"It is important to stress that developing countries, although they are not the source of the international crisis, are affected disproportionately by it."
"As the largest donor of aid to developing countries, the European Union plays an essential role in providing necessary leadership in terms of the adoption of measures at international level to enable the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"When we refer to the financial, economic and social crisis that we are currently experiencing, we are talking about a global crisis in which special attention must be given to developing countries, which have suffered the impact of this crisis both directly and indirectly."
"The existing mechanisms for helping poorer countries and their populations - which are facing conditions of extreme poverty and misery - must be applied in a way that is more effective and focused."
"They must not result in dependency, which could have negative effects on growth, salaries and employment."
"It must therefore be guaranteed that development tools and policies will allow effective development."
"This requires more coordinated action at bilateral and multilateral level."
"Action must be taken relating to humanitarian aid, cooperation and development, and in this area, the Member States, the European Union and the international organisations play an essential role."
"Nevertheless, I am opposed to the introduction of a tax on international financial transactions (Tobin tax) to help fund these countries because of the impact that it would have on society in general."
"The report under discussion tackles very important issues and makes some arguments that are correct: for example, the closing of tax havens, the cancelling of the foreign debt of certain countries, the need for increased efforts in terms of Official Development Assistance, and a tax on financial transactions."
"We must, however, point out some features of the report that are negative and even contradictory."
"One example is the argument for liberalising trade in line with the patterns that the European Union has been following, particularly through the Economic Partnership Agreements, which the EU has been seeking to impose on African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"This has been the case despite resistance and reports of their negative consequences from many of these countries, not to mention the failure to tackle the problem of foreign debt in a more far-reaching way."
"This Parliament's texts sometimes border on the absurd, but I have to say that in the case of Mr Guerrero Salom's report, you have surpassed yourself."
"I will quickly pass over the unacceptable demand for global economic and financial governance, and over the fundamental contradiction that consists in lamenting the external dependency of poor countries, while advising them to open up even more to world trade."
"I am also going to pass over the hypocritical condemnation of, and I quote, 'the concept of globalisation aiming at total deregulation and the rejection of any public governance tools', a concept that was and basically still is your own, and which you have been imposing here for years."
"Then, to crown it all, there is paragraph 26, in which you propose following the advice of George Soros!"
"He who owes his entire fortune to speculation."
"He who, in partnership with other hedge funds, bets on the collapse of the euro and speculates on the Greek debt in order to cause it."
"He who disregards the social and economic consequences of his actions so as to impose his own chosen global economic order."
"However, it is true that you also share this wish for a unified Euro-Atlantic Bloc, global governance and a global currency."
"I supported the report by my colleague, Mr Guerrero Salom, in order to remind the Member States of their responsibilities to developing countries in the face of the global challenges of the economic crisis and climate change, for which they are not responsible."
"Europe must commit itself more to achieving the Millennium Development Goals; in other words, it must devote at least 0.7% of GDP to combating poverty in developing countries by 2015."
"In order to achieve this goal, I also supported the creation of a tax on financial transactions, as well as the consideration of possible options for cancelling the debt of the poorest countries."
"Finally, access to sexual and reproductive health rights remains a priority for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and it is on this basis that I voted in favour of this report."
"This text has the merit of recommending the establishment of a moratorium on debt and the cancellation of that debt for the poorest countries, of advocating food sovereignty and of undertaking to respect the ILO."
"However, this does not compensate for the fact that it is firmly in the camp of the carbon market and green growth and that it preaches free trade and an increase in financial services."
"This text supports the implacable logic of liberal dogmatism."
"It is therefore harmful."
"I voted against."
"I voted against this report for several reasons."
"Firstly, the quick votes in plenary on what I considered key votes on amendments to paragraphs 7, 31 and 34."
"Also, the decision regarding the so-called right to sexual and reproductive health."
"Finally, the move towards establishing future European taxes to which I am utterly opposed, as I have stated on several occasions, particularly during the campaign to be elected to Parliament."
"The most serious financial and economic crisis since the 1930s has hit Europe hard."
"However, the developing countries are also suffering heavily from its effects and they are largely powerless to do anything about it."
"Irresponsible speculation, greed for quick profits which are completely unrelated to the real economy in the Anglo-Saxon countries and a financial system that is coming apart at the seams have brought the world to the brink of a financial abyss."
"Another cause of the crisis is a globalisation concept that has made complete deregulation its highest priority."
"The countries of Europe are getting themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart their economies."
"However, in many cases, it is not possible for developing countries to do this because of their poor financial situation."
"Therefore, they must be given the opportunity to protect their own national economies more effectively against imported goods which are sold at dumping prices and which destroy local markets and local people's livelihoods."
"We must give the developing countries the chance to emerge from the crisis under their own steam."
"Traditional development aid has largely failed in its purpose."
"Ultimately, we have to tackle the root of the problem and impose strict regulations on the financial markets, prevent speculative practices and quickly introduce a tax on financial transactions."
"The problem will certainly never be solved by the type of 'world government' proposed in the report, which will further disempower both people and states."
"The report of the Committee on Development on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation rightly notes that in the last two years, there has not been just one crisis, but a whole series of related crises."
"Instead of resulting in a reduction in development aid for developing countries, this situation should cause an increase."
"The common objective should be to allocate 0.56% of gross national income to development aid by 2010, and 0.7% by 2015."
"Apart from temporary aid, other measures are also needed which will change the architecture of world economic governance."
"This explains my support for the immediate fulfilment of obligations undertaken at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on the matter of a shift in the IMF quota share to emerging and developing countries of at least 5%, and an increase of at least 3% in voting power in the World Bank for developing and transition countries."
"These measures should be correlated with action to end tax havens."
"An important solution for the financial system, the introduction of which is worth considering, too, is what is known as the Tobin tax."
"Taking into account the fact that the Committee's report contains all the above-mentioned proposals, I decided to vote in favour of its adoption."
"in writing. - I am glad the report was adopted, although with a tight majority (283 votes in favour, 278 against and 15 abstentions), especially because some split votes requested by the EPP to weaken the report in certain paragraphs - taxing the banking system for global social justice, international levy on financial transaction, debt moratorium and debt cancellation - did not succeed."
"All these paragraphs were adopted by comfortable majority."
"in writing. - (SV) On 25 March, I voted against the report on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation, primarily because of the wording in paragraph 31 concerning taxing the banking system and imposing a levy on international transactions."
"Introducing a 'Tobin tax' would run the risk of undesirable side-effects which would harm the international market, which is, of course, the market in which poor countries need to be involved in order to enable their economic development on fair terms."
"In my view, it is not clear how the Tobin tax could help to prevent future financial crises without global consensus and support."
"I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation because these countries are the most affected by the economic and financial crisis."
"We note with great concern that, according to estimates, developing countries are expected to face a financial shortfall in 2010 of more than USD 300 billion and that mounting budgetary problems in the most vulnerable countries are jeopardising the operation and development of core areas such as education, health, infrastructure and social protection, with a value in excess of USD 11.5 billion."
"In addition, developing countries are also the hardest hit by the effects of climate change."
"Consequently, we are urging the Commission and Member States to support all actions aimed at combating climate change and to speed up, in this context, the transfer of suitable technologies to developing countries."
"In addition, I voted for the Member States and the Commission to devote particular attention to the promotion and protection of decent work and measures for combating gender discrimination and child labour, adhering to the recommendations made on this subject by the International Labour Organisation, whose role should be consolidated."
"The euro area has faced an economic crisis of great magnitude during the last two years."
"The cohesion of the policies applied by the ECB and consistent, yet relevant measures have ensured that the impact of the crisis has been kept to a minimum in the euro area."
"The exception to this, Greece, came about due to systemic errors compounded over time and kept hidden."
"The impact of the economic crisis has been felt significantly harder outside the EU's euro area."
"Romania is an example of this where, in spite of current appropriate economic measures, the impact of the crisis is considerable."
"The effects would have been much smaller if there was fiscal responsibility, and Romania would not have entered the first year of the crisis, 2009, with a 5.4% budget deficit at a time when, just one year before, it reported record economic growth."
"While states in the euro area have already been reporting a shift into the black for their own economies during the last six months, the first shoots of economic recovery, albeit fairly modest, are evident in Romania only now."
"However, this cannot be sustained without a drastic reduction in the budget deficit, which is required to prevent us from ending up in the same situation as Greece."
"The mechanisms for imposing penalties on Member States in the case of failure to meet the vital macro-economic indicators must be deployed without delay."
"I voted against the ECB report for 2008."
"Since 2008, the ECB has provided liquidity to merchant banks, but without setting specific and strict rules and criteria as to where this additional liquidity is to be used."
"As a result, there has been a decrease in loans granted to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers and the anticipated reduction in consumer borrowing rates has not come about."
"At the same time, the ECB has demonstrated once again that it is unable to put an end to the mockery being perpetrated by the merchant banks, which borrow from the ECB at a rate of 1% and lend to the states at much higher interest rates."
"It must be acknowledged that the independence of the central banks was not the right choice, both from the point of view of democratic and political control and from the point of view of economic efficacy."
"What we need now is not only strict regulation of the financial sector, but also a restriction on its size and importance in relation to the real economy."
"The way that the European Central Bank has introduced measures in response to the current economic, financial and social crisis has played a vital role, particularly through the measures that have allowed the Member States to maintain their liquidity, issue credit to companies and reduce interest rates, amongst other things."
"I therefore believe that exit strategies must make allowances for the genuine stability of the financial markets or suffer the return of a strengthened version of the effects that we have already experienced but whose impact has been softened by these measures."
"Furthermore, I believe that we should give some thought to adapting the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The purpose of this would be to make it more flexible and adapt it to exceptional situations such as the one we are currently experiencing."
"As we know, the decisions of the European Central Bank (ECB) are partly to blame for the crisis that we are experiencing."
"It is interesting to note that the report itself does not hold back from making some criticisms of the ECB's actions."
"This is, of course, the case when it notes that the ECB's economic projections, like those of the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions, failed to predict the severity of the downturn in 2008."
"It also does so when it 'notes that the ECB's interest rate cuts were less radical than those made by other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in the UK, and compared with what many economic observers expected at the time'."
"However, the report continues to defend the ECB and its guidelines, even making major contradictions."
"That is why we voted against it."
"Nonetheless, there are other aspects that merit reflection, specifically when it expresses its 'disappointment that the extra liquidity injected by the ECB did not sufficiently ease the credit crunch faced by industry, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, and was instead used by some banks to improve their margins and cover losses'."
"Congratulating the European Central Bank for its actions in 2008 is a forced exercise with which I refuse to be associated."
"The Bank did not see a major crisis coming, and it did not exactly shine in terms of its regulation either, which is far from being perfect."
"I do not think that any lessons have been learned from this crisis: we still trust the handful of Anglo-Saxon rating agencies that are no more capable of rating the States today than they were of rating the banks and toxic financial products yesterday."
"We continue to want to 'reassure' completely irrational markets that increase hostile speculation against a State, when we should be eliminating speculation by renouncing monetary orthodoxy."
"We are preparing for a swift return to the same policies that contributed to the crisis, in the name of the 'viability of public finances', but to the detriment of a potential recovery and of the purchasing power of households."
"Above all, we are not doing anything concrete to change the system."
"Legislation that you pretend to judge as urgent in order to fool opinion has been postponed until after the delicate election days for Mr Brown and Mrs Merkel."
"This is a mistake: their prospective replacements would be just as 'world compatible' as they are."
"in writing. - There is not much to say on this report that is not self explanatory."
"Clearly, more than any other time, there is a need for financial institutions to pause and reassess their approach."
"In the last two weeks, two former high ranking officials in Ireland's biggest bank have been arrested in dawn raids."
"This is a dramatic statement of the need for responsible and moral financial management."
"There is just one point I would like to make, and that is the greater need for transparency in our financial institutions, be it at regional, national or EU level."
"This report calls for greater transparency which I am sure the majority of MEPs will support"
"in writing. - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the work of the rapporteur Edward Scicluna."
"I particularly draw attention to the emphasis his report places on the importance of economic growth as the best means to tackle excessive deficits."
"This is a clear response to those who argue for an undue focus on short-term cuts to expenditure, which could in fact jeopardise longer-term growth."
"Deficits must be steadily reduced over the coming years, as the economy recovers from the effects of the financial crisis, but growing our way out of the crisis is the only effective option to secure long-term fiscal sustainability and protect citizens."
"I shall vote against this report, which blindly promotes the neoliberal logic that is responsible for the economic, social and environmental crisis, the consequences of which we are all suffering."
"The text proposed to us is not only extremely dogmatic, it also shows contempt for the peoples, in particular, for the Greek people."
"How can Parliament vote for a text that is so shameful that it calls into question Greece's entry into the euro area in the light of the budget deficit created by the policies that it supports?"
"Clearly, this Europe is yet another enemy of the people."
"The serious economic crisis that the entire world is suffering simultaneously is making itself felt extremely sharply in the EU."
"The response of the European Central Bank to the crisis was effective, although it was guilty at times of acting late or with a lack of assertiveness, in particular, the policy of reducing interest rates, which was more radical and effective in the United Kingdom and the US Federal Reserve."
"We must learn lessons from the mistakes made so that they can be avoided in the future."
"It should be pointed out that the Treaty of Lisbon has made the ECB an EU institution."
"This has meant an increase in Parliament's responsibility, since this House has become the institution through which the ECB is now held to account before the European public"
"Like the vast majority of this House, I voted in favour of this report."
"The subject matter was not controversial and there were no amendments during the plenary session that could subvert the report's basic content."
"The ECB Annual Report 2008 reflects the causes and circumstances of the crisis well."
"The year 2008, which saw the beginning of the acute phase of the biggest economic crisis for several decades, determined the ways in which the world economy and the European economy would develop for a long time to come."
"For the European Central Bank, the last two years were, without doubt, the most difficult period in its history."
"The ECB had to tackle a crisis which had hit the European economy severely."
"Rising budget deficits in Member States combined with growing debt are the primary macro-economic consequences of the crisis."
"In accordance with the treaty, the ECB is primarily responsible for 'price stability', which means low inflation."
"Has the ECB fulfilled its role?"
"It is hard to be sure."
"It is true that the current level of inflation is below the ceiling fixed by the ECB, but it should be pointed out that in the first months of the crisis it jumped to its highest ever level in the euro area, only to fall, suddenly, later."
"I think, however, that this instability can be explained by the surprise which the crisis caused."
"From October 2008 onwards, the ECB's monetary policy can be described as active and flexible."
"The ECB adopted a different strategy for the crisis than other leading central banks around the world."
"We are still waiting for the results of these actions."
"Europe is coming out of the crisis, but the situation is still uncertain."
"Is the ECB ready for the possibility of another crisis, a possibility which is seen by some economists?"
"in writing. - I welcome this report by my colleague, Edward Scicluna, who has presented a well-considered view and indeed worked hard to get the resolution down to just one vote."
"In this respect, there has to be much in the way of compromise and this tends to disguise the differences which also exist."
"I am particularly concerned that, at a time when questions are being asked about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of the USA, similar searching questions are missing from our debate concerning the ECB."
"Of particular concern is the relevance of micro-supervisory oversight and whether the ECB, by dint of its role in the recent crisis, is automatically qualified to be involved so directly in this endeavour or whether it will carry with it significant reputational risk."

"Ten days ago in Moscow, more people died at the hands of terrorists."
"We share the pain of the victims' families, and hope that those responsible for these attacks will be found quickly and tried."
"The European Parliament condemns and has always condemned acts of violence of this sort."
"Today marks the 70th anniversary of the issue of the order by Stalin to shoot over 20 000 Polish Army officers."
"They were prisoners of war, and were being held captive following the aggression of the USSR against Poland in September 1939."
"During the last parliamentary term, Members had the opportunity to watch the film 'Katyń', which tells the story of these events."
"Last Friday, it was broadcast for the first time on Russian public television. For the first time, the Prime Ministers of Poland and the Russian Federation are paying tribute to the victims of the crime in Katyń together, today, 7 April."
"This important step on the road to Polish-Russian reconciliation, and also on the road to reconciliation in the East, is also a signal to the whole of Europe and is the next stage of the reconciliation of the Eastern and Western parts of our continent, which we all want."

"(IT) Mr President, you have remembered the victims of the attacks in Russia."
"Only recently terrorist attacks also took place in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, countries which - like Russia - are outside the European Union."
"I think it is only right that we remember those victims too."
"You are right, Mr Speroni."
"I agree."
"With these introductory words, we in the European Parliament also refer to events of this kind which are happening throughout the world."
"We remember all victims with great pain."
"We also sympathise with the victims' families and friends, and with the countries where these things happen."
"However, this was an exceptional case, because such things have not happened in Russia itself for a long time."
"This is why I mentioned it."
"However, you are absolutely right, Mr Speroni."
"We should remember that every week, throughout the world, there are many very depressing cases of this kind."
"This is why our work in Europe, in the European Union, makes so much sense, and this is why we can be glad that it has been possible to solve many of these problems in our Europe, although we still have not solved them all."
"Thank you, Mr Speroni, for pointing this out to me. Thank you very much."
"Conclusions of the European Council meeting (25-26 March 2010) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission: Conclusions of the European Council held on 25-26 March 2010."
"President of the European Council. - Mr President, honourable Members, dear colleagues, today I report back to you on the first formal meeting of the European Council that I have had the honour to chair."
"As you know, that meeting had on its agenda our economic strategy for Europe 2020, and our strategy for global negotiations on climate change."
"That agenda was supplemented by having to deal urgently - for the second time in two months - with the situation in Greece and related questions concerning the eurozone."
"Allow me to start with the latter point."
"How, in what circumstances and by whom financial support should be provided, if needed, to the Greek Government, was the subject of much debate in the run-up to the European Council."
"Indeed, prior to our meeting, there appeared to be a wide divergence of views."
"This is really not unusual in the history of the Union, certainly when so much is at stake - the key point is that we reached agreement."
"The Union's capacity to find a compromise remains intact."
"It is fundamental to our existence."
"In the event, a large number of bilateral contacts between Member States and myself, the conclusions of the meeting of the eurozone ministers on 15 March, proposals by the Commission on loans by the Member States and intense negotiations between France and Germany helped pave the way to finding a compromise acceptable to all."
"I convened and chaired a meeting of the heads of state and government of the eurozone countries and presented to them a draft statement which, after being amended, was accepted unanimously."
"The parts of the text for which the European Council is competent were discussed and agreed by the European Council itself."
"The European Central Bank also agreed."
"In the statement, we reaffirm that all euro-area members must conduct sound policies in line with the agreed rules and should be aware of their shared responsibility for the economic and financial stability of the area."
"We fully support the efforts of the Greek Government and welcome the additional measures announced on 3 March, which are sufficient to safeguard the 2010 budgetary targets."
"Those measures were requested by the informal European Council of 11 February."
"On the basis of the mechanism of solidarity we put in place, we stand ready, should market financing prove insufficient, to step in and provide support through a European-led operation of bilateral loans from the euro area Member States, in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund."
"The mechanism respects the Treaties and meets with overall agreement of the Member States, of the Commission and of the Central Bank."
"Consequently, the Greek Government has not needed to request any financial support, though we will continue to monitor very closely the situation."
"Let me just say that the IMF participation initially gave rise to some apprehension on the basis that it could appear to be external support for a euro area unable to solve its own internal problems."
"Upon reflection, however, the view prevailed that the International Monetary Fund is, after all, financed to a significant degree by European money, so why should European countries not be able to draw upon its facilities?"
"We have set up and financed the IMF for this very purpose and it would be strange not to make use of it and its expertise."
"Close cooperation with the IMF appeared therefore to be acceptable, certainly in an operation consisting of a majority of bilateral euro-loans."
"Two further aspects of the statement have given rise to much comment."
"First, the European Council wants to draw lessons from this crisis."
"That is why it created a Task Force under my authority."
"That Task Force will be established in close cooperation with the Commission and include representatives of the Member States, the rotating presidency and the European Central Bank."
"It will present its conclusions before the end of this year."
"The European Council will take the final political decisions."
"I intend to give a high priority to this work."
"The Greek case highlighted the limitations of the current fiscal surveillance mechanism in the euro area."
"We must explore all possible ways to reinforce fiscal discipline and propose a framework for crisis resolution."
"A strengthening of our mechanisms is essential."
"What legal texts may eventually require amendment is an open question that must be explored, while remaining aware of the different procedures that would be required to amend the various legal instruments."
"The Task Force has to deal with two aspects of the problem, revealed by the recent crisis: responsibility - how to prevent such budgetary indiscipline happening again - and solidarity - how to avoid improvisation, if a financial crisis eventually happens again in a Member State."
"The Greek case has also highlighted the need to look at the issue of divergences of competitiveness inside the eurozone and the Union, on which we began a discussion that will be pursued in June and is an aspect of the eurozone economy to which we have paid insufficient attention."
"Without more economic convergence, we will jeopardise the common currency and the common market."
"This discussion is crucial."
"Budgetary discipline is not sufficient."
"Behind budgetary problems lie economic problems."
"The second item giving rise to comments was the paragraph in which we stated that 'we commit to promote a strong coordination of economic policies in Europe."
"We consider that the European Council must improve the economic governance of the European Union and we propose to increase its role in economic coordination and the definition of the European Union growth strategy.'"
"Some have commented on the fact that the French version of this statement refers to 'gouvernement économique' instead of 'governance'."
"Let me make it very clear that there is no divergence here in what we are seeking to achieve."
"We want to make full use of the European Council as the body in which we can coordinate both Union and national instruments to improve our economic performance."
"The European Council is neither the executive nor the legislative power of the Union."
"The mission of the European Council, according to the Treaty, is to give impetus and guidelines to the political direction of the Union."
"This applies also to economic policy."
"That indeed is what the bulk of the European Council meeting focused upon when we turned to examine the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Here, I can report steady progress, which we will pursue further at the June European Council."
"Based on the proposals of the European Commission - and I would like to pay tribute at this point the work of President Barroso, - we have already identified five key targets on which our efforts should focus:"
"First, bringing the employment rate up to 75%, notably through the greater participation of youth, older workers, low-skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants;"
"Second, improving the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of bringing combined public and private investment levels in this sector to 3% of GDP;"
"Third, reaffirming, and integrating into our economic strategy, the climate change targets that we have already committed to achieve by the year 2020;"
"Fourth, improving education levels, in particular by aiming to reduce school dropout rates, and by increasing the share of the population having completed tertiary or equivalent education;"
"Finally, promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty."
"More work needs to be done on these targets, in particular by developing appropriate indicators - and Member States now need to set their national targets, which will be differentiated according to national situations."
"Some of these targets are reflected in EU legislation, whilst others are not of a regulatory nature, but represent a common endeavour to be pursued through a mix of national and EU level action."
"The last two of these five targets - education and social inclusion - gave rise to some comment."
"They do, of course, represent key aspects of what has been called the 'European model' of society, where market forces are tempered by social commitment, and indeed by environmental awareness."
"However, some have pointed out that education is a national or indeed, in many states, a subnational or regional responsibility."
"That is true - and there is no intention whatsoever to change that fact."
"What it does represent is the need for all levels of government to work together on our common strategy, with each taking responsibility for their part in our common effort."
"As regards social inclusion and the reduction of poverty, some have said that this is an outcome, not a means."
"It will be the result of our efforts, not an instrument."
"Although I understand that argument, social inclusion is a competence of the Union according to the Lisbon Treaty, and it is also a key instrument for improving our overall economic performance, as well as for securing public support for what we want to achieve."
"It corresponds to the profound aspiration of peoples for fairness in our economy."
"We ignore it at our peril."
"Besides identifying these five targets - on which further work will be necessary - the European Council underlined that rapid progress is required on strengthening financial regulation and supervision, both within the Union, where the European Parliament has important work before it concerning financial regulation, and in international fora such as the G20, to ensure a level playing field at the global level."
"Progress is particularly needed on issues such as capital requirements; systemic institutions; financing instruments for crisis management; increasing transparency on derivative markets; considering specific measures in relation to sovereign credit default swaps; and implementation of internationally agreed principles for bonuses in the financial services sector."
"The Commission will shortly present a report on possible innovative sources of financing, such as a global levy on financial transactions or on banks."
"We have to find solutions so that a new financial crisis cannot happen again, but we also have to address the moral crisis that was at its root."
"The European Council went on to have a discussion on climate change and on how to refocus our efforts after Copenhagen."
"A global and comprehensive legal agreement remains the only effective way to reach the agreed objective of staying below a 2°C increase in global temperatures. We agreed to remain ambitious and constructive in the international negotiations, but we agreed also that a stepwise approach should be followed, building on the Copenhagen accord."
"The pledges made on emission reductions are insufficient to meet the crucial target of 2°C. The negotiations need a new dynamic."
"The next meeting, in Bonn, should set the road map for taking the negotiations forward."
"COP-2 in Cancun must produce concrete decisions and must address remaining gaps."
"The Union and its Member States will implement their commitment to provide EUR 2.4 billion annually over the 2010-2012 period for fast-start financing, and we remain committed to jointly mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries fight climate change."
"In this context, we had a discussion on how to address key partners in the world introduced by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative Cathy Ashton, whose pertinent analysis was well received."
"We will raise these issues not only within the United Nations process, but also in other settings in order to help build the necessary momentum."
"We will pursue internal work as well."
"We will hold a dedicated European Council debate on energy policy, and on how to shift towards an efficient, low-carbon economy, exploring all its aspects, including security of supply."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I can conclude that the European Council has made clear progress and has avoided huge and damaging pitfalls that could have set us back a long way."
"Curiously, some have suggested that my own role in this process was merely that of a spectator whilst others have accused me of being a power-grabbing dictator."
"Let me assure you that I am neither."
"The permanent President of the European Council has to be a facilitator and a builder of consensus in an institution that can only work by finding the necessary and sufficiently ambitious compromises."
"I had hoped that my start as permanent President of the European Council would have been easier."
"The two coming years will be difficult."
"I am fully aware that the worst of the recession is over, but not the problems."
"We reacted efficiently in dealing with the initial financial crisis, but it is often more difficult to stay united and act consequently once the storm is over."
"This means there can be no 'business as usual' over the coming two years."
"That will also be the case for the European Parliament."
"Mr President, President Van Rompuy, Commission Vice-President Šefčovič, the European Council was dominated by the problems in the euro area and the EU 2020 strategy that aims to put Europe back on the path of growth and jobs for our citizens."
"All the Heads of State or Government agreed to strengthen the European economic governance structure and commit themselves to much stronger coordination of economic policy in Europe."
"This seems promising."
"It could even be an historic moment in European integration, but for the time being it is mainly promising."
"The way this is fleshed out in coming months and years will be key."
"After all, as far as our citizens in the European Union are concerned, promises do not count."
"The only things that matter to our citizens are the results."
"President Van Rompuy, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I wish to compliment you on your commitment."
"You have got off to a strong start as the first permanent President of the European Council, and it is you who has the important task of further transforming the European Council into a body with actual political commitment to economic management of the European Union."
"Therefore, we are looking forward to the results from you and your task force, and we are convinced that your commitment and persistence will make you equal to the task."
"The urgency is great, and decisiveness and energy are the order of the day."
"I hereby challenge you to come and discuss the results produced by the task force in this House, too, and to enter into a debate with us in this regard."
"The scale of the task is great; that is why it is so important that you work together with the European Commission, and also with the European Parliament as the representative of the citizens of the European Union."
"We expect you both to fully respect our institutional role and to involve us actively in matters, and not only after the event but also beforehand, in the development of the proposals."
"For example, the PPE Group is looking forward to the proposals of the European Commission on greater economic coordination in terms of monetary policy."
"In this regard, our group sets store by a tightening of the budget guidelines in the Stability and Growth Pact and the strengthening of their preventive effect."
"We also expect the European Commission to play a very active role in the further development of the EU 2020 strategy."
"We challenge the Commission to make full use of the instruments given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly in assessing the efforts of the Member States."
"After all, it is abundantly clear to the PPE Group and other groups in this House that the open method of coordination should give way to binding commitments and a healthy mix of positive incentives and sanctions where necessary, and we expect you both to lose no time in coming forward with convincing proposals."
"Finally, on the subject of Greece, our group Chair, Mr Daul, has commended the Council on its decision on a new mechanism for lending Greece a hand if necessary with the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"Solidarity and responsibility rightly take centre stage in this plan."
"Yet the situation is still worrying, and so I wish to reiterate once more that solidarity works both ways."
"Greece will have to abide by its agreements by actually implementing the reform plans."
"Can Greece restore confidence on the financial markets?"
"This will be crucial to resolving the crisis."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Van Rompuy for the eagerness of his communication with Parliament, which is a good sign of his personal commitment."
"What you actually had to tell Parliament - which relates to decisions taken by the Council, not by you personally - is deeply disappointing for us."
"Let us look, primarily, at Greece."
"If you look at the comments in the media, for example in the International Herald Tribune, it is quite rightly being said that, while Greece does now have the strict conditions of the IMF, it does not have the latter's good credit."
"That is down to the Council."
"Mr Bini Smaghi - thus someone from the European Central Bank, in any case - says that from his point of view, it is more democratic to solve problems through closer collaboration in Europe than through a technocratic body such as the IMF."
"If you look at the market, you will see that it has reacted."
"I do accept that its reaction in relation to the euro was somewhat more positive, but in relation to Greece things have not got better, they have got worse."
"The message that has come from the Council is not a positive one."
"The Council is always keen to delay issues and discussions and proposals."
"It is like being on the Titanic - the ship hits the iceberg and then people say, 'OK, let us set up a task force to consider how we can prevent collisions like this in future', or 'let us have an intensive discussion about next week's menu' just after the disaster has taken place."
"That is not a solution."
"The Council must find solutions."
"It is not your fault, it is the fault of the Heads of State or Government, who are not prepared to get to work on these solutions and who are not prepared to seize upon new ideas - like those, for example, that have been put on the table by Europe's social democrats - that are based on both pillars, which is to say on stability, but also on solidarity."
"Of course, solidarity does not simply start when something has gone wrong - real friends warn each other in good time when something is going wrong."
"It is therefore also unfair to treat Greece in this way now, after having stood by and watched it for years, actually well aware that something was wrong, and to say now, after the event, 'You cannot count on our solidarity now'."
"That is why the outcome of the Council in relation to Greece is completely unsatisfactory."
"The situation with Europe 2020 is similar."
"The Commission's proposals had their downsides, but they also had their positive sides."
"We were not exactly thrilled, because we felt that several elements were missing."
"What does the Council then do to Europe 2020?"
"It tears several parts from it."
"You have just mentioned five points, but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 will mean that the economic issues, the social issues, the environmental issues will also be dealt with - is getting lost, or at least we see a risk of that happening."
"When I hear - the Vice-President confirmed this - that some Heads of State or Government are asking 'Are we supposed be working on poverty?"
"Are we supposed to be fighting poverty?' - is it not grotesque that poverty and inequality are rising in Europe today?"
"Then there are Heads of State or Government who say 'This is not a matter for us'."
"How, in that case, can you face the citizens, if social justice, specifically, is not dealt with as a key subject?"
"I therefore agree with you and the Vice-President of the Commission that we need to insist that the fight against poverty - whatever the criteria - and reducing poverty must remain our goals."
"That is really important to us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Van Rompuy, you mentioned that this was your first formal European Council meeting."
"You will have a second European Council in June."
"I wish you every success for that European Council."
"It will not be easy, given that certain elections are taking place, associated with which is a very real fear that perhaps parties will be coming into power that are even less inclined towards close cooperation in Europe."
"I wish you all the best, though, and I hope that the Heads of State or Government do not leave you hanging as they did at your first formal European Council."
"Whenever you need help and support, come to this House - in particular, come to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"We will give you hope again that Europe can still be a good thing!"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to make two remarks on last month's Council."
"The first concerns the mechanism which the Council decided on for Greece and about which I have serious doubts."
"I hope that I am wrong, but I do not think that it can work for the simple reason that it is a system of bilateral loans and not a system - a European solution - under which a single loan is made by the European Commission to Greece, which was the initial idea."
"(Applause)"
"If you look at the markets, it is very apparent at the moment that they do not believe in this system."
"This did not start yesterday, but a week ago now."
"Last Monday - one week ago - there was already an issue surrounding Greek bonds being at an interest rate of nearly 6%."
"That is 300 base points higher than the lowest interest rate in the European Union, which is 3%."
"Since there is now a discussion inside the European Union between different Member States about what the interest rate applicable to the bilateral loans should be, that even increased yesterday to 400 base points, which is 4%."
"That is not the way to help Greece."
"Greece has to take the measures which are necessary, but not with bilateral loans."
"That mechanism is not in fact helping Greece, but punishing it at the moment."
"It is absolutely necessary that the European Commission return as fast as possible to its initial idea of a European loan, issued by the European Commission."
"Then you will automatically have lower interest rates than those on the markets today, because there will be this guarantee from the European Commission and the European institutions."
"That is the only way to help the Greek Government achieve its targets."
"At the same time, the Greek Government naturally has to stop its internal struggles."
"If there are differing points of view with regard to intervention by the International Monetary Fund, and should such discussions continue, then interest rates will also automatically increase."
"My second point is that what we need now is more than merely a mechanism for Greece or other countries."
"What we need now is a courageous European Commission coming forward with a package of economic reforms and monetary reforms, and we need those as fast as possible."
"What we need now is a package of the magnitude which we had in the past from Jacques Delors, who at a certain moment came forward with a package of European economic and monetary union, or the internal market, to solve the problems."
"We need that now."
"We need a courageous package."
"Only the European Commission can do this."
"The Council cannot do it - not even the President of the Council."
"It is the Commission which has the right of initiative, and it is the Commission who must now come forward with a real package."
"(Applause)"
"My group feels that three main elements are needed in that package."
"The first is the creation of a European Monetary Fund, which is absolutely necessary and was an idea also floated by Mr Schäuble, the German Minister for Finance."
"We need that fund as fast as possible, in order to increase the effectiveness of the Stability Pact."
"The second thing we need, as soon as possible, is for the European bond market to lower interest rates for all the countries in the European Union."
"That is not a punishment for the biggest country, Germany."
"On the contrary, you can have a system in which Germany pays lower interest rates than today because we can have a liquidity premium attached to the European bond market in the future."
"The technical means to do this exist and can be made applicable."
"The third thing we need is a bolder 2020 Strategy."
"I fully support what Mrs Wortmann-Kool said a few moments ago about our needing a stronger governance method."
"It is not through the open coordination method that we will fulfil our goals."
"What we need is a method with sticks and carrots, as Mrs Wortmann-Kool put it, with not only the Member States, but also the Commission, in the driver's seat."
"Colleagues, we have to think about something: if the Council does not in the coming months do what is necessary in terms of a bolder 2020 Strategy, then what can we as the European Parliament do?"
"What we can do is: in the coming weeks Parliament has to agree to the broad economic guidelines and to give an opinion on them."
"Well, if the Council has not come forward, supported by the Commission, with a bolder 2020 Strategy, then I see no need to approve those broad economic guidelines."
"First of all, there must be a bold proposal, which I hope will be on the table in June, and then we can do our job and approve this bolder approach and the broad economic guidelines."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit, when I heard Mr Van Rompuy's speech, I asked my neighbour, Mr Lambsdorff, to pinch me, because I had the feeling that either I was not in the real world or the President of the European Council must not be."
"I say this because, in my view, the only positive that resulted from the most recent summit was the fact that an end was put to the very ignoble bickering between Paris, Berlin and Brussels - also involving the ECB - in connection with the questions of whether there would be any help granted to Greece at all, how Greece could be helped, whether there was a need for a European Monetary Fund and whether or not the IMF should be called in."
"Ultimately, the result was the horse-trading that Mr Verhofstadt has already very ably described."
"I also do not understand how you can say that what was agreed at the summit is already helping Greece, as the interest rate that Greece has to pay today - I have just checked this again - is not 6%, but 7%."
"The rate thus went up immediately after the Council's decision."
"How it is possible to pull the wool over people's eyes about European solidarity as much as clearly happened in the Council, I simply cannot understand."
"I also think that a very strange, subliminal signal was sent to Greece there, as what was described during and after the Council meeting, during and after the summit, as a safety net really is no safety net at all."
"If it were a net, it would have to bear weight."
"Yet when it comes to Greece, it was agreed that the country's situation must reach rock bottom before Brussels would be ready to actually help."
"In Germany there was a feeling, when Chancellor Merkel came back from Brussels, that she wanted to show the Greeks what it is like to be at rock bottom before she would be willing to actually help them."
"We get the impression that this is more a case of teaching a harsh lesson, but we do not get the impression that teaching harsh lessons is what could help the European Union at the moment."
"(Applause)"
"This very negative energy towards Greece goes hand in hand with the decision not to get involved in solving the problems in Greece."
"Everything that now has to happen in terms of budgetary consolidation, what areas have to be cut back in terms of public debt, how public services have to be made more efficient, how tax evasion has to be combated, how the corruption in Greece is to be tackled, is being left to the IMF, while Brussels refuses to get involved."
"This behaviour, to my mind, is not right."
"We need to be clear, one more time, what Greece actually teaches us - namely that we are being brought face to face with the weaknesses in our Treaties, and those in the Treaty of Maastricht in particular."
"If I analyse these weaknesses, I do not reach the conclusion that we should be mutually agreeing not to get involved at this point."
"Instead, I conclude that more mutual responsibility and more solidarity must be accompanied by mutual intervention."
"The time has simply come - in addition to what Mr Verhofstadt had to say about Eurobonds and the mechanisms for financial support - when we need to talk about the next reform steps."
"Mr Van Rompuy, if your task force - in Germany it is constantly referred to as an Arbeitsgruppe or working party, which sounds a little more restrained - kicks this much-needed reform into the long grass, I actually foresee nothing other than a crisis for Europe as a whole heading our way after the Greek crisis."
"It is inescapable that we must coordinate our economic policy, our tax policy, how we draw up our public budgets, how we ensure competitiveness, with each other much more and that we must assume joint responsibility."
"Yet the summit failed to secure all of this and I believe it also failed to provide rudimentary undertakings."
"When it comes to Europe 2020 - the climate - if we are to take this as the proof of success or failure, what is Connie Hedegaard actually supposed to take to Bonn in May?"
"Is she supposed to go empty-handed?"
"Does she actually have to go to Bonn with what she is being given to bring to the table?"
"It is embarrassing!"
"It is once again the time for Lady No - Chancellor Merkel - to strut her stuff."
"It is so embarrassing that the already weak socio-political goals that Mr Barroso put forward have been watered down once again by Germany, by Chancellor Merkel."
"There has thus been so much negative energy from Germany!"
"I have read that many Members found themselves wishing that they had Helmut Kohl back when this was happening."
"I have to say, I was not one of them."
"There is a somewhat different memory that I still have of the Kohl years, and then, too, Europe was not everything."
"What I would like to see is for the political knowledge in Europe's capitals that it is necessary to join forces in these days of globalisation and the global crises to finally be converted into a common policy."
"Mr Verhofstadt, I am happy to accept your call for more work on Europe 2020."
"So far, after all, three groups in this House have worked exclusively on this."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the crisis in Greece of course dominated the headlines following the European Council but the meeting itself also took important first steps in the Europe 2020 initiative."
"My group, the ECR, wants the euro area to succeed for those who choose to be its members."
"It is now vital for the European economy as a whole that any instability does not damage trade and the wider European economy."
"Of course not all our Member States have yet chosen or will ever choose to join the single currency."
"The current crisis illustrates why many, including the British Conservative Party, reject membership of the euro with the inevitable one-size-fits-all interest rate policy and exchange rates set by factors that may have nothing to do with domestic economic realities."
"Certainly the current crisis has revealed some of the underlying problems with the present design of the eurozone."
"However, in seeking to address these problems, the crisis must not be used as a pretext for extending further the powers of the European Union."
"We have already heard dangerously loose talk about the need for more European economic governance."
"Such a centralisation of power in Brussels is not the solution and would not be acceptable."
"Greece needs our support and encouragement but asking foreign taxpayers, especially in countries outside the eurozone, to pick up the bill is difficult."
"Ultimately of course only the Greeks themselves can sort out the problems of the Greek public sector debt and we wish them well in their efforts to find their way out of the crisis."
"Turning to the Europe 2020 initiative, we welcome the first tentative steps taken by the Council."
"We must never forget, as we deal with the current economic and financial crisis, that we were facing enormous economic challenges even before the crisis struck, such as the growth of China and the Far East and our increasing energy insecurity."
"Our long-term economic prospects depend upon a thorough modernisation of the European economy so that we can thrive in the increasingly competitive global marketplace."
"We do not support all aspects of the initiative."
"Some areas where innovation is required, such as agriculture, have been largely ignored, but we strongly support the broad thrust of the programme and the continued development of the single market in particular."
"We believe that successful competitive businesses are the central pillar of our economic life; they provide economic prosperity, essential to create jobs and to generate the resources on which so much else depends."
"There is a danger that, whilst we all talk about reducing burdens on business, we constantly vote here for specific items doing the opposite, so all the institutions of the European Union, including our own, must play their part."
"The Commission needs to avoid making proposals which will be a burden on industry and we in this Parliament must show responsibility and exercise self-restraint."
"Many targets set as part of Europe 2020 will be reviewed at the June meeting."
"Let me close today by expressing my hope that support in the European Council for economic freedom and reform will be substantially reinforced in the weeks ahead - I hope also, perhaps, helped by a new Conservative Government in the United Kingdom."
"Mr President, it is a good thing that the Heads of State or Government were able to agree an emergency package, but this is hardly a really European solution."
"The German Government has, for tactical electoral reasons - with regard to North Rhine-Westphalia - gone quite far down the road of populism."
"The agreement, then, was hanging by the thread of the conversation between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy."
"It is no package to cover the citizens."
"The objective of the funding mechanism is to consist, and I quote, of 'incentives for the fastest possible return by the financial market to setting high-risk prices'."
"Economic policy coordination is to be built on the failed principles of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The State and the citizens are to make savings, while the financial markets - the banks - are to evaluate whether enough savings have been made."
"I regard that as a dubious procedure."
"In the EU there is currently an unemployment rate of 10% - the highest since 1998."
"Over 20% of under-25-year-olds are out of work."
"There is a need to say very specifically where we want to make savings."
"Otherwise, I fear the worst."
"Why has the Council not agreed on an increase in the cohesion and structural funds or an immediate prohibition on trading credit derivatives?"
"Why has it postponed agreement on specific targets to combat poverty in the EU indefinitely?"
"I am not saying, incidentally, that they have done so deliberately, but to all intents and purposes the postponement will endure indefinitely."
"I consider that to be a scandal in this, the European Year for Combating Poverty."
"June this year is much too late."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, we are in the presence of a great man today - the President of Europe."
"He is a man so important that he is beyond criticism, beyond reproach; he is the king of the modern political class."
"He is the modern-day Zeus, and he intends to rule us from Mount Berlaymont - and woe betide anybody that questions his authority or questions his dignity, as they will face severe punishment!"
"Indeed, in my case, the last time we met and I had one or two things to say, Parliament imposed the maximum possible fine!"
"I am told that if I say anything which upsets you, then the microphone will be cut off."
"Well, what price free speech, what price democracy?"
"You have come back to us today and now, with the approval of Mr Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, you are the head of a new economic government for 500 million people and you have launched your 10-year plan - your wish list."
"I just wonder whether you have remembered what happened to the last 10-year plan, which was launched in 2000."
"It was launched in this Parliament to much acclaim and it was a total and utter crippling failure, even before the global recession hit."
"In fact, all centralised EU plans fail."
"Just look at the disastrous, ruinous common fisheries policy."
"Now your beloved euro has failed; it has failed politically at its first major hurdle."
"You were not able to come up with a plan at that Summit, and you cannot bail out Greece without the International Monetary Fund coming in to save, at least for the moment, your euro dream."
"And yet, Mr Van Rompuy, your plan seems to be that we are losing, we are failing, but let us have more of the same; let us have more Europe; let us have more failure!"
"What really matters is the loss of democracy."
"You have not been elected."
"You are not accountable and there is no mechanism for the peoples of Europe to remove you."
"It was Zeus who kidnapped Europa, and my fear is that you are kidnapping our democracy."
"You are only here because the Lisbon Treaty went through without the British people being given the referendum that they were promised."
"As far as we are concerned this is unfinished business."
"People fought and died so that we could be an independent self-governing democratic nation that was able to hire and fire its leaders."
"No one who believes in democracy would accept the post of President of the European Union."
"(NL) Mr President."
"Mr Farage, again you have spoken on behalf of a great many Europeans who do not like this Europe, for which I thank you."
"This debate is a big sham."
"The new bogus President Herman Van Rompuy, who was appointed in back rooms, has congratulated President Barroso and the Commission on the financial rescue of Greece."
"Of course, this again boils down to Dutch taxpayers having to dig deeply into their pockets once again."
"Let us not forget that Greece has been deceiving the countries of Europe with falsified figures for many years."
"Mr Van Rompuy, you say that you have forced Greece to take tough measures."
"Tough measures: an increase in the retirement age from 61 to 63 years?"
"Most working Europeans can only dream of such things; indeed, the Dutch Government is even looking to increase this age from 65 to 67 years."
"Greek workers are taking retirement at 63 and we have to foot the bill."
"What has happened to all the tough language of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)?"
"The Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), as represented by Mrs Wortmann-Kool: a couple of weeks ago, her party was still saying that not a cent of Dutch taxpayers' money would go to Greece."
"Fine words also from Angela Merkel: not one cent towards Greek pensions."
"Yet what are we seeing now?"
"They have changed their minds; they have buckled."
"Apparently their words were worth nothing."
"Now the Greeks, with their falsified figures, are already receiving financial support, and who is next?"
"Portugal, Spain, Hungary, you name it."
"Even the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe of Mr Verhofstadt and, indeed, of Mr van Baalen from the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is now promising soft loans to weak countries and a European Monetary Fund."
"Mr van Baalen, why are you not contradicting Mr Verhofstadt?"
"This is voter deception, pure and simple: in the elections you promised less Europe but we are only getting more."
"It is your own group that is advocating this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is not the solution to the problems but the cause."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be fairly brief."
"There are some basic truths of which I must remind you."
"The first truth - and I have heard it now and again here, but not enough for my liking - is that the problems we have to address first appeared in a country with budgetary irregularities."
"These must be corrected."
"Steps must be taken to prevent them ever occurring again."
"We must, therefore, start with the basics: budgetary orthodoxy."
"That is why we created the Stability and Growth Pact in the past."
"Some people are arguing for sanctions, penalties and a show of toughness."
"However, we had this Stability and Growth Pact, but I would point out that it was of no help to certain countries."
"The Greek Government has taken some measures, some courageous measures that I applaud."
"They were laid down in the informal Council statement of 11 February."
"We asked Greece to take some measures."
"It has taken them; it has shouldered its responsibilities."
"Now they must be carried out, and I fully understand the delicacy and difficulty of the circumstances under which the Greek Government must proceed."
"Nevertheless, they must be carried out."
"The Greek Government is convinced that the famous spreads will narrow only if the results of this entire policy of budgetary discipline are visible."
"It is convinced of that."
"The basic truth, therefore, is that we must start by tackling the very root of the problems in order to solve them; in other words, the budgetary problems of one country and of other countries."
"Secondly, the Greek Government has shown itself to be in complete agreement with the conclusions of the European Council."
"We can force people to be happy, but they were in agreement."
"I witnessed their agreement before, during and after the meeting."
"Thirdly, they have not yet asked for financial support."
"They repeated that again yesterday."
"These are the three basic truths of which I am keen to remind you."
"Next - and it is Mrs Wortmann-Kool who requested this - we will, along with the President of Parliament and others, ascertain how we can work with Parliament during the period in which the task force is operational."
"Regarding the task force, I agree with those who say that it must be ambitious."
"I do not take examples from the past."
"History never repeats itself and certainly not in the same way."
"This important task force must be very ambitious."
"We must learn every lesson there is to learn from the crisis that we have experienced."
"We must draw every consequence there is to draw from it."
"We must be far more preventative."
"We must be very preventative not just in budgetary terms, but also with regard to the economic policy implemented."
"This is not in order to take the place of national governments in implementing economic policy: in the final analysis, of course, they are the ones that are ultimately responsible!"
"However, we can be preventative in a way that does not endanger the single currency - the euro - or the common market, the internal market."
"Let us not endanger them!"
"That responsibility is incumbent on the EU."
"To each, their own responsibility."
"We must, therefore, also be more preventative in economic terms."
"I am keen to remind you - it was not mentioned during the speeches - that the problem of competitiveness is a fundamental one."
"We have more than just budgetary problems: underlying the budgetary problems, there are economic ones."
"We must tackle them because, if we do not, we will - I repeat - endanger the common market."
"We will, therefore, think about all of that."
"In that respect too we must, as I have just said, learn every possible lesson as regards coordination, supervision, and certain new mechanisms that must be put in place."
"I have heard here in this House several ideas that are altogether valid and respectable, which we must study."
"Just because I am not discussing their content, it does not mean that I have forgotten them or that the task force will forget them."
"I am keen on quite a few of the ideas that are circulating and that have emerged here this afternoon."
"We will discuss them openly in the task force."
"As I have just said, we will ascertain how we can work with Parliament in the period during which the task force is operational."
"As regards the 2020 strategy, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Commission has really grasped the essence of our European social model."
"There are economic objectives, environmental objectives and social objectives."
"The excellent concept of a socially and environmentally corrected market economy is, therefore, one of our objectives, our targets."
"We have decided on the five targets, amongst which is social inclusion; it is a competence of the European Union under the Treaty."
"We have decided on social inclusion and, amongst other things, the fight against poverty."
"I assure you that, when we discussed the five objectives on Friday morning, they were not called into question, and we will also come here in June with the quantifiable and quantified objectives for the five of them."
"I ask those who are impatient to be patient a little while longer - until June - but we will indeed reach the goal that we have outlined."
"I personally, and President Barroso - I say this out of kindness - even more so than I, have fought to include these five objectives in the European Union's programme and to keep them there."
"There have been disagreements of course, but I believe that we have convinced our colleagues - in the Ecofin Council, which I attended, in the General Affairs Council and in the European Council - that this balance between the social, the economic and the environmental should be maintained in the approach to the 2020 strategy."
"If it has not already been refined, I can assure you that it will be in June."
"There is also the whole problem of financial regulation, of which some people have rightly reminded us."
"There is a tendency to forget very quickly."
"However, we must continue to work on it. Parliament has a major role to play in terms of financial regulation."
"However, at the G20 we reached agreement on an entire programme, because there are some measures that can only be decided at global level."
"In this regard, I hope - and we will do everything to make this possible - that the EU's voice, a strong and united voice, will be heard."
"The G20 worked hard at the start of the crisis."
"It is necessary to work hard following a recession."
"The crisis is still not quite over, but the recession is over."
"However, as I said in my introductory address, it is far harder to reach agreements when things are going a little better than when we are in the midst of the storm, surrounded by problems."
"The G20, aided by its creator, the European Union, therefore has a very important programme in June in Toronto and, in the second half of the year, in South Korea."
"I really think then that we have had a European Council that has avoided the worst - and that is sometimes an objective in politics too - and which has laid the foundations for a solidarity mechanism."
"I repeat that Greece has made great budgetary efforts, is not asking for anything today and has declared itself in agreement with this mechanism."
"We have decided on an economic strategy with five objectives; not sixty, but five."
"We will implement them at national level."
"In June all the Member States have to present their plans for the coming years."
"We will assess the situation."
"I really think that we have laid the foundations for future action."
"The task force is, let us say, the embodiment of wisdom."
"How can all that be improvised?"
"To those who are impatient, I say that by the end of the year, and we do not have long to go, we have only nine months - but a great deal can be achieved in nine months, would you not agree? - we will try to have completed the ambitious task of doing everything we can to prevent the crisis that we have experienced from ever happening again."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Van Rompuy."
"Thank you for your straightforward reply to the remarks which were made."
"There were critical remarks, which we all heard."
"They are necessary in such a discussion."
"We are talking about a matter of the greatest importance."
"We are not only talking about how to get out of the crisis or how to help a country - a member of the euro area - which is in trouble, but also about how to develop in the next 10 years."
"It is, therefore, a key issue."
"On top of this there are matters relating to climate."
"So I would like to thank you once again, Mr Van Rompuy, for a quick answer to some of these matters."
"The task forces will, of course, discuss these issues systematically with the three European institutions, so that we can develop a common strategy."
"The European Parliament is fully ready for this."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I also want to react to the initial discussion."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its many excellent ideas, for its very good proposals and also for the constructive criticism we receive in this House, because it helps us further in our work."
"Both the President of the European Council and I have been very open in describing how difficult the situation was at the European Council."
"We have been very open about the differences and divergences of opinion in looking for solutions to Greece's situation and on the EU 2020 strategy, and we have both said that we might have wished for better solutions."
"However, at the same time, we have to operate in the real world, where there are very often conflicting ideas, and always have to seek compromises."
"That is what we did, and in the end we achieved the best solution we could under the circumstances."
"I do not think we are doing any of us a good service if we belittle what we have achieved, because we have a solution for Greece and we have a solution for the eurozone."
"We are in very close contact with the Greek authorities and with the international community, and if there is a need and a request from Greece, then I am sure the whole eurozone and the Commission would mobilise and come to the rescue of that country."
"So we have the mechanism, we have the means, and we are ready to use them if it comes to it."
"I would like to thank Members of Parliament for their support for the EU 2020 Strategy."
"I can only agree with the President of the European Council that we are very optimistic about the future of this strategy and about reaching a political agreement on the targets."
"This is because the leaders in the European Union know that those targets are very important for the preservation of the European way of life."
"They know that if we achieve them, then we can guarantee that Europe will in 10 years' time be one of the global leaders on the world stage, with a very competitive economy and with the strong social policies we have in Europe today."
"Therefore, the discussion we are having at this point is how to better motivate the Member States and how to better calculate the targets so they are more precise and better monitored in the future."
"I am sure that with the help of Parliament we can achieve those goals, and can achieve a positive outcome at the June European Council."
"I would also echo one particular element of President Van Rompuy's remarks, which concerns the preparation for the G20."
"We in the EU can only do so much."
"We can coordinate, and do better within our European framework."
"However, it is very clear that if we want to move out of the crisis and to live in a better world in the future, then we need global coordination, especially when it comes to such important matters as macroeconomic stability, economic policy and measures in the very sensitive financial field."
"That is exactly what the EU is planning to do, and the Commission will come forward with the appropriate proposals shortly."
"I am sure that we will have a very fruitful debate on those proposals very soon."
"Mr President, first of all I would say to those of us who would like to invent new institutions, new rules and new funds, I do not think we can solve the problems that have come from not respecting rules by creating new rules."
"We need to respect the rules we have."
"One of the big lessons to be learnt from this crisis is that we should never have allowed the deficits to emerge as we have let them do."
"Secondly, we - all of us - allowed this, because we softened the rules, and I know who was in the lead in softening them up."
"If I might be critical, I prefer ambitious reforms before ambitious ambitions."
"I think that there is a bit too much talk about ambitions and too little talk about action."
"When there is talk about action I note that the Commission and sometimes the Council talk about what Member States should do rather than what we could do together in the European Union."
"I welcome a task force, but we should not waste too much time because we know a number of the concrete actions that we should take: decrease and eliminate red tape; ensure that we invest more at European level on research and science; change the budget so that it allows for more growth and innovation; ensure that we can advance further with the knowledge economy by implementing the Services Directive and expanding the Services Directive to new areas; ensure that we have mobility in the labour market; ensure that we develop the financial markets to make them more stable, but not protectionist - because I would like to say to the Commission that creating new protectionism regarding financial markets does not help the European economy."
"If we destroy opportunities for a transatlantic capital market, it does not help Europe."
"So we know what to do."
"It would be good to have a task force but it would be even better without it."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to the introduction by the President of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission, and I have to say that I am not convinced by the conclusions."
"I am not convinced by the conclusions of the March European Council, because we are witnessing a decline, among some leading figures of European contemporary history, of the Community ideal and method."
"It is this that concerns us given what is happening in the world; rather, certain aspects concern us."
"The Greek affair is merely an illustration of what Europe ought to be, but is in reality not yet."
"Therefore, we call on the European Commission, on the Vice-President, who is standing in here for the President, and on the President of the Council, to adopt a strong political initiative, a legislative initiative: the Commission must set the agenda, and the Council must ensure that we do not trail in the wake of governments whose power and incisiveness is too often curbed by imminent electoral issues - yesterday in France and Italy, tomorrow in the United Kingdom and Germany - which paralyse the action of governments."
"Your role must be not only that of a facilitator, Mr Van Rompuy, but of a driving force behind this Europe, and we appeal to your democratic and pro-European sensibility to ensure that this new impetus will bring benefits for this Europe."
"It is no longer enough to set objectives; we need to define instruments."
"We agree on the objectives, just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy."
"What are the instruments, though?"
"Do we want to end up with a federal budget - and to call it that - which equates to at least 2% of GDP?"
"Do we want to bring into play Eurobonds, European investments and treasury bonds so that we can politically enhance this Europe, without which we will go nowhere?"
"In essence, we need to know whether we are succeeding in defining the new Europe and whether we are succeeding in defining - through a new relationship between the European political forces within and outside this Parliament - the real distinction, the real boundary that exists within today's Europe between conservatives and progressives, between those who want a more politically integrated Europe and those who, instead, want only an enlarged single market."
"Mr President, there are two key words that are devastatingly missing in the Council conclusions, and they are 'transparency' and 'courage'."
"Firstly on economic governance: if we do not have the courage and the transparency to work with the true facts, with true statistics and the truth, and act accordingly among friends within the European Union, we will end in chaos."
"We have known this for years."
"When Mr Van Rompuy says we have to learn lessons: we have learned the lessons in debates in plenary in this Chamber for years and years and years."
"What we need now is action on statistics, otherwise, in Biblical terms, we will build our decisions - our house - on sand, and we know that this is not sustainable."
"We also know that those who violated the Growth and Stability Pact are eurozone countries."
"That makes it even more urgent to be true and bold, transparent and to have courage."
"As many speakers said, we also have to move away from open coordination methods."
"It is a secret coordination method today."
"What we need are open, binding targets and carrots and sticks for states to implement what is decided."
"Then on sustainable and inclusive growth: we know that 'sustainable' should mean environmentally friendly; it should mean socially inclusive."
"Why be so afraid of growth?"
"We need economic growth and we need it spelt out in the conclusions of Europe 2020."
"On climate, this road map and this way of talking: we will end up going round in circles."
"One thing that is immediately needed is energy efficiency."
"Find the courage to put forward the proposals on energy efficiency."
"We know it creates jobs and competitiveness."
"Finally, on the role of Parliament: consulting is not enough."
"When we talk about bottlenecks, when we talk about flagship projects, we are talking about codecision and that needs much more than consulting."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy is at the podium; as leader of the Belgian delegation in the European Conservatives and Reformists I should like to welcome him to this House."
"I wish to ask something about the EU 2020 strategy."
"I agree with you that the big question over the next 10 years will be whether or not Europe can survive."
"The issue is - and this is an American saying that I have probably quoted once or twice - 'Are we at the table or are we on the menu?'"
"This applies to us all."
"I also have a specific question, therefore, regarding an idea that has been raised a number of times, namely that of a North Atlantic free trade area between the European Union, the United States and Canada."
"This is not a revolutionary idea, nor was it my idea. It was Chancellor Merkel's - from 2007, I think - and I can find no trace of it."
"It concerns the ambition of looking outwards to create open markets at a time when protectionism is rearing its ugly head."
"It is only open markets, innovation and competitiveness that can strengthen our economy, not subsidies or European Funds."
"Therefore, I would ask you to look outwards and to include this aspect, too, in the EU 2020 strategy, as that is the only thing that can save us."
"If not, we shall become the Bruges of the globalised world."
"(EL) Mr President, the value of the decision by the European Council which we are debating was seen yesterday: following a statement by an unnamed member of the Greek Government, a news agency stated that Greece did not want any involvement on the part of the International Monetary Fund."
"A new orgy of speculation, with borrowing rates hitting historic highs."
"The plan failed."
"The markets you refer to prefer the International Monetary Fund as the supervisor of Greece and other European economies."
"With this decision, you are making the International Monetary Fund the guardian of the European Union, the guardian of the eurozone."
"By deciding to involve the International Monetary Fund illegally - and which Treaty and which article makes provision for it to be involved in internal matters? - you are imposing a stricter Stability Pact at the expense of the weaker economies and weaker social groups."
"What solidarity mechanism was set up, given that a mechanism for coercion and pressure was already in the offing?"
"Apart from Greece, Spain and Portugal are taking harsh anti-grassroots measures so as to avoid the same fate and, as a result of this, poverty is increasing, unemployment is increasing, growth is slowing and the recession is getting worse."
"Social dumping has become the only competitive tool in the European Union."
"This is not the Europe of solidarity and cohesion."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic policy coordination, growth, employment, innovation, social inclusion: those are the slogans of the new 2020 strategy, that is, the one which, after the Lisbon Strategy, is supposed to guide Europe towards the end of the crisis that is weakening Europeans' spending power and spirits."
"Ten years after the first bout of Lisbon hysteria, unfortunately this is the new recipe that is in danger of turning into a slimming cure for the European economy."
"Examining the key points of the new strategy, we cannot really see any specific innovations."
"If we have not yet realised, the EU of the next decade will be the same Europe of which we are today lamenting the failure."
"The 2020 strategy is disastrous because of the disastrous modus operandi of this Europe, which wants to imitate the planning-driven dirigisme and the statism that for a long time dominated national policies and which penalised spontaneously productive forces and local entities."
"Today, in fact, Europe prizes Brussels' power and hinders the more direct and effective action of its decentralised bodies."
"Taking my cue from an opinion of the Committee of the Regions, I note that a truly innovative strategy should, above all, reverse the balance of power between the centralised and the decentralised levels."
"This is what Europe needs: real subsidiarity and real federalism."
"European history forewarned us of the following sentence: state-controlled centralism destroys wealth and social welfare when its aim is not to support the economy, but to mould its character."
"All talk aside, what the peoples, young people and small and medium-sized enterprises - in other words, 99% of Europe's productive fabric - want, is not impractical European strategies for growth, but decentralisation and freedom from the orders of the political and bureaucratic elites."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Swoboda, you talked of solidarity and about how you should not wait until a crisis breaks out before you inform good friends about a problem."
"For me, that gives rise to the question of why you did not inform your socialist friend in Greece of the problem in advance."
"Did you actually not know anything about the financial imbalance in Greece?"
"In addition, for me, the question of responsibility also quite naturally arises in this connection."
"Who is responsible for the fact that Greece has delivered inaccurate budget figures?"
"There is a need here for clarification and, above all, complete transparency."
"This is because only then can these people actually be made responsible, only then can it be guaranteed that the existing ground rules, too, will ultimately be stuck to."
"However, there is always talk of new ground rules and solutions."
"These have been on the table for some time already!"
"The problem is that, under pressure from the banks and the lobbyists, politicians have left these solutions full of as many holes as a Swiss cheese."
"That is why independence is so very important in politics."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Šefčovič, firstly, on the question of form, Mr Van Rompuy, it was customary for the President of Parliament to take the floor, but, in the minutes, in the record, there is no mention of a speech being made by him."
"Was he not invited, or is this an error in the minutes?"
"I wanted to know your thoughts."
"I also wanted to say to you again how much Parliament - or, at least, some of us - appreciate your being able to come here and prepare for the European Council meetings, instead of sending the Council, which is not a member of the European Council."
"You said that you were not a dictator; you are a democrat of distinction."
"You are not a spectator; you said, 'I am a facilitator'."
"Mr Van Rompuy, be a political actor, and come and look for political support here; we will give it to you."
"I should now like to discuss a variety of subjects, the first of which is agriculture."
"I should like to thank you, Mr Van Rompuy, for having corrected, together with the Heads of State or Government, an unfortunate omission in the European Commission document, since the latter did not mention agriculture, and you were right to add one of the European Union's main historic policies, namely agriculture, which is a factor in the well-being of the European people."
"Secondly, I do not believe that the 2020 document instils enough ambition in the European Union as a global actor, especially when it comes to international trade."
"As representatives on the international stage, we shall have to demand reciprocity for our partners."
"I am pleased that, together with President Obama, we have obtained reciprocity in relation to the EADS project for supply aircraft."
"I also suggest, Mr Van Rompuy, that you combine your political influence with that of President Buzek so that we may invite President Obama to come and address our European Parliament."
"If he cannot come, then perhaps his Vice-President, Joe Biden, can."
"I should like to conclude by proposing that we introduce, now that we have decided on European solidarity, a macroeconomic and financial information system for the public sector - at Member State and European Union level - that is certified by the Court of Auditors, so that we may have a reliable set of data at European Union level."
"I was invited to the European Council meeting to give an introductory speech, which is available on the internet - I can send it to you by e-mail as well."
"I hope it will be taken into account;"
"I presented the position of the European Parliament, of course."
"We had a discussion on the same day about the crisis in Greece and some other points."
"Generally, it was a presentation of the position of the European Parliament."
"I spoke for about 15-20 minutes on the most important points."
"You can read it; I will send it to you."
"Regarding the United States, I shall be leaving for there in two weeks' time, so it will be possible also to talk about your proposal."
"(FR) Mr President, President of the European Council, I have four comments."
"The first concerns the mandate of the working group that has been entrusted to you with regard to the excessive deficit procedure and the crisis: do not settle for that agenda because, if you do, you will overlook our needs."
"What we need today is economic governance."
"What that means, no one yet knows."
"We have been trying to find out for 10 years, but the time has come to clarify this point, and if we concentrate too much on crisis management, we will overlook the crucial debate, which is to know how, with a single currency, we can carry out intelligent joint action."
"This intelligent joint action is not just a question of responsibility or solidarity, as you said; rather, it is a question of the added value that comes from sharing a currency that does not just boil down to a monetary union, but which must also be an economic union, and where the only tool that we have had available until now - the Stability and Growth Pact - is insufficient, since it has never been a growth pact, and it is a pact that has not permitted the euro area to fulfil its potential."
"It is also a pact that has not prevented the existence of, or increase in, competitive differences among the economies of the euro area."
"No matter what reform of the Treaty you think up, no matter what reform of the Stability and Growth Pact you envisage, you will not address the problem of the competitive differences of the economies with those tools."
"New tools therefore have to be invented; this is how you must approach the mandate."
"I would add that, for years now, we have been saying that we need coordinated timetables, harmonised economic forecasts and shared diagnoses in order to decide on the economic strategies of the Member States of the euro area."
"That is the issue at stake in the debate and in the mandate that you have today."
"As regards the European Parliament's role in this whole affair, my proposal to you, and my proposal to my fellow Members here in the European Parliament, is that, in a spirit of healthy competition among institutions, we set up our own group of wise men with high-quality, expert, independent individuals who can make an important intellectual contribution to this debate, which is a critical one for the future of the euro area and, hence, of the European Union."
"Mr President, I want to address my comments to Mr Van Rompuy as one chairman to another."
"I have noted, as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market, that the one thing that is clearly absent from the targets are any targets for the Member States to complete the internal market, which should be the centre-piece of economic reform and growth."
"There are a few warm words about reducing bottlenecks, but I notice that the great flagship initiatives we heard about have been relegated almost to the bottom of Mr Van Rompuy's list."
"They have sunk almost without trace in this communiqué."
"Why are we not focusing on things that we can actually get a grip on?"
"We have a framework of rules in place."
"We are working on implementing those, which I am pleased about."
"However, I once again agree with my friend Mrs Berès: how about some competition between our institutions?"
"My committee is taking more political action on completing the internal market than anything we have seen here today or anything we have heard from the Council."
"I would invite Mr Van Rompuy to come and meet my committee and to come and talk about some of our initiatives."
"We have Mr Monti's report coming, and there will be a report from my committee."
"Let us compete together, but for heaven's sake let us get to grips with something on which we can really deliver, instead of having a whole lot of vague targets, which is what I see in this proposal."
"(EL) Mr President, the decisions by the European Council highlight once again the fact that the European Union is an imperialist, transnational union of capital."
"Approval of the guidelines for the Europe 2020 strategy and the 'alleged' Community economic support mechanism are two sides of the same coin."
"They signal a 'rally' of new, harsh, permanent, anti-grassroots measures against the working class and the grassroots class in 2010, 2011 and 2012 and so on indefinitely, regardless of the level of public debt and the deficits of the Member States of the European Union."
"All possible means are being used to reduce the price of labour and increase the degree of exploitation, in a bid to increase the profitability of capital."
"The decisions by the European Union and the bourgeois governments of its Member States move in this direction."
"The opposing positions developing within the European Union and between the European Union and other imperialist centres and unions, such as the International Monetary Fund, are connected to the escalating competition between the capital which they represent."
"The working and grassroots classes are setting their own single fighting front against the single EU strategy of capital and of the bourgeois governments of its Member States, in order to achieve radical change and satisfy the modern needs of the working, grassroots family."
"(NL) Mr President, it is stating the obvious to say that the 2020 objectives do indeed merit consideration; most of them, at least."
"If a European incentive is useful to some Member States for internal political purposes, to help them take the necessary measures, I cannot see any problem with that."
"Yet what is quite astounding, especially on the part of the Council President, is that the whole eurocracy is barely, if at all, noting that its whole former master plan and the whole Lisbon Strategy have been a complete and utter blunder - rhetoric in its purest form - and that, in fact, there is nothing to indicate that it will be any different this time round."
"On the contrary, we are hearing pleas for a rush ahead, including the establishment of a European Monetary Fund and an even more federal Europe."
"I do not think this is the path to be taking; quite the reverse."
"Allow me to remain very sceptical when it comes to the totality of European policy being placed even further into the hands of the eurocrats who have made a fine mess of it up to now."
"I should like to ask the President of the European Council to show the Dutch language rather more respect than he has done up to now."
"(EL) Mr President, it is a fact that economic union did not follow monetary union."
"However, economic union would possibly mean doing away with different political views and different political factions."
"In the present case, the decision taken on Greece in terms of the involvement of the International Monetary Fund was, of course, accepted by the Greek Government, but it raises underlying questions."
"In a way it signals the fact that the Union itself is unable to address, not the problem of Greece, but similar problems that might arise in the future."
"Mr President of the Council, I agree with you, of course, that there is a moral crisis, of that there can be no doubt."
"There is a crisis of values, which has been uncovered by the global economic crisis."
"The European Union should take appropriate steps here."
"The European Commission and the European Council should pass more general decisions in order to prevent the same thing happening again in future."
"Of course, the conclusions of the Council in terms of addressing poverty, social solidarity, the knowledge society, research, training and combating climate change are very important."
"However, we need to look at all this, especially research and competitiveness, in light of the decisions taken in 2000 and in light of the failure of the European Union as regards the Lisbon guidelines, which are obviously a failure on the part of the Member States to apply that policy."
"At the same time, on the other side of the Atlantic, and in China and Japan, the issues of research and the knowledge and information society are rapidly taking centre stage."
"In one way, I think that we have taken a step forwards."
"However, the conclusions of the task force will help us to take definitive, final and purely European decisions, because that it is the only way we can move forward and address any new international crisis."
"(NL) President Van Rompuy, you will not be surprised that both I and my whole group are very disappointed with the results the Council has produced."
"You said in your reply a little while ago that the Council is keenly aware of the balance of the Commission proposal in economic, ecological and social terms, but the results show a rather serious neglect of that balance."
"You have indeed achieved results in the areas of labour market and research and development."
"You have preached the status quo on climate policy."
"The 2020 objectives have long been accepted in this Parliament and in the various European institutions."
"In my view at least - and this is actually a real disgrace - you have failed to respect the objectives on poverty, based on the fallacy that further consideration is needed."
"You have tended to gloss over the disagreement that undoubtedly surrounds this social objective in the Council."
"I think this is most lamentable, and indeed it is a slap in the face for the 80 million poor in the European Union."
"To your credit, you have always played your role with both modesty and ambition."
"Modesty in that you are absolutely not presumptuous in the role of President of the European Council, and ambition in that you say your role mainly consists in developing a long-term strategy and rolling that out over the coming years."
"Well, this will be your test: the EU 2020 strategy and the objectives in all those possible areas."
"You have your resit in June."
"You have our support, but this strategy does need to contain clear objectives on poverty."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Van Rompuy, I have two preliminary remarks to make."
"First of all, as an Austrian MEP, I would like to offer my truly heartfelt thanks for the fact that you paid a visit to Austria over the last two days and also engaged with the national parliamentarians, who have already had the opportunity to discuss this project."
"Secondly, I would like to offer Mr Reul's excuses."
"This was his speaking time, but he had to go to committee, as we had several jobs to do at the same time."
"When it comes to today's debate, first of all I want to say to the Council, yes, a solution was reached at this Council."
"Yet the Heads of State or Government lacked the courage to opt for a purely European solution."
"With such a solution, we would not have needed to involve the IMF."
"The criteria when it comes to money are clear."
"Yet we - Europe - must take action ourselves if we have problems within the European Union."
"We need more European solutions."
"My second point concerns Europe 2020."
"Europe 2020 is not an objective."
"It must be an instrument to achieve our objectives, including as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis."
"This Europe 2020 lacks the projects, the clear instruments and, at the moment, the political will to have these objectives become reality."
"My third point, Mr Van Rompuy, is that the Treaty of Lisbon is not enough, and that more intergovernmental collaboration is needed."
"However, we do not want intergovernmental collaboration based around President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel, without the European Parliament and without the citizens."
"What we have achieved with the Treaty of Lisbon must not be brushed aside, even when tackling future issues."
"Othmar Karas is, of course, from Austria, but he was talking on behalf of Herbert Reul."
"(ES) Mr President, President of the European Council, I have two messages: one of concern, and one of demanding encouragement for the work that lies ahead."
"Concern over the inadequate nature of the response and that it be genuinely European in scale; concern about the involvement of the International Monetary Fund and the recourse to bilateral loans."
"Concern that the response has not been effective enough, with the short-term effect that the Greek debt has increased."
"Also, however, concern for the lack of understanding of the fundamental problem, which we here in Parliament have underlined."
"Moreover, the Greek problem is a problem for the euro area and, by extension, the entire European Union: the deficit and, consequently, the debt have rocketed as a consequence of the financial rescue plans, which have been extremely expensive."
"Therefore, austerity must not put at risk either the investment necessary for economic recovery or the financing of essential reforms."
"That is why the second message is of demanding encouragement: because the essential reforms must go hand in hand with a strategy whose importance must not, clearly, diminish in the eyes of Europeans."
"Let us, therefore, place the emphasis on renewing the European model that is so important to us: education, yes, and the knowledge society."
"In addition, however, a commitment to high-quality employment and, above all, egalitarian employment that will better prepare us to face the future, without neglecting the fight against poverty."
"That is why I am calling on you, Mr President of the European Council, to make a commitment that the Council and the Commission will be ambitious in the 2020 strategy - in which this House must also be involved - and measure up to their responsibilities, because it is clear, whatever the case, that Parliament will measure up to its responsibility to the European public, which looks to us."
"Mr President, we cannot anticipate crises and nor will we be able to prevent another one from happening in the future."
"We are in pretty good company on this, if that is any consolation."
"However, our punishment should be to learn the lessons that the crisis has given and to use all the opportunities it has generated."
"For this we - the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council - have no other choice but to work hand in hand and to convert those lessons into the wise, smart and truly European policies that citizens need."
"I am convinced we do not have the luxury of being patient, and a sense of urgency should be with us all the time."
"There is a high risk that the financial and real economic crisis might turn into a public-debt crisis."
"That is why there is nothing more urgent today than to find a new source of economic, social and political energy to start growing in a sustainable way."
"The new Treaty makes it clear where that energy should come from: Europe is much more than the European institutions and national governments."
"Its tasks are shared between the European, national, regional and local levels of governance, and I believe that we can re-energise Europe by taking seriously its multi-level governance system to provide EU 2020 delivery mechanisms."
"The regional and local levels of European governance are important co-owners of Europe's future."
"They are capable of harnessing not only the growing number of policy tools which they have at their disposal, but also the enthusiasm of all the partners which Europe needs: business, academia and civil society."
"They are also able to translate common European goals into their own territorial growth and job strategies."
"Europe will only be able to do its job if we truly understand that European tasks and responsibilities must be shared in a well-orchestrated way between European, national, regional and local levels of governance."
"Engaging local and regional Europe into the pursuit of common European objectives within the EU 2020 framework enlarges Europe's potential and our chances for growth."
"(EL) Mr President, a fortnight ago, the Heads of State or Government decided to set up a new European solidarity mechanism to support economies with serious economic difficulties, such as Greece, and to safeguard the stability of the eurozone."
"This was, without doubt, an important decision which we hoped, and we still hope, will put an end to the image of fragmentation and cacophony which has prevailed in the Union recently, with the painful consequences for the cost of borrowing to Greece and for the stability and cohesion of the eurozone as a whole which we are all familiar with."
"However, over and above the uncontested political significance of the decision, speculative attacks have, unfortunately, continued - and even increased - over the last 24 hours, fed by certain ambiguities surrounding the support mechanism - which, Mr President of the Council, must be cleared up post-haste - and by rumours of unknown origin and purpose, of which various versions are circulating, the most recent version, which appeared in Greece the other day, being that there has been a call for the agreement of 25 March to be renegotiated."
"As you know, the Greek Government has denied these rumours."
"However, you too should expressly and categorically state here in this House if the question of renegotiation of the agreement of 25 March has been raised by the Greek side over the past two weeks."
"You must also have the will and strength to ask those Heads of State or Government who had the key roles and final word in formatting the final agreement to respect the letter and spirit of it, instead of making unfortunate statements about the rate of borrowing which will be imposed on Greece if it asks - which it has not done and does not intend to do - for the support mechanism to be activated."
"(ES) Mr President, I am going to try to say two new things on the subjects with which the European Council has been dealing: the 2020 strategy and the regulation of the financial markets."
"As regards the 2020 strategy, all of us here have been saying for quite some time that one of the reasons for the relative failure of the Lisbon Strategy was that there were not enough tools to oblige Member States to honour their commitments."
"Now the Commission and the European Council are coming to us with a proposal that is more of the same: a weak agreement that makes reference to Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty."
"The President-in-Office of the Council began the Spanish Presidency by saying that he was aware of this weakness and that he wanted more: that he wanted to strengthen economic governance."
"I ask you now, Mr President of the European Council: 'Where are the courtly gallantries?"
"The deeds of love and high emprise, In battle done?'"
"What has happened to these intentions?"
"As regards financial regulation, I have one piece of bad news and two of good news."
"The bad news is that the Council has decided to delay the regulation of alternative investment funds - known as casino capitalism - at precisely the time when these funds have been partly responsible for the speculation on the Greek economy."
"The first piece of good news is that the 2020 strategy talks about obliging financial institutions to put money aside to pay for some of the plates they smash; or, as President Obama would put it, to avoid Main Street having to pay for the damage caused by Wall Street."
"The second is that for the first time the Council is singling out the systemic institutions to which it wishes to pay particular attention."
"These two things feature in the reports that Parliament is currently debating."
"They do not feature in the agreement that the Council reached in December."
"I would like to see the Council taking these two ideas up again, because then we will be much closer to playing ball."
"Believe me, Mr President, I am really keen to play ball with the Council that you are chairing."
"(HU) I would like to make two remarks."
"The first may appear to be technical in nature, but in fact is more than that, and the second point goes to the substance of the matter."
"I see from the review that the employment directives are an integral part of the 2020 strategy, which the Council is seeking to adopt in June."
"This seems patently impossible, however, since we have not even received the draft text."
"They promised it will be ready by the end of April."
"Even at the pace of a forced march, Parliament will not be able to render its opinion until September at the earliest."
"How could a June adoption be possible?"
"Or - a different question - how will Parliament's stance be taken into account in that case?"
"So, although we are ready to cooperate here and would like to work together, for that to happen, the rules that are binding on Parliament also need to be taken into consideration."
"As regards the substantive parts, it is to be welcomed that the Council seeks to promulgate the directives on employment and the economy in a closer reciprocal relationship, but as I say, if this is to happen, we should be able to start working with the Council."
"In any event, the ideas seem too general for the moment."
"The 75% employment level is nice enough, as are the '20/20/20' targets with regard to climate change, and the 10% and 40% objective regarding education, but how, with what and from what will these targets be met, and what about supervision, what will happen to those who do not meet these targets, and what about those who meet them only on paper, in other words, who do not submit accurate figures?"
"We have experienced such things with regard to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Finally, I wish to express my delight that the cohesion policy will at last be put forward as well, as an important area linked to the 2020 strategy."
"I would have one suggestion in this regard, however: in any event, quantitative objectives ought to be set - as this was indicated in relation to the fight against poverty - and some sort of index should be developed in order to enable us to track progress or, for that matter, delays."
"(GA) Mr President, there is much that I would like to say on this subject but I do not have the time."
"Therefore I will speak about the moral crisis."
"Mr Van Rompuy said that the Council discussed the moral crisis, but he did not elaborate;"
"I would like him to so do."
"As an example, in my own country the Anglo-Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide have played financial ping-pong so that auditors could not discover the true state of their finances."
"What has happened?"
"The CEO of Irish Nationwide has ridden off into the sunset with millions in his back pocket while taxpayers have had their wages reduced dramatically."
"Two weeks ago the management of the Anglo-Irish Bank got an increase in wages while taxpayers had EUR 40 billion and growing added to their bill over the next number of years."
"Unless the perpetrators of these bad deeds are brought to heel, both individually and institutionally, not only will history repeat itself, Mr Van Rompuy, but it will repeat itself in exactly the same way as it occurred in the first place."
"(GA) I would like him to speak a little about this crisis."
"(EL) Mr President, many people are saying that it is not Greece, it is not the eurozone, it is the European Union that will ultimately be judged on these developments in times to come."
"Following the Council decision in March, no European country is at risk of bankruptcy."
"However, I agree with my fellow Members who proposed more standard institutional instruments, not only to address and prevent the bankruptcy of countries, but also to protect the Member States from the repercussions of occasional crises."
"Greece is not asking for help, it is taking measures: the deficit has been reduced by 4% thanks to harsh measures which the people of Greece are heroically enduring, because they want to change the situation in Greece once and for all."
"By May, the Greek Parliament will have approved radical changes in taxation, insurance and the labour market."
"We should not be surprised if Greece emerges from this crisis stronger and free from the debts of the past."
"But who knows what battle awaits Europe?"
"(RO) Unfortunately, a huge number of us are unaware that a new spectre is looming over Europe, namely, that of populism."
"We forget that, as a form of political governance, this may be one of the causes of the moral crisis which we are all talking about, underlying the economic crisis."
"However, this is about us and the political parties we belong to."
"President Van Rompuy, you spoke about budgetary discipline."
"Judging from the past, having too many rules can frequently cause shortcomings just as much as having too few rules."
"I believe that we could be much more flexible and could review the Stability Pact, because we do not have a vision of the future European model."
"It fails to take account of the reality and demographic situation which we are facing and about which we have heard no mention in the EU 2020 agenda."
"I believe that this matter will have to give us some food for thought because we should not allow a new design for the European social model to fail like the Lisbon Agenda has done."
"A second failure will deal a crushing blow to cohesion and inclusion in the European Union."
"Mr President, my French is not very good - pardonnez-moi - but I do understand that the French word 'gouvernement' means government in English."
"I thought that was easy to understand."
"However, it does not seem to be easy for the British Labour Government or for President Van Rompuy."
"They seem to think it means governance, which is defined as the action or manner of governing."
"That is just dissembling, since the reality is that the EU Council's agreement to improve economic EU gouvernement means the action of ruling and directing the affairs of a state."
"The truth, then, is that the Council has handed yet more powers over to the EU, including powers over the UK economy, which is the single most important issue to the British people today."
"When will people be told the truth?"
"We are heading for an EU superstate, and Britain will have to pay to rescue those in the euro area - even though it is not, thankfully, a member of the euro itself."
"(DE) Mr President, the Europe 2020 strategy has ambitious goals and specific figures."
"Apart from the fact that we were a long way from achieving these goals even with the Lisbon Strategy - for example in the research and development rate - the question must be raised of whether many of these goals make sense."
"The Europe 2020 strategy, for example, aims to increase the number of academics considerably."
"Clearly we do need highly qualified human resources, but experts are observing that what is needed is well-trained specialists, not an explosion in numbers of university graduates who then can hardly find a job, or who can only find an inappropriate one."
"There is considerable contradiction within the specifications of goals."
"On the one hand, the budget is to be consolidated, whilst, on the other hand, there is to be massive investment."
"It will be an interesting balancing act to see how this will be resolved."
"When it comes to the regions, studies have clearly shown that the Treaty of Lisbon and the Lisbon Strategy were successful where the regions were systematically involved and not where a centralised approach was taken."
"This will also be an important point to note when implementing Europe 2020."
"Mr President, two matters: first, accountability, which is vital to solve this situation in Greece."
"The Commission needs to clarify the flow of information with Greece."
"The Commission must report to Parliament in detail about the macroeconomic information received from Greece, as well as the methodology applied and the exact time when the Commission was provided with each category of information and statistical data."
"The Comission must clearly indicate where institutional and personal responsibility rests."
"Someone is accountable and must be made accountable."
"This is an issue which is different from supporting Greece."
"Secondly, as recognised by the Greek Prime Minister and emphasised by the public perception recorded in Eurobarometer in 2009, corruption was a key factor leading to Greece's economic situation."
"It is time for the Commission to put in place an anti-corruption policy for all Member States and also to establish a mechanism to prevent and combat corruption - again, in all Member States."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their speeches, questions and proposals."
"I would like to answer telegraphically some of those questions."
"I agree with those MEPs who have been calling for respect for the rules."
"I am sure that, if we respected them better, we would not be in this situation."
"We work very hard on agreeing the rules, so once we have them we definitely should respect them."
"The Commission will do its utmost to enforce them even better in the future."
"When it comes to the division of labour - what the Commission and what the Member States should do under the EU 2020 strategy - we now have a quite detailed description of the level on which the EU should act, and on what level the Member States should act."
"We will elaborate a bit further on this when we come forward with a concrete proposal on how to deliver and put in place the flagship projects."
"This will be quite detailed."
"It will be a measure-by-measure description."
"I can assure you that it is the Commission's utmost ambition to deliver on this very important strategy."
"Part of this, of course, involves getting rid of unnecessary barriers and better using the potential of the single market, and using what Europe can offer in a much more efficient and better way."
"We will be doing this at the level of the Commission, but at the same time we also expect input from the Member States as to where they see that the single market could be used better and where they see that there are barriers still in place which we should work on to erase."
"When it comes to economic governance and better economic coordination, we intend to use fully the Lisbon Treaty provisions and will be coming forward with initial proposals in this area this spring."
"When it comes to governance and EU 2020, we are looking for an adequate balance in how to motivate the Member States in a positive way, and at the same time how to ask for better, stronger, efforts from their side."
"We believe that this time we have found an adequate method and that its delivery should be much better than it was before."
"We will, of course, be working on monitoring and evaluations, together with Parliament, so will have a very good opportunity to discuss this in detail."
"When it comes to transatlantic cooperation, the Commission is committed to further advancing the Transatlantic Economic Council and its work."
"At the same time, we are also committed to the Doha Round because we believe that the conclusions of the Doha Round will open new doors for improved world trade and for improved situations in developing countries."
"A lot of Members spoke on the issue of Greece."
"Here again I would like to underline that we have created a eurozone mechanism - with the IMF, but it is still a eurozone mechanism, and we have to stress that."
"This was the best solution we could find under very challenging circumstances."
"When it comes to another argument that I have heard, which is that EU 2020 is too much on the side of dirigisme, I cannot agree."
"We are trying to find a way to mobilise and activate the different levels through which we can achieve the most efficient actions and the best possible course of events."
"We would like to do this in a complementary way, so that each level supports the others."
"When it comes to SMEs, the heart of the strategy, and what we are hearing from them, is that they are asking us for is a level playing field across Europe and for a reduction in the administrative burden."
"That is exactly what we would like to achieve."
"When it comes to the agriculture, this has certainly been present in the European 2020 strategy from the outset, but we should not view EU 2020 as an exhaustive list of everything we should do in the future or an exhaustive list of how we should treat agriculture in the future."
"Very soon we will have a very important debate on the budget review, and that would be the right moment to discuss the future not only of agriculture, but also of other policies, in greater detail."
"This is a crucial debate for us, so it is necessary to sit here and discuss further."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief following on from what was said by the Vice-President of the European Commission."
"There are just a few points that I wish to stress."
"Firstly, the famous mechanism put in place for the Greek crisis, as it has been called over the last few weeks and months, unfortunately."
"Many of you have called for more Europe."
"That is a worthy argument, but we must work within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is very clear."
"It does not include so-called bailout clauses."
"It did not foresee this kind of situation."
"Therefore, we must find something."
"Having demanded that the Greek Government assume responsibility - which it has done, and it has taken some measures - we must invent a financial aid mechanism that respects the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That is why the European Commission has proposed a mechanism of bilateral loans managed by the Commission."
"That is why many Member States, including the Dutch Parliament, have demanded that the International Monetary Fund intervene."
"It is not just one or two governments that have demanded this; many more have requested it."
"Why?"
"Because they have paid money into the International Monetary Fund in recent times so that it can actually fulfil its task of providing timely financial assistance."
"Indeed, Europe has contributed a very large amount."
"As Belgian Prime Minister, I contributed on behalf of my country something in the region of EUR 5 billion, and thus certain members - their parliaments and governments - have questioned why we cannot draw on these financial resources that have been made available to the International Monetary Fund in order to help a European country, after the effort made by the European countries."
"Therefore, something had to be found, an exchange in kind, something creative that respects the Treaty."
"As for those who are calling for more Europe, the first thing they have to do is to work - I repeat - in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The mechanism is, of course, a compromise mechanism, and it is one that had to be found because other mechanisms were not provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Greek Government has not asked for the two-week-old agreement to be reviewed; it has not done so at all."
"Moreover, the Greek finance minister said this very clearly yesterday."
"He did not, I repeat once again, request financial assistance."
"He hopes that once the results of his efforts are visible, the spreads will decrease."
"Therefore, making all kinds of statements and spreading all kinds of rumours is very harmful to Greek taxpayers, because not only does it not help anyone, it is also to the detriment of those who have to endure a number of measures because action was not taken quickly enough in their country previously."
"As for economic governance, Mr Šefčovič spoke about this; let us be very clear, the European Council works within its remit laid down in Article 15 of the Treaty."
"It gives guidance and it defines the main policy guidelines to be followed, but it is not an executive power, it is not a legislative power."
"Therefore, it is certainly not a government in the constitutional sense of the word."
"It does, however, coordinate, monitor, provide a certain impetus and, as the Treaty clearly states, give guidance."
"That is the political sense of economic governance, but it should certainly not be understood in the constitutional sense of the word."
"There is a great deal of work to do."
"Some people have asked me: have penalties been applied or are they envisaged for failure to observe certain economic- or employment-related directives?"
"Well, in such cases, the Treaty has to be changed, it has to be amended."
"Penalties may be applied only where they are provided for by the Treaty."
"The Treaty does not provide for this. Should we discuss this within the task force?"
"If some people wish to put proposals on the table, they will be discussed, but penalties cannot be imposed that run counter to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As far as a free-trade area between the United States, Europe and others is concerned, right now I believe that the main job to be done is the one that Mr Lamy and others are embarking on, that of making the Doha Round a success."
"I believe that that is the top priority."
"He has sounded the alarm, and rightly so."
"A major protectionist movement has certainly been avoided in Europe."
"We have avoided that, but we must do more, we must go further."
"In fact, we face some very great challenges in three areas."
"There is the climate challenge, for which there is the Copenhagen Accord, but the promises made in terms of reducing CO2 emissions are not enough to meet the few objectives that were laid down in the Copenhagen Accord - in other words, the objective to ensure that the temperature does not exceed the pre-industrial level by more than two degrees."
"As well as the climate challenge, there is the challenge for international trade and the challenge for international financial regulation; some of you rightly spoke about this."
"We therefore have an extremely important international agenda, and Europe must play a very major role at the G20 and within other bodies so that progress is made at an international and global level."
"Why not include the internal market in the five objectives?"
"Indeed, the internal market is an instrument, and it must be regulated via a large number of these objectives."
"In the area of research and development and in others, we must use all the resources of the internal market."
"We must develop it further, but it is not an end in itself."
"It is an instrument, but an important one."
"We are keenly awaiting Professor Monti's suggestions on how to improve the internal market, but it is an extremely important asset."
"Just as there is the common currency, there is the common market."
"It must be developed further to help increase growth and employment."
"Some of you have asked, 'What is the point of all this?'"
"Well, the point is to have sufficient economic growth so that we can finance our social model properly, and it is also to serve a European Union that wants to play a role in the world but which cannot do so without being a greater economic force."
"We cannot play a role in our world if we are not really a great, a very great, economic force."
"(NL) Since Mrs Van Brempt asked me this question, I should like to reply in Dutch."
"I am talking to her empty seat, but I shall say it anyway: I do not really understand why she thinks this a disgrace."
"It is the very first time the fight against poverty has been included in five key objectives, and yet we are told that it is a disgrace, that we have not gone far enough and that we must take a resit."
"It is the very first time."
"I am pleased, therefore - proud, even - that we and the Commission joined battle on this and were able to include the fight against social exclusion and against poverty in these five key objectives."
"Of course, we need to identify the right indicators, and this is not such an easy task; it is much harder than many people think."
"To reiterate, I by no means feel the need to turn up for a resit in June."
"In that month we shall be continuing to implement what we decided on 25 March in the usual way."
"I am very pleased, therefore, that we have broken with the past and made poverty a top priority in the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, I shall confine myself to these few comments and observations."
"Although I have not responded to all the comments, I repeat, it is not because I have not listened, but because we are short of time."
"Many of the speeches consisted of comments, not questions."
"I have therefore noted them, and I will give them some thought."
"In any case, I thank you for your important and interesting contribution to this debate on a subject that is crucial for the European Union, namely this strategy relating to what we call 'employment and growth', the 2020 strategy."
"I am quite sure that not only Ms Van Brempt but also at least 300 other colleagues are listening in their rooms, because there is the opportunity to listen to the debate there."
"At least eight committees of the European Parliament work directly with the 2020 Strategy, and the rest indirectly, so we are highly committed and we are open for further discussion, cooperation and preparing details on how to organise it."
"This is a very important discussion for all of us."
"Thank you very much for coming, thank you both for such a deep and broad discussion on this topic, Mr President of the European Council and Mr Vice-President of the Commission, and thank you, colleagues, for the discussion."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"It is important for the European Parliament to engage in positive cooperation with the Commission and Council."
"In this respect, I welcome today's debate on the conclusions of the European Council meeting (25-26 March 2010)."
"Particular attention was focused, among the topics discussed, on the 'Europe 2020' economic strategy, as well as on the preparation for the international climate change negotiations."
"I think that we are all affected by the problems in the euro area, as the euro's stability is of paramount importance to the whole of the European Union."
"The European Council will play a more important role in coordinating at national and European level instruments intended to boost Member States' economic performance."
"Against this background, solutions relating only to budgetary problems are inadequate, as these problems are closely linked to economic problems."
"I support the European Council's objectives of raising the level of employment, especially through policies aimed at supporting young people."
"The conditions for increasing investments in research and innovation must be improved."
"Realistic objectives must be set not only in this area, but also when it comes to setting climate change targets."
"The European Commission must put forward as soon as possible specific measures intended to implement the projects aimed at reducing poverty across the whole European Union."
"The Spring European Council summit has been so dominated by Greece's economic problems that, if conclusions had not been documented in writing after the meeting, many of us would not have even known that the Europe 2020 strategy and many other topics were discussed as well."
"However, this information has certainly not reached the European man in the street yet, who is under the impression that Greece completely dominated the whole spring summit."
"Without being cynical, we can say that this whole global crisis during the last two years has produced one cloud with a silver lining at European Community level: a strategy and future vision which will avert any huge economic slump in the future, set out a new direction for the EU27's development and, by implication, make Europe more competitive."
"However, it is vital that the Spring Council's noble conclusions on the Europe 2020 strategy go beyond good intentions."
"The European Union is a complex body, made up of distinct, individual countries which have been united institutionally."
"However, they respond in different measures to the guidelines set out by the European Union's Council."
"Consequently, setting clear targets for each Member State would probably yield more results than leaving it to their discretion to take the necessary action to implement the strategy."
"in writing. - The outcome of this Summit is far from responding effectively to Greece's needs."
"Mr. Van Rompuy says the EU's capacity to reach consensus remains intact and so it is, but unfortunately there is only consensus on the lowest common denominator!"
"The solution proposed is everything but a European one."
"In order to have a real European response we should have had a European framework for helping Greece out of its debt crisis, instead of doing it through bilateral loans."
"Moreover, I'm afraid that the credibility of the whole euro area may suffer if the IMF is to intervene, not to mention the fact that apparently the Greek government has stepped back on IMF intervention since the IMF conditions could lead to social and political unrest in the country."
"What's really worrying me is that markets have simply not reacted very positively to this solution, as interests proposed to Greece by the markets remain around 7% or even slightly above, which is unfavorable for Greece."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the setup of the task force which I hope will come with more ambitious proposals so that the economic and fiscal sustainability of the Eurozone is effectively ensured in the future."
"I welcome the fact that at the most recent meeting of the European Council a compromise was outlined regarding the European Union's economic programme covering the period to 2020 and on providing aid to Greece."
"The economic growth set as a target in the strategy is at the same time a prerequisite for emerging from the labour market and social crisis."
"It is to be welcomed that the European Council is devoting a great deal of attention to increasing employment not only among young and older workers but also among the low skilled."
"Increasing employment among the targeted groups must go hand in hand with the acquisition of skills that have market value, as well as with fostering lifelong learning."
"I also agree with the Hungarian Government's efforts to get us to think, in the fight against poverty, about quantitative regional cohesion goals instead of poverty-related objectives, since those living in poverty and particularly in severe poverty within the EU live in clearly defined geographical regions."
"This would allow harmonisation of the handling of poverty and of the complex problems of underdeveloped regions."
"At the same time, it is important that when the objectives of the 2020 strategy are adopted, the decision-makers have available accurate data as regards the level and proportion of poverty in society."
"Although the handling of the economic crisis and the EU 2020 strategy set out the direction to be followed, the request raised by the Visegrad countries is entirely understandable, namely, that the debate on this matter should not determine the long-term monetary perspective after 2013."
"Debating the latter will require longer negotiations, and it is impossible to foresee how much financial room for manoeuvre circumstances in 2012-2013 will afford the EU."
", in writing. - (HU) The final document of the March Council meeting - very properly - devoted special attention to the question of climate change."
"This is all the more welcome because the failure of the Copenhagen Summit has created uncertainty with regard to climate policy."
"Flexibility mechanisms, primarily the quota trading systems, are likely to remain important instruments for the European Union's climate protection efforts in the future."
"Their functioning today, however, is still marked by contradiction."
"Last year, for example, a major tax fraud was perpetrated in the UK in the course of a quota transaction."
"Not long ago, it came to light that the quotas sold by the Hungarian Government found their way unlawfully back into the EU's emission trading system."
"With the mediation of offshore companies, there was an attempt in effect to use emission rights twice."
"These are just two examples showing that the system of emission rights is not working smoothly."
"Abuses are damaging in particular to those actors who are making true efforts to mitigate environmental damage."
"Learning from negative examples, we need to put an end as soon as possible to the legal loopholes that lurk in the quota trading system."
"The European Commission must take steps against the use of permits without real performances, in bad faith, or for other than their intended purpose."
"In addition, we need to create full legal harmony between international and EU climate protection regulations."
"With a view to all these goals, it would be useful to strengthen the EU's supervisory procedures as well."
"Effective climate protection regulation will continue to require flexibility mechanisms."
"Flexibility cannot, however, mean unpredictability and cannot create opportunities for abuse."
"The conclusions from the European Council meeting which took place on 25 and 26 March 2010 certainly highlight the major ambitions which Member States have for the forthcoming period up until 2020."
"I noticed in particular the consistent objectives in terms of boosting investment in research and development and reducing gas emissions, which are backed up by figures and commitments."
"It goes without saying that political will is a fundamental requirement for ensuring that these objectives are turned into policies which also deliver results."
"With this in mind, we must all make efforts."
"On the other hand, I would like to condemn the postponement of setting quantifiable targets for reducing the school dropout level and increasing the number of university graduates, as well as for reducing social exclusion, all the more so as 2010 is actually the European year dedicated to this issue."
"Even if the speed of decision-making remains slow due to numerous factors, greater efficiency must be demonstrated when it comes to implementation so that this new strategy is a success and not a repeat of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In view of processes which are taking place in Europe, such as the demographic decline in the indigenous population and the economic crisis, a well-thought-out strategic action plan has my full support."
"The Europe 2020 strategy should enable us to be effective in the fight against the effects of these detrimental phenomena, to make our continent ready for the challenges of the next decade in an environment of global competition."
"I am counting on a good information campaign among the citizens of Member States, to help them use the powers conferred on them by the Treaty of Lisbon and influence first the planning, and later the realisation, of the strategy by involvement at regional and lower levels and in smaller local communities."
"I agree that the strategic priorities themselves - sustainable growth, a knowledge-based and innovative economy, investment in education of the citizens and building a society free of economic divisions and poverty - have been specified well."
"I also think this should be followed by the speedy development of mechanisms for putting these priorities into practice and the establishment of a timetable for this."
"I am counting on good and comprehensive cooperation in this area."
"I would like to stress that the Europe 2020 strategy must take account of the huge differences in the level of development and in the potential of different regions."
"If we forget suitable adaptation of the timetable and means of achieving the strategic objectives to the characteristics of individual parts of the EU, I am afraid our work may not bring the result we expect."
"I welcome the outcome of the European Council, especially the important decision made to support Greece, in cooperation with the IMF."
"This is an important step towards strengthening European solidarity."
"Greece is not the only State in the euro area facing financial problems."
"Structural reforms and restoring macroeconomic stability through reallocating budget resources to support sustainable growth are more pertinent than direct aid."
"The European Union needs a new, medium-term strategic vision for growth and development, combined with the prudent collection and redistribution of financial resources."
"Two fundamental reforms need to be added - the reform of the CAP and the reform of the cohesion policy, two budget items absorbing a large volume of resources."
"Increasing employment, boosting competitiveness and productivity, along with exceptionally productive investments in research and innovation are the main measures for halting the decline and kick-starting sustainable growth, which are key objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I would like to welcome the fact that the text detailing the European Council's final conclusions referred to the particularly important role played by the cohesion policy and common agricultural policy in ensuring the EU's competitiveness."
"The common agricultural policy in particular - a topic which is currently the subject of heated debates prior to the forthcoming reform of this area - is a special subject because of its importance."
"It is not only more than 12 million European farmers but consumers as well who are expecting specific results after the CAP has been reformed, which will have a positive impact on their standard of living and the quality of food being eaten, on the one hand, and on the competitiveness of Europe's agriculture and food industry, on the other hand."
"The European Union is duty-bound to take into account the hopes which its citizens have pinned on the future CAP when implementing its future policies."
"The EU 2020 strategy must be based on expanded coordination of economic and environmental policies in order to generate eco-efficient economic growth and higher employment."
"The transition to a clean economy generating green jobs will only be achieved through changing production, consumption and transport models and will entail major investments from budgetary, private and fiscal sources."
"I believe that this must involve an intelligent, green process which will be given priority at every level - local, national and European - and will help improve the welfare of all citizens so that the European Union becomes a leading player in an increasingly globalised economy."
"The 2020 strategy which has been adopted by the European Council is not acceptable to me as a socialist."
"It lacks a clear statement of a strategic objective (combating poverty) and does not contain measures for achieving this goal."
"Poverty affects 80 million (20%) of Europeans, and 17% have such low incomes that they cannot meet their basic needs."
"This is not only an economic problem, but is also a violation of human rights."
"Poverty causes loss of health, restricted access to education, homelessness, discrimination and social exclusion."
"According to a report of the European Commission published in 2008, one in five (19%) Poles lives below the poverty line, with 26% of children living in poverty (the highest level in the Union)."
"We need a long-term strategy for fighting poverty as an integral part of EU policy."
"In accordance with the proposals of my political group, the strategy should be assisted by reform of the common agricultural policy."
"It is essential to ensure food security to all EU citizens in all of its aspects (physical and economic access to food which meets high health and quality standards)."
"The 2020 strategy will be a valuable document for EU citizens only on condition that social objectives are included."
"Therefore, I am asking the Commission and the Council to: 1. recognise the fight against poverty as a principal, strategic objective; 2. establish and precisely quantify particular objectives relating to the systematic curtailment of poverty; 3. elaborate and adopt (at the June summit) specific indicators of poverty; 4. specify dates for the realisation of individual partial objectives."
"On 25 and 26 March decisions were made in the European Council on issues that will have a considerable impact on the lives of thousands of Europeans, especially those who share the euro."
"Even at a time of economic crisis, which is becoming much more serious in countries such as Greece, the Heads of State or Government of the euro area have reached agreement regarding financial assistance for that country."
"These Member States have demonstrated solidarity with Greece and determination to reinforce the stability of the currency by undertaking to provide bilateral loans in the event that the country is unable to resolve the problems with its public finances by other means, specifically intervention by the International Monetary Fund."
"In addition, over the next 10 years the new Europe 2020 strategy will have to capitalise on the previous Lisbon Strategy, showing the public tangible results especially as regards the promotion of employment without further putting off structural reforms."
"Territorial cohesion must be an integral part of this strategy, along with other key issues such as a continued commitment to knowledge and innovation, sustainable economic progress and social inclusion."
"The European Union has formalised its support for this strategy and the Member States' commitment to it must be absolute."
"I welcome that during the European Council meeting held on 25 and 26 March the EU made a firm commitment for the first time to increase energy efficiency by 20% by 2020, while also reaffirming its commitment to cut polluting emissions by 20%, compared with the 1990 level."
"The biggest challenge the EU is currently facing is the dramatic rise in unemployment."
"In February it reached a rate of 10%, taking the number of unemployed above 23 million, marking a rise of 3.1 million compared with February 2009."
"The economic crisis has hit both the public and private sectors, with thousands of European companies going into liquidation and millions of employees losing their jobs."
"The fall in the number of employees and companies has a powerful impact on the budgets allocated for public expenditure, as well as on European citizens' quality of life."
"Nevertheless, the EU must set out the course of action for its development and provide the necessary funding."
"The European Union must invest in education, research and in an ambitious, sustainable industrial policy, enabling it to remain competitive globally."
"The EU also needs to invest in health care, agriculture, and transport and energy infrastructures."
"I call on the Commission to table a legislative initiative for setting up a European fund for developing the transport infrastructure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the last European summit was an attempt to develop a new strategy for the euro area and for coming out of the economic crisis."
"European leaders were agreed that it is necessary to strengthen economic policy in Europe by defining future common guidelines and developing an early-warning system for Member States facing economic difficulties."
"The consequences of the world financial crisis are a good opportunity for Europe to strengthen its internal integration and cooperation."
"Now is the time to make use of the undoubted benefits of European integration and take the European project up to a new, higher level."
"The summit had optimistic and promising significance."
"However, we need to be careful that this attempt to develop another economic strategy for Europe does not end up like the Lisbon Strategy, which was supposed to transform Europe into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy, but was a spectacular failure. Thank you."
"in writing. - (HU) In half a year, the European Union has moved from a hopeful situation to almost complete disunity."
"Six months ago, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon inspired optimism and hope."
"Only half a year later, the Greek crisis has put the EU before a dramatic situation."
"In spite of an increasing number of alarm signals, everyone is waiting, although this sounds trite, for national protectionism to get out of hand, which may have potentially disastrous results."
"I am convinced that the Member States that are in difficult situations do not need cynical advice."
"Greece's situation is not unique; the EU will have to face other similar shock effects."
"The solution lies in increasing EU solidarity, effective coordination and achieving strong economic governance."
"As a representative of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and a Romanian Hungarian politician who obtained his mandate as an expression of political solidarity, I believe that the only way out of the crisis is through solidarity among northern, southern, western and eastern Member States - that is, among all of us."
"The situation of the Greek economy has, undoubtedly, aroused much emotion."
"Its catastrophic condition is both the effect of the world crisis and the result of the neglect of the government in Athens."
"It is because of the failure to carry out serious reforms and an interpretation of macroeconomic data which was too casual that Greece is, today, on the brink of bankruptcy."
"Greece is going to feel the effects of today's economic collapse for many years to come."
"Therefore, it was with great interest that I studied the proposed forms of support which the Council intends to give to Greece."
"I am glad that Greece can count on help, but this should be linked to immediate and radical reforms of public finances."
"Our reaction to the crisis in Greece must be a clear signal to other Member States which are struggling with similar problems that robust internal reforms are the route they must take to lift themselves out of the crisis."
"The conclusions of the European Council meeting on 25-26 March 2010 contain a decision which talks about an intention to strengthen the coordination of Member States' economic policy by better use of the instruments provided for in Article 121 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The economic crisis, especially at the beginning, led to the appearance of numerous examples of protectionist practices, which quite often caused doubts from the point of view of EU principles of competition."
"Will stronger coordination of the economic policies of Member States and the proposed better use of the instruments established in Article 121 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prevent a repeat of similar practices in the future?"
"If so, how?"

"The names of the signatories will be published in the Minutes of the sitting."
"Mr President, I should just like to thank everybody for signing Written Declaration 71 on breast cancer."
"Most of you know that this is the leading cause of death across the EU of women aged between 35 and 59, and we want Member States to set up nationwide screening programmes and breast cancer specialist units among other things."
"I hope that the signing of this written declaration will be another step forward to help to make sure that we have EU-wide action to stop the dire consequences of breast cancer."

"Statements by the President"
"Before we begin the sitting, I would like to say that our thoughts and prayers are, today, with the families and friends of the victims and with those who were injured in the railway accident which happened last week in the north of Italy."
"It was, as we all remember, a very serious railway accident."
"I would also like to thank all of you, Members and staff of Parliament - many people from Parliament - for attending and for organising the ceremony on Wednesday last week at 12.00 in connection with the Polish air disaster."
"The funeral of the President of Poland was held yesterday, and the funeral of the President of Poland in exile was held today."
"On Wednesday last week, we observed a one-minute silence in memory of the victims of the disaster."
"I would like to thank you again for this act of solidarity."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr President, for the sympathy that you expressed for the victims of the accident that occurred in my region and my country, the autonomous province of Bozen - South Tyrol - last week."
"The people in my region are indeed extremely shocked by this accident, which cost the lives of nine, predominantly young, people and left many people injured."
"It is all the more shocking because this train was not an old train, but a jewel of our region and it was a new route that was only opened a few years ago."
"This accident was not due to a technical fault, either."
"It was purely and simply the result of a landslide, which is something that can occur in a mountainous region like the Alps."
"Thank you very much, Mr President. I will pass on your words of sympathy to the victims and to the people of my country."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to thank everyone who is present in the House today, because we have overcome very great transport problems in getting to Strasbourg."
"Not everyone has managed to come."
"An extraordinary meeting of the Conference of Presidents ended a few minutes ago."
"The chairs of the political groups have specific proposals for you, which have been agreed and endorsed by the chairs of all the political groups."
"These proposals mean, in essence, that we will not have a plenary sitting on Thursday, and so there will be no order of business on Thursday."
"However, on Thursday and Friday, Members will be able to sign the attendance register and work as usual."
"There will be no plenary sitting and no order of business, but it is, of course, our obligation to work, and those who sign the attendance register on Thursday and Friday will be treated normally, as always on Thursdays and Fridays."
"I would also like to emphasise that no votes will be taken this week in plenary or in committee, if any committee meetings are held."
"A committee meeting may be held, even on Thursday, but without taking a vote."
"This is what we have decided."
"The reason for this is that not all our fellow Members were able, physically, to get here, and we cannot deprive them of the right to participate in this part-session."
"So this has nothing to do with a quorum, because there will, probably, be a quorum, but it has to do with the fact that not everyone has been able to come to the part-session."
"Deferring the votes is not serious from the legal point of view of our obligations to the Council."
"The votes are important, and so we are postponing them by two weeks, and they will be taken at the May part-session in Brussels."
"From the point of view of our work with the Council of Ministers, and of agreements and second readings, this can be done."
"I would also like to say that there is an important reason why those of us who are here should meet and discuss, because tomorrow there is an extraordinary item which we had not foreseen."
"This item, which we will discuss tomorrow morning, is related to the current transport situation in Europe and its consequences for Europe's citizens."
"Tomorrow, during a two-hour discussion attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, we want to think about the situation in Europe, because mobility has fallen, airlines are in danger, and we are faced with unemployment in places where there are large airports and where European airlines might collapse if they are not able to serve passengers for many days."
"This is, therefore, a serious threat to all of Europe's citizens, and so tomorrow morning's discussion is of key significance."
"This item of business had not been agreed earlier; it is a completely new item added as a consequence of the difficult situation in the European Union, and we must think seriously about it."
"The remaining items will be discussed, except some of the items planned for Thursday."
"I would also like to inform you that on 7 April this year, I received a letter from the Member, Mr Farage."
"In his letter, the Co-Chair of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group refers to Rule 6(3) of the Rules of Procedure and makes a formal complaint concerning a breach of protocol on European Union privileges and immunities."
"I have forwarded the request contained in Mr Farage's letter to the competent committee for consideration."
"Order of business"
"The final draft agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Monday, 19 April 2010 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"(First part of the changes: see previous item)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order for your information."
"It is nice for you to congratulate us for being here today."
"Although it is difficult, it is our job."
"It is nothing special."
"I would simply like to recommend for next time that you make this job a little easier for us by providing us with information more quickly and by answering our emails so that we know what is likely to happen."
"Those who are not here today may then perhaps also come."
"(Applause)"
"I must admit that I do not fully understand your remark, Mr Leichtfried, because the Members have reacted very well."
"However, let us leave this discussion."
"Mr President, I would like to concur with the gentleman over there."
"We know there is an issue regarding air travel - of course we do; we are not silly - but I cannot understand why it has taken until tonight to come to this conclusion."
"We have all arrived here today, there are many people in the Chamber, and there are many staff."
"The costs to the taxpayer run into millions of pounds for us all to be here, and yet you decide to cancel it at a moment's notice."
"I think it is absolutely abysmal that you have done that."
"I think there are enough people here to vote."
"We know the difficult conditions, but this is supposed to be a parliament."
"You have turned round now and said we are not going to vote, but you can come along and discuss things, debate things, which quite often means absolutely nothing, and then, when it comes to voting, we are told we cannot."
"I think the taxpayer back in the UK will be absolutely appalled by this."
"We have trouble in the UK with finances, we are cutting services, we have a general election, we are talking about saving money, and yet we are wasting money hand over fist over here."
"Surely the time has come for this place to be shut down."
"Thank you for your remark."
"I treat all comments very seriously, but I would like to tell you that all the political groups and their representatives have agreed to the changes which I am about to propose."
"(NL) Mr President, I think it was a wise decision to postpone the vote because, although we have the required number of members for a quorum, we do not have the geographical distribution."
"However, I would suggest that the points on the agenda that have not been covered are condensed so that we can finish a full day earlier than normal, i.e. at the end of Wednesday afternoon, as we usually do on Thursdays, rather than at Wednesday midnight."
"That would at least allow people who are here to travel back home and we would not have to stay here on Thursday."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will give people the floor after establishing the order of business."
"Mr President, thanks to the law of unintended consequences, moving this week's votes to 6 May - that is the day of the general election in the United Kingdom - means that many, if not all, of the British MEPs from all parties and delegations will not be here on that day, which will also distort the final outcome."
"Could you move it to Wednesday, 5 May instead of Thursday, 6 May please?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is my proposal to you."
"We shall start now with the agenda and after the agenda, we can start again with all your questions about the part-session on 5 and 6 May."
"We will decide later; it is not necessary to decide that now."
"The only thing is that the votes will be held on 5 and 6 May."
"All the decisions will be taken later."
"We will start with the agenda."
"I do not want any further points of order now."
"The final draft agenda for the April part-session has been distributed, in which the following changes are proposed (Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure):"
"Monday:"
"No changes."
"Tuesday:"
"The sitting will begin at 09.00 with statements from the Council and the Commission on the disruption of air traffic in Europe."
"The debate will continue until 11.00."
"From 11.00 to 13.00, the following items will be discussed: a statement from Mr Barroso on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2010 and a statement from the Commission on coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Haiti."
"No votes will be taken on Tuesday."
"Wednesday:"
"No changes."
"No votes will be taken on Wednesday."
"Thursday:"
"There will be no sitting on Thursday."
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, thank you for letting me speak again."
"In view of what has been said here now, at very short notice, I would urge you to look again at that matter of voting at the next session on 5 and 6 May."
"It is quite likely that most of the MEPs from the UK will not be present."
"It is our general election on 6 May."
"The whole country will not be here."
"You are going to discuss things which will not represent the United Kingdom."
"I urge you to perhaps look at 4 May - bring it back a few days - because, if you deny that vote, you are going to deny the United Kingdom a chance to oppose or support measures ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"If I may give you my answer: I will take what you have said very seriously."
"We have two days: 5 and 6 May."
"We will decide how to proceed with the votes scheduled for 5 and 6 May, and how to divide them."
"Before we begin, I would like to make an announcement."
"As we all know, Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure allows for one-minute speeches."
"Experience shows that we receive over two times more requests to speak than we can accept in view of the time available."
"The disappointment expressed by Members who were waiting for the opportunity to speak, and then did not have the opportunity, is inevitable."
"In order to avoid further uncertainty and disappointment, I am going to apply the following procedure in future for the one-minute speeches."
"Pursuant to Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure, a list will be drawn up of 30 speakers, who will be chosen selectively so as to maintain a representative political and geographical balance."
"Priority will be given to Members who did not have the opportunity to make a one-minute speech at the two previous part-sessions."
"All Members who have requested the opportunity to speak will be told in advance if they have been chosen or not."
"Members chosen to speak will be expected to be present in the Chamber at the time when it is their turn to speak."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the question of genetically modified food."
"The European Commission is working on a proposal to change EU law, to give Member States greater freedom in deciding if they want to allow genetically modified organisms, because at the present time under EU law, it is not possible to introduce a ban on GMOs in Member States."
"The European Commission is soon to propose that Member States be able to decide individually on the cultivation of genetically modified plants."
"However, decisions on the importation and processing of GMO seeds would still be made at EU level."
"In view of this, we should consider whether a special label should be introduced for GMO-free products."
"Such labelling should be clear and universally recognisable, so that European consumers will know the product they are buying has not been produced from animals fed with genetically modified feed."
"We should, therefore, think about a specific design of label."
"Mr President, may I remind this House that one year ago, Communist abuses were met by a popular revolt in the Republic of Moldova."
"The protests brought to power a pro-European coalition and, one year on, the new government proved its European stance."
"The Moldovan Government needs immediate support from the EU, and there are three ways in which European support can help Moldova: quick financial assistance, abolishing of visas and the conclusion of an association agreement."
"I also have to mention here the case of Ernest Vardanian, a journalist arrested, held incommunicado and indicted for high treason by the so-called authorities in Transnistria."
"It is a serious human rights violation."
"I am asking the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the EU Head of Delegation to Moldova to act urgently for the immediate release of the detained journalist."
"(SK) Mr President, Secretary General, Commissioner, I should now deliver the speech I have prepared, but there have been some exceptional circumstances."
"We all know that meteorological conditions do not favour us all meeting here in Strasbourg without difficulties."
"This has caused many fellow Members and officials a lot of stress and anxiety."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Mr President, and also the General Secretariat under the leadership of Klaus Welle, for leaving nothing to chance and providing us with the best possible working conditions."
"From the first days of the aviation problem, Parliament set to work on the reorganisation of transport to Strasbourg, and I would therefore also like to offer sincere thanks on behalf of those who cannot be here today. Thank you very much."
"(DE) Mr President, I tried to attract your attention earlier when you were talking about the new rules for the one-minute speeches."
"Coming from Poland as you do, you will know what it means to have different classes of people and parliamentarians."
"I would, however, ask that the people in the back rows also be taken into account in connection with points of order."
"I have some specific questions."
"Firstly, can you please clarify for me what you said earlier, namely whether, by the next two part-sessions, you mean the next two Strasbourg part sessions or whether you are also including Brussels in that?"
"Secondly, what will you do if - as has just happened - Members are not here for whatever reason, even though they have requested the floor?"
"Will there perhaps be another few minutes of catch-the-eye?"
"Thirdly, in line with this new efficiency - which is to be welcomed - could you please make a start right away today by reading out the names of the 30 speakers you intend to give the floor to today?"
"Thank you for your remark."
"Application of the new rules will begin with the meeting in Brussels."
"The part-session in Brussels will be the first one held under the new rules."
"(DE) Mr President, the problem of stray dogs in Romania has become topical once again as a result of the planned lifting of the ban on killing these dogs that has been in place since 15 January 2008."
"I am pleased that Romania has again refrained from implementing these plans."
"However, the alternative that has now been chosen, namely to place dogs in mass animal shelters, is not the solution either."
"The only sensible thing to do is to implement a castration programme."
"Romania has refused to do this, however."
"When it comes to this matter - like any animal protection matters - the European Union really should do something - and not before time."
"Mr President, that was my one-minute speech."
"I wanted to use the remaining time to explain once again what it was I wanted to say earlier."
"(RO) Mr President, when Simon Kuznets, the man who created the concept of 'gross national product', recognised how difficult it can be to measure a nation's well-being, based only on the size of its national income, I do not think he imagined that it would take three quarters of a century before five Nobel prize winners would work on a set of proposals for providing a more accurate assessment of economic performance and social product than that offered by GDP."
"This macro-economic indicator ignores the quality of products, fails to measure sustainable economic growth, and excludes other factors such as subsistence and suburban economies, household work and voluntary work."
"Based on the outcome of the work carried out by this committee, summarised in the Stiglitz report, a proposal has been drafted for improving the national statistics system, defining the quality of life more accurately and including sustainable development in the calculation of the economic and social progress index."
"In this context, I believe that we must have a coordinated system across the whole of the European Union for measuring quality of life, the extent to which economic growth can be sustained and, last but not least, social disparities."
"This step would signal that we have learnt the lesson from the recession which is having such a major impact on us."
"(ES) Madam President, last week, a court ruled that the closure of the Basque language newspaper Egunkaria, which I spoke about here a few weeks ago, was an unjust, illegal and arbitrary act."
"The ruling states that neither the Spanish Constitution nor the Criminal Code allows a newspaper to be closed down, and that the whole charge was built on the premise that defending Basque culture means collaborating with ETA, which is absurd."
"It says that the people charged are completely innocent, that they do not belong to ETA, and that the newspaper has not funded ETA, nor has ETA funded the newspaper."
"The ruling also states that the detainees were held incommunicado, with insufficient judicial controls, which gives credibility to the claims of ill treatment and torture made by the detainees."
"I would therefore like to make two requests: I would like us to take note of the consequences that demagogy and the manipulation of feelings and emergency legislation have in a democracy, and of the fact that in Spain, the main elements of the media and the main parties accused all of us who opposed this injustice of collaborating with ETA."
"I would also like us to work together to ensure that justice is done for these victims and that the case is closed fairly."
"(EL) Madam President, last February, the European Commission report edited by Reuter and Trautmann on global illicit drug markets from 1998 onwards was presented to the European Parliament."
"This report is a valuable database and its conclusions corroborate certain evaluations made to date about the ineffectiveness of drugs policies in the European Union and at global level."
"The basic conclusion is that current policies have failed in their main objective, namely, to reduce the demand for and supply of illicit substances, and are a key factor in exacerbating the harm to individual users, their environment, the economy and society."
"In 2004, the European Parliament approved a package of recommendations, such as the Catania report."
"We are therefore calling for this issue to be revisited, within a broader framework, so that no harm comes to users."
"(PL) Madam President, my nation has been hit by a great tragedy."
"The President, the head of the Central Bank and military leaders have been killed."
"The funeral of the President and his wife was held yesterday."
"I would like to express my thanks for the expressions of solidarity which have been received from very many Member States of the European Union."
"The concept of European solidarity has proved itself, and this is, for us Poles, something very important."
"The Presidents of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and Slovenia and the Prime Minister of Estonia attended the funeral."
"I regret that the head of the Council and the President of the European Commission were not there."
"They could not come, but the Prime Ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia did come, for example, and they had a longer journey."
"I would like to thank everyone who was there for these expressions of solidarity."
"(DE) Madam President, please allow me, in one minute, to make a few comments with regard to Serbia."
"Serbia's ambitions to join the EU seem to be putting wind in the country's sails."
"In any case, the country formally apologised recently for the genocide in Srebrenica - that is certainly not something that can be said about the controversial candidate country Turkey, where there is the threat of sanctions if a country merely debates the issue of the Armenian genocide."
"The interpretation of the Copenhagen criteria is, in my view, arbitrary, if Belgrade is accused of a lack of cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague but the human rights violations by Ankara are considered unimportant."
"However, it is nothing new for the European Union to apply double standards."
"In Bosnia, several ethnic groups are to be thrust into one multicultural state, whereas in Kosovo, it is suddenly legitimate for one ethnic group to split away from an existing state."
"In contrast to Turkey, Serbia is historically, spiritually and culturally part of Europe and a key state for the security of the Balkans."
"Of course, we must not repeat the mistakes made in connection with the rushed accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"All accession criteria must definitely be met, but Serbia is a European country and should become part of the Union."
"(EL) Madam President, the recent dismantling of an important terrorist cell in Greece reminds us that violence and the threat to democratic institutions have no borders and are undiscriminating."
"It is important to remember that the current economic crisis and the pessimism that it engenders in citizens feeds aggression and produces violence."
"No one disagrees that violence is reprehensible, whatever form it takes and wherever it originates."
"However, what we need to agree and put greater emphasis on is the importance of prevention rather than cure."
"That is why we need to put issues relating to SWIFT, the PNR and the strengthening of Europol and Eurojust higher up on the agenda."
"Having said which, it is vital that we correct the chronic social pathogenies that give birth to violence."
"We need to strike at poverty and unemployment."
"There is no longer any margin for inaction."
"Last time the leaders of Europe backed away from the social challenges of difficult economic times, this continent sank into the depths of hatred and totalitarianism."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission and of this House to the worrying developments with regard to the prices of raw materials."
"Duisburg, home of the largest steelworks in Europe, is in my constituency."
"Here, and in the other steel-producing locations in the EU, the employees are very concerned about their jobs because the three large suppliers of iron ore are forcing price increases of 100% on the steel industry."
"In future, the price of ore is to be traded on the London Metal Exchange instead of price security being ensured, as was previously the case, by means of long-term supply contracts."
"The workforce and its trade unions fear that this will result in an extreme rise in the price of the base material, steel."
"This comes at a time when the potential areas for savings by means of cost-cutting programmes and reductions in the workforce, particularly after the most recent restructuring in the steel industry, have been completely exhausted."
"In order to draw attention to this situation, works councils and Germany's Industrial Union of Metalworkers have directed an appeal on behalf of Duisburg to Chancellor Merkel and to President Barroso."
"I would ask the Commission to respond to this appeal."
"Madam President, travellers whose holiday plans have been ruined by the volcanic ash face confusion over insurance."
"Although airlines will refund or rebook flights under the Air Passenger Rights Directive, many passengers face the cost of hotel rooms and car hire and perhaps alternative flight arrangements, but some travel insurance policies are expected to pay out for the losses."
"There are others claiming that this is an act of God, but I would call on these companies to be pragmatic, to be reasonable and to reconsider that decision, bearing in mind that I, like many others, have numerous constituents who are at airports in various parts of the world, costing them money that they do not have."
"I understand that the Package Travel Directive is being reviewed, and this must be done urgently."
"In conclusion, it is essential that this travel directive ensures that there is a standard set of rules which applies to a situation of this kind."
"Even at this stage, I would ask the Commission to look at this."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to propose in this, the democratic heart of the European institutions, a brief overview of the ultimate impact that European interventions have on communities, regions and individuals."
"I believe that we must decide whether to present a universalist and globalist vision or, instead, to preserve the contribution and the identity of each individual."
"I believe that the second option is preferable; it is a broad vision in which the more unique dimensions deriving from specific vocations and traditions also have their place and their dignity."
"Let us consider, for example, the effects of the 2006 Services Directive, the so-called Bolkestein Directive, on the Italian bathing resort sector. I do not believe that we should sacrifice, for the sake of a supposedly more efficient global system, the culture and the tradition of hospitality that have always characterised local communities."
"I believe that, economically speaking, small enterprises are the most genuine expression of the cultural identity of local communities and that they should therefore always be safeguarded."
"(DE) Madam President, it is not easy these days to be a fervent pro-European."
"I would like, today, to mention the problem of Eurostat."
"It has turned out that Eurostat was much more aware of the real situation in Greece than it was generally thought to have been. There are reports of which only parts were published and which uncovered cases of fraud as long ago as 2002, and then, of course, there was the great report of 2008."
"However, it is totally unclear where the reports go, what the effects of these reports are, and who can be held responsible for them - in this instance, for not acting on them."
"I would therefore like to suggest at this point that we deal constructively with Eurostat and not just with regard to the scandalous practices, which of course also existed in the past."
"Thus, my suggestion is that the Commission takes action here to ensure the independence of Eurostat and to provide citizens with the information that we so badly need in order to revolutionise our democracy."
"(PT) Today, we are facing a natural disaster with unpredictable consequences."
"Science allows us to calculate the effect of the particles in the atmosphere on aircraft engines and avionic systems with reasonable precision."
"Science also allows us to calculate the movement of those particles in the atmosphere with a reasonable degree of precision."
"EU transport ministers are meeting today to decide how to deal with the air transport situation."
"The conclusions of this meeting should be based on scientific knowledge and the precautionary principle."
"The economy cannot take priority over people's safety."
"Europe must continue to act as a bastion of safety and quality of life."
"However, we expect swift, pragmatic solutions on alternative transport systems by land and sea."
"Over the last year, we have been faced with a number of crises, natural disasters and an epidemic; in view of all that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Madam President, at the end of this year, the Third Postal Directive is due to come into force, which will completely deregulate this market."
"The repercussions of the economic and financial crisis are well known, including on the postal market."
"The effects of the crisis have multiplied following the implementation of the directive in Member States where the postal market has been completely deregulated."
"In this sector, the level of redundancies and the reductions in the incomes of the remaining staff are higher than average."
"There has also been a decrease in the number of transactions, an increase in postal rates, not to mention depriving citizens living in locations and areas which are difficult to reach of access to a means of communication and a universal service."
"I believe that the social consequences resulting from the implementation of this directive must be assessed."
"It is our duty to prevent the occurrence of social dumping."
"I urge the relevant European institutions to examine the option of applying a minimum 2-year moratorium to the deadlines envisaged for implementing this directive, with some variation in each of the remaining Member States."
"(RO) I wish to speak to you today about the extremely delicate situation which a journalist called Ernest Vardanian finds himself in."
"He was arrested by Igor Smirnov's regime in the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria."
"Ernest Vardanian is accused of high treason and espionage, which is not only absurd, but is completely laughable."
"Indeed, the journalist has been refused release on bail and is being kept in totally awful conditions."
"I would like to say that this action is used by the authorities in Tiraspol to intimidate Chişinău at a time when the new government which took office after last year's elections would like to move closer to the European Union and also resolve the Transnistrian conflict."
"I am calling for the immediate, unconditional release of the journalist Ernest Vardanian, and I urge the authorities in the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria to make a move towards Chişinău in order to resolve the conflict there."
"(PL) The financial and economic crisis has hit the poorest people the hardest."
"To meet their needs, the European Union has declared the year 2010 to be European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"It is estimated that in Europe, over 40 million people live in poverty, and nearly 40 million more are threatened with poverty."
"It is particularly regrettable that a quarter of this number - 20 million - are children."
"The problems they have to face concern not only a lack of food, medical care and clothing but, above all, the absence of the prospect of an improvement in the situation and an escape from poverty."
"Providing a high level of education is the most important step which can help change this tragic situation."
"This need can be seen most clearly in small towns and rural areas which are a long way from academic centres."
"Therefore, I think a key solution for change is to increase funding for scholarship programmes for young people from poor backgrounds."
"Mr President, I welcome the debate tomorrow on the air crisis because we need to remember that this has an impact not just on this Parliament, but on individuals and businesses across Europe."
"This is at a time when Europe, or most of Europe, is recovering from a deep recession."
"The UK, like many other countries - not all - is recovering from that recession, and that is due to the government intervening when the market failed and not standing on the sidelines as some would have us do."
"There are many economic figures coming out in the UK in the next few weeks and I believe many of them will be positive."
"That is because the government has intervened."
"I think it is important for EU institutions also to intervene in difficult economic times."
"All the institutions of the EU should, in the future, make sure our budgets are aimed at helping individuals and businesses come through difficult economic times and to plan for the recovery."
"(PT) The matter I am bringing before this plenary session today is the budgetary position of the various Member States."
"I am doing so now that the time for submitting the stability and growth programmes has ended."
"These programmes forecast the medium- and long-term positions of the various Member States."
"In the specific case of my own country, Portugal, the Commission has remarked that the programme submitted is a risky one."
"That is a worrying sign for the markets, but it was essentially a sign that it was looking at stability and the health of public accounts, when it is also important to look at the issue of growth."
"Again, here too, the figures submitted by my country are not satisfactory, and concern for issues such as simplification for businesses and the situation of tax competitiveness is, unfortunately, still lacking."
"Madam President, it was actually two speeches back, but I would like to ask the gentleman over there who was advocating EU intervention how he thinks the EU should intervene against volcanic ash."
"Supplementary questions using the blue card are not permitted during the one-minute speeches."
"Thus, it was not a point of order."
"Your fellow Member could perhaps answer your question on a one-to-one basis, but in any case not during the plenary debate."
"(FR) Madam President, I would have liked you to bear in mind a male-female balance when giving the floor."
"You gave the floor to a man five times in a row."
"Thank you very much."
"As you can imagine, as President of the High Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity, equality is very important to me."
"We have a list of speakers and we did try to make it balanced."
"Who gets the opportunity to speak during the debate is, of course, also dependent on who is actually present."
"That concludes this item."
"Power of legislative delegation (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Szájer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the power of legislative delegation -."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, many speakers start their speech in Parliament by saying that their topic is important, very important or even among the most important."
"I, too, would like to say this, but with much more reason than many others, since the subject we are discussing now, Parliament's power of legislative delegation to the Commission, is perhaps the most important and yet often neglected innovation in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Those who criticised the Treaty of Lisbon spoke of a democratic deficit."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that this amendment, that is, the guarantee of Parliament's power of legislative delegation, is one of the most significant expansions of Parliament's jurisdiction."
"This means that representatives elected directly by citizens will henceforth be able, in Parliament and by virtue of their legislative powers, to oversee and veto the implementing resolutions and decisions introduced by the European Commission."
"In other words, this element of the Treaty of Lisbon, frequently mentioned in connection with the expansion of Parliament's powers, namely, that the codecision procedures have increased significantly in number and that the areas in which Parliament can participate have expanded, represents, along with the question of Parliament's power of legislative delegation, not only a quantitative but also a significant qualitative expansion."
"In other words, from now on, as the result of a long struggle and battle which has been fought here for many years, and which continues to be fought by the Members of the European Parliament, we are guaranteed that the decisions taken by the European Commission which do not fall within its own jurisdiction but are adopted through delegated legislative powers are overseen by Parliament."
"Many may say, of course, that in a formal sense, this oversight already existed."
"In a sense, that is true, but with such deadlines and in such circumstances, and as a result of such legislative and interinstitutional cooperation as did not allow for effective oversight."
"I would also like to draw attention to the fact that this new possibility, that is, Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon, will also transform the work of Parliament in the coming years, particularly if we, Members of Parliament, take these powers seriously and are truly able to take decisions on these matters."
"If the outside world and non-specialists in this area are also to understand what this is all about, since this is a very technically complex subject matter that nevertheless concerns a democratic institution and serves to eliminate the so-called democratic deficit in Europe, we should point out the following: What this means is that Parliament and the Council, the two legislative powers of the European Union, cannot on their own deal with every matter of detail."
"Parliament sits every month, and sometimes there are circumstances, like now, when we are sitting but cannot vote, even though Parliament must, after all, oversee those issues which the Council or the Commission, under delegated legislation, addresses."
"From now on, it will be possible to do so."
"In my report, I strove to make it clear that Parliament insists on these rights."
"We will not accept any additional obligation that goes beyond what is laid down in the treaty."
"We will not accept it because we wish to exercise our rights fully, and I think that European democracy will increase as a result."
"If we are to do so, close cooperation with the Commission and the Council is, of course, necessary, but we must not forget that now the competence rests with the legislators, and therefore with Parliament and the Council."
"I wish to thank everyone, all my fellow Members, for their cooperation in this complex subject matter, and also wish that Parliament will, in future, use its new powers to the full."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Szájer for the very high quality report because we in the Commission appreciate very much the support Parliament has indicated for the horizontal approach to the delegated acts."
"The legislator, of course, is entirely free to regulate all questions related to delegated acts in each basic act, but some guidelines are needed in order to avoid a piecemeal approach."
"This was the purpose of the communication the Commission already made in December to indicate to the legislator what would be the preferred course of action for having a good and practical approach to the future legislation."
"I would like to underline that the Commission strongly supports the idea of common understanding, or even interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions on the delegated acts, because this will bring the necessary order into the preparation of the legislation."
"On the substance, I can just reiterate that the Commission very much welcomes the report."
"We might disagree on some specific questions but our objectives are the same."
"We want to see precision, efficiency, transparency and a clear and fair balance of power."
"If you would allow me to be a little bit more specific, I will just make some telegraphic comments on some particular parts of the report."
"Regarding the limitative nature of Article 290, especially the second paragraph, here we have a slight difference of opinion with regard to the means of control of the legislator over the delegated acts, but we would not like to enter into the legal controversy because what we think is that it is very important to look for the practical solutions as regards specific legislation."
"Regarding the duration of the delegation of power, here we very much welcome and support the idea of tacit renewal, as expressed in the report, because we found it very constructive and we can say that some solutions of this nature have already been found in several legislative files."
"I have another specific comment on the duration of the right of objection."
"Here, again, I would say that we are singing from the same hymn sheet because we also largely share the opinion of the rapporteur for the standard formulation of two months, with a possibility of extension for an additional two months, which could be fixed in a common understanding among our three institutions, which, hopefully, we will have in the future."
"I think we have already seen something like 10 positive examples of how this was applied in the current legislative work."
"Regarding the urgency procedure, here we already had some clear examples in the past that there are issues as regards food safety or safety of toys, for instance, that sometimes call for a very urgent procedure and, therefore, we think that we have to find something even more urgent than the early approval proposition made by the rapporteur."
"If you would allow me to conclude on the alignment, because this is very important for Parliament, here again we would advocate the pragmatic approach, because this Parliament, together with the Commission, has already done considerable work as regards the alignment of more than 250 basic legislative acts which have been aligned under the pragmatic approach."
"Now we think that the priority should lie in the areas in which we have not, until now, aligned to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I think that we should focus on them."
"Again, it would be an enormous amount of work, but we are already reflecting on how we can approach it in the most pragmatic and flexible way."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has been waiting for this moment for a long time, namely for Parliament to be on an equal footing with the Council with respect to the control of legislative delegation."
"To illustrate this point: in 2008, there were 6 000 delegated acts, in other words, a huge mountain of standards, which were turned into a kind of secondary legislation by the Commission and the old comitology procedure."
"Parliament had very few rights in this process."
"We were informed, but we were not colegislators."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has now changed that."
"With regard to the control of delegated acts, we are on an equal footing with the Council, and we also want to utilise our equal standing to the full."
"That means, Commissioner, that when you argue that the urgency procedure is possible, then we will also need to receive information at as early a stage as possible."
"We want to receive information as early as the Council receives it."
"I think it is only fair to start by congratulating Mr Szájer on the excellent report he has presented to us."
"As has rightly been said, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the powers of the European Parliament and introduces rules to reinforce democratic control."
"I therefore think Parliament deserves to be congratulated twice over: not only on Mr Szájer's excellent report, which I have just mentioned, but also because the new rules abolish the old comitology system, which we have criticised so often in this House."
"We now have Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon, and I note that Mr Szájer's report suggests a number of ways of working that safeguard Parliament's prerogatives."
"With this new provision, Parliament can concentrate on essential legislative acts and give the Commission a margin of flexibility to complete non-essential legislative acts within the limits laid down by the legislator."
"As Mr Leinen has rightly said, we are now on an equal footing with the Council and, therefore, Parliament is not in a position of inferiority."
"Madam President, I would like to highlight some aspects of Mr Szájer's report that I think are particularly important."
"The first is the idea that we reject any provisions that impose on the legislator additional obligations over and above those already included in Article 290."
"Secondly, the Commission must ensure early and continuous transmission of information and relevant documents."
"Thirdly, the periods should only start once all the language versions - I repeat, all the language versions - have been received."
"The last point is that Parliament's recess periods must be taken into account."
"Madam President, these often underestimated structural issues with regard to the relationships within the institutional triangle have been summed up very well indeed in Mr Szájer's report."
"The cooperation was extremely constructive and I would also like to express my sincere thanks for that."
"Through the Treaty of Lisbon, we have created new relationships, and these new relationships must not be undermined again through the back door."
"That is actually the key point in this regard."
"The purpose behind this was to place the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council, including with regard to delegated acts, and to ensure, firstly, that this is feasible and, secondly, can be guaranteed during the procedure."
"The absolutely key issues for us, therefore, are that the appropriate conditions are created, for example, by us having clear access to the documents in good time in order to take the necessary decisions and, secondly, that no procedures are operated on the basis of a 'common understanding', but that instead we have agreements that are fixed and which cannot be subject to political arbitrariness or the political agenda of the day."
"For this, we need firm, sound rules through which we can protect the rights of Parliament in practice rather than just simply taking note of them in theory."
"Thank you, Mr Szájer. It was an excellent collaboration and I hope that we can also use it to achieve what we need to achieve for our fellow Members."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur is right to refer to the democratic deficit."
"The elitist construct that is the EU has a democratic deficit that has increased, is increasing and, after the Lisbon Treaty, will increase still further."
"I have to say that I am bemused that the rapporteur, despite his eloquence, sees Article 290 as a solution."
"Our interpretation of Article 290 is that this gives the Commission the opportunity to supplement or amend legislation."
"Such an opportunity is far-ranging and wide-sweeping and is open to almost unlimited interpretation."
"We would argue that the safeguards against the inappropriate use of the powers thereby delegated to the Commission are clearly insufficient."
"Perhaps the rapporteur will comment in his response as to why they are sufficient."
"This therefore amounts to a further transfer of power from the elected Parliament to the unelected Commission, whatever the Lisbon Treaty purports to say."
"We have always maintained, and continue to maintain, that the Lisbon Treaty lacks democratic legitimacy largely because a referendum was promised in the UK by all three establishment political parties, and all three establishment political parties spectacularly reneged on that promise."
"Article 290 is therefore a product of the illegitimate Lisbon Treaty."
"It increases the democratic deficit - I would be interested to hear from the rapporteur why it does not - and it should therefore be opposed."
"(DE) Madam President, as a fervent pro-European, I was against the Treaty of Lisbon, precisely because it makes possible the kind of arguments that we have just heard, and precisely because it has not created the clarity and explicitness that I would want above all else for future generations."
"I am a realist, however, and I would say that now we have to live with it."
"It is very important to say once more explicitly that this article, Article 290, can be interpreted as saying that not just the Council, but also Parliament can repeal the relevant delegation single-handedly and in a relatively simple way."
"We will need to remind ourselves of this again and again."
"Of course, what Mr Leinen has said is also true, namely that we now already have thousands of legislative acts which occupy a grey area in terms of comprehensibility, and which, in turn, continually provides grist to the mill of the anti-Europeans, the opponents of a European project, an EU which should function in those areas where we desperately need it."
"Once again, this has a lot to do with transparency."
"It therefore seems to me to be very important that in paragraph 10, it is proposed that the arrangements for the transmission of documents, among other things, need to be clarified explicitly."
"Quite a few of us know the Freedom of Information Act, and quite a few of us have experience of the way in which things are done in the USA."
"Why then do we not simply do a 'copy and paste' and make it possible for citizens, and also for us in Parliament, to obtain the relevant documents independently, and not by act of grace and through massive amounts of intervention by political groups?"
"Why do we not make this into a right, given that we are already taking the great risk of having thousands of delegated legislative acts?"
"On that note, I would say keep up the good work."
"We will be constructive partners on the road to revolutionising democracy."
"(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, with regard to the process for delegating executive power to the Commission, the Treaty of Lisbon has something new to say on this."
"In fact, Article 290 refers precisely to this matter."
"Indeed, delegated acts are general acts which may modify unnecessary aspects of a basic legislative act, providing a mandate for delegating executive power to the Commission."
"In practice, this allows for a mandate to be defined, along with the duration of delegation, the timeframe within which Parliament and the Council can lodge objections, as well the conditions for revoking the mandate."
"Parliament and the Council exercise control, but only after the adoption of the delegated acts."
"Delegated acts can also be published during the timeframe within which the European Parliament and Council can raise objections."
"However, I ask you, Commissioner, to guarantee greater transparency too during the process of drawing up the delegated acts."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, allow me to react to the comments of the honourable Members."
"I absolutely agree with Mr Leinen that the Lisbon Treaty brought in enormous changes."
"This was underlined by the rapporteur, Mr Szájer."
"I would like to assure you that we are fully aware of it and that we would use the procedure with the utmost respect for the legislator, because this is very important for our mutual relationship and for our good cooperative work."
"With regard to urgency and to urgent procedures, I would like to assure all of you that we will use it only in extreme, exceptional cases."
"We know that, if we abused this instrument, we would have a very difficult relationship, and it is definitely not our intention to do that."
"Concerning the comments by Mr Coelho and Ms Lichtenberger, I would like to assure you as well that we will do our utmost to guarantee and to provide you with an early transcription of all documents at the same time as the Council, and with all the necessary translations."
"We know the Lisbon Treaty introduced this very important change, that, when it comes to the legislative or financial matters, the European Parliament is on absolutely the same footing as the Council."
"Moreover, we are planning to develop a new type of cooperation whereby the European Parliament would be involved in the preparatory work of delegated acts, and we would like to do this on very solid ground."
"You will therefore also find the expression of this new relationship in the framework agreement that we are currently negotiating between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Moving to the comments by the Earl of Dartmouth and Mr Martin concerning the unlimited powers which this Article 290 should bring to the Commission, I do not think this is really the case, because it is you, the legislator, who will decide (or not) to delegate the power to the Commission."
"It is you, the legislator, who will have the chance to revoke this power or to object to the proposals the Commission will make."
"So I cannot accept that we are entering a grey zone, because I think the powers of the legislator are very clearly set out in the treaty, and the Commission will, of course, respect that."
"I wish to thank my fellow Members for this debate, since the drafting of this report was made possible by the very close cooperation between the committees - and I would make special mention of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which will have many such tasks in the coming period - and the political parties."
"I would also add, my fellow Members, that this is a struggle."
"A struggle with the Commission, a struggle with the Council, since it is a struggle for our rights."
"This report is about affirming clearly that these are our rights and we insist on them."
"It is much easier to do this in a situation in which the committees as well as fellow Members of other parties stand behind me, so that we make it clear to our partner institutions that Parliament insists most decidedly on these issues."
"At the same time, in order that we may be able to exercise this right effectively, I take the words of Mr Šefčovič as encouragement that the general alignment can speed up in the coming months and that we may indeed extend these rights as broadly as possible."
"We consider it important primarily for those areas where codecision did not previously exist."
"Another very significant aspect, which fellow Members have also mentioned here, is that access to information is important."
"This access must be set out in an interinstitutional agreement, and discussions are under way with the Commission and with the Council in this regard."
"However, we would like to know what the Council is doing; what sort of consultation it is conducting on these matters."
"As far as whether our rights have been expanded or reduced, ladies and gentlemen, please read the report and look at the legislation."
"I cannot interpret the latter any other way than that our rights have expanded."
"Until now, we had no say in what happens to the powers that we had previously delegated."
"In practice, Parliament was not assigned any role in this process."
"They listened to us out of politeness, but the deadlines were so short that Parliament did not even sit during that period."
"Now, on the other hand, we can veto or withdraw these decisions and are not even required to give our reasons - in other words, this is most definitely an expansion of rights."
"We are the ones with the legislative power and we delegate these powers to the Commission."
"Therefore, I cannot see this as anything other than an expansion of our rights."
"Fellow Members, it is now up to us alone to decide whether to exercise these rights in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Szájer for the outstanding work delivered in so little time."
"The delegated acts will be of paramount importance for Union law and the interinstitutional balance in the EU."
"Therefore, it is fundamental that they are developed and decided upon in a fully transparent manner which effectively enables the Parliament and the Council to democratically control the exercise of the power delegated to the Commission."
"To this extent, as advocated by the Szájer report, some issues will be of utmost importance and require our stronger commitment."
"These include, inter alia, the possibility for the European Parliament to revoke the delegation at any time and to make sure that Parliament and Council are conferred the same rights concerning their involvement in the process of delegation."
"Finally, I would like to stress that it should be a priority for the Commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291, including the acquis in policy areas which, pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty, are now subject to the codecision procedure."
"in writing. - I warmly welcome the outcome of the report by Mr Szájer."
"Defining the new legislative system is a difficult and complex issue."
"I am convinced that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and, in particular, Articles 290 and 291 thereof, reinforces the democratic character of the Union and rationalises its legal order."
"The introduction of the novel concept of legislative acts has far-reaching consequences."
"The report emphasises the slight differences among the key colegislators, the competences and the detailed agenda of how they work with each other."
"The real question is: in case the EC gets more legislative competences and wider legislative authorities, which means an immediate increase in Community interests, what kind of control methods should be introduced on behalf of the Council and the EP?"
"The new legislative framework of the TFEU set up the tools but there has not been any practical experience of their adaptation at Community level."
"Finally, I urge the colegislators to have an interinstitutional agreement as soon as possible between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the implementation of Article 290, as there is an urgent need for greater transparency."
"The delegation procedure, although it remains in the background, is a very important transition in quality introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It should be treated as a fulfilment of the treaty, without which the position of Parliament will not be fully consolidated in relation to the other institutions in the decision-making process."
"For it is only by this procedure that we will gain full legislative power and a role in the implementation process of any piece of legislation."
"We well know the frustration associated with the laborious process of negotiating with the Council in the codecision procedure and in the case of decisions where implementation contravenes the interinstitutional agreement."
"Hitherto, 'comitology' was an expression of Member States' lack of trust towards the Commission, whereas now, the role of Parliament in the implementation of a legal act gives the process greater legitimacy."
"Parliament, and, indirectly, EU citizens, will find themselves closer to the process of enacting EU law, and this is how we should view the delegation procedure."
"However, for this to make sense, Parliament must be given full access to information and, in this, I am in full agreement with the other participants in this debate."
"Introducing the possibility of legislative delegation is intended to ensure that legislation, and especially legislation of a technical nature, will be completed and updated more efficiently without the need to institute a full legislative procedure each time."
"Delegation should, therefore, be seen as a tool for improving the process of law making at EU level."
"At the same time, it is essential to ensure appropriate control over the use of regulatory powers conferred on the Commission."
"Parliament and the Council must, among other things, have sufficient time available to exercise the right to object to planned regulations."
"Above all, however, they must have adequate access to documents, analyses and contributions prepared during preparatory work on drafts of delegated acts."
"Only in this way will the powers of the Commission to publish delegated acts be of real service in improving the legislative process in the Union while, at the same time, retaining essential control over and transparency of the Commission's activities."
"It is also essential to develop suitable mechanisms of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, so that Parliament will be kept informed about preparatory work which is in progress and be able to gain a good knowledge of the nature of the issues under consideration."
"The resolution on the power of legislative delegation, which is the result of a compromise agreed between all the political groups, presents the above matters properly and deserves Parliament's support."
"Air safety: EU airline blacklist (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the subject of air safety: the EU airline blacklist - B7-0205/2010)."
"deputising for the author. - Madam President, the question was submitted by Brian Simpson, on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, following the Commission's report looking into the effectiveness of the EU blacklist."
"The EU blacklist was established in 2006 to name, shame and ban airlines which are not complying with international safety rules."
"It was established in response to concerns over the level of enforcement of international safety standards and on the back of several fatal air crashes over a short space of time in 2004 and 2005."
"Four years on, we know that the blacklist has proved an effective and valuable tool in promoting enforcement of ICAO safety standards and in protecting EU citizens."
"How we can now build on this is the question facing us today."
"In other words, how can we extend the protection beyond our own borders and further work towards the goal of improving global aviation security?"
"The blacklist has a responsibility not only to identify where the safety risks lie but also to ensure that this information is effectively communicated to EU citizens."
"In line with this, how can we ensure that EU citizens taking flights outside Europe are aware of banned air carriers that continue operating in other regions of the world?"
"In cases where the air carrier's licence has been revoked, and therefore the air carrier does not appear on the blacklist, how can we be sure that passengers are aware of this situation?"
"We have seen how effective the bringing together of different national blacklists into one comprehensive EU-wide list has been."
"However, the blacklist is only as good as the access we have to information relating to the safety of air carriers."
"How can we build on the information which forms the basis of the blacklist by improving the access to verifiable and reliable information?"
"This means not only looking at strengthening the checks made in EU Member States but also approving the data information received from non-EU Member States."
"Would the Commission consider establishing harmonised and standardised ramp checks and reporting?"
"In terms of improving the data information received from third countries, would the Commission consider establishing an effective system of international exchange of reliable data, bringing us closer to a kind of worldwide blacklist which I know has been mooted in the past?"
"Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the blacklist has proved an effective tool in incentivising airlines to meet international safety standards."
"But how can we work more proactively towards the ultimate goal of improving global aviation safety?"
"By this I mean, how does the Commission intend to support national civil aviation authorities in meeting safety deficits based on ICAO audits and improving their oversight capability?"
"It is crucial that we ensure effective communication channels with the public, but it is also vitally important that, in the long term, we continue to work on promoting the enforcement of international aviation safety standards around the world."
"This will ultimately be the most effective way of improving safety for all passengers."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament looks forward to working with the Commission to try and build on the EU's blacklist achievements."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I thank Mrs Ţicău for her very positive evaluation of the approach to the blacklist."
"The Commission is convinced that the existing measures already provide for a very high level of information and rights to the public for flights within and outside the European Union."
"The list of airlines banned within the European Union is made widely available to the public on the Internet and by targeted information actions."
"The Commission liaises closely with European and international travel agent associations each time the list is updated."
"This allows them to be in the best possible position to aid the passengers."
"National civil aviation authorities and airports in the territory of Member States are obliged to bring the EU list to the attention of passengers, both via their websites and, where relevant, on their premises as well."
"The list provides useful information to people wishing to travel outside the European Union in order for them to avoid travelling with these airlines."
"The list has no extra-territorial effect - it does not apply outside the European Union."
"Hence, the Regulation establishes passengers' rights to know the identity of every airline they fly with throughout their trip."
"The contracting carrier - or travel agent or tour operator - is required to inform passengers when making a reservation of the identity of the air carrier or carriers effectively operating the flight."
"The passenger must also be kept informed of any change of operating carrier, either at check-in or, at the latest, when boarding."
"The Regulation also gives passengers the right to reimbursement or re-routing if a carrier with which a booking has been made is subsequently added to the list, resulting in cancellation of the flight concerned."
"Different sources of information are used to monitor and assess the compliance of operators with international safety standards; namely, the safety audits carried out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the information provided by competent authorities of third countries, the information provided by the European Aviation Safety Agency in the framework of its inspections and investigations within the European Union or technical missions outside the European Union, the results of the ramp checks carried out on aircraft or air carriers at EU airports in the framework of the Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft Programme, according to the requirements of the relevant EU rules, and, finally, substantiated accident-related information stemming from accident or serious incident investigation reports."
"I should also mention that the European Commission does not, at this stage, have a comprehensive list of the countries which have similar legislation but several states - the Republic of Korea, Bahrain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - apply the same restrictions as those defined in the European list."
"I can confirm that the Commission is ready to work with Parliament to really improve this blacklist legislation, but it provides for much-needed safety in the air."
"Madam President, as I was rapporteur for this regulation almost five years ago, I am delighted to see that we have put in place a mechanism that works and that has even been extended over the years."
"The Commission's report on the application of the 'blacklist' regulation seems comprehensive and offers interesting food for thought."
"In particular, I endorse the idea of an international blacklist, the sole guarantee of a global harmonised level of aircraft safety."
"Nevertheless, I would like to put some questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, I would like to know how the right to defence is exercised when it is not just one air carrier that is banned, but all the air carriers of a state."
"Do all of these air carriers state their case, or just the civil aviation authority of the country concerned, and, in this regard, how can certain safe air carriers avoid being included on the blacklist?"
"Moreover, another very important point in my opinion is aeroplane monitoring."
"Does the Commission specifically monitor all the aircraft of an air carrier which has been included on the list or whose licence has been revoked, so as to ensure that these aircraft do not take to the skies again under a different name?"
"In this respect, has the Commission identified states believed to be used as flags of convenience, accepting banned air carriers which then change their name and state of registration?"
"Furthermore, in the event that an air carrier is on the blacklist, does the Commission have any information about how travel agencies and ticket sellers have notified and compensated travellers, or offered them alternatives?"
"Lastly, before I conclude, I have a question regarding a specific matter: a number of MEPs have received messages, which could be described as insistent, about Indonesia, all air carriers of which have been banned, requesting that we ask the Commission to take Indonesia off the blacklist."
"I find this pressure to be inappropriate since commercial reasons do not justify endangering passengers' lives."
"I would like to know the current situation in that country, and whether, having been on the blacklist for several years, Indonesia has taken steps to remedy the safety deficiencies of which it was accused."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is obviously a bit surreal having a debate about the blacklist at a time when the whole of aviation in Europe is in chaos, but I understand that we will have the opportunity tomorrow for a topical and urgent debate and that is exactly what we will have."
"The blacklist itself is an important topic and we can say that it has been a success thanks to, amongst other things, the impetus of Madam de Veyrac, who indeed worked hard a few years ago to make it a reality."
"We must build on and learn from the experience we have gained."
"There are some areas where further action is necessary."
"First of all, in the area of communication with passengers."
"It is right that passengers need to be informed if they are booking a blacklisted plane somewhere, at a travel agency, for example, but it is often the case that passengers decide to take a domestic flight only when they are already in a particular place."
"My proposal therefore is that we explore whether it would be possible for travel agents and airlines which book flights to countries with unsafe airlines or unsafe aeroplanes to inform passengers automatically of this even though they themselves, of course, are not on the blacklist."
"We need to think that one through."
"A second aspect here is helping passengers avoid aeroplanes, airlines and countries which have been placed on the blacklist."
"When it comes to capacity-building assistance for third countries, and certainly in the poorest countries, the European Union could provide much more help and know-how and ensure that the aviation authorities also have the necessary capacity to resolve the issues they have. One point mentioned by Madam de Veyrac is, of course, people being misled."
"Do we really have a watertight system?"
"Are we sure there are no loopholes here and there through which airlines from a country which is on the blacklist might actually operate via other countries or islands?"
"We have seen some examples of that."
"To conclude, I also think that we should work towards a worldwide blacklist."
"I would like to know what efforts you have made with your colleagues from other countries, for example, at ICAO level, to make such a list become a reality."
"Madam President, at the moment, our airspace is at a standstill - we know this; it has already been mentioned."
"We will soon be discussing how we can remedy this situation."
"We may actually have to fear, as regards economic questions in particular, that the airlines will soon face even bigger problems."
"Of course, this does not need to influence safety."
"This is about aviation safety for European passengers."
"For us in Europe, it is a great achievement that people are able to move about freely, and that consumers can decide freely how they want to travel, which air carriers to book flights with and which not."
"In order to be able to decide freely, it is, of course, necessary to actually receive the relevant information as well."
"Now we have just heard that we have already had this blacklist since 2006, and that in principle, people should be informed as to whether they can arrive safely or not."
"For me, the question is really - just as Mrs De Veyrac and Mr El Khadraoui have already said - whether there are actually holes in the system, and whether people really always get all the information on safety that they need."
"We simply want everyone who flies here in Europe to be transported safely and to arrive safely."
"Finally, another thing that plays a role with regard to safety is to know whether an airline is financially strong."
"Airlines must regularly apply to their national authorities to make sure that they are actually allowed to fly in European airspace, and this process involves not just checking whether they actually observe all of their safety obligations, carry out all the required checks and are able to transport people safely, but also checking whether they are financially strong enough to be able to stay in the transportation business in the long term."
"As far as I know, to date we have not had a European airline on a blacklist."
"Despite this, though, we have actually had the SkyEurope incident just in the last year."
"What happened then was that European citizens had booked with a European airline, but had no information on the fact that this company was on the brink of bankruptcy."
"They took the flight and were stranded, and so they had no information that would have protected them."
"This actually makes me wonder - even if the Commission has said that it has the information and is publishing it, that there is an obligation to publish it - why this, for example, was not known."
"Do we actually have a guarantee that everything that passengers need to know, everything that is required, is always passed on?"
"I would like to have an answer to this generally in the debate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Parliament showed a lot of initiative when it came to drawing up this blacklist."
"This was done in a responsible manner too, which means that it provides the highest possible level of safety for consumers."
"However - and this is also an issue now - we need to check whether it has really worked well enough in the current situation."
"The first question that I would like to ask about this is as follows."
"It is possible to access information over the Internet, but it is not always very easy with the different airlines."
"I have tried this out for myself."
"You cannot always immediately find information, for example, on connecting flights which require you to land in a third country."
"So here we have a problem then."
"The second open question, and this would be of interest to me: what experiences have people had with wet leasing?"
"Here, there have been serious concerns that it could become a loophole for enterprises which are not very reputable."
"Have there been any positive or negative developments with regard to this?"
"Third, and this is a very important point: has this way of regulating companies through the blacklist had a preventative effect on airlines, so that they - non-European ones in particular - have followed safety regulations more closely?"
"How does the selective authorisation of a few aircraft belonging to certain airlines work, where we only allow them to use certain aircraft to come to Europe?"
"Madam President, Mr Piebalgs, I hope, but am by no means sure, that the effects of the volcanic eruption in Iceland will not, by any chance, be shifted onto European passengers, if we are talking about ticket prices."
"For you are, indeed, right that these stoppages in air transport will probably be offset by higher ticket prices."
"It is worth saying this, in defence of the interests of the European consumer."
"The European Parliament is speaking on this matter yet again."
"This shows what importance we attach to the matter."
"I spoke about this a couple of months ago."
"Many of you also spoke then, and I remember the previous parliamentary term, when we spoke very openly about this, too."
"After everything that has been said, I have a personal reflection."
"A journalist from the most influential newspaper in Poland asked me, 'What do you people do in the European Parliament?"
"After all, it is such an unimportant issue.'"
"Only now have the media begun to be aware that it is a very important question, a question of security and an absolutely fundamental question from the point of view of the interests of European citizens, taxpayers, voters and consumers."
"It is not normal that we know what the blacklist in the European Union is like, but we do not know what it is like outside the European Union."
"This is a completely schizophrenic situation."
"Now to the final and very important matter: it must not be that European passengers pay extra for security - this is, after all, a matter for states and governments."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, seen in this way, the blacklist was an interesting achievement of this Parliament under the leadership of Mrs De Veyrac and her colleagues from the previous legislative term."
"The blacklist can affect companies, countries or aircraft, and I believe that in connection with this, the Commission should provide somewhat more detailed answers to the questions that have been raised, particularly as regards the extent to which companies have a say in decision making in different countries, and why this procedure takes place in connection with individual aircraft."
"Further development is also important for us."
"We have already explained in the debate a few years ago that it remains important to us for the Commission to improve follow-up on these acts and measures in communications, at least with Parliament."
"This is because there are certain questions which remain open for us, not least the monitoring of the airlines, as well as the question of aircraft which could suddenly fly under a different name at some point, and regarding the fact that today, a certain level of transparency is required for those decisions in particular which could be taken at the last minute."
"With that, I come to the point which is most important for me: information."
"All in all, we are of the opinion - and I think that this is true across the groups - that citizens and passengers have the right, and there should accordingly be an obligation, for the companies to inform them systematically that information regarding the blacklist can be obtained at airports without any problems, as well as at travel agencies, and that, especially when flying to 'certain countries' which are already known for problems today, travel agencies indicate which companies are problematic when rebookings are being made."
"For us, the aim is that this measure, which has now essentially already improved safety, is not just extended to Europe and European passengers, but is adopted worldwide."
"Madam President, I would like to raise an issue which is closely linked to aviation safety and which underlines the need to make the operation of the EU blacklist as effective as possible."
"In December 2008, the Council finally adopted the EU Code of Conduct on arms transfers."
"This code controls the export from the EU of military technology and equipment."
"However, a concern persists that not all EU arms-exporting countries are abiding by the code and that European arms are still being supplied to conflict zones."
"But one measure has been shown to be very effective in curtailing the illegal supply of arms, and that is the EU aviation blacklist."
"A Swedish study in 2008 showed that the air cargo operators who are involved in arms transfers to conflict zones are the same operators who habitually violate air safety standards."
"Maybe it is not surprising that dodgy operators with a lax approach to safety should also be revealed as dodgy operators as far as the cargoes they carry are concerned."
"But the happy consequence of this link is that the measures to ensure strict control of aircraft, measures which are designed to protect European citizens, are also helping to protect the citizens of other continents, especially Africa, from the destruction that takes place when conflicts are fuelled by abundantly available small arms and light weaponry."
"So I would ask Commissioner Piebalgs as Development Commissioner if he could add his personal weight to the Commission's efforts to ensure that the blacklists are implemented effectively and systematically."
"(RO) The blacklist of unsafe air carriers is a measure for protecting European passengers which I very warmly welcome."
"The list must be well publicised by both the European Commission and Member States, and especially by tourism agencies."
"In actual fact, it all boils down to the good faith and good will of tour operators and travel agents."
"On the other hand, a solution needs to be found for the scenario where a particular destination is only served by unsafe air carriers."
"A large number of the carriers on the blacklist serve destinations in developing or underdeveloped countries in Africa, South-East Asia and Central Asia."
"This begs a valid question: To what extent can fair competition still be guaranteed between large European, US and Far Eastern air carriers and small transport companies that have been set up in these developing countries?"
"In this respect, I believe that we need to consider how the European Union could support their development through improving the safety and security of their flights, rather than excluding them from the market via a ban."
"This would enable the European Union to fulfil a duty of honour by supporting the sustainable development of the air transport sector in these less advantaged states as well."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a general comment and then ask two or three questions, depending on how much time you allow me."
"The general comment is as follows."
"I find it almost ludicrous that in the present situation, we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, have received, in three air safety reports, a total of nine minutes of speaking time."
"Of course, there is the special session tomorrow, but I believe that it is about time for this House to pay more attention to things that really affect people, and perhaps to cut back somewhat on debates whose value has been artificially inflated."
"As for the questions themselves, Commissioner - for me the most important is: what is the situation with regard to code-share flights - these aircraft that are meant to be flown by a European airline, but which can then be operated by some other airline, even one on the blacklist?"
"What is happening here to inform people who need to fly?"
"This is a real burning issue for me, and I would expect you to answer it."
"I will leave it at that one question."
"(DE) Madam President, now that we have addressed aviation safety - and we will also be speaking and voting on the European Aviation Safety Agency the day after tomorrow - I would like to take the opportunity to broach another problematic area."
"People taking part in aviation sports in Austria and in other Member States are confronted with the fact that vitally important sets of rules for such sports are only available in English."
"The sportspeople concerned often speak excellent English; however, it is often not easy to understand a subject which is already complex in itself in a subject-specific jargon in another language."
"As a result, Member States then try to obtain expert opinions from the EU."
"This expenditure of time and effort would be avoidable, in my opinion, if the rules were available in the relevant languages."
"I am trying to make vitally important regulations for those taking part in aviation sports available in German and French too - that is, in the two more widely spoken working languages."
"(RO) The blacklist, updated on 30 March this year, features 278 companies from 17 countries."
"The EU must develop its technical and administrative capabilities in order to ensure compliance with the necessary civil aviation standards so that only airlines which comply with international security regulations can fly in the European Union."
"At the same time, however, we must also help third countries improve their civil aviation safety standards."
"Competent third country authorities need to improve their ability to monitor the air carriers they grant licences to."
"The flight safety analysis conducted in the European Union for third country operators will also include checks carried out on the ground on these companies' aircraft, bearing in mind the evidence showing serious incidents and accidents suffered by carriers last year."
"However, information must be provided to passengers during their whole itinerary, including about all the companies which they are using to make this trip."
"This information should be provided no later than at the time of purchasing the ticket."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank you for the questions."
"It has definitely demonstrated that this House is very strongly behind the blacklist approach."
"I can promise, on behalf of Vice-President Kallas, that we will improve communication with Parliament on these issues."
"I can also promise that all the questions that have been asked will be forwarded for a written answer because if I follow up with answers to the questions, I will definitely not be able to do so in the remaining one and a half minutes."
"I will, therefore, cover some of them but not because I would not be able to answer all the questions asked."
"Firstly, international aspects: the Commission works in directions such as making every possible effort to strengthen international cooperation with third countries by encouraging States to join the safety assessment of a foreign aircraft programme which encompasses all the 40 states in Europe, but also through technical assistance projects to achieve the worldwide standards."
"We also work very much with ICAO."
"We participated in the ICAO High-level Safety conference at the end of March in Montreal and also we are currently negotiating a Memorandum of Cooperation allowing further cooperation with ICAO."
"You are right; we need a global approach to this issue, but we should not underestimate the results that a blacklist approach makes on other countries."
"I will mention an example from Indonesia that was asked of me."
"Indonesia has invested a lot of effort to modernise its aviation system, including its legislation, the organisation of the authority and, by doing so, the procedures for certification, an oversight of the airlines established in this country."
"To date, it has demonstrated that it has achieved significant improvement in the case of four air carriers: Garuda, Airfast, Mandala and Premier."
"That has been achieved with the help of the Commission and also with the Member States and the industry."
"It is a process requiring adequate resources, but the Commission is very closely cooperating with these authorities and carriers in this country to allow further positive developments."
"Our approach definitely encourages countries to change their approach to aviation safety, and that is only one example."
"I shall end with a particularly important issue raised, that of consumer information."
"We require the travel agents to inform orally and/or in writing passengers at the time of reservation."
"Also, travel agents often require that if passengers agree to travel with a banned carrier, they renounce any rights to claim compensation later, but I will be happy to answer all the questions also in writing because I see that I am using up your kindness, Madam President."
"The debate is closed."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to speak in accordance with Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure because of an incident which took place here a few minutes ago, and indeed during the item of the agenda for one-minute speeches."
"At the point when you called on Hans-Peter Martin, while he was actually here, he wandered past us."
"In response to our humorous question of whether he had slept through his own speech, Mr Martin adopted a particular stance here, clicked his heels and gave the Hitler salute."
"Madam President, this is unacceptable; this is a serious breach of the customs of the House in accordance with Rule 9, and I therefore implore you to issue the appropriate call to order against this improper and unacceptable behaviour."
"I would also ask you to check whether, in connection with this, this behaviour can be documented in the recording."
"This is unacceptable."
"Even if it was a supposedly humorous provocation, jokes of this kind have no place in this House."
"Many thanks for bringing this to our attention."
"We will look into this accordingly and see what happened."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Madam President, with reference to the questions asked by Mr Simpson, I would like to ask the Commission to explain what fresh principles and plans it has in connection with ensuring the safety of passengers from Member States who fly with airlines which make internal flights in airspace not subject to European Union jurisdiction and frequently violate regulations, thus endangering passengers."
"I suggest the Commission, through the efforts of the High Representative, should develop an international agreement on this matter, which would be a guarantee of our common security."
"In addition, I would like the blacklist to make available precise information on the air carrier, which would contain comprehensive data and statistics and would show the risks, both in terms of safety and of comfort, to which passengers are exposed."
"Today's discussion is unquestionably a crucial one for the safety of passengers who travel by air in the European Union."
"I am pleased with the fact that EU Member States are observing ICAO standards in the area of the principles and techniques of international air traffic."
"It is obvious, however, that air transport is not restricted exclusively to European Union air space."
"A question, therefore, arises: how can we ensure the safety of EU citizens outside EU territory?"
"In my opinion, the European Commission should stimulate countries which do not belong to the Community to work together to create a blacklist based on EU standards, or should also play a leading role in creating a global blacklist."
"In addition, I would like to draw attention to a possible problem: when the Commission monitors an air carrier which is on the blacklist, does it also monitor in detail the whole fleet which belongs to the carrier?"
"For it may happen that an aeroplane will not be used by an air carrier which is on the blacklist, but it will be used, for example, by another company under different livery which charters individual aircraft."
"Aviation security charges (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Leichtfried, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on aviation security charges - C7-0038/2009 -."
"Madam President, at the moment, in the area of European aviation security and aviation security charges, we have a situation in which everyone does what they want."
"No one really does it properly."
"However, we will have to pay for this."
"This is something that we really should not take lying down, and this report aims to change things."
"What specifically will it change, and what does it aim to change?"
"I would just like to say in advance that on almost all points - and I would like to thank my fellow Member - there is a unanimous perception that the report could bring more transparency."
"Transparency means that on the one hand, airlines will, in future, be able to obtain information allowing them to understand what security charges will be applied to them by airports, what they are for, whether they are too much - which still sometimes happens at the moment - and, as the next step, that passengers too, of course, will be able to understand what airlines require from them."
"Here too, I have the suspicion that the transparency of the airlines is sometimes intentionally restricted, even when, as they say, they make a great effort to be transparent."
"One point which is very important in this regard is the fact that, across Europe, there are various different systems for financing security facilities."
"There are states which have financed them purely through taxation."
"There are states in which only the end-user pays, and there are others which have a mixed system."
"Our intention was to ensure that these systems could be retained."
"We do not want to prescribe to any Member State how security charges should be financed; we only want to ensure that whoever pays ultimately knows what he has paid."
"There are, or were, different ideas about which airports should be included, and we have decided that it is a question of security."
"It is not about earnings and not about profits; it is about security."
"Therefore, we have decided that all airports that are commercially run must be included, and I think that that was the correct decision too."
"Finally, we have reached a point where we have a great deal of unanimity here in plenary, namely on the point that we should make a distinction between charges for security facilities, security measures included in the EU rules, and charges for security measures which go beyond that - what are referred to as the 'more stringent measures'."
"We say that everything that falls within the EU context will stay as it is; each Member State can do what it considers right."
"If, however, security measures going above and beyond that are taken, then those Member States have to finance this themselves."
"On the one hand, this should ensure that it will be dealt with carefully, that security measures will not just be taken immediately without considering whether they are really necessary and that it will also be taken into consideration what this means for passengers and what it means for airlines and airports."
"On the other hand, it should also be ensured that, in this regard, we also apply the principle that security is a public duty as well."
"Attacks on airlines are, as a rule, not directed at airlines, but at the states from which these airlines come, and therefore we also think that, in principle, security is still a public duty, and therefore must also be financed publicly."
"I would briefly like to say something more on the amendments, which have reached an unbelievably high number - three in total."
"I think that they are all very justified and well-founded."
"I would say, particularly concerning the two amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that they are very much worth supporting, not because Mrs Lichtenberger is sitting next to me, but because they contain social requirements for employees at airports."
"I think that that is very important, particularly at times when airlines and airports are under pressure."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the proposal for a directive on aviation security charges is the result of the debate on financing aviation security which has been on the table since 2001."
"It follows on from the rising security costs observed subsequent to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, and from the establishment of an EU regulatory framework for aviation security."
"By its legislative proposal, the Commission intends to set up a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for levying aviation security charges in Europe."
"Furthermore, the Commission considers that aviation security charges should be set in consultation with airport users and should be cost-related."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Leichtfried for his fantastic work on this report and also to thank the Members of the TRAN Committee who also contributed to this report."
"I believe that the report goes precisely in the direction of the Commission's intended goals, and I welcome the support it gives to the Commission's proposal in those regards."
"I would just like to emphasise two specific issues which are dealt with in the report."
"Firstly, the report introduces what is really a new element, namely the important and sometimes very controversial question of who pays for aviation security."
"Well, the Commission's proposals did not address this issue, and the reason is that nearly all Member States insist that they are not in a position to take commitments in that regard, even though they acknowledge that public financing of aviation security should be permitted."
"The choice, in our view, should therefore be left to the individual Member States, and thus be dealt with through subsidiarity."
"With this in mind, and with respect to the position outlined in the report up for adoption, the Commission would like to note that Amendment 32, which would oblige Member States to finance more stringent measures, will give rise to intense discussions with the Council on this proposed directive."
"However, I am confident that the rapporteur knew all this, and expected this fight with the Council."
"The second issue is more for clarification, and relates to the impact assessment to be undertaken in advance of any further aviation security measures being taken under the framework regulation."
"This is definitely a very justified measure, but I would like you to know that we already have some mechanisms in place and we should not overburden ourselves."
"First, there is the Stakeholders' Advisory Group on Aviation Security which consists of air transport industry representatives among others, and it is fully involved in the conception of any proposed measures on aviation security."
"Secondly, the regulatory procedure with scrutiny ensures that Parliament can exercise its right of veto if it deems appropriate."
"Thank you very much for this excellent report."
"We look forward very much to working with the rapporteur and the Parliament and to further progress on this issue."
"(DE) Madam President, I am sorry that I must burden the plenary session, but in accordance with Rule 151, I feel forced to make a personal remark."
"I was targeted a moment ago."
"This is typical if you live in Austria."
"There is a group there which, by international standards, is classified as far-right."
"They have party leaders who make certain gestures in the air and think nothing of it."
"These are also people that cannot bear to be beaten in democratic elections, and then refuse any form of handshake or contact."
"If you wave at them, they only see one thing: the thing that they have real experience of, the Hitler salute."
"Of course, these are problems which simply show that my home country has unfortunately not succeeded in coming to terms with the past, that we will not just be dealing with one far-right party which is represented here, but soon with two."
"I would simply like to make it clear once again: we are the democrats."
"The far-right wingers sit over there."
"I am proud to belong to a political group that has managed to make a decisive contribution to the fact that we no longer have a far-right group in this Parliament and hopefully will never get one."
"The answer is thus to have more democracy and not more far-right politics, hostility towards people and cynical contempt for people."
"Those are the men who have already said that I should seek psychiatric help because they could not bear to lose elections in a democratic manner."
"Blue card questions on a personal comment under Rule 151 are not permitted."
"Your request to speak on this point therefore cannot be accepted."
"(HU) This is a blue card question addressed to the previous speaker."
"I would like half a minute to ask a question."
"Madam President, this intervention - which is totally acceptable - is interfering with a debate on a subject."
"I would suggest that you place this sort of thing in between the reports."
"Many thanks."
"We will now continue with the debate."
"I allowed the personal explanation because the previous point of order referred directly to Mr Martin."
"We will now go on with the debate and also devote our full attention to it."
"Madam President, at the outset, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for a splendid report and for ideal cooperation during our work on this document."
"We had to answer four questions, but first we had to state the task, which was protection of the interests of airline passengers, and this was the most important part of our work."
"However, the four questions we asked ourselves were a matter of answering a question about transparency, or which groups might be admitted to participate in the procedure."
"It was a question about the scope of the directive, or at which airports the directive can be applied."
"There was one very important question, about financing, which the Commission was not able to answer."
"However, together with Mr Leichtfried, we did manage to find a solution, and I thank him especially for this."
"I am talking about the more stringent measures, which should be financed by the Member States."
"Another matter concerned the competence of the independent supervisory authority in establishing charges connected with air traffic security."
"During our work, we developed a common position, which I consider a very ambitious one."
"It is, today, a challenge for the Council and the Commission."
"I think that we, as airline passengers, and in contradistinction to the passengers of ships, cars and railways, should not have to pay for this kind of security."
"This is a gesture to the Council, it is a compromise position and I expect, today, an equally ambitious position from the Council."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, to begin with, I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work, some would even say a fantastic piece of work."
"Thank you, therefore, and thanks to those who have contributed to it."
"Might I just remind you that the issue of funding is not a new one."
"This dossier has actually been in the making since the moment we adopted a European regulation on the application of security measures at European level in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001."
"Right from the outset, the European Parliament has always stressed that the funding issue is a serious one and that we have to find a European solution to it."
"However, the Council has always obstructed this."
"As a follow-up to this debate, we should again call on the Council to honour the agreements it has made with us in the past, particularly the one that would allow us to draft a separate proposal on this issue, and to commit itself to working with us towards a solution."
"Obviously, we need to bear in mind a few considerations."
"The first and the most essential one is transparency."
"At the moment, we are not looking into exactly who in each of the Member States should foot the bill."
"However, one thing we certainly do want is to organise a consultation on this issue, to reach agreements and then to stick to those agreements."
"In other words, what we want to see is the revenue generated by security charges actually being ploughed back into financing security measures and not, for example, into some sort of parking."
"That is essential and it should be clear that we must not budge on this issue."
"A second important consideration is that we need to make a distinction between security measures which we all have agreed jointly at a European level, and other additional measures being taken individually by Member States."
"As far as the first consideration is concerned, the transparency rules are clear and they have to be applied."
"As far as the second one is concerned, we have to make it clear that the financial responsibility lies with Member States and that they are the ones that have to foot the bill for additional security measures."
"Coordinating security measures at a European level would also be a bonus and if Member States decide on their own to introduce body scans or whatever, well, they will also have to bear the financial consequences of that."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, also on behalf of Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert."
"She cannot be here today."
"She arranged everything together with you, and was also completely satisfied."
"We can also say that another thing that shows how good the report is is that there has been pretty unanimous voting in the Committee."
"This is also - just like the question for oral answer which was just raised - a question of protecting consumers, and it is also a question of aviation security."
"We want security to be in place; however, we also want consumers to know how much they are paying for what."
"It has already been pointed out that the systems in different Member States are very different, and we do not want to change that in general either."
"We do not want to impose anything."
"We do, however, want there to be transparency on how the costs are put together and on the proportion that is to be paid by the consumer."
"This is not always provided at the moment."
"That is, we want to know what proportion of the ticket price - at the moment it is just a proportion of the ticket price that is paid for security - is really relevant to security."
"Then we also want a guarantee that what is paid for security is also actually used for security, and that no one profits from it."
"I think that the approach that we have developed on this is also a completely logical one."
"There is a critical sticking point between what Parliament would like and what the Member States think is good, and this is the question of who will pay for additional security measures taken which go beyond what we want in Europe for passengers."
"Here, we have said that actually, the Member States should do this."
"It is a question of national security in which the national states, too, must take a strong interest."
"Of course, the states do not want to pay for it."
"As has already been noted, with regard to the question of whether we want body scanners or not, we will undoubtedly also have to consider whether we want to have them throughout Europe or not, and who will eventually pay for them."
"Of course, we will also have to ask whether they really provide more security."
"So, aviation security charges of this kind must be administered transparently."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, once upon a time, an airport was a place where you bought a ticket for a flight, checked in your baggage, showed your passport and took off or landed."
"Today, airports are more like a small town, offering all kinds of facilities - but with security measures that have made them something of a Fort Knox, and things are only moving in one direction: towards more and more of them."
"Certainly, aircraft crashed in the old days, and unfortunately they still do."
"That is why it is important that the same rules apply both within and outside of the EU."
"In this context, the EU is too small to be an isolated island."
"This is an area where we can see the benefits of having the same rules, the same transparent rules, for aircraft from every country."
"That also applies to charges."
"Everyone - both passengers and airlines - needs to be clear as to what is covered by an aviation security charge."
"Nobody should be lost in a jungle of unclear charges and levies."
"Passengers need to know exactly what the charge covers, nor should they have to pay special national charges or pay extra for airlines."
"I wholeheartedly support the report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, first, I would like to thank the rapporteur, as well as the other groups, for their work."
"We had an interesting discussion in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I am, however, of the opinion that we have already made many compromises with the Council, which has shown itself to be very unwilling to compromise here, just as it has in the past."
"For when we start to talk about implementation, that is when the discussion gets going."
"Here, we as Parliament should also expect the support of the Commission for the idea that security charges will apply to all airports."
"We should not repeat what we have already done in other areas - whether ground handling or aviation charges - that is, to allow for exceptions affecting two or five million passengers."
"The second thing, and this is even more important for me, is, of course, to ensure transparency for passengers - who pays how much for what - and that is unequivocally a duty for the airports as well as the airlines."
"This is quite an important consideration in my view."
"With that, I come to the third point, payment - an area in which there are always sticking points, of course."
"With regard to financing, personally, I am of the opinion that public security should be paid for with public funds."
"We are already compromising by leaving some things to so-called subsidiarity."
"This is always an effective trick here in the House, and also together with the Commission: if you cannot get a solution with the Council, then you simply call it a question of subsidiarity."
"Personally, I am not very happy about that, but there we are."
"Therefore, I think we should at least stick to what we have said here, namely that special measures, stricter measures, must definitely be paid for from the public purse."
"Security charges and security overall have increased significantly in recent years."
"Therefore, this dossier also has an economic aspect."
"We are now talking about around 30% of the costs."
"If we are talking about security and who pays for it, that will have an economic aspect tomorrow as well."
"Therefore, these three points are crucial for me."
"I hope that, at least with the current requests, we will get a positive result with the Council and the Commission."
"(RO) The legislation being tabled offers a framework for setting aviation security charges which is transparent, non-discriminatory and allows the right of appeal."
"Airport security is the responsibility of Member States."
"Passengers are the ones, however, who ultimately pay for security measures through the price of their ticket."
"This is why passengers are entitled to be told separately how much of the final ticket price is to pay for security."
"The directive on aviation security charges and the directive on airport charges should be harmonised."
"Parliament has asked on repeated occasions for the aviation security charges specified in this directive to be used by companies and airport operators only for implementing aviation security measures."
"Parliament has also asked for transparency and a correlation of the security taxes and charges with the objectives being pursued."
"Member States can also apply tighter security measures, the cost of which, however, will be borne entirely by Member States."
"These security measures should not, all the same, impede the smooth flow of passenger traffic at airports."
"Unfortunately, here in Brussels in particular, we encounter endless queues which passengers stand in to be able to travel."
"I would also like to mention the ban on bringing liquids on board."
"This means that various items can be confiscated."
"Unfortunately, at Brussels airport, for example, there is a long-winded procedure involving both additional charges and the confiscation of items."
"Regrettably, this procedure does not include the option of receiving the item later at the addressee's address."
"(SK) The introduction of security charges has brought a new financial cost to the aviation market, which airport operators and airlines will immediately and adroitly pass on to passengers."
"It is therefore right to look for mechanisms to protect passengers in order to prevent fictitious amounts concealed as security charges being added in a non-transparent way as well-hidden items, with the aim of generating unjustified profits for crafty entrepreneurs in the aviation sector."
"The level of these charges should correspond only to costs demonstrably incurred in securing the safety of passengers."
"Our duty, Commissioner, is therefore to define clear and transparent rules - rules which will eliminate the current anarchy in this sector and prevent operators in future from exploiting mandatory measures for the protection of passengers in order to make unjustified profits."
"It is necessary to define rules, and not to establish more institutions and authorities which will burden passengers, airline operators and also taxpayers with yet more additional costs."
"Commissioner, if we want to help Europe become competitive, we must forget about setting up new authorities."
"Authorities do not create the added value which can raise living standards for our citizens."
"Thank you for your attention."
"We had a technical problem here, so it was somewhat longer than a minute."
"However, the clock is now working again, and hopefully everything should now go according to the set timetable."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the effects of the volcano ash cloud on Europe's airspace, which, as is well known, caused many thousands of flights to be cancelled, are a good example of why aviation security is important."
"There is already a big argument over who should cover the costs arising from this - who should pay for the natural disaster, so to speak - and to what extent the restrictions are justified."
"While transport ministers are agonising over this, we must decide which costs relating to anti-terror security regulations, which are becoming more and more restrictive, can be passed on to passengers."
"In the end, the costs of a task to be undertaken by the state, namely the maintenance of public safety, cannot simply be shifted on to the citizens like this."
"Only if countries themselves have to take financial responsibility for the strict security measures which have been prescribed can we prevent the possibility of a wild increase in the number of body scanners and other rather ridiculous security measures."
"While we are still struggling with the SWIFT agreement, the US is concluding agreements, in the name of fighting terror, to exchange passenger data with the European Commission and the various aviation organisations."
"Furthermore, the fact that the lack of air traffic controllers and their growing workload could have fatal effects on aviation safety was pushed into the background in the discussion."
"Since the liberalisation of the 1990s and the vision of a unified European airspace, it has mainly been costs, and not so much safety, that seem to be at the forefront of consideration."
"What is clear is that the ash cloud has only delayed the pilots' strike which has been announced."
"So one might take an ironic view of this: hopefully, we will not go from one chaotic aviation situation to another."
"(FR) Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, on his text and his spirit of cooperation on this matter, and I particularly support his proposals on the financing of aviation security, since we are discussing aviation security here, and not air safety."
"Our committee has been fighting for many years to gain acceptance for the principle that the most stringent security measures should be funded by the Member States, and I fully support our rapporteur on this point."
"In fact, security does not concern only travellers, but all citizens, and it is the states' responsibility to take counterterrorism measures."
"It is therefore not justifiable to make air passengers alone bear the cost of security measures in airports and on board aeroplanes, all the more so since, on means of transport such as trains and ships, security measures are financed by the states, either partly or fully, as appropriate."
"I therefore think that we need to stand up to the Council and defend to the bitter end Amendment 32 of the report adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I would like to quickly raise another point."
"While I support the progress that the text will bring in the field of non-discrimination and transparency, I do not believe that the objective of this directive is to put in place a single and identical system for security charges in Europe."
"While respecting the common rules, the Member States must be allowed to keep their current systems for levying charges."
"Thus, in states such as Spain, Italy or France, the charges are approved by their parliament and, in these cases, it is the authority responsible for investigating appeals to laws which must act as the independent supervisory authority."
"This is the subject of Amendment 40 which, I hope, a great number of you will support when we vote on it."
"(ES) Madam President, despite the difficulties that have become cruelly obvious this week associated with the current lack of a single European sky and, more importantly, of a genuine single authority to control and manage that single sky, little by little, we are moving closer to the target that we set ourselves, and this text should be one more tool to help us along that road."
"I am aware of the tenacity of the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, whom I congratulate on his work and also on his particular sensitivity to air transport and social issues."
"In this case, however, I feel that we might be falling prey to a degree of naivety and maximalism, and that by seeking perfection, we are running the risk of not achieving the best outcome."
"While I am entirely in agreement with creating a common system, including an independent supervisory body with the ability to establish fair and transparent powers in relation to charges, and with taking into account environmental and social criteria and passenger protection, etc., I still think that some aspects are missing, which I would like the Commission to clarify."
"For example, I refer to what Mrs De Veyrac just said: I do not see a clear acknowledgement of the system by which a national parliament votes on charges by parliamentary agreement, as it is the body that has to apply them."
"I am also finding it difficult to see - and I would like the Commission to clarify this - how viable this text can be given the differences with the Council and, more importantly, the consistency, or lack of it, in my view, between this text and the general directive on airport charges."
"Given the major uncertainty and disagreement over who is going to pay for this security - which I admit is public security - I think we need to make it clear that, when we talk about the Member States paying, it is the public in general who are going to pay."
"When we talk about Member States, it sounds like an abstract person, but it is not: it is every one of us citizens who travels, as well."
"I therefore fear that we will ultimately see very little progress."
"I would therefore like the Commission to give its opinion on how it sees the future of this text."
"(RO) It is true that air transport is the safest out of every form of transport."
"However, aviation incidents with global ramifications, like the one which took place 10 days ago, or the chaos created by a volcanic eruption, make us face up to the issue of the whole safety and security chain in the aviation sector: airports, airlines, control towers, aircraft, crew and passengers."
"There needs to be a particularly close bond between all these links, along with open communication."
"Passengers concerned about their own journey and comfort cannot understand the need for security measures, no matter how lax or tight they might be, and even the costs they incur, unless they are aware of the significance of such dramatic or tragic events as those of 11 September 2001."
"A terrorist threat, pilot error, technical defects, a misunderstanding between the pilot and control tower and unforeseen atmospheric conditions are all factors which must be predicted and stringent measures must be taken to apply the regulations both in spirit and according to the letter."
"I agree with adopting exceptional measures in the scenarios already mentioned."
"However, these measures must be transparent."
"Passengers are entitled to and must enjoy a safe journey to the same extent as they are entitled to know the truth."
"Unfortunately, communication and transparency are features of the aviation security sector which need to be improved urgently."
"This is the task of airports and airlines which must become more open and transparent."
"On the other hand, passengers need to realise that they must be aware that the security measures applied at airports and onboard aircraft, no matter how stringent they might be, are ultimately for their benefit and their benefit alone."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Leichtfried for an excellent report which contains good, sustainable proposals."
"What, in the end, is the issue here?"
"It is about strengthening transparency, consumer protection, security and coordination, as well as quality control."
"I would, however, advise against creating a new authority to deal with these questions."
"I take a positive view of the subsidiarity in the report, and it should definitely be retained."
"It is also very important for me that there should be a clear separation between taxes and charges, and all government tasks - whether fingerprinting and photographing, police tasks, fighting terrorism or something similar - must clearly be financed through taxation and not through consumer charges."
"If individual states then have a vital interest in taking security measures that go beyond this, then I think that, in this area, they also have the duty to bear the costs."
"Whoever orders government-related security measures also pays for them."
"I think it is different in the case of technical or personal security, which can certainly be passed on to the passenger, as long as its purpose is clearly declared."
"It is worth noting, though, that in the impact assessment that the Commission has put before us, we are talking about a sum of around 0.1% of the total fare for these measures."
"We should therefore not start too high."
"I believe that we are bringing about a sustainable compromise, including with the Federal Republic of Germany, which has considerable reservations here in the area of subsidiarity."
"I would hope that the end result is very close to our proposal."
"(CS) Although I fully support this proposal, because it greatly increases the transparency of rates and the calculation of security charges for all European consumers who use air transport, I am amazed that there is not more harmonisation in this important area."
"I am concerned that, because of the dominant position of certain airports, passengers will pay excessively high security charges with no direct impact on the level, speed or quality of security measures at check-in."
"In its evaluation report for the two years after this directive entered into effect, the Commission should have been much more courageous and should have proposed a unified and binding method for calculating security charges throughout the EU."
"I fully agree with the demand for more stringent measures, such as body scanners, to be financed by the state and not by passengers, especially as the debate is still continuing over the need for them and the associated health risks."
"Last but not least, I am concerned about the interpretation of the provisions on charging for the cost of security measures implemented not by airports but by the airline companies directly, as these costs may, on the contrary, be charged to passengers, and this, in my view, means there is a potential risk of abuse in the form of over-charging."
"Madam President, Mr Leichtfried is right."
"The cost for extra security should, in the end, be covered by the Member States."
"After all, the passengers, and every citizen, are already paying the Member States for their security in general."
"The state cannot simply say to its citizens, 'you get exactly what you pay for'."
"Its obligations go beyond that, because the state is not simply another service provider motivated exclusively by profit."
"I am reminding you of this simple truth because, in spite of this principle, the passengers and not their states are footing the bill for extra air security in the end, as the rapporteur rightly notes."
"Moreover, many times the extra security that passengers are getting by paying extra charges is not even provided by the state, but by subcontracted private companies, often disregarding the passengers and their rights under the general shelter provided by the secrecy covering security matters in general."
"That simply should stop."
"(DE) Madam President, given that aviation security charges within the EU have been dealt with in very different ways, I think it is important to apply an objective measure here."
"It would make a lot of sense to take a combination of the number of passengers and also maximum take-off weight as the basis for assessment."
"It is important, however, that there is a clear connection between the security charge levied and the services which are actually provided."
"It is important to define aviation security itself, and we must also know exactly what we are paying for."
"The exact way in which the security charges will be calculated must be comprehensible."
"Information on the size of the charges, and what they consist of, must be provided openly."
"Transparency is imperative here."
"For this, however, we need independent regulatory authorities in order to be able to counteract any distortion of competition quickly and efficiently."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this debate on aviation security has been a fascinating one, and shows that we all have our own experiences in this field."
"In my case, I lost all the cheese I wanted to bring because it was tartinable!"
"I thought that excessive, but nevertheless believe that we have provided improvements throughout the system."
"The Commission proposal goes one step further because where there is security, there are also charges, and the first rule is transparency."
"The report and the Commission proposal strengthen each other."
"On the question of who should collect the charges, my view is that subsidiarity is still the best way because, after all, it is not Member States, but citizens, that pay."
"The only question is whether it should be all taxpayers that pay or just those who are passengers."
"That is not a simple question to answer, but I consider the subsidiarity aspect to our proposal to be in keeping with today's aviation security arrangements."
"Parliament is going one step further, in looking at the whole of the aviation security sector."
"We will see where that debate leads."
"I believe the Commission has made a very decent proposal and am very glad that Parliament has broadly accepted it and is, as usual, going a little further than does the Commission proposal."
"I believe that the timing and scope of the proposal are correct."
"Madam President, I am somewhat embarrassed after so much praise, and so I will keep it short."
"I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, who have worked hard together: Mr Zasada, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Kohlíček."
"We have worked hard on this matter for nearly a year now."
"This is how I see European politics, not as a forum for bickering to provide a spectacle, as perhaps other fellow Members are doing."
"Second, I would like to address the Council and make an appeal to them."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism is actually a very amicable committee, a committee which works and argues in a businesslike manner, and in this spirit, we have very much met the Council half way on this law."
"From the start, we have been very willing to compromise."
"However, I would like to warn the Council to let sleeping dogs lie."
"If you are willing to compromise, then you must also be able to expect compromises from your opponents or partners."
"If the Council is not at all willing to meet the European Parliament half way now, then the attitude of this committee will also change."
"This is not only my opinion."
"I have already heard from some colleagues that if the Council is not willing to meet us half way, then we will also discuss body scanners in quite a different light and perhaps also not be willing to meet the Council half way."
"This is something which is not in the interests of the matter as a whole and which absolutely must not happen."
"This is why I am appealing to the Council and the Member States to move on this."
"We now have the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Both the Council and the Member States must keep moving on this, otherwise we might once again hear: Come on, let's SWIFT again!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Mr Leichtfried should be commended for a thorough and conclusive report, which had dealt effectively with many of the issues left open by the Commission paper."
"However, there are some questions which remain unresolved and these issues should be viewed in a new context following the prolonged closure of European airspace."
"With the aviation industry set to lose upward of €1 billion as a result of the volcanic ash cloud, the EU must act quickly and decisively to ease the financial blow on the aviation industry."
"Though Commissioner Almunia must be applauded for his favourable comments on the crisis today, we as MEPs also have the opportunity through this report to aid an industry which has just been brought to its knees for the third time in the last ten years."
"This house and our colleagues in the European Council and Commission should begin to consider state funding to cover the proposed security costs, particularly in the event of a low passenger threshold not being passed."
"While these measures were not popular before the eruption last week, we are currently at the point where any missed opportunity to provide assistance to the aviation industry could prove to be fatal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his excellent work on the report on aviation security charges, which considers, among its various aspects, one important point: consumer protection and passengers' rights."
"There have to be clear and transparent rules because, if airlines charge passengers extra for security measures, this information should be made available, in my view, to ensure that passengers are not out of pocket."
"I believe that it is only right that consumer protection organisations should take part in the consultations and thus gain an insight into the pricing of security measures, which they can then check against the ticket price."
"Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee greater transparency and information for passengers."
"Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (recast) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (recast) - C7-0111/2009 -."
"As Mr Simpson cannot be here, Mr El Khadraoui will speak on his behalf."
"deputising for the rapporteur. - Madam President, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson, is not able to join us today and has asked me to read out his statement."
"The recast on the development of the guidelines of the TEN-T network seeks to bring together the various amendments adopted over the years to the guidelines and to incorporate amendments that take account of the enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States."
"To give a bit of background to the report, the guidelines give direction to the development of the Trans-European transport network."
"The objective is to establish the network gradually by 2020 by integrating land, sea and air transport infrastructure networks throughout the Union."
"Turning back to the report at hand, it is, strictly speaking, a codification of the legislative text, but, because the Commission made some minor changes to the annex, they were forced to do it via the recast procedure."
"The changes to the annex are to correct initial mistakes that were made during the accession of the 10 new Member States that joined in 2004."
"The changes are not about updating the maps or making any substantive changes."
"The two changes the rapporteur has introduced to the report involve minor modifications in the recitals and some technical corrections to the maps."
"These are in line with the changes made by the Council and in line with correcting the guidelines."
"Following the Commission's advice, the decision was taken, both by Council and by Mr Simpson as rapporteur with the backing of the Transport Committee, not to make any substantive changes to the guidelines."
"The rapporteur is, however, aware that the Greens have retabled their own amendments seeking to update the line between Munich city and Munich airport, but the rapporteur would like to reiterate the point that the changes we are making in this report are about correcting the text, not updating it."
"The point of this recast is to bring everything into order ahead of the real revision of the guidelines during early 2011."
"It is important to ensure the clarity of the guidelines in preparation for the more substantial changes that will take place next year."
"We are all eagerly awaiting the real revision of the guidelines and the chance to further develop the TEN-T network but, in order to get to that stage, we need to get the current legislation right, and that is what we have done here."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very grateful to the speaker and rapporteur."
"This is exactly what we have been looking for, so that is why I have on this point nothing to add because I think it describes exactly what is at issue."
"I will just concentrate on this measure revision, where we stand on it, because it is important to see it being the process."
"Based on the Green Paper of April 2009, the Commission has launched a public consultation with more than 300 answers and set up six expert groups, which help to work on the results of consultation in a new policy proposal."
"In a very short time, there will be a proposal to the college, a document that will outline the methodology for establishing the new trans-European transport network."
"So we foresee that this could be presented to the college on 5 May."
"Then this methodology will definitely be presented to this House and the Council."
"The Commission will then engage in the preparation of the proposals for the new TEN-T and its financing."
"So, our expectation is that we will be able to adopt this in the college in the first semester in 2011."
"I am very grateful to Parliament for understanding the necessity for minor changes and I am looking forward to our having a very broad and strong debate on new outlines for the trans-European transport network in the months to come."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank those Members who, following the information imparted by the rapporteur and also by the shadow rapporteurs, have allowed the swift conclusion of the parliamentary process concerning this matter."
"They have desisted from tabling amendments which, although acceptable in terms of their content, would have been an obstacle to the adoption of this codifying text."
"We are now in a position to give the Commission the basis for the programming of the TEN-T of the next decade."
"In a specific effort to make the timescales shorter, from the moment the rapporteurs took up this matter, they reached an agreement not to table amendments that were not agreed on with the Council."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism has approved the technical modifications examined by the legal services of Parliament and of the Council, and the Council has stated that it can conclude at first reading if we vote along these lines, which is entirely acceptable."
"The few changes made by the Committee on Transport and Tourism are consistent with this objective, and I regard them as appropriate and useful for presenting a coherent and accurate final text."
"Therefore, I support the amendments tabled, although I do not consider appropriate at this time the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which has already been rejected in the vote within the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Although the content of the amendment - namely the modification of a map relating to Munich Airport - is acceptable, there will be an opportunity to table it again during the review of the TEN-T, which could even take place by summer, since the work in the European Commission is progressing quickly."
"This technical document allows Annex I to be updated by including the maps of all Member States and the target deadline to be changed to 2020."
"The in-depth debate on updating the list of TEN-T projects is planned for the end of the year."
"This list should include the development of Black Sea maritime corridors, road links with the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, as well as the extension of the current priority projects 6 and 17 so that the high-speed railway line can reach Bucharest and Constanţa."
"The eruption of the volcano in Iceland has highlighted to us the weakness of the European transport system."
"The European Union ought to have had an efficient system for redirecting passengers to other forms of transport."
"It is becoming absolutely vital for a trans-European transport network to be developed so that high-speed railway lines can serve not only all the Member States' capitals but other large European cities as well."
"Another increasingly important aspect is the development of transport along inland waterways and the European maritime corridors."
"Madam President, the trans-European networks are a topic which is keeping us busy in this plenary session, and which should keep us even more busy."
"We now have a recast, and some people - Mr Silvestris, for example - have been surprised that the Greens have put forward amendments proposing changes to the list of the trans-European networks, or what is considered to form part of this."
"They must not forget that what we have suggested involves a special case: namely where the Member State itself has said that this part of the trans-European networks is only a feeder and will therefore no longer be relevant for us; this famous flight path - now I am talking like Mr Stoiber;"
"I think this is contagious, and quite dangerous - is something we do not want to build any more; one would, so to speak, have built a feeder to Munich Airport."
"This is the reason for our amendment, therefore."
"I also generally think, however, that we should apply ourselves with particular care to revising the trans-European networks, and we should consider a point which is particularly important to me."
"There is a study by a Dutch person - I will gladly pass it on to the Commissioner, when he is here - which, for me, is very relevant for the coming debate, and which shows that the costs of a large project - and it very often involves large projects - are, as a rule, underestimated by an average of 45%, and their benefit is always overestimated, since that is needed in order to implement the project."
"That means that we must completely rethink the cost estimate for trans-European projects, and I would call on you to do that."
"It is our responsibility to give our citizens good, clear information."
"The definition of trans-European transport networks is a fundamental step towards improving transport connections for residential and industrial areas across Europe."
"While in the North, West and South of Europe, railways and roads terminate at sea ports, roads and railways in the East have the enormous potential to continue eastwards across the whole of Asia to the shores of the Pacific."
"Asian countries such as China, Japan and India are experiencing significant economic growth and are becoming major trading partners for European companies."
"It is therefore necessary, along with the construction of an internal European transport structure, to also open up transport routes to the East."
"The broad-gauge railway line from Vladivostok reaches the border of the EU at Čierna nad Tisou."
"A project has been drawn up for this line to be continued to Vienna, linking it to the Danube, to the ports and, of course, to the European network."
"In my opinion, projects such as this should also receive very significant support in the future. Thank you."
"(DE) Madam President, yes, I rather prefer 'non-attached'."
"Even though, at this point, we are only talking about a recasting of the guidelines, I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity to mention a project that is particularly problematic for Austria."
"The Brenner Base Tunnel is part of the high-speed rail axis from Berlin to Palermo and the trans-European transport network programme and it is intended to cross under the Innsbruck to Bozen axis."
"The current situation is that the EU has left Austria, Tyrol, northern Italy and also southern Germany in a state of uncertainty and there is a risk of the tunnel becoming a black hole for billions of euros."
"The original cost estimate of EUR 4.5 billion from 2002 has long since been exceeded and experts expect higher construction costs in the region of EUR 16 billion."
"Moreover, the financing has still not been clarified."
"In principle, the project is supposed to be financed partly by the Member States concerned and partly by the EU."
"However, the EU refuses to make a legally binding promise for the period after 2013 and, as a result, is leaving the aforementioned countries in a state of uncertainty."
"That is not all, however."
"Of course, in order to ensure that the tunnel is fully utilised, appropriate feeder lines also need to be established."
"The catchment area concerned stretches from Munich in the north to Verona in the south and, in this regard, the financing is totally unclear, including on the Italian side."
"My request is therefore that, when the TEN projects are launched, they must not be subject to insufficient planning by one party, leaving the Member States concerned to foot the bill."
"The EU must accept at least 50% of the costs, and the planning and the promises must be forthcoming with due speed."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport networks initially sound very technical."
"However, the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, has already pointed out that they are, of course, vital from the point of view of future economic development in Europe."
"Roads are the arteries of our economy."
"That is something on which we all agree."
"We also have to acknowledge time and again that, as an economic and trading centre, Europe is in competition with the large economic and trading centres of America and South-East Asia."
"It is therefore necessary for us to develop our inland transport systems for the domestic market while, on the other hand, of course also linking Europe's export capacity with the development of the trans-European networks and continuing to strengthen them further."
"The purpose of traffic arteries is to take up originating traffic and turn it into terminating traffic and ultimately, to take it to where the customers are."
"The big issue in this regard is, of course, that the development of major traffic axes is also intended to provide access to the area and thus has an economic development role - we really must not forget that."
"Europe is a continent that has very many coastlines and very large ports and these ports need to be linked together - in this regard, mobility is essential."
"However, we must not simply take a 'just-in-time' approach."
"We also need to work in a cost-effective, environmentally sound and environmentally friendly way."
"This will be particularly important in future."
"An absolutely crucial question will be: can we turn the north-south and east-west links that we currently have in terms of rail, road and inland waterway systems into a real network, because we have to acknowledge that there are bottlenecks here that we need to get round."
"In this regard, there are, of course, certain things that need to be taken into account."
"When it comes to the longest trans-European axis - from Palermo to Berlin - this should be extended further via Rostock in the direction of Scandinavia."
"These are things that we will need to take into account in future."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Madam President, the text that we are concerned with today updates and consolidates the procedure for establishing trans-European networks, to prepare us for the definitive launch of the penultimate and final phases of the review, now in a Europe of 27 that is richer and more spatially complex and which has new, innovative mobility needs."
"The Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency is now almost fully up and running, we have almost all the coordinators for the corridors, and we hope that soon, we will have the remaining ones so that they can promote the corridors that we need."
"Our neighbours, especially in the Mediterranean, also have enormous expectations regarding these networks and their own networks, and we are looking forward to receiving the communication that the Commission has promised us on the methodology, which will complement the consultation and the debates, before starting work on one of the most exciting exercises for our Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"The mobility and cohesion network is becoming a reality and, for the first time, it will connect the EU-27 common area in an integrated and dynamic way."
"It will identify the essential hubs - ports, airports and logistical hubs - overcoming the border barriers."
"It will include, among other things - if you will allow me to mention it -breaking through the centre of the historical barrier of the Pyrenees with a low-level tunnel."
"It will thus achieve a plan for the future of 21st-century Europe that has such strength of conviction that it will secure the necessary funding."
"That is our challenge, but for now, we will be more humble and limit ourselves to approving this first legislative polishing exercise, for which I would like to congratulate our Chair, Mr Simpson."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Transrapid system should not be included in these guidelines."
"It does not fit into the European landscape."
"It does not reduce the differences between the systems that we currently have; it increases them."
"We have paid out billions to create a uniform system, and here billions are being paid out at national level to counteract that."
"That cannot be allowed to happen!"
"Although the European Parliament had previously come out against the Transrapid system, it suddenly reappeared in 1996 as a project between Berlin and Hamburg."
"It then suddenly disappeared again - and no one knows why."
"In 2004, the Transrapid link between Munich airport and Munich Central Station appeared just as suddenly."
"That was then halted in Germany, with the additional support of the State Government of Bavaria."
"There was agreement about scrapping this project - no one wanted it any more."
"That is why it must no longer be included in these guidelines."
"After leaving office, the former Minister-President of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, was appointed to campaign for a reduction in bureaucracy here in Europe."
"That is his responsibility."
"He is also the one who now has to take the decision that this Transrapid system does not belong in these guidelines."
"That is something that we should all take note of."
"We must get rid of this Transrapid system."
"It was a nice model from a scientific perspective, but it has no place in Europe."
"It does not belong here and, as such, does not belong in these guidelines."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, and, at the same time, express my regret that he cannot be with us here today."
"We will manage, nevertheless."
"I would particularly like to express my congratulations for taking the approach of essentially leaving things as they are in these guidelines, because there is one principle that is very important, namely reliability and calculability on the part of the European legislator."
"That is certainly fulfilled with this report."
"Secondly, I would like to mention that we also need a proposal for the future when we can once again decide what is really part of the TEN system and what is not."
"We could conduct the debate in the way that it is, to a certain extent, already being conducted."
"Some people are arguing charismatically in favour of linking a boot with an island and the others say that that absolutely must not be included."
"However, that is the wrong way to go about it."
"We need to look at what adds value for the European Union and European taxpayers."
"Moreover, support should clearly be provided in places where the Member States are already doing something, where something is happening, because then, something really will happen and we will not have a situation where TEN plans are made that are then never implemented."
"European citizens and passengers will benefit, as will those Member States that commit themselves ultimately to moving traffic away from the roads and on to the rail system."
"(DE) Madam President, as a result of the fall of the Iron Curtain and of Central European integration, the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor is, as we know, currently regaining the importance that it had before the collapse of the Danube Monarchy."
"The EU has, of course, already confirmed the importance of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor by giving priority status to the northern part from Gdańsk to the Czech Republic."
"However, it would be even more important to also give the development of the southern part via the Austrian Southern Railway to Italy the same level of priority."
"In this network, in particular, which carries half of all goods and passengers, we need to neutralise a dangerous bottleneck situation."
"Only the Koralm Tunnel will be able to permanently eliminate the barrier posed by this bottleneck."
"The people living along the transit routes are, as we all know, paying a high, and rising, price for the increasing volume of traffic."
"Only the complete development of this southern corridor will lead to the sort of switch from the road to the rail system that could not be expected to be achieved by any other infrastructure measures in Austria."
"(RO) At the moment when all the air traffic throughout Europe is experiencing severe disruption due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland, the need to develop pan-European transport networks is even more obvious than ever."
"The European Union should be giving particular support to the development of the transport infrastructure and its interconnection with the main European transport routes in the countries which have joined the EU in recent years."
"Romania has three pan-European corridors crossing its territory, 4, 7 and 9, which are all closely linked to the Black Sea port city of Constanţa."
"I feel that particular attention must be focused on corridor 7."
"The Danube is part of the main trans-European Rhine-Main-Danube transport waterway, which links the North Sea and Black Sea via the ports of Rotterdam and Constanţa."
"It could provide Europe with a proper transport backbone."
"However, cooperation must be established in order to raise the profile of these transport corridors as soon as possible."
"(DE) Madam President, the trans-European networks are indeed utilised for regular traffic in Europe."
"We could even say that the traffic is the absolute backbone of the entire European internal market, which is, of course, one of our main aims in Europe."
"Therefore, we absolutely must take care to ensure that all corridors are indeed developed and to discover where there is a need for financing and where the EU should concentrate its efforts."
"Of course, it is clear that there are always national interests."
"We have seen it already today: some people talked about the Danube, others talked, in particular, about southern Europe and others still talked about the Brenner Base Tunnel."
"These traffic corridors are found all over Europe."
"The aim is for them to be generally continuous throughout Europe so that not only goods, but also people, can be transported from A to B. That is the task facing us."
"As I said before, it is natural for each of us to attach importance to our own regional requirements."
"We need to make sure that we avoid bottlenecks and, above all, that we have a truly functional network for all means of transport."
"That is what it is all about, and that is also what we will debate accordingly."
"(DE) Madam President, during this debate, the Brenner Base Tunnel and the new rail route from Munich to Verona have also been mentioned."
"Currently, around 50 million tonnes of goods are transported by road on this route and so this tunnel is urgently needed."
"However, it has also been said today in this Chamber that on both sides of the Brenner - in both Austria and Italy - it is difficult to finance the project."
"Financing on the Italian side would easily be possible by reallocating the revenue from the road tolls, from the Brenner motorway, to fund the rail route."
"For this to happen, however, it would be necessary for the concession for the Brenner motorway not to be put out to tender - as is the current intention as a result of pressure from Europe - but for the Italian State to be given the opportunity to extend this concession for at least another 50 years instead of it being awarded to private tenderers."
"Otherwise, there will be no cross-financing, which would mean that it would be extremely unlikely for the TEN route to be developed on the Italian side."
"(ES) Madam President, Parliament is going to adopt this recast on the trans-European networks, and I would like the Commission to tell me as specifically as possible when we are going to be able to have access to the communication on the methodology."
"As you know, Commissioner, this is one of the Spanish Presidency's priorities, and we are now crossing the half-way mark."
"I would therefore like to know as specifically as possible when we will be able to have this text, as Parliament is going to adopt the recast now and will therefore be free to examine this new text."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, again I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism for its support for this technical recast and I hope that the vote in plenary will confirm it."
"Today's debate was on a broader scale and it will help to propose a methodology."
"Commission Vice-President Kallas will send the proposal to the college on 5 May."
"It took a bit of time because this new Commission has not been in place for long, and it takes some time for the new college to prepare proposals."
"What I take away from this debate is that this House very strongly supports trans-European network policy."
"I believe that without a well-interconnected infrastructure, in transport or in energy or in telecommunications, it is very difficult to speak about Europe."
"I believe this debate will help us to shape our proposal for methodology, which basically means that the Committee on Transport will have a chance to speak about it if everything goes well in May."
"deputising for the rapporteur. - Madam President, I would just like to thank the colleagues who have contributed to the debate today and reiterate my point that we are looking at correcting mistakes made in the past and not at making any substantive changes."
"That will come later on with the real revision of the guidelines and, of course, we are looking forward to that debate."
"For this reason, the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, and myself, as coordinator for my group, will be instructing my own political group to vote against the amendment put forward by the Greens."
"We hope that the other political groups will be able to support us on this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in Brussels."
"Strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr van Dalen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018 -."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, one could talk at length about the European maritime transport policy."
"I am not going to do that and will concentrate instead on a couple of key points and core themes."
"The first key point is the importance of the sector."
"Eighty per cent of world trade takes place via the sea and the European fleet accounts for 41% of that global market."
"Within the European market, 40% of all goods are transported by seagoing ships."
"This makes shipping a crucial economic sector and one that has to compete in the global market."
"When you understand this, the second key point follows automatically, and that is competition."
"We know that many countries the world over support their maritime fleets in very diverse ways."
"If we were to allow this in Europe, then it would only take a few years before all our ships flagged out to countries such as Hong Kong or Singapore."
"That would not only be to the detriment of the fleet, but more than that, it would deal a blow to the entire maritime cluster."
"On-shore employment, in banks, shipyards, insurance companies, logistics companies, training and education institutions and in companies actively working on innovations and improvements to the fleets' environmental performance, would be dealt an insurmountable blow if our fleet were to leave us."
"Because of these two key points, my report calls on Member States to continue to boost their flags."
"We are talking here about providing tax breaks, such as the tonnage tax system for ships and tax breaks for seafarers and shipowners."
"That is the only way we will be able to ensure that both the sector and the maritime clusters remain relevant in Europe in the long term."
"I have a question in this connection for the Commissioner: when is the European Commission going to come up with rules for State aid to sea ports?"
"That proposal is supposed to come in the autumn, but I do not know in the autumn of which year."
"What is important for me is that State aid is granted transparently and that there is good accountability."
"We should not embark on this by supporting stationary terminals any more than ports which are geographically very close to third countries."
"In both cases, that would be tantamount to flogging a dead horse."
"In this connection, I have a comment on paragraph 5 of the draft resolution, the English-language version of which talks about 'flags of convenience'."
"For me, that is a misnomer and I would have preferred something like 'substandard' ships."
"After all, what we do not want are flags and ships that circumvent minimum requirements for safety and social standards."
"We are talking about the quality of the flag and what we in Dutch call 'goedkope vlag' is certainly not automatically synonymous with a 'flag of convenience'."
"To conclude, I would like to mention another key point and that is making the maritime sector attractive to young people."
"The population of Europe is increasingly an ageing one and so we need to do a lot more for our youth."
"It is never too early to start informing them about the maritime sector and sea shipping and I was pleased to hear that shipowners are even visiting primary schools to inform young people about working at sea."
"Those were some of the key points I wanted to make thus far and I will be happy to respond to any comments by members and the Commissioner when I wrap up the debate."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this politically very important issue."
"The Maritime Transport Strategy until 2018 has been very much used in preparing the Commission's Europe 2020 strategy, and the process for a new White Paper on Transport is on its way."
"We can see that this transport strategy is at the forefront of major strategic developments in Europe."
"Shipping is one of Europe's strengths, and it is only natural that we should capitalise on what we have built in the past, but it is important to also look into the future."
"Our main aim is to ensure and further increase the long-term sustainability and performance of European shipping."
"This means efficient, safe, secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport services."
"Maritime transport provides for high-quality jobs in Europe and fuels research and European industrial innovation."
"We also have ambitious environmental goals, and the Commission has always emphasised the need for global solutions, especially on the reduction of greenhouse gases."
"The main work on the strategy was carried out before the economic crisis."
"In view of the economic downturn, the strategy is still valid."
"In this context, an emphasis must lie on the maintenance and improvement of the international order."
"We are faced with threats like protectionism, unfair competition, substandard shipping or piracy."
"We must find better responses to these issues, namely through dialogue with major trading partners."
"I welcome the conclusions reached by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the report presented and can assure you that many of the issues are already being addressed by the Commission in various activities to implement the strategy, such as the proposal on reporting formalities for ships, an important element of the Common maritime transport space without barriers."
"The Commission services have also started working on a Social Agenda for maritime transport as well as on the EU e-Maritime initiative, both of which the Commission intends to present in 2011."
"I would also like to answer the point on State aid guidelines for shipping in 2010."
"On the one hand, the 2004 guidelines will not 'expire' in 2011, even if the Commission said that they 'will be reviewed within seven years'."
"On the other hand, the current crisis, with its severe consequences for shipping, calls for a very cautious approach."
"With regard to the specific measures, we are currently preparing a detailed roadmap for implementation of this strategy, which we plan to publish this summer."
"Mr President, the Commissioner's statement evinced a very positive response from me and I listened to it with a great deal of interest, because shipping is indeed a very important - I would say vital - sector for the European economy."
"The European Union has every reason to safeguard the leading role which it plays in this economic sector and to maintain a high standard of maritime transport."
"This is the challenge: to maintain our leading role in the global shipping market, which is why we need an effective and coordinated maritime transport strategy."
"The report we are debating today, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in the competent committee, is a detailed report which moves in the right direction, and I consider that, even as it now stands, without changes and amendments, the text responds fully to the need for us to move along a specific fixed line in the direction I referred to earlier."
"Of course, European shipping faces huge challenges at present, as well as an exogenous challenge."
"The first challenge is the need to increase competition."
"It is a fact that free competition is the life blood of shipping."
"At the same time, however, State aid is often needed, because we frequently have to cope with unfair competition from third countries."
"So the conclusion is this: State aid must be kept, because it has helped to maintain the competitiveness of European shipping and of the economy of the Member States."
"The second challenge we face is the need to strengthen and improve vocational training of human resources in the shipping sector, because there has been a spectacular reduction in the number of young people entering the profession and there is a lack of trained seafarers."
"We therefore need a dynamic policy."
"We must, without fail, address these two sectors and I believe that the report moves in the right direction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, we very much welcome the fact that, in future, we will have a maritime strategy in the EU, even if we will have to wait a little longer for the vote."
"We assume that this report will be incorporated into the Future of Transport report and then into the White Paper."
"Through the European Maritime Transport Strategy 2018, we are creating the framework to make the European maritime economy more competitive at international level, and in this strategy we have determined, firstly, that we want this framework to be set up on the basis of ecological standards and, secondly, that we want sensible global social standards for high quality shipping."
"Let me briefly address three points."
"Firstly, shipping is an environmentally friendly transport sector and therefore, one of our aims was for this branch of the economy to play its part in combating climate change in future, too."
"I am very much in favour of us creating incentives like the green ports, even if we do not make any decisions today but rather assign the Commission and the Council the task of finding out what is possible in this regard."
"I believe it is just as important to maintain international competitiveness - including in respect of other modes of transport."
"It is therefore also right for the Commission, on the basis of our proposal, to once again carry out an impact assessment in respect of the sulphur emission control areas in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea because, if we want higher requirements here than elsewhere, we need to take international competition into account and ensure that, if possible, we do not cause the transport of containers to move back to the roads, which would be counterproductive."
"Allow me to mention one last thing that I feel is particularly important, namely the inclusion of the major European ports in the planning of the TEN networks."
"This is of such enormous importance to us because the ports are important intersections in the transport chains and they can only perform their role effectively if intermodality is facilitated and reinforced."
"There are numerous other points that I could mention here."
"Mr van Dalen, congratulations on this excellent report."
"We have all contributed a little to it and I would ask for your understanding for the fact that we do not want to spoil this excellent report by accepting your amendments."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports Mr van Dalen's report and recommendations."
"He offers us a balanced text which is the result of the close collaboration he managed to establish with the other political groups."
"We endorse this report because it clearly sets out the challenges facing the EU's maritime policy, namely a significant increase in maritime traffic, both inside and outside the Union, without sacrificing the environment or social issues."
"This text is consistent with a rationale that we wish to see applied in all areas: a policy of sustainable development."
"It offers positive paths to allow maritime transport to develop between now and 2018 in the best possible conditions."
"In particular, we highlight the fight against abuses of flags of convenience or substandard vessels."
"We also highlight protection against piracy."
"We highlight having a policy designed within the framework of a single European sea, and the importance ascribed to the multimodal linking of European sea ports with the hinterland."
"We highlight the support for simplification of the administrative rules governing entry and exit from European ports."
"We highlight the promotion of maritime occupations and continuous training for them."
"Lastly, we highlight the priority given to environmental issues."
"On the whole, we will always support anything which, in our view, helps to promote a maritime transport sector which can compete with road and air transport."
"Mr van Dalen's report has taken full stock of the global environmental challenge, for which maritime transport is one of the solutions."
"In particular, it is a useful tool against global warming."
"Our only regret is that the amendment that we tabled in order to integrate the maritime transport sector into the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system has not been taken up by the rapporteur or by the Commission."
"From our point of view, no economic sector should depart from the general rule, and, as with the air and road sectors, maritime transport, even if it is only responsible for low gas emissions, must do its part to reduce them."
"We will therefore be retabling our amendment to plenary."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to say that the Union needs a real maritime transport development strategy is putting it mildly, since this is a major issue for the future of our Union in terms of food, economic and political independence, as well as environmental protection."
"In order to be effective, this strategy must be comprehensive and cover shipbuilding, ship repair, ports, employment and worker training, as well as safety."
"The rejection of the directive on the liberalisation of port services by Parliament in 2006 represents, in my view, the cornerstone of any European maritime transport strategy."
"Parliament is calling on the Commission to continue its fight against abuses of flags of convenience."
"This is positive, but the fight has yet to really begin."
"Ultimately, it is not abuses of flags of convenience that we need to combat, but the very existence of this practice."
"Otherwise, all of our good intentions on safety, on job creation, are doomed."
"It is a positive step to make State aid for this sector conditional on having to meet quality social and environmental criteria, and on promoting jobs and training for seafarers from EU Member States, since the only true distortions of competition do not result from State aid, but instead from social, wage and environmental dumping."
"The best guarantee for the safety of maritime transport lies in having well-paid, well-trained crews who enjoy good social protection and good working conditions."
"I am pleased to see that we are finally talking about lifelong training for seafarers and strengthening professional qualifications and skills."
"We must now ensure that this is recognised as a right for all seafarers and have employers finance it."
"I also support the requirements for shipbuilding and steel quality."
"Of course, the text submitted to us takes a certain number of steps forwards, but it also still contains many contradictions."
"It remains imprisoned in the shackles of the dogma of free and undistorted competition."
"It is still too shaped by pressure from the shippers' lobby and by the worst ultraliberal utopian scenarios."
"For example, how can it support employment for Europe's seafarers but also call for studies to determine to what extent the new technologies could replace them?"
"How can it defend a reduction in dumping practices, while seeking freedom of movement for employees who do not even have identical rights within the Union?"
"How can it highlight safety when it is self-declaration that prevails, and when some parties, attracted by the smell of profit, have no hesitation in transporting goods which could turn out to be particularly hazardous for people and the environment, without declaring them?"
"There is still much work to be done, but we will do it together because a sound, high-level maritime policy must also and, above all, respect those tenacious men and women who often risk their lives to satisfy the needs of others."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Mr President, this is an ambitious strategy document."
"I have a couple of comments, however."
"More freight on the EU's major rivers - great, but how do we take into account the fact that in recent years, water levels have often been too low for a fully laden barge to navigate them?"
"If they sail only half-full, the freight costs are too high."
"Risk-based controls - then how can we tell that a coal barge is smuggling people?"
"Risk-based controls alone are not sufficient."
"It is naïve to expect all the maritime nations of the world to abide by the EU's high environmental standards."
"On the contrary, many old ships from third countries will take financial advantage of this."
"Piracy - why is this problem only mentioned in an African context?"
"The problem is far greater in the waters around Indonesia."
"That also affects EU shipping companies."
"Mandatory discharge - mandatory discharge should be made a statutory requirement in all coastal waters navigated, to avoid environmental disasters."
"I also consider it regrettable that we have closed down so many small ports."
"We should invest in strengthening coastal maritime transport, not weakening it."
"One final point - we are often told how important the shipbuilding industry is for the EU."
"Yet where is the debate on the responsible, environmentally sound scrapping of ships?"
"Do we want to continue sending our ships for irresponsible scrapping on Indian beaches when we have finished with them?"
"(RO) Europe's maritime matters cannot be viewed separately from international maritime matters."
"Europe is a major competitor on the maritime transport market, especially in terms of transporting passengers and containers."
"The European Union's position in the global market in this sector must be enhanced."
"Improving the quality of training given to sailors, as well as their working and living conditions, both on board and when in port and roadsteads, can go a long way to meeting this requirement."
"There is a shortage of highly qualified workers right across the European maritime sector, from shipbuilders right down to pleasure boats."
"Companies in the US, Asia and the Middle East offer far more facilities than their European counterparts."
"In these conditions, European professionals in this sector prefer to be employed by maritime companies or shipowners in Dubai or China, while European ships are crewed by Filipino and Indian seafarers."
"This situation must be ended."
"Maritime institutions in Member States must work together much more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes, as well as offer opportunities for paid work placements and exchanges of experience with European maritime companies."
"I also wish to raise another point relating to security, which is extremely important and continues to hamper the smooth flow of global maritime traffic."
"I am referring to the situation in the Horn of Africa."
"I welcome the actions of the NAVFOR Atalanta operation, which is completely fulfilling its duty in the region."
"However, we must recognise that specific investment is required in the defence industry in order to be able to supply the military with ships and other intervention resources which are much more effective than those which the European navy currently deploys."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I agree to a large extent with the comments made by my colleague Fleckenstein and would, first of all, like to thank the rapporteur, Mr van Dalen, for his excellent report."
"He hones in on a number of important issues, the importance of shipping for our economy, to begin with."
"He also points to the fact that we have to compete in a global market, and that we therefore have to pay attention to the competitiveness of our maritime sector while, at the same time, strive for more sustainable transport."
"In other words, we must counteract the risk of deflagging."
"At the same time, we must also play on a level playing field."
"It is therefore important that the State aid rules which have been in the pipeline for quite some time actually begin to apply to our ports."
"I am sure we will have to come back to this at a later stage."
"There are three important areas for consideration."
"First of all, employment and working conditions."
"The shipping profession has to be made attractive to young people again, and these days, that is an extremely difficult thing to achieve."
"We have to make more effort to spread information about career opportunities, whether on shore or elsewhere."
"These are the things we need to build on."
"Working conditions also need to be improved by ratifying International Labour Organisation legislation and by performing checks at a global level, not just within Europe, obviously."
"The second important point - and many of you have already mentioned it - is the impact of shipping on the environment."
"In itself, shipping is a sustainable mode of transportation, but there is still a lot of room for progress."
"On that score, Europe must play a pioneering role, including in the negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation."
"Finally, it goes without saying that safety is essential."
"You can only create a thriving profession if it can be undertaken safely."
"We have to make the extended Third Maritime Safety Package a reality and continue to give support to the Atalanta mission off the coast of Somalia."
"(DE) Mr President, since I am the first speaker from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to Mr van Dalen."
"We have all seen that he is wholeheartedly committed to maritime transport."
"That has become abundantly clear."
"We all know how important this area is."
"In recent years, before the crisis, the maritime economy as a whole was growing considerably more than other areas of the economy."
"Of course, maritime transport plays a major role in this, and it is possible to say that maritime clusters will be absolutely crucial to the further development of Europe."
"There are also forecasts that predict that, now we are through the worst of the crisis, the transport sector will start to grow once again and that maritime transport will then gain in importance."
"Ninety per cent of our exports and imports are transported via the ports."
"Of course, in this regard it is important - as has already been said - for ports and hinterland connections to be given due consideration in connection with corridors and trans-European networks."
"We need new blood."
"If we have more transport in the maritime sector, we will, of course, also need people who want to work in this area."
"For this, we need high quality training that is also harmonised throughout Europe and, at the same time, we need to advertise for this area."
"Young people simply need to see what future prospects they would have in maritime transport."
"We want good working conditions - that is also something that we can, and want to, harmonise throughout Europe."
"The environmental aspect has already been mentioned."
"Shipping is very environmentally friendly, particularly where CO2 emissions are concerned."
"There is still considerable room for improvement with regard to nitrogen oxides and sulphur emissions."
"Work needs to be done here, both in the sector itself and also in Europe in general, because, as has already been said, this is extremely important on account of there being strong international competition in maritime transport."
"In Europe, we play a fairly leading role in this, but we need to ensure that we also retain this leading role."
"In individual cases, we may also need State aid for this."
"We need to ensure that we work together to develop this sector further."
"To sum up, maritime transport is a definite area for the future and therefore, it is good that we are developing a long-term strategy."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it is vital that we conduct a European maritime transport policy that is ambitious and looks at the long term."
"It must take on board factors that are specific to this sector and address the challenges it is facing."
"Maritime transport is a strategic sector for the European Union in several respects, primarily because of the role it plays in growth and employment, its international dimension and its environmental and sustainable development aspects."
"It has been mentioned that maritime transport is the vehicle for 80% of the world's trade."
"The European Commission Communication and Mr van Dalen's report show us the path we need to follow, set strategic goals and identify key action areas for the European Union's maritime transport policy."
"I would personally like to stress certain points that my colleague, Mrs Vlasto, and I have been promoting within the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which are that the European Union needs to act to strengthen the competitiveness of the maritime transport sector, that this involves, in particular, improving working conditions and career opportunities within the sector, without dissociating the aim of competitiveness from those of sustainable development, fair competition and safety."
"As regards environmental aspects, EU policy should promote internalisation of external costs and the establishment of maritime emission control areas."
"Finally, in anticipation of increasing sea traffic levels, we need to promote investment aimed at modernising and increasing the capacity of our port infrastructures."
"It is important for the European Parliament to share its vision for EU maritime transport policy from now until 2018."
"Mr van Dalen's excellent report, which has been very widely supported within the Commission, will, I hope, receive equally broad support from Parliament, which will give us a strong basis for future negotiations."
"(RO) Maritime transport is becoming extremely important for the European Union."
"Bearing in mind that the maritime sector is facing competition not only at Community level, but especially on a global scale, we should emphasise the importance of increasing the proportion of maritime transport as part of our transport activity as a whole, both within the Community and particularly outside it."
"However, we should highlight that there are still European Union Member States on the black or grey list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding."
"This is why we are calling on Member States and shipowners to make efforts to obtain a place on the white list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding."
"In addition, given the maritime accidents in recent years, I believe that European maritime accident intervention centres need to be set up in every Member State with access to the sea."
"Commissioner, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity and debate to reiterate my request to the Commission to capitalise to the maximum extent on the European Union's direct access to the Black Sea, a region of particular geostrategic importance."
"In this regard, the Commission should launch, as in the case of the other European seas, calls for proposals for developing Black Sea maritime corridors."
"The link between the ports of Rotterdam and Constanţa through the Rhine corridor, the Main Canal and River Danube cuts the distance between the North Sea and Black Sea by 4 000 kilometres."
"This is why I believe that this is vital and I am asking the Commission and Member States to speed up the implementation of priority project 18."
"Although transport by ship causes less pollution, the European Parliament has asked for ship transport to be included in the emission certificate trading scheme, especially in the case of maritime transport."
"Shipyards are facing financial difficulties, especially in the current economic and financial crisis."
"At the moment, shipyard representatives cannot envisage a solution for overcoming the current economic crisis."
"The European maritime sector is facing an ever-growing shortage of qualified seafarers."
"The social aspect and work conditions enjoyed by seafarers in the European Union are closely linked to the European fleet's competitiveness."
"I think that measures are required to facilitate workers' mobility in this sector without unjustified barriers and restrictions."
"(ES) Mr President, I would especially like to congratulate Mr van Dalen and also my colleague, Mr Fleckenstein, on this brilliant initiative, which moves forward with the European Parliament's ambition for European Union maritime policy, and I also want to thank them for their generosity in accepting a large proportion of my suggestions."
"The completed report includes such important aspects as support for adapting ports and ships to the needs of people with reduced mobility and the requirement for ratification of the ILO 2006 Maritime Labour Convention and, moreover, it asks for the industry to incorporate the Convention into its practices."
"Another important aspect is the extension of the proposals for professional training to seafarers at all levels in order to combat their under-valuation and exploitation."
"It also proposes leading the way in the fight against pollution in the International Maritime Organisation, in terms of both alternatives to bunker fuel and reducing sulphur in emissions, and proposes doing so by using smart transport systems such as the Galileo satellite system."
"The report also proposes acknowledging the stepping up of the European fight against piracy and supporting the growing effectiveness of Operation Atalanta, as well as the need to improve the quality of ship design in order to adapt them to the highest accessibility and safety standards."
"Finally, I especially welcome the acknowledgement of the role of the ports in the new trans-European networks, including their crucial connection with dry ports or inland ports and with logistics platforms."
"(EL) Mr President, the strategy we are debating today is extremely ambitious and, as far as the basic direction is concerned, Mr Koumoutsakos, the rapporteur for our political group, has already covered everything I wanted to say."
"Allow me, however, to make a comment, as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in connection with the very interesting and pioneering initiative to create e-maritime, a maritime monitoring network."
"I personally agree with the Commission text; it makes provision for the creation of an integrated information management system to recognise, monitor, locate and report all ships at sea and their cargos."
"However, similar - I do not know if they are more or less developed - electronic monitoring actions are also being undertaken by Frontex forces, as part of the fight against illegal immigration."
"I therefore wish to ask if we are taking this into account, if the Commission needs to clarify anything in its communication, if there should be specific, different competences for each agency, or if perhaps this information should be combined, so that we have a better outcome in both directions."
"Mr President, I would like to address two issues mentioned by the rapporteur, but not elaborated upon."
"The first is piracy, on which the recommendations are all good, but inevitably general."
"Perhaps our experience on the basis of the lessons learned from the Atalanta operation can be used to contribute more to the self-protection rules recommended by the IMO, given that piracy will probably expand and our Union cannot reproduce that type of operation all over the maritime space used by the EU's merchant navies."
"The second issue is the need for a better-developed link between the maritime and inland waterways sectors, given the complexity of activity in those areas."
"This is illustrated, for instance, in the interconnection between economic, social, environmental and political factors in the case of the River Danube and the Black Sea."
"(RO) The first question concerns a report we are asking the European Commission for about the effectiveness of the Marco Polo programme."
"The second question relates to the possibility, or rather, the future legislative proposals on increasing the role of the European Union's maritime ports within global maritime logistics."
"(EL) Mr President, I have asked for the floor in order to clarify that, in my initial report, I overlooked something which my fellow members here have not mentioned either."
"I should like, in particular, to refer to the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency or EMSA."
"I and a number of other colleagues recently had an opportunity to visit EMSA, which carries out important work crucial to the development of the European Union's maritime transport strategy."
"It needs our support and I believe that the information and technical facilities which it has not only help shipping and maritime transport in the Union, but can also help in the other sectors referred to a moment ago, especially as regards, for example, information which can also be evaluated and used by Frontex."
"To be honest, and this is my final comment, EMSA carries out important work which we must recognise and take into account when we discuss the European Union's maritime strategy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been a fascinating debate and definitely strengthens the excellent report by Mr van Dalen."
"I think it is well done because there is nothing more difficult than to write a report on strategy in general, because strategy is an instrument which really has a longer-term vision and, at the same time, it needs to concentrate on main points."
"We are working now in the college to prepare a detailed roadmap for implementation."
"By the summer, we could come out with this."
"I should like to refer to three specific questions."
"One concerns State aid guidelines for ports."
"This is under discussion in the Commission's DG on Competition and with a former Commissioner for competition and they really would like us, as a Commission, to work in line together, so it will take some time."
"I cannot give any precise timelines but we are working on it."
"On the Marco Polo issue, we have discussed the issues relating to the trans-European transport network, so this discussion will be related to this."
"On maritime ports, we do not have any legislation at this stage in the pipeline."
"Finally, thank you once again, Mr President and honourable Members, for this debate."
"It was really very helpful for the Commission."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, thank you and thank you to all the members."
"I think this report is a good example of constructive cooperation between the different groups."
"I would like to address three key points which some of you have already mentioned."
"First of all, the environment, which is crucial."
"The environmental performance of our ships must improve a great deal and, in my report, I set out a number of options in that regard, in particular, levying a charge on bunker fuel which has a poor environmental profile."
"I wonder whether the Commission might like to consider that idea again."
"Finally, the concept of 'green ports', as some members have dubbed it."
"In a green port, an environmentally friendly ship would be dealt with more quickly and would also have to pay a lower port duty."
"Such a concept is a reward for good environmental behaviour."
"That way, you actually combine a system of incentives and disincentives."
"If you have a good environmental record, you are rewarded and if you do not make the grade, then you very quickly end up with an empty wallet."
"I strongly endorse such a system."
"When it comes to safety, one of the members said that Member States need to implement the Third Maritime Package very quickly."
"That is necessary."
"Mrs Ţicău mentioned the Paris Memorandum of Understanding."
"You are quite right; inspection is now moving towards being inspection based on risks, which is much better than the fixed percentage."
"This gives inspection an enormous boost and good behaviour is rewarded."
"That is, ships have to behave well."
"Slovakia is still not on the white list and must make an extra effort there."
"I have placed particular emphasis on shipbuilding and maintenance of ships."
"We know that in times of economic downturn, maintenance quickly falls by the wayside."
"We clearly cannot allow that to happen, and classification societies, in particular, are currently facing major demands."
"We give our full backing to the Atalanta mission against piracy."
"It is a good mission and has already proved a success."
"Only last week, a frigate of the Dutch Navy helped free a German merchant ship."
"Such cooperation seems ideal to me."
"In this particular case, all the shipowners had to work together and sail in a convoy as none of them was able to go it alone."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission and we look forward to this report being translated into a roadmap."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in two weeks' time, during the part-session in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European maritime transport sector plays a key role within the globalised market."
"Its importance is based on one key statistic: 41% of the global fleet is managed by the countries of the European Union."
"However, following the increase in State aid in the maritime transport sectors of third countries, the competitive position of the European fleet is subject to growing pressure."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to quickly present the new rules on State aid, in order to develop fair international maritime trade conditions."
"Recent studies estimate that, in 2018, maritime transport will increase in the Member States from 3.08 billion tonnes in 2006 to 5.3 billion."
"I therefore agree with the content of the report in question; in other words, I agree that developing European port infrastructure capacities, in order to sustain the growth of the maritime transport sector, is a priority."
"Lastly, I believe that the maritime professions should be promoted more among young European citizens with the aid of appropriate information, which currently seems to be lacking."
"As I see it, in fact, the growing lack of professionals in the European maritime transport sector may serve to weaken it over time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a look at the situation of European Union maritime transport can lead to ambivalent conclusions."
"On the one hand, the data which have been presented testify to the fact that the flags of Member States have a huge share of transport globally as well as inside the Union."
"This underlines the significance of the Community in the implementation of new technologies and organisational systems, especially those concerning environmental protection and improvements to the living standards of crews."
"On the other hand, however, increasingly strong competition from third countries can be observed, and particularly from what are known as flags of convenience."
"Also noticeable is the increasing reluctance of young people to take up work in what is, undoubtedly, a difficult sector."
"In summary, the present situation of the maritime transport market in the EU is not a bad one, but the prospects do not make us feel optimistic."
"However, for me, personally, measures to help inland shipping and ensure optimal connections between maritime and inland transport of goods are a priority."
"I represent the region of the upper Odra river basin, and can see what little use is being made of the potential of river ports in this region, especially as a transportation route connecting inland regions of the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany with the sea port in Szczecin."
"This aspect, too, should be borne in mind in the context of EU maritime transport, so that measures taken as part of the policy under discussion will contribute to the development of the Community as a whole, and not only of coastal areas."
"Mr President, Mr van Dalen, ladies and gentlemen, 41% of fleets worldwide belong to Europe, yet unfortunately, some other countries give more support to their fleets and shipowners than do the European Union Member States, or impose less stringent requirements on the safety and environmental friendliness of ships."
"Europe must guarantee better working conditions for its sailors, the safety of its ships and an improvement in the marine environmental situation."
"In order to do this, we should require, or perhaps encourage Member States to support the state's maritime sector or guarantee that ships appearing on the register of that state observe the convention that has been ratified, as well as international requirements."
"Although sea transport is more environmentally friendly than road or air transport, it is possible to reduce pollution still further here."
"My hope in presenting this proposal for change is that it will make future docking operations more effective and less polluting, something which will definitely be facilitated by paper-free procedures as well as the wider use of intelligent transport systems."
"At the same time, the main goal of intelligent transport systems is not to reduce pollution, but to increase efficiency and guarantee better competition."
"The safety of the maritime sector is very important."
"We must do everything to guarantee the safety of our sailors, passengers, ships and goods but, at the same time, we cannot solve this problem with our eyes closed."
"We must look at the situation more broadly and find a solution to the existing problems in this area."
"In a nutshell, I would say that maritime activity is a very important part of the economy and the everyday life of many Europeans."
"We must therefore do everything to guarantee the competitiveness and sustainability of this sector, while not forgetting environmental and human factors."
"Europeana - the next steps (short presentation)"
"The next item is the short presentation of the report by Helga Trüpel, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on Europeana - the next steps -."
"Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, Europeana is to be the major digital cultural project of the European Union."
"What does Europeana mean?"
"It is a digital library, a digital museum and a digital archive for our European cultural heritage."
"The intention is to provide access for all citizens to this digital resource, not only within the European Union, but throughout the world."
"The Europeana project was started in November 2008 and 1 000 cultural institutions contributed to its establishment."
"It has 150 partner organisations."
"So far, around 6 million works from our European cultural heritage have been digitised."
"By June 2010, there are expected to be 10 million digitised works and by 2015, the figure is expected to reach 15 million."
"As you can see, this is a very ambitious undertaking, and it is very important for the European Union."
"Up to now, it has been funded by the eContentplus programme and by the Member States."
"However, so far, the rate of digitisation has varied considerably between the Member States."
"France is leading the way with over 40%, Germany is at around 16%, but many other Member States are much further behind, and this, remember, is supposed to be our joint flagship of European digital cultural policy."
"It is particularly important that we understand that there is a public cultural institution, and this is intended, for understandable reasons, to provide strong competition for the Google Book Search legal case settlement, because we do not want our European heritage simply to be entrusted to a monopoly."
"We want a public resource, in the best European sense, for our European cultural heritage."
"We also want to retain public influence, because that means that European citizens can also have genuine political influence."
"There is no problem in respect of works that are no longer subject to copyright or that are in the public domain."
"It is much more complicated when it comes to orphan works, in other words, works that have not been released from copyright, but for which it is very difficult to trace the rightful holders."
"It is another matter again when it comes to works protected by copyright."
"If Europeana is to one day also hold works protected by copyright, there will need to be a payment for private downloads, because otherwise, we will destroy our cultural added value on the cultural markets."
"Therefore, what I want to achieve from a political point of view is, on the one hand, quick and effective digitisation while, at the same time, retaining copyright, because that is the only way that we will be able to maintain the cultural diversity of the European Union."
"Thus, we need consensual solutions for orphan works and a very thorough search to find out who the rightful copyright holders are."
"From a political perspective, the absolutely key issue for me when we now discuss the post-Lisbon strategy, the EU 2020 strategy, and when it comes to modernising our economy, developing the digital society, the knowledge-based society and cultural diversity, is that Europeana must also be partly financed from this EU 2020 programme, with the involvement of the Member States, of course."
"It must be a joint European project."
"We therefore also need a 'join Europeana' campaign to hopefully find additional private sponsors."
"We must make it clear, however, that we need to raise awareness among our citizens and, above all, among young people, that this resource exists."
"Many people still do not know about this."
"That is the huge task that we now have to face together."
"(PL) Mr President, Europeana is an undertaking of crucial importance, which can make the cultural heritage of Europe available to the whole world."
"As we all know, it is not only a library, for it is also a virtual museum and archive."
"I wish that each one of us in this Chamber could say that the works of great national creators, such as in my case Chopin, Marie Curie née Skłodowska or Słowacki, could be available on the Internet."
"I would like to mention three key factors."
"Firstly, in the case of Europeana, we cannot allow a reduction in quality."
"This is something about which we should be careful during this project."
"Secondly, it requires a solution to the matter of copyright in the case of orphan and out-of-print works."
"Thirdly, I have a huge request to Mrs Kroes to speed up digitisation in Member States, if we want to be proud of this great flagship project in the future."
"I would like to thank Mrs Trüpel for an excellent report."
"(RO) As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the report 'Europeana - the next steps', I welcome the fact that this report has been finalised and I hope that its recommendations will be adopted by the Commission."
"During the debates on this topic so far, a whole range of subjects have been discussed, such as IT structure, management of the Europeana site, free access to library information, the need to standardise the digitisation process and the problem of media coverage for the website."
"Some of these subjects feature in the report."
"This fills me with the hope that we have managed to achieve an exhaustive report."
"However, I hope that the debate will continue in the future on certain aspects, such as managing the site, funding methods and, above all, organising the site in the form of a single database and not a portal."
"I hope that the recommendations specified by the European Parliament, along with the Commission's reflections on the issues mentioned above, will be turned into a successful project."
"Europeana can become a successful project for the European Union as long as it is built on the EU's values and ideals and provides the focal point for European cultural information."
"(FI) Mr President, to begin with, I would like to thank Mrs Trüpel for this excellent report."
"I have known her well from the committee for five years now, and I know that whatever she does, she does with true care and professionalism, and this is one good indication of that."
"This is another kind of project that we need in Europe, because the European Union is regarded as a community of values, but it is also a strong cultural community."
"We have 27 different Member States which have an extremely rich and varied culture."
"If, at a time when information highways are increasing in number, we can make information more easily available to people, then this is the kind of European richness which is worth investing in and seeking resources for."
"In this way, all the small countries will also have the opportunity to promote their own unique and special cultures."
"Once broadband is extended everywhere through the work of the Commission and the Member States, the principle of equality will be realised in the supply of cultural services, in electronic libraries, museums and archives."
"(PL) My political group, and I personally, are not specially in favour of extensive programmes and institutions or of creating entities which go beyond what is needed."
"However, Europeana is not such an entity."
"It is, in fact, something very important, especially because we live in times of a visual, and not a written, culture."
"This means, as Neil Postman has shown in his superb book Amusing Ourselves to Death, that the visual culture is devaluing public debate and making us poorer citizens."
"This means, in turn, that if a project has a chance of improving the habit of reading, it has a chance of improving the mind of the citizen, and in this way, the European Union would contribute to a strengthening of the quality of the education of its citizens and the way they function, and this would mean that in the Member States, those citizens would be more active and wiser and would be better citizens."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating an initiative which may prove to be a real treasure for the Union and I should like at this point to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Trüpel, once again for the exceptional report which she has submitted."
"We are referring to an electronic cultural depository of the European States which will allow access to primary cultural information, and I should like to emphasise at this point that the success of Europeana will depend on the format which we ultimately decide to give it, by which I mean that we do not want a Europeana which is a copy of electronic platforms that already exist, such as Google or Wikipedia."
"We want a serious and reliable source, the information in which is of scientific importance and value, a source in which intellectual property rights are protected and the seriousness of the content of which is safeguarded."
"I think this is guaranteed with the amendments tabled and the debate on the subject that we held in the Committee on Culture and Education."
"Of course, what it cannot ultimately safeguard is the interest on the part of the Member States in making use of this tool to promote their culture."
"This is where we all need to develop our role, to explain how important this project is to our national governments and the citizens of the Member States, so that this project has an impact and we can all make use of it in the best possible way in the medium term."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would once again like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Trüpel for the truly excellent report that we are debating today."
"I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe's diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library."
"However, it still requires further joint efforts on our part to actually make this project a success."
"A significant prerequisite for this is, in the view of my group, the free - and that means also, as far as possible, cost-free - access to our cultural heritage via Europeana."
"In the joint discussions, we have reached a good compromise, which protects the interests of authors of protected works on the one hand while, at the same time, providing the necessary free accessibility, and I would very much like the Commission to also take account of and adopt these proposals in future."
"Another prerequisite is that the Member States become increasingly aware of their responsibility."
"For my own country, this means that it is not acceptable for Goethe to be available in Polish and French, but not in the original German."
"In this regard, we must all jointly call on the Member States more strongly to once again provide the appropriate financial resources to make Europeana a real success on this level as well."
"(RO) Bearing in mind the benefits offered to the European Union's citizens through having access to Europeana, I believe that existing digital content must be made available in all the European Union's official languages."
"I also think that it is of paramount importance to offer people with disabilities access to Europeana's digital content."
"With this in mind, not only is a suitable format required, but also access which is adapted to their needs."
"We recommend that the European Commission ask digital content providers to certify the security of the websites linked to Europeana."
"Last but not least, I believe that it is important to provide a sustainable system with regard to funding and developing the Europeana project."
"Commissioner, please also say a few words to us about the revision of the directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, and, of course, especially Mrs Trüpel, we are absolutely fascinated by your report."
"We welcome it."
"I think that indeed 'Europeana - the next steps' is just a start of a very challenging adventure and it shows, by the way, the strong political support for the further development of Europeana as a common access point to Europe's rich and diverse cultural heritage in the digital age."
"So I would like to thank Mrs Trüpel, the rapporteur, for the work she has done and also give her my compliments for the branding, since the branding itself is already unique: 'Europeana' - you do not need to explain what it is all about."
"The Commission can also support the alternative motion for a resolution, which has the agreement of the main political groups in Parliament, I have been informed."
"It is an ambitious project and again, I repeat, it is the start."
"It aims to make digitised books, newspapers, maps, museum objects, audiovisual material and sound archives from across Europe available on the Internet."
"That is essential to ensure access to culture in the digital age."
"It is not only what Mr Migalski said: something that makes us better citizens."
"Well, let us wait and find out, but, anyhow, it gives an opportunity to be more happy, for enjoying culture is, in most cases, enjoying happiness, so to speak."
"It is Parliament's report that rightly underlines that there is also an economic component."
"The digitisation and the online accessibility of our cultural heritage will benefit different sectors of activity: think of education, research, tourism and the media."
"The Europeana site is the result of an unprecedented collaboration between European libraries, archives and museums."
"At present, as was rightly mentioned by Mrs Trüpel, it gives direct access to 7 million digitised objects."
"Again, this is just a start and let us go for it."
"More can be done and more needs to be done."
"The Parliament report highlights different areas for Europeana and for the related policies where progress must be made in the coming years."
"The development of the site depends, in the first place, on the input from Member States who should do more to digitise their cultural heritage and to make all digitised objects available through Europeana."
"I am glad that Parliament joins the Commission in asking Member States to make fast progress in doing so."
"The sooner the better."
"Parliament underlines that Europeana should not just give access to public domain works, but should also include material that is still in copyright."
"Indeed, there is an urgent need - and that is my answer to Mrs Ţicău - to find workable solutions for bringing out-of-print works online, for dealing with the issue of orphan works (works for which it is impossible to locate the rights holders)."
"Failing to do so bears the risk that Europe will lag behind within a few years from now, in particular, compared to the US."
"At present, the Commission is carrying out an impact assessment on a possible legal solution for orphan works at European level and we are discussing what could be done, but if you do not mind, I will come back to that when we talk of the digital agenda, for that is one of the issues that we have to touch upon."
"An enhanced version of Europeana will be launched later this year, and is expected to give, by then, access to more than 10 million digitised objects."
"The site will be further developed in the years thereafter."
"Parliament rightly points out that for the success of Europeana, it is a must to increase the awareness of the site both among cultural institutions, who could contribute their digitised content, and among the general public."
"Special attention should be given to younger people, rightly mentioned by you, an extremely important part of our population, who could be targeted through the schools."
"The Commission is fully committed to continuing work on the development of Europeana and the policies related to it and that will be a key area of work in the European Digital Agenda."
"It is anyhow worthwhile to fight for it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in two weeks' time, at the next part-session in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Europeana, the European Digital Library, faces many challenges today."
"The success of this pan-European undertaking is far from being assured."
"Firstly, because until now, Europeana has contained, principally, works coming from just a few of the most active countries."
"Secondly, these are not contemporary works, which would attract the greatest interest, but older ones which are in the public domain."
"I would like to draw particular attention to one aspect of the Europeana project which, in my opinion, is of crucial significance for its success - financing."
"The process of extending digital collections is very expensive and will take many more years."
"Meanwhile, Europeana is only guaranteed financial resources up until 2013, as part of a project financed partly by the European Commission and Member States, and also by private sponsors."
"I think it is essential to ensure stable sources of finance as part of the new Financial Perspective for 2014-2020."
"European funds in the form of grants made to individual cultural institutions in Member States should encourage them to be more effective in the digitisation of collections."
"At the same time, compulsory digitisation targets should be introduced, which Member States would have to meet in a specified time."
"Only consistent realisation of a 'carrot and stick' approach will ensure that Europeana becomes an attractive portal of great interest to readers and researchers, and not a digital attic used for the sentimental storage of old junk."
"Our intention is for Europeana to be a brand new project devoted to European cultural values and not an alternative to Google's book digitising project."
"Europeana, which is a library, museum and digital archive rolled into one, must promote a single European heritage, offer a credible source of information and enable Member States to add content in a formal, structured manner."
"Europeana must not turn into a portal like Wikipedia where anyone can input text without it being verified beforehand."
"This practice obviously produces numerous mistakes in the content posted there."
"In this regard, we could create a special section on this site specifically where users can have discussions with each other, without offering them the chance to amend the cultural content posted on the site."
"It is important for us to focus attention on the Europeana site's graphical presentation, on raising its profile and making it accessible at a time when its current design is not very user-friendly and may contribute to a loss of public interest."
"Based on the considerations mentioned, I support the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) as an alternative to the current option put forward in the report so that we can help create a valuable portal, which is relevant in terms of the information the public will find there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, one of our fundamental duties nowadays as politicians and citizens is to preserve our European cultural heritage for future generations."
"Europeana is one of the leading projects in this area, helping to speed up the processes for digitising cultural heritage in each individual Member State."
"However, cultural and legal problems associated with the mass digitisation of books, including those currently held by European libraries, still remain to be overcome."
"Copyright and legislation governing it in Member States pose one of the biggest challenges Europeana faces."
"Competition with Google also spotlights numerous issues which will have to be resolved."
"In this respect, every possible resource needs to be found to support national libraries, museums and archives so that the Europeana project can become a true reflection of the wealth and diversity of Europe's cultural heritage."
"During the debates in the Committee on Culture and Education, I suggested that the European Parliament should have certain controls over the project, but I realise that, based on current rules, this is not possible."
"Nevertheless, I want the European Parliament, as the only EU institution whose members are directly elected, to be able one day to exercise its control over European initiatives. Thank you for your attention."
"Evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010 (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Marit Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010."
"Mr President, animal welfare is, in fact, something that most of the citizens of Europe care about."
"Animal welfare is not just about animals."
"It also concerns our own identity, what we think we represent and what we think Europe represents, what we consider to be the hallmarks of civilisation; it is about respect and how we treat these, our fellow travellers in the journey through life."
"In my assessment, which is supported by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the vast majority of the five year plan adopted by Parliament in 2006 - for which Mrs Jeggle was rapporteur - has been implemented fairly reasonably."
"One very important piece of the puzzle is missing, and that is compliance."
"Consequently, when I outlined the coming five year plan - which both I and the Committee very much hope will come about this year - I focused on tightening up compliance with the existing legislation."
"At present, this means, in particular, the directive on the life, welfare and management of pigs."
"It also concerns the recurrent problem of the long-distance transport of animals, sometimes in grim conditions."
"In other words, it is about compliance with, control of and the sanctions contained in the laws, directives and regulations that have already been passed."
"Furthermore, I should like to see a slightly new approach - and in particular a more holistic approach."
"I would like to see a general act on the protection of animals that sets a basic standard for Europe, the EU and the internal market, with minimum levels laid down."
"This is important for two reasons."
"Firstly, because of competition within the Union in the internal market; in other words, it must not be possible for one country to derive a competitive advantage as a result of the neglect of animals."
"The second and perhaps most important reason is that we make great demands of European farmers and producers."
"They therefore need to be protected from unfair competition from third countries."
"It is unreasonable to make such great demands of them if we are not prepared to ensure fair trade."
"Moreover - and this may not be so popular - somehow or other, we have to pay for animal welfare."
"Whether this is at the point of sale or via taxes is a debate for another occasion."
"We also need to establish a permanent, well-organised network - and note here what I am saying: not a new authority, but rather coordinating functions for the extremely good scientific institutions that we already have in Europe."
"Last but not least, we need to get to grips with the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry."
"I am not talking now about the risk of antibiotic residues in foods, but rather about the resistance to antibiotics - particularly among zoonotic bacteria - which poses a considerable threat to public health."
"Mr President, I want to refer to a piece of legislation with which the Commissioner - who was Energy Commissioner for five years - will be closely acquainted. That is the Laying Hens Directive, which requires the animal welfare standards of the cages in which egg-laying hens are kept to be upgraded by the end of next year."
"I thought this would cost thousands."
"In fact, in many commercial centres, it costs millions, as large-scale industrial equipment is involved."
"Many countries have complied with the directive."
"Many farmers have invested money to ensure that animal welfare standards are raised to the required level, but I do not think we are likely to get compliance across the entire European Union by the end of next year."
"I want to know what action the Commission will take, and what action it is initiating, to try and get compliance."
"The rapporteur has called for a ban on trade in eggs which do not comply with the legislation."
"I am not sure that one can do that."
"However, I want to know that the Commission is being proactive in trying to ensure that Member States and their farmers keep to raising these animal welfare standards and that there is a level playing field for all."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Paulsen, thank you for your report."
"I would like to applaud the work that has been done by the various shadow rapporteurs as part of the preparation for this dossier and, in particular, the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Jeggle."
"This issue resonates differently in the various European countries."
"Not all producers or consumers perceive the issue in the same way."
"In spite of this, European legislation is gradually succeeding in creating a very strict standard, which I feel we should make much better use of in international negotiations and, in particular, in the control of imported products."
"However, as has already been said, these rules carry a cost, and every day we are seeing this cost rise for farmers and other operators, at the very time when the profitability of farming is being hit hard."
"This is, therefore, a clear justification for the common agricultural policy."
"If we spend EUR 100 per head per year to finance a common agricultural policy, animal welfare is one good reason why this funding is needed."
"(RO) I wish to congratulate Mrs Paulsen for this report, which offers solutions concerning animal welfare and the problems which this subject raises within European policies."
"It is well known that animal health comprises their well-being and a certain, minimum biological comfort, without which it is not possible for them to fully express their vitality, including their natural behaviour, depending on the changes which occur in their living environment."
"This is why I believe that the improvement and increase in competitiveness in the agricultural sector must be maintained at European Union level by promoting and observing the current regulations governing animal welfare, which must also comply with the requirements for their protection."
"This entails Member States considering a review of their livestock rearing technologies and replacing old technologies with other, state-of-the-art and high-performance technologies, which take into account the animals' physiological needs and allow their productive biological potential to be utilised in ideal conditions, also resulting in much better food safety."
"This obviously envisages both the allocation of appropriate funds to this area and the efficient use of the support opportunities offered by them so that Member States can invest in modern, innovative solutions intended for the benefit of the animals' welfare."
"I believe that, in order to find the best solutions, an important role can be given to the involvement of ordinary citizens and civil society in drafting and implementing programmes in this area, tailored to the actual situations in each Member State."
"(FI) Mr President, animal welfare is also a measure of how civilised we, the European people, are."
"The European Union must ensure that legislation is up to date and that supervision is in operation. At the moment, there are shortcomings in both of these areas."
"The question of transporting animals has been raised here."
"We have seen some cruel and harsh films on the television and, in this matter, as well as in every matter associated with animal welfare, we would expect swift action from the Commission so that we can be sure that animals are treated in a decent manner."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Mrs Paulsen, for the own-initiative report on the EU Animal Welfare Action Plan."
"The report is not only a reflection of what has passed, but also contains important and useful ideas for a future strategy on animal welfare."
"The Action Plan, adopted in 2006, has basically been a success."
"It has brought together separate EU initiatives into a single vision on animal welfare, and its implementation has been broadly satisfactory."
"That said, the Commission shares the view expressed during this catch-the-eye session that enforcement remains a serious issue and efforts need to be maintained and enhanced to ensure proper implementation."
"Regarding the question from Chris Davies, we will provide a written answer on that particular question but, basically, the Commission is focused on implementation."
"The rules adopted should be implemented."
"It is not only about the rule of law, but also about fair competition."
"We also agree on the need to promote fair competition between EU and non-EU producers."
"Animal welfare is also a 'non-trade concern' that has to be defended and explained during the WTO negotiations."
"Our future strategy will have to make that clear."
"I note the call for a new action plan for 2011-15, and am pleased to inform you that the Commission has already started work in that direction."
"Our ambition is to establish a new strategy for animal welfare that will adopt a holistic approach, taking into account the overall costs for EU producers and the effects of welfare measures on their competitiveness."
"As mentioned in the report, Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union underlines the need for consideration for all animals."
"The idea of a general European animal welfare law, encompassing all animals, is also a very interesting one."
"Such a general law could be the basis for future initiatives, including legislation, but also information to the consumer, education, research and promotion of higher standards."
"I also note and appreciate the support for the establishment of a European network of reference centres for animal welfare."
"This would assist EU institutions, Member States and stakeholders in their actions to promote animal welfare initiatives."
"I share your opinion that the future strategy should carefully look at costs and competitiveness."
"We must ensure consistency between our policies, keeping in mind the overall sustainability of our proposals from a global perspective."
"The report also stressed that the EU budget should correspond to our ambitions - in particular, by providing sufficient resources for research, new technologies and techniques in the field of animal welfare."
"It also stressed the need for sufficient resources for proper monitoring and support to EU producers."
"As I have said, the Commission welcomes all these ideas - which collectively show that animal welfare is high on the EU's agenda."
"The Commission plans to present a new EU strategy for animal welfare in 2011."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in two weeks' time, during the part-session in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Animal welfare is an important issue."
"European legislation on this matter must be rigorously applied, as Mrs Paulsen's report recommends."
"We must also ensure that the animal welfare standards imposed in the EU are applied reciprocally to goods entering European territory."
"Indeed, our farmers and the European agri-food industry must not be penalised at a time when they are incurring additional costs to meet EU requirements."
"Animal welfare standards must go hand in hand with European trade policy, with the protection of our jobs and with hunting practices for fauna management, which are crucial to the balance of biodiversity."
"Moreover, I would express my reservations about the creation of a European Network of Reference Centres for the protection and welfare of animals."
"As rapporteur for the 2008 discharge to be granted to the decentralised agencies of the EU, I am well aware of the problem of setting up agencies which, unfortunately, have no overall coherence."
"This issue, which the interinstitutional working group on the agencies is looking into, must be resolved before the establishment of any new agencies is considered."
"EU agriculture and climate change (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Stéphane Le Foll, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on EU agriculture and climate change (SEC(2009)0417 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming."
"This week, nature has reminded us - this time in the shape of volcanoes - that it can have a major impact on human activities and on the climate."
"However, this means that, in spite of everything, human beings and Europe in particular must take responsibility for combating what we refer to as global warming."
"My report aims to show that the agricultural sector can continue to reduce both its carbon emissions and its fossil fuel consumption and, above all, at the same time, can make a very active contribution to carbon fixation so that, at world level, we can achieve lower carbon emissions and ensure that a greater proportion of carbon is stored and captured."
"The report attempts to illustrate the need for agriculture to move away from a compartmentalised approach, which consists of introducing a new directive on soil, water, pesticides and so on, whenever there is a problem, towards trying to tackle the agricultural issue in a more comprehensive and systematic way."
"Within this type of approach, we will need to identify avenues which ensure, as I mentioned earlier, that the agricultural sector not only reduces its energy consumption but, at the same time, actively participates in carbon fixation."
"This role relates, in particular, to photosynthesis and biomass, and especially to an area that is close to my heart, which is soil and the capacity of European soils to store organic carbon."
"I believe that this approach, which I discuss in this report and which I hope will be endorsed during the vote that is due to take place in the Brussels part-session, will enable agriculture in Europe to enter a new phase of sustainability and to make the transition to a more environmentally aware state which would place it ahead of a number of other continents and other agricultural systems."
"In doing so, it would have a more positive impact both economically and environmentally and, as a result, a more positive impact in social terms."
"This report deals, therefore, with the specific issue of agriculture in relation to the fight against global warming, but it also claims - in any case I hope it does - to explore other ways of sustaining, in particular, the debate that will be taking place on the future of agricultural policy post-2013."
"I am addressing the Commission; I will be addressing the agricultural committees, as I have frequently done, and I will also be addressing the various ministers when I have the opportunity."
"I believe we need to change direction."
"The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious."
"It must be based on goals that will help citizens to understand why we need a common agricultural policy."
"We need a common agricultural policy because Europe's agricultural community needs both to ensure food security and to embark on the path of sustainability."
"In any case, this is the direction I propose in my report and the one in which I hope a large majority of Parliament will follow me."
"(DE) Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his report."
"Agriculture is the economic sector that is already doing, and can still do, the most to protect the environment."
"Thus, we have already succeeded in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in agriculture by 20%."
"In addition, agricultural soils and plants draw large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere."
"Agriculture is therefore part of the solution to the problem of climate change."
"On the other hand, food production for 500 million EU citizens must take priority while, at the same time, using resources as efficiently as possible and providing the highest possible level of protection for the environment and biodiversity."
"Farmers cannot manage this alone."
"They need a strong European agriculture policy to support them."
"Only in this way can we succeed in producing sufficient food for a growing world population and, at the same time, protect the environment in order to combat climate change."
"(FI) Mr President, Mr Le Foll's report is extremely important, because European food production and agriculture are important issues."
"Europe must be self-sufficient."
"This is also important for preventing climate change, because short transportation distances and local food are the best way of preventing climate change."
"Agriculture must be ecologically sustainable and, in this regard, we have much work to do."
"The European Union Member States can play a pioneering role on this issue, and in this sense, Europe and the Member States are in a good position in that we have the opportunity to invest in research."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Le Foll most sincerely for his report."
"It contains very important points that we will need to take heed of in future."
"Climate protection must also be part of the new agricultural reform; it needs to be incorporated into this reform."
"In future, we will need sustainable and ecologically sound procedures which ensure that the environment is protected."
"Agriculture is not only a victim in relation to climate protection; it is also a significant part of the cause."
"Ten per cent of greenhouse gases still originate from agriculture."
"There needs to be a reduction here, too."
"We also need to take note of a subject that is mentioned in the Le Foll report, namely, the fact that we import a great deal of soya from Brazil, for example."
"European agriculture is also partly responsible for the fact that areas of primary forest in other countries are being turned into very intensively farmed agricultural land, which then ultimately has an impact back here, too."
"That it something that we need to consider in future."
"In future, we will also need to endeavour to re-establish our own protein supply in Europe."
"That is also part of the solution to the environmental problems relating to climate protection."
"(HU) An extremely important aspect of the Le Foll report is that without agriculture, we would not even have a chance to take action against global climate change."
"At the same time, I am thinking here of forestry, in particular, which, to this day, does not get adequate support."
"I completely agree that in future, agriculture must be greener and more environmentally friendly."
"On the one hand, this is very important; on the other hand, agriculture produces numerous environmental public goods - biodiversity, protection of the countryside, water purity and so on - which the market does not sufficiently reward, and neither does the common agricultural policy."
"Therefore, our common agricultural policy must, from 2013 onwards, create a market for environmental public goods so that farmers may receive additional services and compensation for these additional services which they perform."
"(FI) Mr President, this own-initiative report concerns an extremely important area, because the role played by agriculture will only increase in the future."
"Demand for food is increasing rapidly worldwide at the same time as climate change is reducing the area of land available for farming across the globe."
"In addition, the demands of consumers regarding the quality of food are increasing."
"As well as reliably providing for its own food security, Europe must also play a role in maintaining the food supply in other continents."
"Investment in sustainable forestry and the better exploitation of forests must also be seen as an important part of EU climate policy."
"Because of this, I was also a little disappointed that in the EU's 2020 strategy, a minuscule amount was invested in agriculture and forestry."
"After all, agriculture and forestry play a very vital role in ensuring the safety of European food, more effective bioenergy production and the viability of rural areas."
"(SV) Mr President, if I may, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a very refreshing new approach."
"Personally, I am convinced that farming and forestry are easily the most important factors in our efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly if we are to bind carbon in trees, plants and roots and fix it in the soil."
"This does not involve mastering new technology or carrying out research projects, because we already have the knowledge and instruments required."
"Since I have just been speaking on the protection of animals and animal welfare, I would like to ask a radical question: is it not the common agricultural policy itself that we need to change?"
"If we paid farmers for all the benefits that they produce which are vital to life - as in this case - for all of society, then, rather than paying for what people own, we would be paying them for what they do."
"(RO) First of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur for the comprehensive approach he has adopted in dealing with one of the most urgent problems of the moment."
"Climate change poses one of the most serious threats not only to the environment, but to the economy and society as well."
"Crop yields fluctuate from one year to the next, heavily influenced by the variation in extreme climate conditions, which has an implicit impact on every sector of the economy, although agriculture remains the most vulnerable."
"Against this background, the European Commission's strategies must consider both the prevention and mitigation of the adverse consequences for agriculture in the European Union by implementing an action plan in the most affected areas."
"I am referring at this point to adapting agricultural activities to the new conditions: forestation, the management of water resources for agriculture and making polluted land environmentally friendly."
"The other measure must be a plan for the future aimed at eliminating the causes of climate change by promoting a global low carbon economy, combined with the promotion of energy security."
"The European Union must maintain its leading position in the battle against climate change, which must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties."
"(PL) Mr President, I am impressed by this report's comprehensive approach."
"I do have, however, a simple question: what is the real responsibility, influence and impact of agriculture on climate change?"
"I am thinking of beneficial effects as well as adverse ones."
"Can it be said that the position of science and the results of our research are sufficiently strong arguments to expect such a large increase in expenditure on combating warming which has not been fully defined?"
"After all, there is such an urgent need to combat the effects of the economic crisis, unemployment and other difficult problems arising from the socio-economic situation in the Union."
"To what extent is the common agricultural policy already implementing the requirements of climate protection, and what instruments can be applied in the CAP in this area in the future?"
"Mr President, I just want to mention my home."
"I am lucky enough to live on the edge of the Saddleworth Moorlands, between the cities of Manchester and Leeds."
"It is the southern end of an area of peatland that stretches straight up from England into Scotland."
"It is a very rare habitat across Europe, but it is also a habitat that has been much denuded by 250 years of industrial pollution which have devastated the variety of species that it can support."
"That has been complemented by overgrazing, perhaps by sheep, and by fires."
"Of course, as the peatland dries out, it releases global warming gases."
"A huge potential supply of global warming gas is being released from what should be a wonderful area."
"The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is now trying to restore that habitat and to get the sphagnum moss that created the peatland to grow once again."
"The funding they require is not in the millions - it is in the tens of thousands or perhaps the hundreds of thousands."
"It is a small element that can contribute both to the restoration and encouragement of biodiversity and also the protection of this moorland habitat which ensures that these global warming gases are contained within it."
"As we look at the reform of the common agricultural policy, this is something we must very much bear in mind."
"(RO) Agriculture generates a significant proportion of the total volume of carbon dioxide emissions."
"This is why we are highlighting the need to improve energy efficiency in this sector."
"I urge the Commission to constantly examine the link between high food prices and rising energy prices, especially for the fuels being used."
"I would like to remind you that the incentives to encourage sustainable cultivation of energy crops should not jeopardise food production."
"For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to monitor the effects of increased biofuel production in the European Union and in third countries in terms of changes in land use, food product prices and access to food."
"We call on the Commission and Member States to promote research and development in order to prevent and enable us to adapt to climate change."
"I am referring here, in particular, to research into the future generation of biofuels."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Le Foll, for this very important report on agriculture and climate change."
"The fight against climate change is an absolute priority globally."
"The EU is also making a huge contribution and also the agricultural sector already contributes in the fight against climate change."
"We have a policy that limits greenhouse gas emissions."
"Agriculture also provides renewable energy sources in better using the whole cycle and all the products that come from agriculture."
"Also, EU agriculture policy is working to optimise a carbon sink function of agricultural soils."
"Since the 1992 reform, significant progress has been made in integration of all environmental considerations into the common agriculture policy."
"The recent 'health check' reform represented a further step in this direction with specific emphasis on climate change mitigation and adaptation."
"The current common agriculture policy framework provides a balanced approach between binding requirements enforced through cross-compliance, which sets the limits on some farming practices, and positive incentives for climate-friendly farming practices provided by rural development."
"The Commission fully shares the view that climate change now needs to be addressed globally and it is important that others follow our example also."
"We need, on the one hand, to further help EU agriculture to contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing CO2 sequestration in soils and making use of renewable energies from other sources and, on the other, to be more productive, to be more efficient at providing food supplies, in this way demonstrating that one can achieve both goals: food security on the one side, environmental sustainability on the other side."
"In the preparation now of the common agricultural policy for post 2013, and in the light of the results of the ongoing negotiations on climate change, the Commission will examine ways to further and better integrate adaptation and mitigation objectives in the common agriculture policy instruments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in two weeks' time, at the next part-session in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Agriculture is, and will continue to be, directly affected by climate change, because it involves living organisms and its outcomes are influenced, above all, by the quality of the soil, water and air."
"Unfortunately, agriculture also currently has a share (of almost 10%) in the creation of greenhouse gases."
"Nitrous oxide is released from nitrogenous fertilisers and methane is created through the digestive processes of livestock."
"It is precisely agriculture, of course, which can help in the fight against global warming, especially through new methods of tillage aimed at conserving soil and reducing storage of CO2, through support for forestry and agro forestry and through support for organic farming."
"I welcome and I fully endorse the opinion of the rapporteur concerning the introduction of a genuine European forestry policy, in which it would be possible to support the administration and subsequent output of forests, and not to exploit forests mainly for economic activities focused chiefly on generating financial profits, whether for semi-nationalised or private entities."
"Scientific research shows that this sector is uniquely capable of capturing carbon in a natural and non-polluting form."
"Forests also help to solve problems of soil erosion and degradation, water shortages and pollution, and to preserve the biological diversity of plant and animal species."
"For all of the above reasons, I fully support the adoption of the report."
"in writing. - I welcome this timely report which addresses the role agriculture can play in mitigating the impact of climate change."
"The FAO report 'The State of Food and Agriculture 2009' underlines the necessity of livestock in food production worldwide."
"In order to meet the global demand for food, it is essential to maintain our current production levels."
"We will, however, need to find a balance between providing sufficient food for the world's population, while producing this food in a way that does not lead to increased negative impacts on the world's climate."
"The part that European farmers can play in this will come into clearer focus in the ongoing debate on the future shape of the CAP post-2013 and it is essential that the EU assists our farmers in striking this balance."
"I fully support this EP report's call to compensate farmers for their efforts in reducing emissions and to provide support in adapting to climate mitigation measures."
"The report's proposal for the development of a strategy at EU level to address the impact of adverse weather conditions on EU agriculture is very welcome and indeed very pertinent, considering the exceptionally harsh climatic conditions experienced by farmers over the past months."
"Climate change has a direct influence on agriculture."
"Its most severe effects are particularly evident among the population in rural areas, who are dependent on making a living from agriculture."
"Women are among the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change."
"The reasons for this are that, on the one hand, they account for the majority of the agricultural workforce in many countries while, on the other, they do not enjoy access to the same opportunities as men for earning an income."
"The method of agriculture deployed in the millennium we have just entered requires human effort which needs to satisfy major demands: ensuring food security and safety for the world's population (expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050), harmonising measures supporting the quantitative and qualitative rise in agricultural production aimed at producing food with the development demands imposed by the production of biofuels, along with protecting ecosystems and breaking the link between economic growth and environmental degradation."
"I believe that a new strategy needs to be adopted, based on a new approach focusing on sustainable agricultural production models, requiring compensatory aid to cover the additional costs linked to these objectives (e.g. local eco-certification contracts), as well as on the creation of 'green jobs' and the integration of women into the labour market (preservation of rural areas, biodiversity conservation, greenhouses for vegetables and flowers)."
"Agriculture in areas with natural handicaps: A special health check (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Herbert Dorfmann, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on agriculture in areas with natural handicaps: a special health check -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this report, we are concerned with a communication from the Commission regarding agriculture in areas with natural handicaps."
"Specifically, it is about delimiting disadvantaged areas and, in particular, about finding new ways of delimiting them."
"They are currently defined on the basis of mainly or exclusively national criteria."
"There are over 100 of these criteria, and they are completely different in the different Member States of our Union."
"This does not ensure uniformity, a state of affairs that the Court of Auditors has criticised on a number of occasions."
"In its communication, the Commission is now proposing a new way of delimiting these areas using eight different criteria, which are intended to lead to a complete re-definition of these areas."
"Parliament does not know what impact these criteria will have because the area simulations that the Commission asked for from the Member States were not available when we were working on this report, nor did we get to look at these simulations."
"I would like to summarise what we are now proposing in this report."
"We think that, in principle, a uniform method of delimitation is sensible and possibly also necessary to ensure uniformity within the European Union."
"We also believe that the compensatory allowance - which you could say is the most important result of this delimiting process, as this is primarily carried out so that these areas can receive compensatory payments - is an extremely important element of agricultural policy and, above all, makes agriculture possible where it would otherwise be very difficult, in other words, in disadvantaged areas, especially in mountainous areas."
"However, we are unable to carry out an assessment of the quality of these criteria, that is to say, whether or not these criteria now work, because we currently have no access to any area simulations."
"There are nonetheless very specific doubts as to whether the proposed criteria will be sufficiently precise."
"It also still needs to be clarified whether the criteria that the Commission is now proposing should actually be dealt with in this way, in other words separately, criterion by criterion, or whether, under certain circumstances, an accumulation of these criteria needs to be taken into account."
"The handicap is often associated with several factors at the same time and it seems perfectly sensible to us to consider whether it would not be absolutely essential to take an accumulation of these criteria into account."
"We also need to consider whether the principle of subsidiarity should be taken into account in this regard, in other words, whether, in this case too, it would be necessary for us to draw up a rough framework using the new criteria and then give the Member States and the regions the opportunity to fine tune it."
"Finally, I believe that it is essential to also consider having transitional periods."
"This delimitation will result in some areas being removed from the delimited areas and these areas need a sufficiently long transitional period."
"In summary, I would like to say - and I believe that the report also reflects this opinion - that the current communication from the Commission still requires further refinement and that, before it is implemented, it needs to be given very careful consideration, because it will have far-reaching consequences for the farmers affected."
"Finally, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow Members here in Parliament and also to the Commission staff who, over the last few months, have helped to put together this report."
"(DE) Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"Subsidising disadvantaged areas is a core element of the common agricultural policy, with the aim of maintaining the universal spread of agriculture throughout Europe."
"The Commission's approach to develop a system that can be used EU-wide for delimiting these areas is therefore to be welcomed."
"The crucial point, however, is whether the eight criteria that have been developed to do this will actually be sufficient."
"I am not convinced that these are really the right criteria to use."
"I cannot understand - and I think the same can be said of the rapporteur and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - why the Commission has not made the simulation results for the effects of these eight criteria available to us."
"I therefore appeal to the Commission: this really should not happen as often as it does."
"When we want and need to evaluate something, we naturally also need to know the results."
"I view this to a certain extent as a lack of trust in Parliament."
"That means that, for this particular proposed regulation, there is still much to be done."
"I hope that the Commission will look closely at the Dorfmann report that we have made into our own report."
"Personally, I hope that Mr Dorfmann will be able to continue to have political input on this matter."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Dorfmann for his report."
"What he has presented clearly shows that there are still a few things that need to be clarified with regard to this matter."
"Like the speakers before me, I, too, think that the current framework for delimiting these areas is too rough and ready."
"Many parts of it do not meet the needs of disadvantaged regions."
"I question whether we will be able to manage with these natural criteria alone."
"We also need to look closely at the social situation, which plays a major role in disadvantaged regions."
"As the payments for disadvantaged regions are vital for the survival of many holdings, the Commission needs to think once again about refining the current framework in order to give many regions a chance of survival."
"I fear that implementation of the current system would lead to very large shifts which are not always comprehensible and will lead to a large amount of disquiet and uncertainty within agriculture."
"We ought to look at this again."
"(HU) It is very important that on the basis of the Dorfmann report, the common agricultural policy's budget continue to give priority to supporting agricultural areas with natural handicaps, since without such support, there would be serious ecological damage and social problems in these areas."
"It is gratifying that the Commission - and here the Commission deserves praise - leaves the identification of the eligible areas, based on the eight criteria, up to the Member States."
"At the same time, I would like to call attention to the fact that to this day, there are differences and discrimination between the Member States, not only as regards direct payments, which are imposed on new Member States, in particular, the Commissioner's own county, Latvia, and on other new Member States as well."
"In my country, supplying water to the sand dunes region (Homokhátság) is a concern, since the groundwater level has fallen by 4-5 metres over four decades, and the area has become a semi-desert."
"The same problem also arises in Southern Europe, and therefore finding a solution to the question of water management in the future common agricultural policy is of particular importance."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to thank our colleague, Mr Dorfmann, for his excellent work on this report."
"I think it sums up perfectly the issue as it stands today in terms of the Commission's proposals."
"It is the Commissioner whom I would like to address in particular."
"This work has been going on for several months now."
"It is creating great agitation within several of our countries' industries, which are threatened with reclassification, and this reclassification is happening or may happen at a time when - and this will be the subject of tomorrow evening's oral question - many production sectors are experiencing particular difficulties."
"We therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly."
"I do not think we can wait three years to come up with a clear answer for the farmers who are affected by this delimitation exercise."
"(FI) Mr President, it is extremely good that less-favoured regions have been particularly highlighted in this report."
"The really central idea, which probably everyone here supports, is that the preconditions for profitable agricultural production must be safeguarded everywhere in the EU, both now and in the future."
"There seems to be a lot of confusion arising from the criteria for defining less favourable regions."
"We must focus particular attention on agriculture in less favourable regions, because previous reforms to the common agricultural policy have very often been carried out from the point of view of favourable regions."
"In order that we can continue to grow in less favourable regions, it is extremely important to use proportional regulation mechanisms."
"The cancellation of some of the previous agricultural regulation mechanisms by the EU has not been successful."
"For example, the withdrawal of milk quotas and the abolition of the set-aside scheme have been unsuccessful decisions as far as less favourable regions are concerned."
"(PL) Mr President, the subsidising of European agriculture cannot be called into question."
"The reasons for the subsidies include a variety of conditions of production, such as climate, soil quality, the problem of access to water, the situation of the land and social and historical conditions."
"Most of these have a significant influence on the results of production and economic performance, and have influenced the current constituent elements of the common agricultural policy."
"I share the views and fears of the author concerning the lack of expected effects of the new approach."
"Can it be that the criteria used up till now have been so inappropriate?"
"We expect calculations and a more profound analysis of the effects."
"An important question is how to maintain agricultural production in less favoured areas."
"In my opinion, support for these areas still needs to be continued at a suitable level as part of the common agricultural policy in the future Financial Framework."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Dorfmann for an excellent report on the Commission communication entitled 'Towards a better targeting of the aid to farmers in areas with natural handicaps'."
"I would like to address a couple of issues."
"The overall objective of the natural handicap payments is to ensure continued land use and, through agricultural land management, maintain the countryside as well as to promote sustainable farming systems."
"The payments to farmers in these areas compensate farmers' additional costs and income forgone, which occur due to the existing natural handicap."
"The Council has decided to remove the socio-economic criteria from the objectives of natural handicap payments."
"The removal of socio-economic criteria should be seen in the context of the whole suite of measures available to Member States in the Rural Development Regulation - the diversification into non-agricultural activities, the development of micro- and small and medium-sized enterprises and tourism activities, as well as the provision of basic services."
"So, the natural handicap payments are not the intervention lever that aims to tackle this issue of depopulation."
"Compensating farmers in areas where production is not hampered by natural handicaps and where there is no additional cost or income forgone would distort competition with farmers in other areas."
"Furthermore, socio-economic indicators change over time and would, therefore, require a continual follow-up and revision process of each area concerned."
"The proposal to take remoteness into account is not practical against the agreed framework set down by the Council, which relates to natural handicaps."
"In terms of their peripherality, there are other levels of delimitation possible, for example, the specific handicap article of the Regulation."
"At the different stages of the process, the Commission invited Member States to submit alternative proposals for biophysical criteria and their thresholds."
"These proposals will be analysed by scientists for their validity and, above all, for their transparency and possible Community-wide applicability."
"The alternative thresholds, however, must lead to the conclusion that an area in question is affected by a significant handicap, as desired by the Council."
"Once the exercise of testing a delimitation based on biophysical criteria is completed, the Commission proposal for the common agricultural policy after 2013 will take the results of this exercise into account."
"Any legal proposal will also aim for a smooth transition for those areas which may lose their status of areas with a natural handicap."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in two weeks' time, at the next part-session in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Maintaining diverse and active rural areas is important for several reasons, not least because of growing global demand for food products and environmentally sustainable tourism."
"Additionally, it would be a serious setback in many areas to stop to cultivate the land, both in terms of vital rural income and the loss of landscape, which might have been formed during several centuries."
"The aid scheme for areas affected by natural handicaps has effectively helped the farming of agricultural land to continue in these regions."
"The importance of granting appropriate compensatory payments for less favoured areas is indisputable."
"The process for delimiting and classifying these areas has been carried out by Member States based on a number of criteria, according to their own set of indicators."
"However, it is extremely difficult even to compare these sets of indicators as they use different methods for classifying and weighting the regions."
"Establishing a common set of classification criteria would increase the scheme's transparency, reliability and efficiency across the whole of Europe."
"In this regard, I support the need to review the aid scheme for farmers in areas with natural handicaps and devise a global strategy for the less favoured areas, thereby reducing the disparities which have appeared between Member States in terms of allocating financial support."
"in writing. - We should remember that 54% of farmed land in the EU currently falls into a LFA classification."
"The continuation of the LFA scheme is vital if we are to compensate farmers for providing public goods, avoiding land abandonment, assisting in promoting biodiversity and helping to support rural communities."
"The market neither rewards nor compensates farmers for these achievements in areas where farming is at a natural disadvantage."
"We must, therefore, ensure that further reform of the LFA system is adequately financed within the overall budget for CAP and that the system used for classification is fair and non-discriminatory."
"In its initial communication, the eight biophysical criteria proposed by the Commission to assess the classification of areas with significant natural handicaps were undoubtedly biased towards the warmer and drier climates of continental Europe."
"Therefore, I was glad to see that amendments that mention 'soil moisture balance' and 'field capacity days' were passed at committee level."
"This is a first step in ensuring that countries in Northern Europe, such as the UK and Ireland, are not discriminated against in the framework of a new classification system."
"Simplification of the CAP (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Richard Ashworth, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on simplification of the CAP -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, we are at the very early stages of the debate, which leads up to the common agricultural policy reform post 2012."
"In this report, I suggested some of the principles which should underlie the reformed common agricultural policy."
"It is clear that the agricultural industry needs to change."
"It will need to change in order to reflect both the challenges of the times in which we now live but more the times which are to come."
"Those will be issues such as food security, market volatility, climate change, and the need to adequately meet the expectations for the delivery of public goods."
"It is clear, therefore, that the common agricultural policy has to change in order to reflect those challenges, but it is also clear that the way we apply the common agricultural policy needs to change."
"In setting out these principles that should underlie the reformed common agricultural policy, I have deliberately not gone into detail; that will come in later reports."
"But what I have developed is two main themes."
"Firstly, that the common agricultural policy needs to be simpler, fairer and more transparent and that, secondly, the culture of the common agricultural policy needs to change, that a future reformed common agricultural policy ought to be more outcome-driven and less burdened with excessive regulation."
"I have highlighted four ways in which we can reduce the bureaucratic burden on farm businesses."
"Firstly, we should ensure that the requirements made of the industry are proportionate to the risk assessed."
"Secondly, we could harmonise inspections standards and we should cut out the duplication of inspection standards and procedures required of the industry."
"Thirdly, there could or should be greater scope for self-certification within the industry and, fourthly, we need to ensure that the penalties imposed on farm businesses are commensurate to the scale of the infringement rather than the current inappropriate flat-rate penalties, especially in those cases where infringements were not the fault of the farmer."
"In my view, one objective of the common agricultural policy should be to help and encourage the industry to adapt to these new challenges."
"To do that, there is a need for a change of culture in the common agricultural policy."
"It does need to adopt a more flexible, lighter-touch approach."
"There needs to be greater consultation with the stakeholders of the industry and, in particular, in order to better assess the impact of proposed regulation."
"It also needs to be easier to interpret."
"The reformed common agricultural policy must be able to publicly demonstrate the industry's delivery of public goods."
"It must find ways to reduce the cost to the industry of complying with its requirements and, finally, it must effectively and efficiently and fairly manage the industry."
"This report sets out a number of ways that that can be achieved."
"(FI) Mr President, the burden of managing agriculture must definitely be reduced as far as farmers are concerned, and these methods highlighted by the rapporteur are very welcome."
"Some farmers have said that they feel like criminals when trying to battle with the various administrative documents and regulations."
"The common agricultural policy needs to be simpler."
"It also needs to be said that when more and more changes take place in the markets and EU import protection decreases, administrative and regulatory mechanisms for the market will be needed in the future as well."
"For example, stock-taking systems and possibly promotional activity for exports will also be necessary in the future."
"It is clear that there can be no simple way of maintaining these systems."
"Particularly in the case of delicate products such as milk, we should create a system of regulation similar to a quota system; otherwise, production in less favourable regions will become impossible."
"(HU) I congratulate the rapporteur, since not only his specific proposals but the entire philosophy is excellent."
"Excellent because it seeks to give support in future to those who are actively farming, in other words, those who are, in fact, cultivating the land."
"I also consider excellent the point that it would be important to put an end to sectoral and other distortions in the future common agricultural policy and here, I would once again like to emphasise the discrimination against the new Member States."
"Similarly, it is very important not only that Community regulations be simplified, but much depends on implementation by Member States."
"Let me quote a typical example: two years ago, the Council adopted a regulation introducing the requirement for the compulsory individual electronic identification of each individual ovine and caprine animal intended for slaughter under the age of 12 months."
"In the case of the poorer Member States, where the State is unable to provide support, this rule impoverished the sector and placed it in a hopeless situation."
"This is another illustration of the way in which excessive regulation and excessive bureaucracy can often cause serious harm under the common agricultural policy, and constitutes yet another reason why Mr Ashworth's report is important, as are those of Mr Dorfmann and Mr Le Foll."
"(DE) Mr President, thank you, Mr Ashworth, for this excellent report."
"The common agricultural policy is a successful policy, but we sometimes cloud this success in excessive bureaucracy."
"That is just as true of the first pillar of the agricultural policy as it is of the second."
"However, it is particularly the case for small holdings, where the input of bureaucracy is sometimes quite simply disproportionate to the output represented by the money received."
"In the course of reforming our agricultural policy, we need to consider having a regulation for small producers and how we can find a much simpler method for such holdings which, from various budget chapters, we often give a total of just a few hundred to a few thousand euro in premiums, without losing sight of our objectives and producing a lack of clarity in the granting of subsidies."
"That must be possible and we must endeavour to achieve it."
"(HU) Richard Ashworth's report on simplification of the common agricultural policy sets out excellent proposals."
"Its great merit is that it examines the question from the perspective of farmers."
"Naturally it is also important for taxpayers' money to be used in the most legitimate way possible."
"This, however, is only a means, not an end."
"The goal is to fulfil all the tasks of the sectoral policy."
"The Boards of Agriculture often confuse these two things, to the detriment of the achievement of the goal."
"A radical change in perspective is needed."
"Instead of what we might describe as a culture of subordination among clients, farmers and officials, we need a culture of cooperation."
"The Commission should also draw up a regulation that imposes on the Boards of Agriculture an obligation to provide compensation and metes out sanctions on them if farmer's interests are harmed through their own fault."
"We must ensure that those with entitlements also have the right to turn to an independent court for remedy."
"In Hungary, this is not yet possible."
"(PL) Mr President, simplification of the common agricultural policy is a beautiful idea, and it is hard to imagine that someone would oppose it."
"Simplification means a reduction in the number of inspections, a restriction of administration costs and a saving of time for the farmer."
"It is, indeed, wonderful."
"However, I want to point to two cases which require a somewhat different approach."
"Firstly, there are special areas of production where it is difficult to simplify support instruments."
"I am thinking here of tobacco, hop and other specialist production of this kind."
"The second case is that of maintaining production in less favoured areas, where it is necessary to use very specific instruments for the support of production, which a previous speaker mentioned."
"I share the view of the author that the common agricultural policy, the policy of the future, should be clear and transparent, but it should also be effective, and effectiveness is something which does not always go hand-in-hand with simplicity."
"(DE) Mr President, European agricultural policy must be made simpler, more transparent and easier to understand."
"That is the message conveyed by the rapporteur, Mr Ashworth, and it is a good message and the right one."
"Our report is intended to encourage the Commission to intensify its efforts to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP) in a tangible way."
"Doing so would save our farmers a lot of time and money and would increase social acceptance of the CAP."
"Our farmers would also be able to concentrate on their real job again, namely producing food."
"I would therefore like to see the simplification of the common agricultural policy made a long-term task here in Parliament and in the Commission."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, simplification and better regulation are priorities for the Commission."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ashworth, for an excellent report in this rather complicated and challenging area."
"The Commission fully agrees that simplification and reduction of administrative burden should be of particular benefit for farmers."
"This will enable the farmers to spend more time on their core agricultural activities."
"The Commission welcomes the report presented; it generally tackles the main areas of concern of European farmers and provides the Commission with new ideas and observations with regard to simplifying the common agricultural policy."
"During the past years, the Commission has made substantial progress in simplifying the common agricultural policy."
"I would like to give just one proof of this: the Stoiber Group, which advises the Commission on the topic of administrative burden, has clearly indicated that the level of red tape for farmers has been reduced considerably as a result of simplification activities carried out by the Commission."
"But simplification is an ongoing process; work will continue in 2010."
"Moreover, there is an overall reflection process on the future of the common agricultural policy."
"We have already launched a public debate, and that means that we will have to all work together to find efficient ways to reduce the administrative burden while maintaining a high level of protection of the European Union's financial interest and, at the same time, a very efficient agriculture."
"In this process, I would also warn about one desire, and will just mention one example of it."
"Sometimes, simplification should not be made at the expense of the challenge that we could face."
"Take as an example traceability."
"We have, in recent years, had a peaceful situation, with no major scandals or outbreaks of epidemics, but, at the same time, traceability is the key."
"We should not just abolish it because we have not had any crises."
"So I believe that in the whole process, we should be very careful when we simplify; we should not forget the lessons of the past and the reasons why we introduced particular rules."
"So the Commission will continue to work on this process and we will be very careful not to forget the lessons learned."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in two weeks' time, at the next part-session in Brussels."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The new system must be based on objective and fair criteria."
"Reducing differences in payments in different Member States is essential to achieving this objective."
"Prices for the transportation of goods, agricultural machines and fertilisers and the costs of work have a similar ceiling in many countries."
"For the conditions of competition in the single market to be the same, the level of basic direct payments must be the same or comparable throughout the Union."
"The time has come for principles which are in force in other areas of the economy to take effect in agriculture, too."
"It should also be remembered that the new Member States need significant means to support the modernisation and reconstruction of agriculture and to catch up with the countries of the 'old fifteen'."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Agenda"
"In view of recent developments in the situation and by agreement with the political groups, I would like to propose the following changes to the order of business on Wednesday."
"They are new changes in relation to those we adopted yesterday at 17.30. They are additional changes."
"Firstly, we are withdrawing Question Time with the Council from the order of business."
"The Council has informed me that in connection with the transport difficulties being experienced this week, Mr López Garrido will have to leave Strasbourg on Wednesday at 18.00, so we will not be able to have Question Time in the evening."
"Secondly, we are withdrawing from the order of business Mrs Ţicãu's report on the energy performance of buildings, because it was not adopted in committee on Monday."
"Thirdly, we are entering an oral question on the ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies as the third item on the agenda in the afternoon immediately after the debates on SWIFT and PNR (this is about passenger name records)."
"In this way, the sitting on Wednesday will close at 19.00."
"I will say this again, very briefly: we have withdrawn those items which are not possible and, as a result, we will end Wednesday's sitting not at 24.00, but at 19.00."
"I repeat that these matters have been consulted with the chairs of the political groups."
"(DE) Mr President, I simply want to ask whether sittings will still be taking place in the House on Thursday, whether committees such as Scientific Technology Options Assessment (STOA) and others will be meeting, whether interpreters will be available for the sittings, and whether groups of visitors will be admitted to the House on Thursday."
"Disruption of air traffic in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on disruption of air traffic in Europe."
"As we all know, decisions for the next few days must be made by the executive arm of the European institutions."
"This will be, of course, the task of the Commission and the Council of Ministers."
"As we know, both the Commission and the Council have been working on this at least since Sunday, but we, as MEPs, have our duties, too."
"These concern longer-term answers to the present crisis."
"We are going to want to get our parliamentary committees involved in this."
"We must also think about how to respond to the present situation at the part-session in Brussels."
"It may be that we will respond with a resolution."
"I am talking about different ways of reacting."
"I would like to ask you all to give attention in your speeches, too, to how Parliament can contribute to solving the present problems. They are, first and foremost, the problems of our citizens, the residents of Europe."
"We do, of course, have a problem with getting to Strasbourg and Brussels, but that is our problem and we should definitely not make a point of this."
"We should prepare ourselves to discuss how to solve the problems of Europeans in a situation in which air traffic is paralysed."
