"Text"
"For those reasons - we hope that the House will accept practical reasons - we cannot accept Amendment No 13 either."
"Having said that, however, I share Parliament's concern that if very big fish factory vessels were to be excluded from the statutory obligation, that would be very retrograde."
"I should like to reassure the House that those vessels are definitely subject to the notification and control obligations, since fish factory ships, which are not engaged in catching fish, are not considered to be fishing vessels under the terms of this proposed directive."
"The most controversial amendment, as indeed Mr Lagendijk said, is probably No 8 on the charging system for the delivery of ship-generated waste."
"Here the objectives of Parliament and the Commission are absolutely the same: all of us want to achieve a charging system in which ships are not given incentives to discharge waste at sea."
"However, we differ about methods of securing that objective."
"The Commission's proposal seeks to strike a balance between the need to make the best possible progress in encouraging waste delivery to ports and the plain political reality of taking into account the very different views of Member States on this issue."
"The end result of both Parliament's and the Commission's approach is that fees cannot only be based on actual delivery."
"Neither of us thinks that ships which do not deliver waste should be free from the fees associated with waste management."
"Our divergence, therefore, arises only from the fact that the Commission's proposal preserves a greater flexibility for the Member States in deciding the extent to which the so-called no-special-fee system will be applied."
"In addition, we should bear in mind that ports, marinas and fishing ports in Member States are obviously very different, not just between but also within Member States."
"As I said, however, the fundamental objective of sharing the cost between users and non-users is crucial if we want to encourage the delivery in ports of waste and reduce and, indeed, prevent the pollution of the sea."
"Amendment No 9 is unacceptable because the Commission can adequately deal with competition matters under the powers it already has under the Treaty."
"The proposed amendment would have the effect of reducing those necessary powers merely to the possibility of making a proposal, and that, clearly, would not be in order."
"Again, I hope, on reflection, that amendment may be withdrawn."
"Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 11, which relates to the number of spot-check inspections to be carried out for control purposes."
"The Commission considers that a certain flexibility is needed, partly because of the potential future inclusion of the waste control regime in the existing port state control directive, which obviously would have exactly the effect anticipated correctly by Mr Jarzembowski."
"Our feelings arise partly from the fact that the main elements for enhancing compliance with this directive are not only set down in the control part of the directive."
"The Commission, therefore, considers that a slightly less systematic spot-check system is adequate for the purposes of the directive and achieving the purposes of combating the pollution of the sea, at least as far as checks outside the port state control regime are concerned."
"Clearly, as Mr Jarzembowski said and as other Members have noted, in the course of the normal port state control check, it would be extraordinary if the inspector taking his 25 % quota, as it were, were not to pay attention to the waste-disposal situation on board the craft."
"One could readily anticipate that will be undertaken - it is a relatively simple check."
"One or two questions were raised by the honourable Members, to which I should like specifically to respond very briefly."
"Mr Sindal raised the question of wrecks in international waters."
"We recall in this House that he has fastidiously pursued the questions raised by the disastrous wreck of the Pallas in international waters."
"Currently, as the House and Mr Sindal know, just vessels are the responsibility of the flag state but we are all aware of the deficiencies of that system, and coastal states may get involved in order to protect their own environment."
"Clearly there is something to be desired in respect of using those powers as well."
"The House may be glad to know that the Commission is supporting discussions in the International Maritime Organisation about placing the mandatory responsibility for safeguarding against pollution and other effects of wrecks on the vessel owner."
"In my view, that could be a very real breakthrough in our efforts to achieve quality shipping in all waters, particularly in European waters."
"I hope that progress can be achieved without great delay in the IMO."
"Naturally we would prefer the standards to be global, if that is at all possible, and then followed up with a legal regime in our own maritime area."
"I hope we can embark upon that without great delay when the discussions are completed in the IMO."
"Further, Mr Sindal also asked about VAT on waste disposal fees."
"That is a crucial question which is probably why discussions on the matter are still continuing."
"However, in the course of the further development of this legislation, I will be in a position to give a more specific response."
"Mr Jarzembowski's point, which is well taken, that it is essential that the fees levied do not result in the distortion of competition between ports, because their rivalry is, to say the least, very interesting."
"After I retire I propose to write a novel about this to do them real justice - maybe a fairy tale, who knows!"
"There will be differences in the level of the charges which arise mainly because of the relative efficiency or inefficiency of the system."
"If a port, because of its efficiency in handling waste disposal, is able to charge smaller fees, well the very best of luck to that port."
"What we are then seeing is effective competition and not a distortion of competition, as I am sure Mr Jarzembowski will agree."
"I conclude by expressing my gratitude to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and specifically to the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, for the expeditious work and the excellent report on this detailed and important proposal."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Combined traffic: dimensions and weights"
"The next item is the report (A4-0031/99) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on"
"I.the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 92/106/EEC on the establishment of common rules for certain types of combined transport of goods between Member States (COM(98)0414 - C4-0485/98-98/0226(SYN))II.the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 96/53/EEC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic (COM(98)0414 - C4-0486/98-98/0227(SYN))."
"Mr President, combined transport is one way of reducing the negative effects of road freight transport, the aim being to replace a considerable proportion of the road transport by water or rail transport."
"However, the situation is disappointing: combined transport accounts for only 5 % of the total freight transported by road, in spite of all the encouragement which Parliament has given."
"We must conclude from this that the efforts made up to now have failed to produce adequate results."
"For this reason, the Commission's initiative to improve the position of combined transport is certainly to be welcomed."
"It recognises that the existing policy has not achieved the desired results, and proposes four measures to improve the current situation."
"First, it broadens the definition of combined transport, which now applies not just between Member States but also within one Member State."
"Second, it proposes to reduce the fixed costs of road use."
"The road transport legs make less use of the infrastructure than other road transport, so it seems reasonable to reduce the taxes paid."
"Third, the Commission proposes an exemption from the bans on weekend driving for the initial and final road legs, thereby reducing the total duration of combined transport operations."
"Finally, it proposes to increase the permitted vehicle weight for lorries involved in combined transport to 44 tonnes, thereby enabling certain transport units to be operated to full capacity."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism has a number of comments on the Commission proposal."
"First of all, we agree with the broader definition of combined transport, but it must be absolutely clear and leave no room for differences in interpretation."
"This is why we propose that the distance travelled by road in combined transport operations should be limited to 40 % of the total journey."
"I should like to make the following points about the rest of the Commission proposal. The problems of combined transport can largely be put down to variations in the services provided by the railways and the high transshipment costs which combined transport inevitably involves."
"The question is whether a permanent solution can be found which does not involve a structural approach to these two factors, and any new policy has to get to grips with them."
"This is why the Committee on Transport and Tourism supports the plans to offset the high transshipment costs at least partially by reducing or reimbursing the tax paid by lorries."
"The Committee on Transport does not agree with the proposal to exempt the road transport legs of combined transport from the ban on weekend driving, as this will distort competition between combined transport and road transport."
"Parliament is trying to create a level playing field for the various forms of transport, so such distortions are not what we want to see."
"The proposal would also bring disadvantages for the public, since freight transport on main roads would increase at weekends."
"It would come up against the same objections that have been raised in connection with harmonising the restrictions on weekend driving."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism also does not support the proposal to allow exemptions from the maximum permitted sizes and weights."
"This would first of all undermine the generally accepted 40 tonne limit established in order to prevent damage to the infrastructure."
"Allowing 44 tonne lorries means putting the infrastructure under greater strain, and the high costs of this make it unacceptable, particularly in view of the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries."
"It would be the first step towards a general 44 tonne limit, which is by no means desirable for the reasons I have described."
"We also have to ask whether higher vehicle weights really serve the best interests of mankind or the environment."
"In conclusion, as the present rapporteur, I should like to thank Mr Wijsenbeek for the work he did as rapporteur in the earlier phases of this report."
"I think that a collective day of rest is essential if society is to operate successfully, which is why I am pleased that the retention of the ban on weekend driving prevents another group of workers from having to lose their hard-earned rest day on Sunday."
"I therefore commend these proposed amendments by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a word of thanks first of all to Mr van Dam, who stepped into the breach for Florus Wijsenbeek, who for very honourable reasons handed back the report."
"If I sense the mood correctly, the House will reject the report when it is put to the vote or at a subsequent stage, and with good reason too."
"But why?"
"After all, we agree on the aim of promoting combined transport, because we want to see the transport of goods shifted from the roads to the railways and waterways."
"So we agree on the aim."
"The question is whether the solution proposed here by the Commission is a suitable means to that end."
"I believe it is an unsuitable means; I believe it is counter-productive."
"When the Commission proposes in Article 9a that goods vehicles be exempted from all restrictions on traffic movements that may be applicable at weekends, at night, on public holidays or in the event of heavy atmospheric pollution, provided they constitute combined transport within the meaning of Article 1, this would open a Pandora's box, which we cannot endorse."
"In other words, as well as the 44-tonne trailer combination that we have consistently rejected in Parliament, another adverse development is being permitted here, allowing almost anything to run on our roads as long as it operates in the name of combined transport."
"That cannot be our line."
"We are willing to negotiate about precise times and routes in this Parliament too, but this blanket clause, this carte blanche , cannot be in our interests."
"It is the wrong way to proceed."
"That is why the Commission must think again on this in order to come up with a better proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the shortness of time, I can only state that we essentially agree with the Socialists and in particular with the rapporteur."
"We do not want to promote combined transport in this way."
"We are in favour of promoting it by offering tax relief."
"But lifting the bans on night driving and weekend driving and increasing the maximum permissible weight are unsuitable measures which, in the interests of the people of Europe, we must reject."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"I have seldom encountered a worse example of hypocrisy than what we are hearing this morning."
"How do people intend to achieve the modal shift if combined transport is not given any advantages?"
"How is rail transport supposed to compete with road transport if large containers cannot be brought to the trains and we are therefore forced to accept the 44 tonne limit?"
"Trains run every single day, including weekends and holidays, but the freight has to be brought to them, which will be impossible if we keep the ban on weekend driving in place."
"I would add that, structurally speaking, a total weight of 44 tonnes or 40 tonnes makes no difference to the infrastructure whatsoever."
"Mr van Dam, who was the one who included this in the report, is telling us a load of nonsense here."
"Mr President, I too want to defend the Greens' opposition to the Commission's proposal."
"Taking up points made by those who have already spoken, with the exception of Mr Wijsenbeek, we believe it is crucial to keep road transport down to 40 % and we cannot accept conditions which entirely favour road transport in every particular, such as being allowed to drive at weekends."
"We think the road transport legs should be limited to a maximum of 200 kilometres but an increase in the maximum weight to 44 tonnes is unacceptable."
"In view of all this, although this approach is obviously designed to promote combined transport, we think it is just a means of making road transport easier."
"We shall suspend the debate at this point since it is now voting time."
"It will be resumed this evening."
"Mr President, I would like here to raise an issue that has led to the European Parliament being deluded."
"In his reply to Mr Donnelly's question, Wim Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank, said that the members of the board of the European Central Bank receive a salary that is ten per cent greater than that of the Members of the Commission."
"In Finland yesterday it was revealed that the Bank of Finland, which belongs to the European Central Bank organisation, pays Sirkka Hämäläinen, who is on the board of the European Central Bank, a pension of around EUR 10 000 a month in addition."
"I believe there is reason to suspect that other members of the board of the European Central Bank receive such additional payments."
"I hope that the appropriate parliamentary committee will look into this matter, and will not condone such immoral goings-on."
"I am sorry, Mr Seppänen, but that is not a point of order and I therefore cannot let you go on."
"We take note of what you say, and no doubt the Commission will also have heard your comments."
"We shall now move on to the votes."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, with regard to the legislative resolution, I would request that we do not vote on it so as to comply with the procedure that has been adopted for all the reports on Agenda 2000."
"As I have the floor for a moment, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues for the vote and to inform them that I have analysed the Commission's position on each of the amendments that were tabled and adopted."
"I noted with great satisfaction that the Commission has accepted half of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture."
"Nevertheless, there are naturally differences on some points that were considered to be fundamental by the majority of the members of the Committee on Agriculture."
"I will defend these points in the meetings we will hold with the Council and the Commission up until the vote on the legislative resolution."
"Applause"
"I therefore put to the vote the proposal by Mr Martin that the vote should be postponed pursuant to Rule 60(2)."
"Parliament decided to postpone the vote and the matter was deemed to have been referred back to committee"
"Mr President, I just wanted to inform you that in the official gallery there is a delegation from the parliament of Taiwan, led by Mr Lee and Mrs Song."
"Loud applause"
"I therefore welcome the delegation from Taiwan."
"Mr President, the report on which we are about to vote, the White report, is, in my view, the most important report for the physical territory of many countries of southern Europe and even for European agriculture."
"Since it is likely that there will be few Members here for the vote this evening, I would ask you, along with the rapporteur and our colleagues here, to agree to postpone the vote on this report to the next part-session in Brussels to be held in 12 days' time."
"Mr President, I am acutely aware of the problems presented to the Iberian peninsula by the issue of water."
"In view of what has just been said I do not object to what is proposed."
"Mr White and Mr Aparicio, the decision will have to be taken in due course, at the beginning of the vote."
"You can ask then for the vote to be postponed, if you so wish, but as things stand at present the vote is on the agenda for today at 5.30 p.m."
"The Swedish Social Democrats are of the opinion that wine - bearing in mind the health aspects - is not a product which should be supported by the Union's common agricultural policy."
"Our view is therefore in principle that this support should be stopped."
"We are voting against the common organisation of the market for wine because it falls outside the whole existing CAP framework."
"The financial envelope allocated to this COM is insignificant compared to the amount earmarked for meat, cereals, milk and tobacco."
"Contrary to what happens with those COMs, wine producers will not be entitled to any direct aid."
"The permitted planting areas cannot sustain a self-sufficiency policy for the European Union, with 14 % of trade already in the hands of third countries."
"Despite the Union's campaign to ensure transparency for the consumer, the COM does not make it compulsory to list the ingredients used to produce the wine on the label, leading to unfair competition between wines containing sugar and those produced from grapes alone."
"The COM seeks to distinguish liqueur wines from naturally sweet wines, thus adding to the fiscal burden on them and creating unfair competition between port and Madeira wines."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Martin report because it rejects large parts of the Commission's proposals for a reform of the organisation of the market in wine."
"We support the Commission's proposals, since the reform is in line with the thinking behind Agenda 2000."
"The Commission has proposed that the wine sector should become more market-oriented, so as to achieve a better balance in future between supply and demand."
"The proposed arrangements therefore mean an adaptation of the market, which in turn means reorganisation and bans on replanting of wine areas in certain regions, together with the abolition of artificial outlets for products that cannot be sold on the market."
"This avoids surplus production, which is marketed at prices far below the costs of production and distillation."
"The Martin report paves the way for a dilution of the Commission's proposals by retaining part of the distillation arrangements, which the Commission proposes should be abolished, and imposing longer timescales for the individual objectives, and this we cannot endorse."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted in favour of almost all of the amendments that were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture as they reflected our position."
"During the debate on the Martin report in the House, Commissioner Fischler made a speech in which he expressed views that were contrary to the interests of French and European wine growing."
"With regard to the ban on importing musts from third countries for wine making, Commissioner Fischler said that he disagreed with the European Parliament's position, basing his argument on the WTO agreements and stating that suitable 'labelling' regulations would be introduced."
"The amendment as adopted in the report reflects the very same current legislation that was consolidated in the GATT."
"Our group does not, therefore, understand Commissioner Fischler's views and is opposed to the introduction of specific labels for wines made from musts imported from third countries."
"The wine will be promoted according to where it is made, so the final product will have the designation of origin of the place where the wine was made, in line with the GATT agreements."
"As far as planting rights are concerned, the Commissioner says that he still favours limiting the growth of European vineyards to 1 % in the 2000-2010 period."
"The European Parliament wanted 3 % growth in order to enable vineyards with structural problems to adapt to their market without relocating from regions of production where the product is less highly valued."
"In terms of the restructuring of vineyards, the Commissioner said that he was in favour of this measure because it fulfilled the objective of quality."
"Nevertheless, he remains opposed to our proposals on the regeneration of vineyards and the improvement of wine-making facilities."
"Once again, the Commission's approach is too restrictive and does not embrace the real economic situation of the wine-making industry."
"What is the use of altering the quantity of vine stocks in a production region without altering its winemaking facilities?"
"How do we plan to alter the vine stocks in an area of designated origin?"
"The Commission's proposal is therefore going to limit the qualitative improvements of the qwpsr and table wines with geographic designation."
"I must point out that these are products that are exported by the European Union and that therefore contribute both to the development of rural regions and to the balance of trade in the wine-producing Member States."
"As regards the promotion measures, the Commissioner stated that they would be subject to a horizontal regulation, that is, one that is valid for all so-called quality agricultural and food products."
"I must point out that only eight of the European Union's fifteen Member States produce wine."
"It is highly probable that of the financial resources to be used for this horizontal regulation, the majority will be used for agricultural and food products that are produced in all the Member States of the European Union, such as milk products and meat products."
"However, I was pleased to note that the Commissioner took account of all the amendments tabled by Parliament on trade organisations."
"In France, we are aware of the fundamental role of professional organisations. They need to have a legal status that is specified in Community law in order to ensure that they are not called into question by the non-producing Member States on the premise of the single market and competition."
"As a Member from the Languedoc-Roussillon region, I welcome the fact that we were able to reintroduce the definition of natural sweet wines into the Commission's proposal."
"However, I regret the fact that certain French pressure groups wanted to remove this definition, purely for tax reasons."
"In conclusion, I was pleased to see that some of our proposals were taken over by the Commissioner."
"However, once again, all the measures that we envisaged in relation to revitalising supply and demand, with regard to both the single market and third countries, have been rejected by the European Commission."
"I must point out that the European Union is the world leader in terms of wine making, and alone accounts for 80 % of world trade in this sector."
"Rather than trying to preserve this dominant position on the world market, the Commission is taking an approach that puts constraints on the European wine-making industry."
"I want to use this explanation of vote to express my support for the report by Mr Martin on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine. This reform is essential and aims to adapt the sector to the current situation and to the high degree of competition in the global market."
"We need to establish a better and more complete system of Community aid and support for those wine-growing zones that are both in crisis and expanding, due, for the most part, to increasing competition from third countries."
"In this respect, the Commission must provide greater protection for quality wine through the designations of origin system both within the EU itself and in international agreements with third countries."
"A comprehensive policy to combat the crisis in the wine sector must aim to ensure that vineyards do not relocate to areas receiving EU subsidies."
"In this respect, the Commission must allow the sector to be cofinanced at national level. Moreover, we must not consider wines made with grapes from third countries to be Community wines, as the Commission proposes, since they would therefore be eligible for subsidies."
"It is also essential to increase to 3 % the area for new planting up to 2010."
"The organisation of the market in wine is, from start to finish, an absurdity that would make the Soviet Gosplan planning authorities green with envy."
"Moreover, support for wine amounts to an irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money, which not infrequently is actually embezzled."
"In spite of this, it is proposed to increase the support from around EUR 1.1 billion per annum to around EUR 1.3 bn - i.e. from some SEK 10 bn to SEK 12 bn a year!"
"We believe that this form of organised swindle involving EU funds should be phased out as quickly as possible."
"Wine is not a foodstuff, but a luxury item which should be subjected to the laws of the marketplace without any further intervention from central authorities - apart from any steps that might be justified for reasons of alcohol policy, but these would need to be effected at Member State level, not EU level."
"If, for social reasons, the wine-growing countries wish to support their growers, then of course they have every right to do so, but to make taxpayers contribute in this way, over and above what they pay to purchase the wine, is nothing short of grotesque."
"It is hard to imagine a more flagrant example of misdirected pseudo-solidarity than support for wine."
"We are in favour of genuine international solidarity, including increased foreign aid."
"This is one of the reasons why we have voted against the report as a whole."
"Wine producers are farmers, and must therefore be entitled to EU support in the same way as other farmers."
"However, EU support must be changed and become more of an environmental support and focused more on smaller agricultural holdings."
"In the long term, the support needs to be reduced."
"It is wrong to include such a large number of detailed provisions in the report."
"I have abstained from the final vote."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament has not gone along with the Commission's proposals but has devised a counter-project, as it were, thereby eliminating some obvious weak points in the Commission text, and has tabled a compromise proposal."
"The important thing is to preserve wine production in Europe, attaching special priority to quality products."
"In particular, it will be essential to safeguard the diversity of traditional production methods, many of which go back thousands of years."
"That is why it is incomprehensible that some of my fellow Members keep trying to fan the flames of north-south discord over winemaking processes."
"The north does not find fault with southern production methods, so the MEPs from southern climes should not oppose typically northern methods either."
"The message here is 'Live and let live'."
"Wine is a natural product which, taken regularly and in moderation, is beneficial to health."
"This has been proved by a number of scientific analyses."
"I should like to refer in this context to a recent study conducted by the University of Mainz, which clearly demonstrates that daily consumption of one to three glasses of wine protects the heart and reduces the risk of coronary thrombosis."
"In my opinion, it would be appropriate to advertise these findings as part of a series of large-scale European wine campaigns."
"Initiatives to this end should be supported by the European Commission."
"They would also serve to refute explicitly the recurrent false reports according to which the Commission intends to prohibit the advertising of alcoholic products."
"Again and again and again - one regulatory frenzy after another from the European Commission!"
"In 1962, for example, a set of market regulations for wine was adopted and remained in force until 1970."
"Then came new market regulations for wine, but these were originally devised for France, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg only."
"The accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain made the problems greater, and as time went by we had a growing surplus of table wines which had to be brought under control."
"The Martin report is therefore of great importance to Luxembourg wine growers too."
"Who does not remember the epic discussions on the two wine reports by our honourable colleagues Mateo Sierra and Julio Fantuzzi?"
"Two worlds were pitted against each other - the wine-growing areas of the south and those of the north."
"Although the Fantuzzi report was adopted by a slender majority, it did not attract majority support in the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"The Moselle and our winegrowers once more emerged relatively unscathed, because the Commission's pessimistic forecasts of wine production and consumption proved to be inaccurate."
"Almost five years after the Fantuzzi report, Parliament has to deal again with a proposal from the Commission on the common organisation of the market in wine."
"And at this point I should like to congratulate Mr Martin as a specialist in this field for the good report he has tabled, and especially for its fairness."
"In the expectation that the report will achieve a majority in both Parliament and the Council this time, let me say that the compromise amendments he has tabled will enable the wine growers of the northern vineyard regions to go on producing their quality wines just as they always have done."
"In any case, I believe that the production of quality wines in the European Union falls under national jurisdiction by virtue of the subsidiarity principle, and that Luxembourg still produces some of the best of those wines."
"Our aim must be to achieve a decrease in the production of table wine and to prevent the importation of must from non-EU countries."
"Above all, there must be a reduction in large-scale distillation, in other words the organised destruction of wine, before it reaches the market."
"I shall therefore be voting for Mr Martin's report, and I do so in the hope that producers in all wine-growing areas will be spared any further rules and regulations in future."
"I would first of all like to commend the exceptional quality of the work that has been done in the context of this detailed study of the importance of activities linked to wine in our societies."
"This is due to the professional experience of the rapporteur, combined with the best possible knowledge of the subject that came from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, and the study carried out on the ground by the writers of the report, on the basis of contributions from producers and in close cooperation with our Directorate-General for Research."
"This debate brings to light several fundamental points, dealing with both the nature of the common agricultural policy and the actual running of the European institutions."
"At the centre of our concerns is the desire to clearly affirm that wine is an agricultural product and not an industrial one."
"It is essential to take this position, as it conveys the need to maintain a genuine, close and rigorous link - not only in terms of marketing - between the land and the product."
"It also implies the desire to encourage the promotion of products on the basis of the place of production."
"Respecting this link between the land and the product is essential to ensure consumer safety."
"It is a necessary condition for the future of food safety, and also for the possibility of maintaining balanced land-use planning."
"It enables us to prevent destructive concentrations and to continue to develop the production of food from the land, which is part of our culture."
"In order to maintain this link, we must prevent the development of a dangerous shift, that is, the possibility of making wine from musts imported from third countries."
"Our colleague Mr Chesa, who comes from one of the most important wine-making regions in Europe, rightly highlighted the risks of a reduction in quality and of breaking the link between product and land that this move would entail."
"Parliament has proposed banning wine making with musts from third countries."
"However, Commissioner Fischler argued that this position was not well-founded, considering that the provisions of the Marrakesh agreement establishing the WTO no longer allowed the countries of the European Union to declare such a ban."
"We in turn contest Mr Fischler's interpretation, as the proposals in the Martin report merely take up the exact provisions of the COM in wine which are consolidated in the GATT."
"I have, moreover, addressed a written question to the Commission on this fundamental point, and this must be clarified quickly."
"Rather than taking the relevant step of encouraging the development of a sector in which European countries are world leaders, the Commission has adopted a Malthusian, restrictive and cautious attitude towards several issues."
"Fortunately, the Martin report deliberately breaks away from this philosophy by rightly proposing a controlled restructuring and regeneration of vineyards and measures to improve the quality of grapes and wine-making facilities."
"It also gives priority to structural measures to help and support young people when they are setting up their operations and as they expand."
"Finally, the Martin report quite rightly requests that the Council's authority and rights be entirely preserved in this important sector, while the Commission proposed, as usual, an excessive increase in its own powers, claiming that it alone held all the powers of modification and regulation."
"We can only hope that the Council, which is the only European institution that has real democratic legitimacy, will be able to resist the pressure from the Commission."
"Mr President, Mr Barros Moura's report raises the issue of which European institutions and policies are needed to complete the transition to the single currency and enable it to function."
"It has not come too soon."
"This issue was deliberately avoided at Maastricht so as to facilitate the Treaty's ratification, and again at Amsterdam, so as not to open debates that might have led to doubts among the citizens on the eve of the single currency's entry into force."
"Nevertheless, we are faced with the issue now and we must face up to it."
"The Barros Moura report opens up several debates, but by no means all the debates."
"For example, it does not thoroughly examine the issue of the democratic control of the single currency, as this issue seems practically impossible to solve."
"It also fails to consider the issue of who will make the ultimate decision on external exchange rates, because it is such a contentious issue at present."
"And even though it mentions the need for a federal-style budgetary system, it fails to specify what this means in terms of new taxes and the rates they would be set at."
"In fact, what does this report actually deal with?"
"Essentially, it deals with the coordination of economic policies which it would like to see extended to other related areas, such as structural policies."
"This is something it would like to see become more centralised, to the Commission's advantage, and more binding, along with the obligatory decisions taken by a qualified majority."
"The socialist leanings of the rapporteur, who views all solutions in terms of a superstate, are clearly evident in all of this."
"Our Liberal colleagues appear somewhat taken aback by this prospect, and yet the result was obvious."
"It is true that the choice has still not been formally announced between socialist or Liberal-style euro management institutions, but, in short, that choice has been largely predetermined."
"The single currency is in itself a unifying and rigid principle, something our Liberal friends seem to have realised a little too late."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for the accomplished work that has been put into this important report."
"We believe that there is good reason to highlight the need for an effective consensus with regard to the policy on EMU and other policy areas, such as employment and social policy, the overall macroeconomic policy and environmental policy."
"We also believe that there is good reason to highlight the need for political control over the ECB within the framework of the independence demanded by its operations."
"The enlargement of the EU compels us to pay greater attention to these questions, a point which is also emphasised in the committee's proposals."
"However, we feel that in several instances the committee's proposals run the risk of tackling the issues from the wrong starting-point."
"The development of increased coordination between policies relating to EMU - above all employment and social policies, overall macroeconomic policy and environmental policy - should be based on more active initiatives and more closely coordinated objectives in these areas, rather than on static demands for changes in the Council's decision-making procedures and the introduction of binding rules."
"In our opinion, it is essential above all that the Community should increase its efforts to achieve more active employment and social policies and better coordination of overall macroeconomic policy."
"We believe that increased efforts cannot in all respects be driven primarily by institutional changes in the way that is proposed by the committee."
"In our view, this is a valid position even in the context of enlargement."
"Furthermore, we are of the opinion that changes in the rules for making decisions on economic policy should be based on clear definitions of which areas of the Member States' current economic policy would be affected."
"We believe that some of the proposals for institutional changes that are being submitted by the committee do not take into account this need for clear definitions."
"One example of these essentially unclear definitions is the committee's paragraph 18 on 'federal-style' budgetary systems."
"As regards the committee's proposal of a legal basis in the Treaty for the Euro Council, we believe that this fails to take into account the fact that EMU should be seen as a matter for all EU countries, even those which are not currently taking part in the euro."
"EMU and the common currency have an impact on large areas of Community policy and should therefore not be a matter that is handled exclusively by the Euro Council, as envisaged in the proposal put forward by the committee."
"This consideration has guided us in the position we have adopted on individual points in the report and the individual amendments that have been tabled."
"The fact that the report as a whole contains certain weaknesses does not mean that we believe it should be rejected in its entirety."
"The relationship between EMU policy and other policy areas and the consequences of enlargement for EMU are so important that this matter warrants further attention."
"The Barros Moura report sets the course, in a clear and technically convincing way, for the development of the EU in terms of the establishment of the internal market, EMU and the euro."
"Consequently, the next logical and inevitable step - if a breakdown of the monetary union project is to be avoided - is to establish a real federal structure."
"Amongst other things, this means giving more power to the Commission and the European Parliament and less power, first and foremost, to the national parliaments."
"At the same time, majority votes will be the norm."
"There will be a common economic policy and a common tax policy."
"In addition, a 'federal-style' budgetary system will be created - a budget that will be used to resolve crisis situations in the individual Member States."
"To put it more directly: the report is canvassing for the establishment of a federal state with a federal budget at its disposal, similar to the federal system that exists in federal states such as Germany and the USA."
"As a counterbalance to EMU, the report wishes to create a social and political union."
"The establishment of a social union will mean that a framework will be created at EU level for the way in which social security benefits and schemes are to be administered."
"The Union will establish parameters for determining who is entitled to benefit from the social security system, how much they are able to receive and how the benefits and schemes are to be financed."
"We do not share the Barros Moura report's vision of a federal EU, and we are therefore voting against the report."
"The transition to the euro is the result of the political will demonstrated by the Union and its Member States."
"It was not an end in itself, but simply one stage further along the road to European integration."
"The launch of the euro provides the Union with a single monetary policy which makes it necessary to restore some kind of balance, particularly in the economic sphere."
"The ECB, among other institutions, now performs all of its tasks with full independence, which is certainly a positive thing."
"However, the absence of a genuine political authority in economic matters at the European Central Bank clearly places the issue of the lack of democratic accountability in European integration at the centre of the debate."
"It also gives rise to the fear of an uncompromising monetarist policy which would govern the Union's strategic choices and be a burden for potentially healthy economic growth which is able to create jobs."
"Coordinating economic policies becomes a pressing need if we wish to promote an efficient and competitive European economy, which - as our resolution states - is also able to generate jobs, solidarity, economic and social cohesion and equal opportunities between citizens of all the Member States."
"In order to attain this, we now need to openly declare our commitment to an economic and social union as well as to define a new 'social contract' that establishes the common principles in social matters."
"However, this will not be possible if the development of an integrated economic policy is not accompanied by closer alignment of Member States' tax systems."
"In short, I very broadly share the conclusions reached in the resolution we are considering."
"I will support it all the more as it highlights the need to strengthen Parliament's role in all matters concerning Economic and Monetary Union."
"Sadly, I have to note that the scenario we feared will become a reality if this text is adopted. We predicted that the existence of EMU would result in calls for harmonisation in areas such as taxation, as well as employment and social policy."
"The Member States are, in other words, being asked to harmonise their economic policies - which is one of the reasons why I voted against this report."
"EMU means 'more Union'."
"Decisions on economic policy, as well as interest and exchange rates, become an EU-only affair."
"In the long term, fiscal and financial policy will be decided at Union level too."
"A whole raft of reports from the European Parliament confirms this trend."
"EMU is an economic and political project - the cornerstone of a future EU state."
"This report admittedly takes a relatively softly-softly approach, but the underlying message is there."
"Economic policies are described in terms of 'issues of common interest'."
"The report speaks of approximation of fiscal and social policy, more qualified majority voting and a stronger Commission."
"The rapporteur calls for 'conclusion of the draft interinstitutional agreement on the coordination of national economic policies and on monitoring the stability and growth pact'."
"Such measures would only increase the power of the EU and widen the democratic deficit."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The rapporteur clearly views EMU as a platform for championing the transformation of the EU into a federal state."
"In the recitals to his report, he uses formulations such as 'The European Parliament... considers that the absence of a common economic and fiscal policy appears to be completely incompatible with the unified management of monetary policy'; or '... points out that establishing monetary union would require a 'federal-style' budgetary system'."
"EMU as an enterprise is fundamentally undemocratic."
"Yet the rapporteur erroneously hopes to remedy its shortcomings by granting increased powers to the European Parliament and allowing qualified majority voting in the Council on the general guidelines for the Member States' economic policy."
"The EU should operate on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation."
"Accordingly, unanimity must be the rule when Community-wide measures are decided upon. It should be governments that appoint the president of the ECB, and the Member States must be responsible for shaping national economic and fiscal policy."
"In the interests of the continued positive development of the EU, it is necessary for economic and monetary union to be a success."
"Especially in the light of the prospective enlargement, it has become even more important to ensure that the structure of EMU is as healthy and as effective as possible."
"This can be achieved in part by providing for strict control of the economies of the participating countries."
"In my opinion, it is important to ensure that a healthy balance exists between decisions taken at national and supranational level."
"Coordination of macroeconomic regulation is essential, but it is important that the EU does not deprive the Member States of the responsibility which they are obliged to live up to as members of the economic and monetary union."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes much of the Barros Moura report, and the attention it pays to the political consequences of Economic and Monetary Union."
"However, we have major reservations about some aspects of the report."
"In paragraph one, second indent, we cannot support the implication that social security must be harmonised to make EMU a success."
"If the President of the Central Bank is to enjoy the confidence of all Member States, he or she should be appointed by consensus."
"We therefore voted against paragraph 8."
"We are concerned about the proposals to extend QMV to the management of economic policy and voted against paragraphs 10, 16 and 20."
"The proposal for a 'federal-style' budgetary system in paragraph 18 is also one we oppose."
"Paragraph 14 calls for the Euro Council to be enshrined in the Treaty."
"This risks institutionally a two-tier Europe in which non-EMU Member States of the EU will be in some sort of second division."
"We oppose this."
"On the final report, the position of the EPLP was to abstain."
"Mr President, we believe that of all the European institutions, the Council of Ministers and, to a greater extent, the European Council, possess the greatest relative legitimacy because people see their elected representatives meet in these institutions at the highest level."
"No other European institution has achieved such status, neither the European Parliament, which is still considered to be a lower House, nor, of course, the Commission, which is considered to be a mere collection of civil servants."
"In the very interests of Europe, attention must be focused on the most legitimate institution."
"Therefore, the Council must be granted the right to propose legislation and exercise control over the Commission, even censure it."
"Also, decisions must be taken unanimously for all major issues."
"In this respect, the Bourlanges report asserts that 'unanimity is an arrangement fundamentally inappropriate to effective decision-making '. In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur presents some gloomy calculations showing that with 15 players, the probability of achieving a unanimous position is one in 32 769."
"This is quite clearly wrong, because in today's Europe, a great many decisions are taken every day by general consensus."
"In fact, the system of unanimous voting forces each partner to respect the point of view of others and endeavour to understand that point of view in order to negotiate better."
"The decisions taken as a result are more valid because they are based on mutual consensus."
"It seems as though this system is perhaps somewhat slower than others that are more authoritarian in nature, but it nonetheless produces good results."
"An enlarged Europe with 25 or 30 members should be able to operate in this way."
"We also reminded you, through an amendment, that the Luxembourg compromise should be incorporated into all parts of the Treaty."
"Unfortunately, that amendment was rejected."
"In any case, we have to accept that a Europe with 25 members cannot be monolithic and must obey the model of variable geometry."
"All of these measures, including the variable geometry which will make decisions on European cooperation more flexible, will strengthen the link between Europe and its nations."
"If the Union is to meet its goal of enlargement, reform will need to extend beyond agricultural policy and the Structural Funds to embrace the whole process of decision-making."
"The report is therefore a welcome initiative."
"We do not however agree with the rapporteur's proposals on the common and foreign security policy, the CFSP."
"Our view is that the Council plays - and should continue to play - a central role with regard to the EU and the CFSP."
"We would refer to the political spirit underpinning Article J.7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, where it is stated that the Council shall be responsible for decisions in all areas affecting the Union's security."
"The rapporteur's paragraphs 10, 13 and 14 are not acceptable in the light of this."
"We believe that the concept of positive abstention could be of assistance in fulfilling the Petersberg tasks (humanitarian intervention, and peacekeeping and peacemaking measures). In our view, however, political will alone can equip the EU to be more active in crisis management."
"The outcome will hinge on how the new decision-making procedures work out in practice. We cannot therefore support paragraphs 30 and 31."
"We support the forward thinking in the Bourlanges report about the way the Council should operate in an enlarged European Union."
"In particular, we support his call for better coordination and greater efficiency through increased use of qualified majority voting and, above all, the vital importance of returning to the Community method by re-establishing institutional balance, with a strong Commission endowed with a real power of initiative and political drive."
"We have voted against certain points:"
"The rapporteur's limited definition of constitutional issues for which unanimity would be maintained; -Paragraph 33, which would give qualified decision-making power in budgetary matters to the States contributing most. This is at odds with the Community method and the principle of constitutional equality between the Member States; -On the weighting of Council votes, anything that goes beyond maintaining the current balances and might therefore encourage the concept of a 'directing board' of the larger Member States; -As in the previous points, anything that might predetermine the position of the European Parliament on basic political and constitutional issues before the process of revising the Treaties begins; -Anything that would make good anti-European propaganda in the coming election campaign.Our final overall vote was determined by the outcome of the votes in the House on these issues - on which, thanks to our initiative and our efforts, the PSE Group has adopted exactly the same approach."
"Given that some of these essential concerns of ours - especially the weighting of votes in the Council - have not been sufficiently safeguarded, we have voted against."
"Before I make any comments, I should like to congratulate Jean-Louis Bourlanges on the quality of his report and the relevance of his remarks."
"Without prejudice to the future of the Community institutions, this text provides a particularly interesting basis for an excellent debate and, moreover, is proof of the maturity of this House, if indeed that still needed to be demonstrated."
"As regards the comments made about the Council, I share the rapporteur's concerns and cannot imagine enlargement ever taking place without there first being a thorough reform of the present decision-making process."
"My greatest fear is to see a paralysed European Union and one that is incapable of giving impetus to a clear policy."
"Faced with the challenges of the next millennium, we need a Council that is capable of setting out Europe's central themes."
"I also think that the ability to do this is fundamentally incompatible with the present system of the rotating presidency, which is why the question raised by Jean-Louis Bourlanges regarding the Council's powers is important, even if it is difficult to answer."
"As regards the way in which the Council of Ministers currently operates, and following the rapporteur's example, I am actively campaigning for a rehabilitation of its role: in my view, it must be the Union's driving force."
"Contrary to the report, I would prefer to see the various ministers for European affairs engage in closer coordination with a view to achieving greater consistency in national and European policies."
"In accordance with the agenda, the relevant minister should be in charge of the matter."
"Lastly, as regards the system of procedures and, more specifically, the general principle of qualified majority voting, I believe that this system should be extended."
"I am not opposed to the principle of the double majority, which to me seems more fair and legitimate than the present weighting system."
"Indeed, I also think that we need to begin debating the powers of the future European Commission within the context of the Union's enlargement."
"Finally, I should like, once again, to stress that enlargement cannot take place without there first being a change in the present institutional framework."
"This prerequisite is not, in my view, designed to hinder the process but, on the contrary, aims to establish the foundations of a political Europe that is able to take responsibility for the choices it makes."
"Jean-Louis Bourlanges has quite rigorously conveyed the expectations of our Committee on Institutional Affairs, which has for a long time been calling for a radical reform of the Council's role, structure and modus operandi ."
"Without such reform, successive enlargements will paralyse this central decision-making organ."
"During the discussion on this report, my concern - in thinking about European citizens - was to extract clear principles from the recitals which will push the European project towards the objectives of our efforts and proposals."
"In my opinion, this project is inextricably linked to an increased democratisation based on the principle of majority voting, the political accountability of the authorities, scrutiny on the part of parliamentary institutions and the transparency of decision-making procedures."
"The Union must progress towards a model which clearly reveals its dual nature as a union between Member States on the one hand, and as a union between peoples on the other."
"In this model, the Commission will become a genuine European executive, with Parliament representing the people and the Council representing the Member States."
"This model of Europe will be able to act as an integrated whole, which is both coherent and united, thereby increasing its international influence."
"As this is an own-initiative report from the European Parliament, my second concern relates to both the principle behind the report and the time chosen to adopt it."
"Generally speaking, I appreciate the efforts made by Jean-Louis Bourlanges and, in particular, his attention to detail in the proposals."
"However, I think that until the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified and implemented by the Member States, it would often be appropriate to leave to the future negotiators the job of putting forward specific rules and limiting our role to simply announcing the general guidelines we are to follow."
"In this way, we can be justified in our desire to see the double majority adopted in the long term, as this is a guideline that the vast majority of the House can ratify."
"But we will not go into detail regarding percentages here, as these should be studied at a later stage."
"I was pleased to note that the rapporteur had recommended that the weighting system be maintained until this double majority is adopted."
"However, it would perhaps be somewhat restrictive and ill-advised to suggest that current percentages must be maintained."
"The most important thing is for the principle of equilibrium to be maintained, chiefly between the larger and smaller countries."
"We should by all means clearly specify a guideline - maintaining equilibrium - but try to prevent divisions emerging by beginning a debate on quantification."
"As regards qualified majority voting, in the majority of cases, Jean-Louis Bourlanges' intention to withdraw the resources that belong to the cases that are excluded from this type of majority gives rise to concern."
"Parliament already gave its opinion on this matter when it examined the Méndez de Vigo-Tsatsos report - a report which expressed a balanced opinion and which was approved by the broad majority of Members - by making an exception of constitutional and 'semi-constitutional' matters in terms of qualified majority voting."
"In my opinion, it would not be wise to go back on this agreement at the present time, even if the term 'semi-constitutional' poses a problem."
"With regard to the issue of foreign policy, we are waiting for the Amsterdam Treaty to be both ratified and implemented before deciding whether or not to reject the idea of 'positive abstention'."
"I think that opinions on this are divided, even within the groups."
"Allow me to briefly sum up the approach that I advocate."
"At the present moment in time, we simply express the principles that guide us, which essentially means our desire to keep the balance, but we avoid discussing details that might divide us."
"This approach is similar to the 'culture of minorities', which leads to respect for others and rejects the abuse of dominant positions."
"For a long time, it has been clear to those of us that are in favour of consolidated European integration that successive enlargements have brought European institutions to the edge of paralysis."
"Any further enlargements are likely to hamper a system which, in its time, has proved its worth, but which was never designed to function with 15 members and less still with 20 or 25 members."
"Before any further accession takes place, European institutions must be reformed, including the Council, which has become tangled up in the growing multiplicity of its organs and takes more and more liberties with procedures that had, however, been determined in the Treaties."
"This is clearly an unacceptable situation."
"I fully share the rapporteur's conclusions, particularly where he affirms the need for a thorough reorganisation of the Council's structure and role, as well as the need to rationalise and consolidate procedures with a view to making it more efficient and transparent."
"I lay great emphasis on the role the rapporteur would like to see conferred on both the President of the Commission and the High Representative for the CFSP, instead of and in place of a Council presidency that is forced to concentrate on its conciliation duties."
"This effectively implies a new division of tasks that is likely to give fresh impetus to the Union."
"In this connection, I fully approve of the idea that qualified majority voting should become the general procedure for decision-making in the Council."
"Unanimous voting would then become the exception, its use only justified on the grounds of the seriousness and importance of a few rare decisions."
"What is more, I think that any future change to the weighting of votes needs to retain the present principle of the relative over-representation of Member States with small and medium-sized populations."
"To conclude, I should like to highlight the quality and importance of the work carried out by the rapporteur in the hope of helping European institutions to cope with the challenges they have yet to meet and overcome."
"There are several comments I should like to make in relation to this excellent report."
"1.I do not believe that Parliament should get involved in the Council's internal procedures as the Council has nothing to do with Parliament's.2.Contrary to the rapporteur's wishes as set out in paragraph 1, I believe that we would be ill-advised to make a distinction between the national and legislative role of ministers, as this might lead to calls for the creation of a new institution, such as a senate, which we do not need.3.I do not approve of the high-profile role the rapporteur confers on the European Council, as it is a role that appears to result from a very centralised and radical approach to politics.4.I do not share the rapporteur's scepticism concerning the rotating presidency."
"I cannot accept his proposal to hand over the tasks of Union leadership to the President of the Commission."
"On the contrary, I think that the presidency, with its enhanced responsibilities, has a significant effect on the attitude of each Member State towards the process of integration.5.This report once again raises the problem of small and large European countries in the context of the weighting of votes in the Council.I was extremely pleased to note the reasonable and well-thought out approach taken by the rapporteur on this issue and his rejection of the popularity-seeking attitude shown by the larger Member States."
"It is an attitude that comes from an unfounded fear of being dwarfed by a coalition of less populated states."
"What we need to do is to find a way of preventing a deadlock in the key areas of common legislation and extending the use of qualified majority voting."
"However, we must not lose sight of the fundamental principle of the partnership between small, medium and large states, formed on the basis of mutual confidence and equality; it is a principle that is all too often forgotten today."
"Lastly, I would wonder about the status of this text."
"If it intends to establish Parliament's position for subsequent negotiations, it is somewhat premature, but if it aims to launch the debate, it is welcome."
"For once, I shall abstain from voting."
"I do not oppose the report, because it is both detailed and interesting."
"However, if I voted in favour of it, I would feel that I was making a definitive decision about a matter that has yet to be debated and that will surely evolve."
"I am disturbed that three quarters of this House should be backing a report which unequivocally advocates such a radical institutional overhaul of the EU, without there having been any proper airing of the issues in the Member States or among ordinary citizens."
"The call for effective abolition of the right of veto and the desire to turn the Commission into a quasi-government constitute a huge leap in the direction of political federation, and away from the principle of intergovernmental cooperation as enshrined in the Treaties."
"I wish to distance myself resolutely from this new trend."
"The Commission - and, in particular, its president - would gain power too. It would be entrusted with 'tasks of leadership of the Union' and would act as the driving force behind foreign and security policy, in conjunction with the CFSP High Representative."
"This scenario is quite unacceptable to a non-aligned country."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs is calling for qualified majority voting in the Council to become the general rule, even when contributions to the EU budget are at stake."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"I believe that the EU should be based on intergovernmental cooperation."
"I cannot therefore endorse statements lamenting that there 'must' still be unanimity when decisions are taken in certain fields."
"Nor can I go along with the idea that the Commission should be the only body enjoying the right of initiative."
"Not allowing elected representatives to amend or propose legislation constitutes a serious breach of democratic principles."
"Finally, I believe that the CFSP High Representative should be Council-based and not transferred to the Commission, as the rapporteur proposes."
"We fully endorse the assessment of the Treaty of Amsterdam offered by the rapporteur in paragraph 1, where he says that the new provisions in many ways constitute a new stage in the development of the European Union."
"In this connection, we welcome his reference to the principle of non-discrimination."
"It is absolutely vital, in our view, that the Treaty be ratified as soon as possible. We cannot therefore support paragraph 11."
"On paragraph 13, we feel that it would be inappropriate, in the current circumstances, for the European Parliament to propose that 'police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters ... be defined more broadly'."
"As a result, we are unable to accept paragraph 13."
"The Gutiérrez Díaz report unintentionally shows, right from its title, the impasse the European Union is about to reach, stating that it is aimed at 'strengthening Union institutions with a view to establishing an area of democracy'."
"What more blatant admission could there be that, for federalists, European democracy is now an objective, rather than a path to achieving a goal?"
"This is indeed the situation we are faced with because of the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty which is building a European superstate at the cost of a real decline in democracy. On the one hand, it is destroying the national democratic area, excluding national parliaments, and making national law - including constitutional law - subordinate to Community law."
"On the other hand, it is proving incapable, for the time being, of establishing the slightest democracy at European level, quite simply because the European people do not exist."
"What is more, the transposition of parliamentary procedures into this House only manages to produce joint positions that are all too often artificial and that are only ever accorded secondary importance by the people of Europe."
"It would appear that, in spite of all of these diversions, genuine democracy remains the ultimate goal."
"I, however, have my doubts about this."
"Once antidemocratic institutions that are allowed to be strengthened without impunity are established, a return to control by the citizens can no longer take place spontaneously and painlessly."
"In spite of its good intentions, the Gutiérrez Díaz report exacerbates the situation by proposing that all the rights conferred on citizens by membership of the European Union be brought within the ambit of a specific Treaty title on 'citizens' rights'."
"It is to be noted that this aim appears very similar to that of the German Presidency, which has proposed to create a 'charter of fundamental rights' for the post-Amsterdam period."
"However, this is a guideline that would bypass national democracies even further and restrict their legitimate role as a pillar of the Union."
"It is indeed this role that we wish to preserve instead, so that democracy and respect for the people are always present in the life of the Community."
"European integration will only progress in the long term if the citizens of the Member States see any interest in it either for themselves or their children."
"Therefore, it is, in fact, vital that the Union's citizens do not perceive the various stages in European integration simply as an accumulation of ethereal texts, but as something tangible and meaningful for all."
"The rapporteur is right to lay particular emphasis on the practical provisions that have resulted from the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"So surely the free movement of people is thus a tangible way for everyone to assess the reality of the Union in a positive manner."
"On the contrary, the insecurity associated with organised crime which, to a certain extent, is also a result of the removal of internal borders, generates a very negative image of European integration in the eyes of our citizens."
"In my opinion, it would be irresponsible of us to lead citizens to believe that it is possible to simply remove internal borders in Europe without there being any negative effects, something that the rapporteur does not do."
"The free movement of persons naturally goes hand in hand with the creation of an area of security and justice which also enjoys enhanced police and judicial cooperation and respect for transparency and legal certainty."
"It therefore falls to the various institutions to act promptly, each in the area of its responsibilities, in order to meet people's expectations."
"I am absolutely convinced that it would be beneficial for everyone if the Council and the Commission were more open in their cooperation with the European Parliament, in these areas, as in many others."
"And on this particular point, I fully agree with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"This resolution, which was unfortunately adopted, includes a series of demands, amongst which are: increased power for the Court of Justice; the coordination of national employment policies at EU level; the creation of legal bases for the formulation of social legislation; legal recognition for transnational or 'European' political parties, with an entitlement to financial resources from the Union budget."
"These are all important issues, but they must be the subject of wide-ranging debate in the Member States before politicians from this Parliament adopt a position. And this debate - which will need to be held at all levels, in all contexts and in all countries - will have to centre on the major questions."
"Where is the EU going? What are the goals being pursued by the various organisations?"
"What do our citizens want? If we wish to retain people's faith in us, I believe that the time has come to discuss these matters openly."
"I cannot support this report in its entirety."
"I believe instead that:"
"Since the EU ought to be based on intergovernmental cooperation, the employment policies of the Member States should not be coordinated at Community level, although far-reaching cooperation is of course possible."
"This applies to legislation on pensions, civil legislation, etc.-Unanimity should be required in the Council on matters of asylum, visas, immigration and free movement.-Schengen should be done away with as soon as possible.-Police cooperation should also cease; we already have Interpol and it works very well indeed."
"Mr President, the Green Group voted against this report because we feel it does not go far enough."
"We have succeeded in some areas such as antibiotic resistance - that has been banned - and also on GMOs that cross-breed."
"That too has been banned."
"Other categories may be added later."
"There is a huge amount of confusion over the time limit of 12 years."
"Initially we wanted what the Commission proposed, namely seven years."
"We then had to propose 12 years because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which is supposed to protect public health and the environment, actually weakened the proposal and took out the time limit."
"So it was essential that we put some amendment in. We put in 12 years because we felt we would get some sort of consensus for it, which we did."
"But it is still unacceptable that the Environment Committee should actually water down a proposal by the Commission."
"We are supposed to be there to protect public health."
"That is a total contradiction."
"The whole issue of fast-track marketing is extremely concerning for the Greens."
"Basically it will mean that Member States who have some sort of conscience about environmental protection and public health will be side-lined because the Commission will decide and negotiate with the United States."
"Member States who feel it is important to protect the environment and public health will be side-lined."
"Already there are Member States within the European Union who have a conscience about this issue, who have serious reservations."
"The European Union is now going to set aside their concerns and negotiate as a whole."
"So multinational companies who control the EU and the United States are going to control this whole issue."
"Those are two of the reasons why we voted against this report."
"Having said that, there are some very positive elements in it."
"But even on time limits it is quite confusing."
"In certain areas we voted for the 12 year time limit but later on there were other votes taken which seemed to confuse the whole issue."
"So it is not very clear."
"One of the most disappointing things is the fact that the Environment Committee and the Socialist Group, along with the PPE in this House, have collaborated with industries' interests instead of with the interests of public health and consumer protection and the environment."
"History will prove that they were irresponsible in not upholding the rights of the environment and of public health."
"Mr President, GMOs provide an extra tool of dependency for nations and people, as is already the case for non-reproducible hybrid seeds and, generally speaking, all patented life forms, because these days, man's madness is leading him to patent the living world."
"Let us not be mistaken, all of this comes under a strategy for world domination, since people are being deprived of the ability to feed themselves."
"We must not forget, in passing, that these methods lead to large-scale job losses, and destroy the environment, quality, tastes and biodiversity."
"As the next millennium approaches, here is a sample menu the European Commission might serve up: human gene ham, hormone-enriched beefburgers, somatotrophic pasteurised cheese, and genetically modified apples from Chile."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all bon appétit !"
"Mr President, I voted against this, because despite two major successes, namely the ban on marketing those genes that can be made untraceable and the fact that we managed to insist on a certificate of liability insurance, the text on which the House decided at the end of the day is worse than bad."
"It represents the demolition of environmental and safety standards."
"We have even backtracked from the Commission's stance."
"The fact that we want to limit the marketing of products to a fixed period where there is inadequate monitoring experience relating to the marketing of comparable organisms effectively means that human beings and their environment are being used as guinea pigs, because if there is not enough experience available, these products should not be put on the market at all."
"And we have no right to say that they can be marketed for a fixed period."
"This is tantamount to saying that we shall see what has happened after twelve years, and only then will we draw the necessary conclusions."
"That, I believe, is utterly irresponsible, just like the simplified procedure, the procedure for simultaneous release in several Member States and the Category I classification, because all these organisms fall under Category I. This means in effect that an environmental risk assessment is virtually ruled out."
"I find this more than deplorable, along with the fact that no scope has been created for more stringent labelling."
"This makes it obvious that we have bowed the knee to industrial interests here."
"We shall see what the Council makes of it, and whether we can still pull the fat out of the fire together and initiate something that will really take us forward."
"I also hope that industry will finally get down to discussing the risks and that the insurance business stands by what it has said, namely that the risk is too great for it to cover."
"I call on all Irish MEPs to protect the Irish environment and peoples' health by voting to strengthen the Directive on the Release of Genetically Engineered Organisms in the Environment."
"This is a huge opportunity to safeguard the future of Ireland's clean green image of food production."
"I am calling on the Irish representatives to come off the fence and, along with other Members of the Parliament, to resist the intimidating lobbying tactics of the gene-industry."
"These companies are panicking because their plan to foist their tampered food products on the public in secret has been exposed."
"Governments and even the companies themselves are now admitting the dangers of gene crops and food, so the genetic industry is now reverting to type by pressurising governments on the quiet, while trying to fool consumers in public."
"The Bowe report will subsequently translate into the legislation to govern the crops grown and the food eaten throughout Europe."
"The Green Group is pushing for full and open labelling of GE foods, proper risk assessment and a moratorium on GE crop and food which would be of immense benefit to Irish agriculture."
"I call on all Irish MEPs to support socio-economic provisions along with public liability."
"One of the most important questions is that of liability and who pays if there is a crisis like BSE."
"The insurance companies say that they cannot give cover unless the risks can be quantified."
"I am demanding that the Irish Government take steps to ensure the biotech companies quantify the risks to consumers."
"As well as resisting the attempts by the multinationals to water down these proposals, we have to eliminate fast-tracking mechanisms which would allow the gene industry to be unaccountable and uncontrollable."
"Genetically modified organisms - particularly when used in food crops - have been the topic of intense debate within the Union."
"Ethical considerations underlie many of the questions surrounding genetic engineering technology."
"Research has run on ahead, with public debate and political regulation lagging well behind."
"Ordinary citizens lack the knowledge to oversee developments, and this limits all our scope for reflection and critical appraisal."
"This directive is designed to introduce strict rules to govern the deliberate release of GMOs."
"The safety of human beings and the environment is put first, which is a good thing."
"And many of the amendments tighten up the Commission's text."
"Nonetheless, we feel that a more restrictive stance on the development of GMOs for use in food production should have been adopted from the outset. Equally, there should have been broader discussion of the advantages of this kind of research before we accepted trial applications, followed by the presence of GMOs in our food."
"We also believe that consumers have an absolute right to information, which means that they ought to be able to choose whether to buy products containing genetically modified ingredients or substances."
"The title of the Commission's new proposal for a directive regarding the placing of GMOs on the market might mislead people as to its severity: 'directive relating to the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms'."
"And yet, in spite of this somewhat dramatic title, the actual context of the text turns out to be quite vague, to the extent that 177 Members - including those from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations - out of 439 saw fit to oppose it."
"The content of this text is admittedly not completely negative."
"For example, the European Parliament has just voted in favour of some interesting amendments that recognise civil liability and force people to take out sufficient liability insurance to cover the losses that might be incurred by persons releasing GMOs."
"In spite of this positive point, there are four major faults with the report which have led us to reject it."
"First, it confirms that a centralised procedure in Brussels for the release of GMOs is planned for the majority of cases without any safeguard for Member States who would like to adopt more stringent measures."
"Therefore, under the auspices of the single market, it appears that underhand plans are afoot which might soon force Member States who do not want anything to do with GMOs to soften their approach towards them against their wishes."
"Second, it creates a simplified consent procedure for GMOs which contains a number of references."
"Speeding up the procedure of common law like this would mean that cases would not be properly researched, and that is unacceptable."
"Third, the European Parliament has extended the time-limit for placing GMOs on the market to 12 years, whereas the Commission itself only proposed a seven-year time-limit."
"This undoubtedly signifies a victory for pressure groups who have been lobbying the larger parties in this House, both the Socialists and the Christian Democrats."
"Fourth, some high risk GMOs have not been banned with sufficient force."
"Like the Green Group, we would like to see three categories of GMOs prevented from being placed on the market: GMOs with antibiotic resistant genes;"
"Instead of voting for an outright ban, Parliament has voted in favour of some very weak amendments, while claiming that certain measures need to be taken to prevent the transfer of genes from these GMOs."
"Overall, this proposal for a directive provides a general view of the direction in which European integration is currently heading: it is taking power away from the Member States and centralising it in Brussels under the pretext of being able to defend the people better."
"However, once the people have been stripped of their powers, the central decision-makers, who are in the driving seat, are themselves not monitored by anyone and do what they like."
"In the end, we find ourselves in a no-win situation, at the mercy of forces that are based in Brussels far more than anywhere else."
"Questions concerning genetically modified products loom larger every day."
"Neither politicians nor scientists can foresee the consequences for man and nature."
"It is therefore unforgivable, as things stand, to be giving the green light to genetically modified products; future generations may well have to pay dearly for our mistakes."
"The Environment Committee has produced a good piece of work, endeavouring to make the best of the situation."
"Many of the amendments were tabled in a similar spirit."
"Sadly, Parliament did not vote in favour of some of the most important ones, however, including the right of Member States to say 'no' (a 'black list') and more stringent labelling requirements. Along with the rest of the Green Group, I therefore voted against the report."
"Future employment in Europe largely depends on the successful development of biotechnology."
"This is why it is important that European firms and research institutes should be able to operate in the same way as their partners in America and Japan."
"Only then will they be able to survive against cut-throat competition worldwide."
"The industry needs a clear and viable legislative framework, and it goes without saying that great care is needed in this new field."
"Many of today's amendments to the Commission proposal for the release of genetically engineered organisms in the environment would result in excessively restrictive legislation for the biotechnology sector, putting the food industry and the EU's competitive position at a disadvantage compared with the US."
"The legislation would also have an impact in the Netherlands, where biotechnology has become one of the country's leading sectors, and this is why the VVD delegation has departed from the ELDR Group's position by voting against a number of amendments, including those tabled by Mrs Dybkjaer and Mr Eisma."
"The VVD continues to demand an unambiguous, viable and straightforward European legislative framework with simplified procedures for the biotechnology sector."
"The position of our group regarding the Commission's communication on biotechnology favours some degree of development in this sunrise industry, while taking great care to anticipate potential drifts."
"With this in mind, strict labelling procedures must be introduced to enable genetically engineered products to be monitored effectively."
"During the various debates we have had on genetically modified organisms, industrialists have persistently stated that the release of such organisms is under control."
"This is why our group supported the urgent request calling on the Commission to introduce specific rules relating to the liability of the various operators."
"The BSE crisis has highlighted the dangers of focusing all research on extremely high levels of agricultural production and the need to provide for a genuinely independent monitoring system."
"To this end, we supported the plan to create a central scientific committee, but we must ensure that the proper procedures are developed so that the mistakes that were made during the mad cow crisis are not repeated."
"To conclude, our group places much emphasis on the need to retain the precautionary principle so as to guarantee both consumer and environmental protection."
"The citizens of Europe will only fully accept biotechnology if they receive genuine assurances about its safety."
"It takes 15 years for experiments to be carried out on medicines before they can be placed on the market."
"However, here we are faced with the prospect of GMOs being released into the environment after only three years of piecemeal experiments and with no extra time allotted for assessing their direct or indirect effects on the environment and health."
"In this regard, we must bear in mind the answer given by the Commissioner for Industrial Affairs when asked if he thought that industrialists and politicians were not playing the sorcerer's apprentice once again."
"Mr Bangemann replied, ' We must not create metaphysical problems with GMOs; placing them on the market will prove their worth'."
"In other words, in the Commission's view, the best guinea pigs are still the consumers, to the extent that they are not even granted the right to correct information on the goods they are buying as labelling procedures are so lax."
"They are not even granted the freedom of choice."
"The report mentions on page 33 that genetically modified crops present 'few risks', but what does this decidedly unscientific term actually mean?"
"We should remember that the nuclear power station at Chernobyl was, until April 1986, said to have presented 'few risks'."
"According to Professor Cabrol, we should not ban GMO production in Europe and thus let the Americans have a monopoly on GMO products."
"This is an interesting comment, but his conclusions are surprising since if the Americans are allowed to export products that have not been fully tested to Europe, the best response is not for us to produce similar products ourselves."
"The only acceptable answer for the sake of public health is to ban the import of such products altogether."
"This is the logical application of a simple, but fundamental, principle, namely, the precautionary principle."
"How can we explain the European Commission's submission in the face of American agri-industrial lobbies?"
"GMOs, sterile hybrid seeds, the patenting of life forms, and so on, are all perhaps part of a more global strategy concerning people's and nations' dependency on food."
"As one American secretary of state said, food is the best weapon of the future."
"Mr President, while I support technological progress, I am voting in favour of this report today because I believe that my constituents should be protected from the excesses of US biotechnology firms, like Monsanto, eager only to turn a quick profit."
"All genetically modified foods must be clearly labelled to allow consumers make an informed choice when feeding their families and loved ones."
"Recent advances in bio-technology were first brought home to us by British scientists when they produced Dolly the Sheep - the world's first genetically-cloned sheep."
"And, with proper safeguards, biotechnology has the potential to help mankind defeat world hunger and disease."
"Without proper safeguards, however, the consequences of altering the order of nature are unthinkable."
"Safety must always come first."
"The Labour Government has proven its commitment to the welfare of consumers by creating the FSA (Food Standards Agency)."
"Its Tory predecessors, in contrast, were committed only to the welfare of the food industry and created BSE."
"Only Labour will stand up for ordinary people against Monsanto's madness and ensure that the food on our plates is safe to eat."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0126/99 by Mrs André-Léonard, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on presidential elections in Kazakhstan; -B4-0161/99 by Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the ARE Group, on presidential elections in Kazakhstan; -B4-0184/99 by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the V Group, on violation of international human rights standards in Kazakhstan; -B4-0186/99 by Mr Swoboda and Mrs Hoff, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the presidential elections in Kazakhstan; -B4-0196/99 by Mrs Castellina and Mrs Sornosa Martínez, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on presidential elections in Kazakhstan; -B4-0205/99 by Mr von Habsburg, on behalf of the PPE Group, on presidential elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan."
"Madam President, the presidential elections in Kazakhstan on 10 January were a slap in the face for the partnership and cooperation agreement that the Union signed with that country."
"Democracy and human rights are now a fundamental element of these agreements, but the conditions under which the elections were held did not correspond to the promises which the Kazakh Government made."
"The OSCE rightly refused to give the elections a seal of legitimacy, and the Union too must also - and not for the first time - clearly link the continuation of cooperation with progress in democratisation."
"President Nazarbayev must move quickly to take corrective measures, and we must hope that he has the means to do so."
"The suspension of cooperation must be a real option if he cannot guarantee that the forthcoming elections will be truly democratic."
"I know that this is easy to say here in the House, but if we do not take this approach with a country like this, with which we have signed agreements, then we are in nowhere country."
"In the meantime, we must step up cooperation with social organisations and the free press to promote democracy in Kazakhstan."
"As I have said, this is not a task we are setting ourselves, it is a request we are making to the Kazakh Government."
"Madam President, it is essential that we work for consolidation of the democratisation process in Kazakhstan, ensuring that developments take place in the interest of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The partnership agreement signed with the EU stipulates that Kazakhstan must comply with OSCE rules for free and fair elections."
"The serious crimes committed in connection with the presidential elections in January deserve firm condemnation."
"We do not wish to see a repeat performance, with infringements of civil liberties, when elections are held later this year."
"Freedom of the press and the right of individuals to stand as candidates are fundamental elements of democratic elections."
"I would like to use this opportunity to ask the Commission what steps it intends to take in order to ensure that the existing partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan is fully implemented. And how does the Commission plan to assist in strengthening the faltering democratisation process there?"
"We must help to ensure that democracy fares better than it did at the ill-fated presidential elections in January."
"Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I wish to say how profoundly disappointed we were in the conduct of the recent presidential elections in Kazakhstan."
"It is clear that these elections did not conform to OSCE standards for free and fair elections which are part of the commitments entered into with the signing of the partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan."
"This House should make it absolutely clear to President Nazarbayev, as both Mr Bertens and Mr Holm have said, that implementation of the PCA will depend on progress with the democratisation process and full respect for human rights, especially in the forthcoming local and parliamentary elections."
"At the same time the Commission must monitor the human rights situation in Kazakhstan closely and report back to this House on progress, or the lack of it."
"Kazakhstan is a vast country with great economic and political potential."
"It should not allow that potential to be stymied by its failure to guarantee civil and human rights."
"Madam President, I believe that when we talk about Kazakhstan, we often tend to wag the finger at the Kazakhs and tell them that they ought to start functioning as a perfect democracy with immediate effect."
"In so doing, we forget that Kazakhstan has only been a free country for ten years and it has actually done remarkably well to come as far as it has done in that time, not to mention the fact that Kazakhstan is a very important partner for us in that region, a partner which, I am glad to say, has freed itself of at least some of the shackles of Russian rule."
"We should show a great deal more understanding towards the Kazakhs, as well as remembering that we did not become perfect democracies overnight; we too required a lengthy development process."
"So we should exercise the same patience with the Kazakhs that we keep demanding for ourselves."
"The only reason why I wanted to say that is that I believe we ought not to forget, in our dialogue with Kazakhstan, how important this country is, not only for our own future but also for that of the entire region."
"We should therefore take due account of this important role and show patience; of course, we should keep telling them how to improve, but without that unbearably schoolmasterly tone which we are all too often inclined to adopt."
"After all, we must not forget that the Kazakhs are a people with a great history of which they have reason to be proud; if we act like the world's teacher, they will react in a way that neither benefits us nor promotes the achievement of our objective."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of Parliament's delegation for relations with Kazakhstan and other countries in Central Asia, I closely followed the news we received about the progress of the presidential elections held in Kazakhstan on 10 January."
"Unfortunately, this news was not as encouraging as we had hoped as regards the observance of essential and indispensable democratic standards."
"Kazakhstan is an important country surrounded by other important countries - Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and even Mongolia - all of which are of enormous interest to the European Union. This is due not only to their significant potential in terms of natural resources - natural gas, oil, gold, wool - but because the European Union is the global power that at this moment in time can contribute most to resolving the deficits that oppress these countries most after almost a century of Soviet influence: the democratic deficit, the human rights deficit, and the deficit in terms of learning how to establish themselves in a free market economy."
"That is why this resolution comes at just the right time. All it does is to draw attention to the democratic safeguard clause in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan."
"It is also timely in that free elections are going to be held in Kazakhstan this year."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr von Habsburg."
"I would like to end by warning you that this resolution must be seen more as a statement of help and understanding than as a reproach."
"We cannot expect to see perfect results immediately."
"What we really want is for the process of democratisation to continue."
"We want it to progress as quickly as possible, to continue and to be free of obstacles."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the points that have been made about the need to see Kazakhstan in a historical perspective and about the importance of Kazakhstan to us and in the region and also about the fact that we have to encourage Kazakhstan to move further, to say when things have gone wrong but to do it in the right way."
"The resolutions are based in part on the statement made on 20 January by the presidency on behalf of the European Union."
"It was clear ahead of the presidential elections that the way in which they were to be conducted fell short of OSCE standards, and that is why the OSCE did not send a full monitoring mission, nor did the EU participate."
"I also agree with the preliminary statement issued by the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights that we have a basis for important further cooperation with Kazakhstan in these fields."
"President Nazarbayev announced last October a wide-ranging programme aimed at the gradual democratisation of Kazakh society."
"The Kazakh Government has assured us that it intends to cooperate with the OSCE and the EU in implementing this programme, in particular regarding the law on parliamentary elections which will be held in the course of this year."
"I expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan to enter into force in the coming months."
"The first cooperation Council has already been scheduled for July, and it is the Council's intention to continue the exchanges of view on the democratisation process and to incorporate these into the political dialogue foreseen in the PCA."
"The European Parliament will also open a direct dialogue on these issues with members of the Kazakh parliament through the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which is one of the three institutions which will oversee the PCA."
"Despite the flaws and irregularities which marred the presidential elections, the atmosphere in Kazakhstan remains relatively liberal."
"These elections were the first in the history of the country to be contested by a number of candidates."
"I am firmly of the view that the only way to improve the situation is through constant patient work on the part of the EU and other donors and international organisations."
"The PCA offers us the basis for this."
"Moreover, we are about to launch a major TACIS project to support the entry into force of the PCA and you will recall that the PCA incorporates by reference the principles set out in the OSCE documents."
"Commissioner van den Broek intends to visit Kazakhstan shortly, and we will reiterate our determination to implement the principles we have jointly subscribed to and our readiness to assist with the further development of democratic institutions and the rule of law."
"The Commission will keep Parliament informed of developments in Kazakhstan and other countries of the region with regard to the implementation of our agreements."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0165/99 by Mr Fassa and Mr Bertens, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea; -B4-0182/99 by Mr Telkämper, Mrs Aelvoet, Mr Schörling and Mr Tamino, on behalf of the V Group, on the new outbreak of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea; -B4-0195/99 by Mr Vecchi, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea; -B4-0210/99 by Mr Hory, Mr Castagnède and Mr Scarbonchi, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea."
"Madam President, after the cease-fire, the senseless war between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out once again."
"I really wonder whether we will ever manage to make the two sides realise that there can only be losers here."
"The issue now is who actually started the fighting - a fratricidal struggle between two obstinate leaders who six years ago lived in one country."
"Both sides claim land on the basis of old colonial maps, and both are too stubborn even to talk to the peace negotiators and listen to what they have to say."
"There are mutual recriminations, with each accusing the other of having started the trouble."
"All the efforts of the UN, IGAD and the OAU have come to nothing, but I hope that they will not give up."
"International pressure must be brought to bear on both sides to bring about a new cease-fire for a start."
"Eritrea and Ethiopia must realise that they have a great deal to lose if Lomé cooperation is suspended."
"Both sides will eventually come back to the peace proposals put forward by the OAU, or at least I hope they will."
"I also hope that they will come to their senses quickly."
"The longer it takes them to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict, the more enormous will be the cost."
"The disastrous effect that this is having on the people and the economy of both countries is indescribable."
"I can tell you this from first hand experience, as I spent some time there when both countries were still united."
"I have to say that the situation in this area of Africa deserves to be given our fullest attention."
"Madam President, may I make an initial remark outside my allotted speaking time."
"At our last part-session, we said that the presidency of the Council should attend these debates."
"It would be good if that were the case, but unfortunately I see nobody from the presidency."
"Perhaps you could arrange that for next time through the Bureau."
"On the border between Ethiopa and Eritrea, serious conflicts occurred between those two countries in May and June of last year."
"There were battles in which thousands died; in June 1998 a moratorium was signed, but hostilities have broken out again."
"We have a frontier conflict here which the population certainly does not want."
"International conciliation efforts appear to have failed."
"Nevertheless, we should not stop trying to achieve peace in that region, because peace will never be achieved there by military means."
"It is right to say that we shall have to exert pressure on both countries."
"That is why it is also right to threaten them with suspension of support under the Lomé Convention and of development aid from the European Union and its Member States."
"But this pressure may not be enough."
"Perhaps it would also be important and appropriate - and we saw this when we met the two ambassadors in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in the Executive of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly - for us to draw up a development plan, subject to both sides withdrawing their military hardware, to their showing willingness to negotiate, and to their being prepared to develop democracy and the rule of law and to grant reciprocal inspection rights. We would then deliver a development plan and would step up the current level of development aid as an initial measure."
"Madam President, sadly what we all feared has happened. It was widely predicted."
"Armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out again with unprecedented violence."
"Although the information reaching us is very patchy, it is clear that there have already been thousands of victims, military and civilian, and the conflict, which apparently flared up after a small border problem, is threatening to become one of the bloodiest wars in the history of Africa."
"In this Parliament we have always been concerned about relations and tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation succeeded in getting the ambassadors from both countries to attend several meetings it organised - something which no-one else has managed to do."
"Today we call on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease hostilities immediately."
"We also call for absolute compliance with the moratorium on air raids, which has already been violated, unfortunately."
"The leaders of the two countries of the Horn of Africa now have the historic responsibility of choosing between peace and even worse crimes against their peoples."
"The OAU proposal for an agreement between the two countries must be accepted by both parties without further delay, before the situation on the ground renders it obsolete."
"All arms supplies and military assistance to the two warring sides must immediately cease, as called for yesterday by the United Nations Security Council."
"The European Union must join the Organisation for African Unity in applying intense pressure and offering political and diplomatic mediation, which has been totally inadequate in the last few months."
"The United States of America might have been expected to take on the task over the last few months, but it has proved quite incapable of doing so."
"So we call on the Council to take a clear and strong political initiative along these lines, and on the Commission to ensure that the thousands of refugees and victims of the conflict receive the maximum humanitarian assistance wherever possible."
"Madam President, alas the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has a long history, but so have human rights abuses in Ethiopia, as all of us know only too well."
"One can but continue to deplore the fact that international mediation efforts have failed to secure a peaceful settlement, and the two countries must surely share the blame."
"The double tragedy is that the population of the two countries is poverty-stricken and suffering in so many ways."
"This makes it all the more difficult to link development aid and Lomé-related benefits."
"But it may be that a hard line will need to be taken by the EU."
"Clearly, the OAU and the UN have a continuing role to play, but is it out of the question for the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to play a key role as well in trying to resolve this desperate situation?"
"Madam President, in yesterday's International Herald Tribune, the following appeared in the section 'News from 50 years ago'."
"I will quote it in English and hope that the interpreters can follow me: '1949: Eritrea's fate."
"Rome. Foreign Minister Sforza said that the interests of three powers - Great Britain, Italy and Ethiopia - are involved in the problem of Eritrea, former Italian African colony."
"Count Sforza expressed the hope that Eritrea would not be annexed to Ethiopia."
"The attempt to reconcile these interests at the expense of Eritrea by territorial partition recalls the old scramble for Africa."
"Count Sforza said it was repugnant."
"He said Eritrea could achieve independence after a period of trusteeship administration.' End of quotation."
"Fifty years later, on 11 February 1999, the headline in the International Herald Tribune reads 'Addis Ababa rules out cease-fire in border war'."
"So that is that!"
"The article goes on to say that Washington is particularly angry that Antonovs and Migs are being used to bombard Eritrean territory."
"This is exactly what Ethiopia has been doing for some time, arrogantly disregarding all advice or agreements, simply because it enjoys political support in the world."
"However, I think that we cannot allow this to continue: we need to adopt a rather more critical approach."
"Ethiopia's diplomatic circles may be bombarding us with paper to try to convince us that its cause is just, as it has every right to do, but at the same time various issues relating to the border war and attacks on the Oromos - the largest minority in the area, some of whom have been imprisoned - are being brushed under the carpet."
"Our urgent resolution today is a desperate attempt by the European Parliament to prevent the war in the Horn of Africa from escalating and further destabilising the region, and it even calls for more humanitarian aid."
"Quite honestly, I think that we should be talking about stopping financial aid, since it is obviously being used to buy Antonovs and Migs."
"We all know that Russia will not supply on credit, because it needs cash in hand."
"If it appears that Eritrea too is not prepared to listen to what we say, then it should suffer the same fate."
"Although the tone of our resolution is very mild and no mention is actually made of stopping financial aid, I would like to ask Commissioner Brittan what he thinks about this, because it is just a waste of money, like in Angola."
"Madam President, after the madness of the red dictator Menghistu and the tribal hatreds of the Yemen, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea places the Horn of Africa centre stage again, while Europe looks on with nothing but words to offer."
"Antagonism which could have been resolved through democratic dialogue has instead deteriorated into a tragic situation inflamed by ethnic claims."
"The Africans therefore need to consolidate still delicate regional balances by combining as much of their authority as possible, and in particular by involving civil society so as to put the necessary pressure on the governments involved to find a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"This is where Europe should intervene, speaking one language: the language of development aid, guided and determined by the drive to achieve political and social stability, which remains the only means of preventing conflicts and reducing the number of zones at risk."
"Madam President, in the resolution we are discussing today, great importance attaches to paragraph 6, which actually says everything. That is where we say precisely what is to be done, namely that the payments made by the European Union to Ethiopia and Eritrea should be linked to both countries' compliance with certain conditions."
"I believe that this is enormously important if we bear in mind on the one hand that the war which we now experiencing between Ethiopia and Eritrea was entirely foreseeable, and on the other hand that the settlement of this conflict will surely be frustrated by a real lack of democracy in both countries."
"To my mind, it is a very serious problem when I see, for instance, that newspapers in Ethiopia, which are naturally controlled by the government, are even now reporting continuously on the amounts of money they have already amassed for the next 'election campaign'."
"I have to say quite honestly that I fear the campaign chest contains some money which our taxpayers might have provided, whereas the opposition has to try desperately to raise funds abroad in order to conduct its election campaign, in order to establish itself as a proper opposition, and the resources for that are non-existent."
"This is extremely regrettable, and I very much hope that the appropriate steps will be taken within the European Union to ensure that the funds we provide are used for legitimate purposes."
"I am sure the Commissioner will agree with that."
"We have to call on both sides to cease all hostilities and stop fighting because clearly negotiation is the only way to solve the problem."
"The Commission has underlined on several occasions, to both governments, the need to resolve and settle the conflict by peaceful means alone."
"A military option or so-called solution will entail - and is already entailing - enormous human suffering and loss."
"We will continue to support all efforts aimed at peaceful resolution of the conflict, in particular the OAU efforts and proposals."
"We will continue to put the maximum pressure on both parties, are willing to take any action needed to help find a solution and are currently examining what could be done."
"I listened with interest to Mr Moorhouse's suggestion that the EU/ACP Joint Assembly could play a role, and will draw that to the attention of my colleagues dealing on a more day-to-day basis with this issue."
"As regards the humanitarian situation the Commission is providing humanitarian assistance to both countries and has responded to appeals from both to assist the displaced population in the area of conflict."
"The Commission has allocated EUR 1 790 000 to two NGOs: Norwegian Church Aid and the Lutheran World Foundation for food and non-food assistance to persons affected by the conflict in Eritrea."
"In Ethiopia the Commission has allotted EUR 1 890 000 through CISP, an Italian NGO, also for food and non-food assistance."
"Furthermore, EUR 300 000 was approved for ICRC activities in Ethiopia and in Eritrea."
"The Commission will continue to monitor closely the situation and is ready to mobilise additional resources if needed."
"I should like to comment on the wider point that has been raised."
"The Commission is preparing a communication to the Council on cooperation with ACP countries involved in armed conflicts."
"In the meantime, in the absence of a European Union position on the matter, the Commission does not think it should take unilateral and isolated measures in the case of this conflict."
"But the Commission has decided to allocate structural adjustment programme funds in smaller tranches and link further disbursements to a periodic review of the conflict and its possible impact on public spending, particularly in the social sectors."
"Moreover, when releasing financial assistance to countries in conflict, the Commission will send a letter to the head of state or government requesting assurances that no funds are diverted for belligerent purposes."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Greg Summers"

"Madam President, it is a sad fact that the European Parliament is once again having to draw attention to terrible events that are taking place in a so-called civilised country."
"I am referring here to the use of capital punishment in the United States of America."
"Despite the horror that we have expressed in a number of urgent resolutions, a horror that we share with many human rights organisations all over the world, with the churches and with Amnesty International, the number of people being sentenced to death in the United States is increasing, often because their trials are not conducted with due care."
"This afternoon we are calling for attention to be given to the case of forty-year-old Greg Summers who, although innocent, has been sitting for years on death row in the Alace Unit in Texas waiting for the lethal injection that is shortly to end his life."
"Our resolution calls on the judicial authorities at least to examine the application for a review of his case."
"We also call on the United States, and in particular the authorities of the State of Texas, to abolish the death penalty immediately and to sign up to a worldwide moratorium on the execution of death sentences."
"Finally, there are a number of amendments calling for attention to be given to other similar cases, and it goes without saying that we will vote for them."
"Madam President, the European Parliament has always rejected the death penalty outright on humanitarian grounds."
"Once again, circumstances compel us to appeal to the government of a civilised nation, the United States of America, not to carry out a death sentence. This time we are appealing on behalf of Greg Summers."
"He has always protested his innocence."
"There are doubts as to whether the trial was properly conducted."
"An appeal was lodged with the competent court in Texas, and there has still been no response to it."
"For that reason, our first request to the United States and the State of Texas is that this appeal should be considered."
"Secondly, we call on them to refrain in principle from carrying out death sentences, commuting them instead to life imprisonment or other custodial sentences. Thirdly, we call for them to join in a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, and we call on the institutions of the EU to pass this on to the relevant authorities."
"Let me turn to our group's amendments on two cases involving Germans - the brothers Karl and Walter LaGrand, who have been sentenced to death in Arizona."
"This would be the first time since the Second World War that Germans were sentenced to death and executed."
"We call on the United States not to carry out their death sentences, and we hope that these amendments will be incorporated into today's resolution."
"In both cases, we propose that the death sentences be commuted to life imprisonment or another appropriate custodial sentence."
"Leonard Peltier"
"Leonard Peltier has been sitting in gaol for 23 years now, and the American authorities have finally admitted that he was wrongly imprisoned."
"It is absolutely incredible, and it is something the House should not just criticise but condemn."
"I hope that his case will be reviewed very quickly, and it would appear appropriate that a pardon should be granted."
"Human rights must be defended all over the world, it is as simple as that."
"Partly as a result of his treatment in prison Mr Peltier's health has visibly declined, but he is still being denied appropriate medical treatment for reasons which no one will explain."
"Like anyone else, this man deserves proper medical treatment in hospital, the prison hospital if necessary."
"A few months ago, I put a number of questions to the Council here in the House about the Peltier case, but the President-in-Office said that he did not think it necessary to take action, and it was not in his power to do so."
"I would now urge the Commission to take the case up, and I think that the Union as a whole should at least enter into discussions with the United States about its human rights policy."
"Madam President, during December's part-session, the American delegation led by Angela Davis, who had come to prevent Mumia Abu-Jamal from being executed, alerted us to the fate of Leonard Peltier."
"I can still remember the alarming remarks made by their spokesperson, Bobby Castillo, who had experienced American prisons."
"As a leader of the American Indian Movement, Leonard Peltier has played and continues to play a major role in the defence of the rights of indigenous people."
"Following the events of June 1975, in the Pine Ridge reserve, South Dakota, he was given two life sentences, although no proof of his guilt was ever furnished, and despite the fact that he had been illegally extradited from Canada."
"After 23 years in prison, his health has deteriorated dramatically and, although he permanently suffers as a result of complications from an operation, the prison's management deny him access to adequate treatment in a specialised hospital."
"Amnesty International, the IFHR and France Liberté have launched a new campaign to defend Leonard Peltier and fight the unacceptable number of human rights violations in the United States."
"Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is still on death row, has sent him a message of support."
"We should, for our part, once again participate in this action and ensure that public opinion is alerted throughout Europe."
"If Parliament adopts the resolution cosigned by my group, it will be sending a clear message to the American authorities and prison directors."
"Leonard Peltier must be given the chance to get better and receive the appropriate medical treatment in the clinic of his choice."
"He must be released from prison so that he can take up his legitimate struggle for the defense of the rights of the indigenous people that the United States continues to scorn."
"Madam President, I have always advocated the principle whereby the European Union must first of all put its own house in order before giving human rights lessons the world over."
"The latest report on human rights in the European Union shows that we are far from being beyond reproach in this area."
"In other words, if I take the floor today to speak about the case of Leonard Peltier, it is because all other possible avenues have genuinely been exhausted and time is short, given the worrying state of Mr Peltier's health."
"There are, in fact, two issues to our message to the United States. The first concerns the procedures used that resulted in Leonard Peltier's sentence, and the second concerns the prison authorities' refusal to let him receive the appropriate medical treatment."
"We must remember that Amnesty International expressly admitted that it had reservations about the procedures that lead to Mr Peltier's sentence and that the government authorities themselves admit to the vagueness that surrounded the sentence."
"Moreover, the trial revealed the unusual methods used during the case's preparation, as my colleagues previously mentioned."
"These facts should have lead to a retrial, but this case confirms that no court, be it American or European, will easily reopen a trial on which a sentence has already been passed."
"Herein lies a future struggle."
"However, as the previous speaker pointed out, the most incomprehensible and intolerable aspect of this case is the refusal of the American authorities to let Mr Peltier, whose health has considerably deteriorated, receive the medical attention he needs."
"The fact that prison facilities are unable to treat his condition is completely unacceptable as an argument to deny him the treatment he needs."
"Solutions do exist and have already been put forward."
"The refusal of the prison authorities to let him receive such treatment amounts to a blatant violation of human rights and of the commitments made by the United States."
"This is why our group will support the call for appropriate treatment and the request to grant Mr Peltier clemency."
"Madam President, there is an annual pantomime that always sends something of a shiver down my spine or at least leaves me open-mouthed in amazement, and that is the occasion when the President of the United States delivers his address on the state of the nation and the world."
"All the countries of the world are given plus and minus points."
"Words of praise and censure are pronounced."
"What it boils down to is that the whole world has to submit to American values and ideals."
"I believe it is very important to do what Parliament is doing today, to hold a mirror in front of the Americans and to tell them that, if they must try to force their values on everyone else, they should also acknowledge that there are sections of the population of their own country - some of them native Americans - who may have other ideals in some respects, a different bond with their own country, with their own native soil, than the Americans who arrived later."
"In this situation, it is very useful for us to keep returning to the specific case of Leonard Peltier."
"This is a case that has attracted international attention."
"There is an international Peltier Committee, of which I, for example, am a member and which has been dealing with the case for many years."
"I consider it particularly important that the European Parliament too has adopted a resolution calling for the case of Leonard Peltier to be placed on the agenda of the next talks between the delegation for relations with the United States and its American counterparts, in order to expose something of the hypocrisy that has so often dominated the US line of argument in this matter."
"Peltier has now been kept in prison for 23 years under exceedingly dubious circumstances."
"He is in very poor health."
"He has frequently been transferred, which has happened whenever public pressure has mounted and has become too great a burden for the prison in which he was accommodated."
"This just goes to show that not only the US population but also the international community are really unwilling to accept such injustice from a country that is constantly preaching justice."
"Madam President, it is with a feeling of dismay and deep anguish that we again raise our voices on behalf of Leonard Peltier, languishing in an American jail for 23 years for crimes he did not commit and after a court case which cast serious doubt on the administration of justice in the United States of America."
"Representative, Joe Kennedy, the son of the martyred President, recently said: 'This government has the moral duty to correct this injustice."
"Seeing that justice is upheld for Leonard Peltier would amount to a major act of reconciliation for past injustice done to the native American peoples.'"
"The anguish of millions of people who follow this case increases by the day with the rapid deterioration of his health."
"After an egregious case of medical malpractice in prison hospital, Peltier is suffering a fibrosis of the masseter muscles and ankylosis of the mandibular joint."
"That means that he cannot eat - that his mouth cannot be opened any more."
"The United States Bureau of Prisons still denies his request to be operated on by proper surgeons."
"Enough is enough."
"In the name of humanity we urge the United States Administration to take prompt care of its native son."
"We ask President Clinton to use his powers of pardon to release Leonard from prison immediately."
"Madam President, half an hour ago, in the discussion on Kazakhstan, I said that we should not go around teaching the world how to behave."
"This time, however, it is quite a different matter, because we are now dealing with those who constantly seek to lecture us, as Mr Habsburg-Lothringen was saying before. In other words, we do have the right in this instance to say that things simply cannot go on like this."
"The whole process, which I have studied very closely, raises all sorts of doubts."
"Not a single piece of conclusive evidence was brought against Peltier."
"The way in which the American judiciary dispensed so-called justice in this case is simply indefensible for a highly civilised country."
"We should therefore point out to our American friends, to whom, of course, we owe a huge debt of gratitude, that something has to be done about Peltier."
"To deprive a person of 23 years of his life, to cast an Indian into prison and give him no opportunities to move about, to give him literally not a single moment of freedom and to leave him languishing in uncertainty is utterly indefensible."
"Having followed the history of the Peltier case, I would almost make so bold as to say that, even if he had done something, which I do not believe, he would already have paid twice over for everything that happened."
"If we are convinced that he is innocent into the bargain, that is all the more reason for us to make every effort to ensure that the Americans make justice prevail in their country too - and if not justice, then at least clemency."
"Madam President, I would like to echo the sentiments of Mr von Habsburg."
"Truly this is a cross-party approach which we must take to the American authorities and insist that they respond to the many pleas which have been made for clemency on behalf of Leonard Peltier."
"It really is ironic that at a time when the future of the American President himself is being decided by Congress - on an issue which bears very little similarity to the case against Leonard Peltier - neither he nor, in fact, his predecessors, have responded to the pleas of clemency made and awaiting a response for the last 6-7 years."
"Therefore we in this Parliament should insist that when Mr Clinton resumes work, presuming he is not impeached, this is an issue which he should address as a matter of urgency."
"It is an issue which symbolises the treatment of American indigenous peoples, a matter very dear to the heart of this Parliament and I hope that we adopt the resolution."
"Religious freedom"
"Madam President, if the European Parliament resolves today to speak out against the increasingly frequent and violent infringements of religious freedom, such a resolution will be a token of our great concern."
"Freedom of religious observance is a sign of respect, not only for a very profound sense of devotion within many people but also for freedom of expression and association, and hence for a significant part of the corpus of human rights."
"We are well aware that the violation of religious freedom can have many different causes."
"We also know that these waves of persecution are not always unleashed by governments."
"The causes vary from one country to another."
"There are power struggles for the control of sources of raw materials and water, as in the Sudan, where an armed majority is let loose on a large minority; hatred, envy and social and political tension can focus on ethnic groups, as in India and Pakistan and now in Indonesia too."
"There are intolerant state religions, as in Iran, Afghanistan and other countries; intolerance can also come from adherents of non-established religions."
"It would be impossible to list all the countries involved."
"The toleration of these persecutions and the forms they take cause us grave concern."
"They range from horrific murders, as in the case of the Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two children in India, to arrests, torture and the disappearance of individuals; they extend to trials on trumped-up charges."
"Extremism, xenophobia and racism often rear their ugly heads, with governments either impotent or unwilling to curb them."
"And yet there are many constitutions, even in those very countries, which enshrine freedom of religious worship, and states have signed international covenants and UN conventions which are supposed to guarantee religious freedom."
"But there are also new religious laws with provisions that hover dangerously on the brink of intolerance, and the European Parliament wishes to draw attention to these new risks."
"Religious groups themselves, however, must also remain tolerant towards those with different beliefs from their own, and must respect freedom of conscience and of the individual as well as obeying the law of the land."
"That goes without saying."
"Abuse of religious freedom is symptomatic of the abuse of human rights."
"That cannot be said often enough."
"Respect for the religious beliefs of minorities is also a sign of properly functioning constitutions rooted in natural law and guaranteeing tolerance and peaceful interaction between the various sections of the population."
"We in Europe have bitter historical experience of the effects of intolerance."
"We have overcome our intolerance, and we are now trying in this House to help others to do the same."
"Political and social tensions have been used time and again in the past as an excuse for savage religious persecution."
"On the threshold of the third millennium, and in view of the increasing degree of global interdependence, I believe we must call on governments and on the representatives of the major religions, who also exercise power in their own name, to observe and to act upon the warning signs."
"By including democracy and human rights clauses in its treaties with non-Member States, the European Union tries to ensure observance of human rights in the countries with which it cooperates. The European Parliament will not cease to ask searching questions on these matters."
"Suppression of religious freedom - let me emphasise again - is a clear symptom of human rights abuses, the causes of which are rooted in national circumstances that need to be improved, circumstances that not only result from religious strife but are also due in particular to social and political factors."
"The Commission supports interdenominational organisations in many countries; in that way, it reaches the people and gets to the roots of the problems, and we want to ensure that the resources we provide for this purpose are not affected by the developments on which we have been focusing today and that these channels remain open to us."
"That is the background to the resolution which we have tabled today."
"Madam President, 50 years on from the introduction of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, more and more new rights are being added to it."
"In fact, people have been saying, quite rightly, that it is all beginning to get out of hand."
"But this does not mean that the old, established rights are now universally respected."
"Quite the reverse."
"There are still problems with the rights of religious minorities, which we are discussing today in connection with an urgent resolution on the issue."
"In many countries, people are still not free to express their religious beliefs in public or to follow their faith as they would wish."
"They are subject to persecution, repression and discrimination."
"Recently in Parliament we have talked about Pakistan and Iran, for example, and now unfortunate events in India are giving us cause for concern."
"For years now, but increasingly so in recent weeks, Christians in India have suffered attacks by Hindu activists."
"In fact, over the last year there has been an enormous increase in the number of attacks on Christian schools and churches in India."
"Priests are accused of forcing people to convert to Christianity by bribing them with money and jobs, for which they must be punished."
"Missionaries in particular are bearing the brunt of the attacks, because they are seen as the legacy of British rule, although strangely enough a lot of the missionaries are actually Christians of Indian origin, a fact that seems to be overlooked here."
"Recently, a large group of Christians and Muslims protested against the fact that the authorities are doing nothing to counter these forms of aggression."
"The attacks have been condemned in the media, and it is certainly not true that the majority of the population approve of them."
"But this does not make the attacks any less worrying."
"One possible reason for them is the increase in the number of Christians in India, and strangely enough they are the ones who have been bearing the brunt in recent times, whereas before that it was mainly Muslims who were the target."
"The reason for this shift is clear: the Muslims in India are concentrated in certain areas, where they are an important factor when it comes to the elections."
"The Christian minority is smaller in number and is largely scattered all over the country, so it is not important in electoral terms."
"Fortunately the Indian Government has now promised to set up a committee to investigate the recent attack on an Australian missionary and his children aged seven and ten."
"Yet it still appears indifferent to such occurrences."
"There is clearly a link between the increase in attacks in India and the fact that the BJP, an extremist Hindu nationalist party, has come to power."
"It believes that too much attention is paid to religious minorities in India, and these attacks help it in its attempts to change this situation."
"With this resolution Parliament is making a clear appeal to countries and governments to take a responsible approach in dealing with religious minorities living in their territory."
"In particular, it calls on the Indian Government to investigate the attacks of recent weeks and to try to prevent them in future."
"If the situation does not change, the European Parliament and the Member States may wish to consider whether the events in India should affect their dealings with that country."
"Any respectable government must help to ensure that minorities in its country can live in freedom and can pursue their faith as they see fit."
"Human rights here involve not just rights for individuals, but also an obligation upon governments to give minorities the freedom that is God's gift to everyone."
"Madam President, as someone who has a parent who was born in India and has many friends from India in the various and diverse communities of faith which make up India's rich mosaic of cultures, I can assure you that it gives me no pleasure to move this resolution today."
"There have been Christian communities in India since St. Thomas landed in Kerala in AD 52."
"By and large the Christians have lived alongside their neighbours for many years in peace."
"But the horrific death of Graham Staines and his two sons, in January, sadly brought to public attention a worsening persecution."
"These murders were the apex of a spiralling campaign of violence against Christians of all denominations."
"In a courageous address to his people the Prime Minister of India highlighted other incidents which are not acceptable in a modern, tolerant democracy."
"These killings and other attacks have been unreservedly condemned by the World Hindu Council."
"The perpetrators of these atrocities do not represent the people of India or mainstream Hinduism."
"This resolution will be a significant message to those extremists that the people of Europe are in solidarity with all those who value and defend religious and communal tolerance."
"Finally, not as a spokesman of my group but as an individual who worships Sunday-by-Sunday in a British church where we have members of the congregation who see India as their mother country, let me assure the people of India that they are in our prayers and that we pray for both the persecuted and the persecutors."
"India, you have our love, our respect and our prayers in this difficult time."
"Madam President, I oppose religious persecution wherever it occurs."
"However the text of this resolution, I believe, is ill-judged and unfair in singling out one country when throughout the region and elsewhere there are many similar cases."
"We should realise that Christianity has flourished in India for 2000 years - longer, in fact, than here in Europe."
"I have been given permission to move on behalf of my group an oral amendment, which is to add to rectial C. the words: 'and applauding the Prime Minister's speech to the nation on 30 January supporting this and opposing sectarian violence'."
"We will be supporting that during the vote but unfortunately I will not be here because of the difficult timing of flights out of Strasbourg, so I have to leave before the vote."
"The officials have a copy of that text and so will the Socialist Group representatives."
"Madam President, the Liberal Group has always stood up for human rights in general, and of course the right to freedom of religion deserves attention as part of this."
"I know that I am entering dangerous territory here, but from time immemorial, the greatest violations of human rights have been carried out in the name of religion."
"It has happened regularly throughout history that religious minorities have not been entitled to exercise the same rights as religious majorities, and this is still true today, with religious riots and other problems in India and on Ambon, and structural repression in Iran and Afghanistan."
"We are not here just to protect Christians, I hope - we must protect and make room for all religions, and this means standing up for Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, for example, who are currently facing prosecution in Moscow."
"The Liberal Group calls on the Commission and the Council to remain vigilant and to take account of religious freedom when assessing the human rights situation in third countries."
"I hope that there will be an opportunity in the next legislative period to produce a comprehensive report on human rights and the role of religion."
"Sadly, I will not be here to see it."
"Mr Bertens, I deliberately allowed you to exceed your time, as you are one of the most regular attenders in this House."
"We have some time in hand, but I would ask you not to exceed our time-limits."
"Mr President, attacks and assaults on religious minorities are unfortunately frequent in India."
"Although the Indian Constitution expressly guarantees religious freedom, the violence goes on."
"Human rights are also constitutionally safeguarded."
"This resolution was tabled following the murder of a Christian missionary, but we must not limit our attention to Christians alone; other religious minorities in India, such as Sikhs and Muslims, are subjected to even greater religious persecution."
"There is no inevitability about these attacks; people are not programmed to use violence. Not at all."
"The truth is that several extremist groups are fanning the flames, among them the VHP, which patently has links running high up the political ladder."
"Nor should we forget the origins of the stand-off in India between different religious groupings: social strife, poverty and illiteracy."
"Efforts must be made to tackle these problems; then we may well see less religious tension."
"India is not the only country where religious groups are pitted against one another, however."
"Similar problems exist elsewhere in Asia, for example in Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives."
"It is incumbent upon all of us to work for human rights."
"Religious freedom is one important element, together with freedom of speech, freedom of movement and the right to non-discrimination."
"We must also counter violent crimes against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation."
"A great deal remains to be done in defence of these principles."
"Mr President, I belong to a political party that has itself experienced in its own country what it is like when a government tries to clamp down on the freedom of expression of a growing opposition party, so I have every sympathy for anyone whose freedom of expression or religion is under threat."
"We will therefore naturally be supporting the joint resolution on freedom of religion in India."
"We unreservedly condemn the use of violence against Indian Christians, and we demand that the national government and the state authorities responsible for maintaining law and order should take firm measures where necessary not just against the perpetrators of the violence, but also against the police officers who simply stand by and watch."
"I would point out here that in Orissa, where a missionary and his two children were brutally murdered, it is not the BJP that is in power, contrary to what some people think, but the Congress Party, to which the likely murderer also belongs."
"The violence against Christians should also not make us forget that for the last ten years, particularly in India, thousands of Hindus have been systematically murdered by Muslim fanatics in riots and pogroms that have sadly been much worse than the current violence against Christians."
"For example, in 1990 almost the entire Hindu population of the state of Kashmir, around a quarter of a million people, fled after a series of massacres in which more than a thousand people were killed."
"The instigator of this ethnic cleansing, Amanula Khan, the leader of the Kashmiri Muslims, is still given a hero's reception in various European countries, including my own."
"I think a little consistency is called for here."
"In this respect the joint resolution, which I think is very general, could also have made reference to the systematic and particularly barbaric persecution of Christians and all non-Islamic religions in the neighbouring country of Pakistan."
"That omission has now been put right."
"For the rest, we shall be happy to support this resolution."
"Mr President, despite the important contribution made by representatives of all faiths to the humanitarian mission of aid, care and relief for the underprivileged, religious intransigence seems to be becoming increasingly radical in many parts of the world."
"Last month we heard that, in clashes in Djakarta, Islamic fundamentalist mobs were busy burning Catholic churches and hunting priests and nuns, while the forces of public order looked on powerless."
"In India violence against the clergy is currently being encouraged by anti-Christian - but also anti-Muslim and anti-Sikh - rhetoric from fundamentalist groups who claim that they are determined to end any form of religious conversion in the country by the year 2000."
"This illustrates the lack of effective protection for religious minorities working in India, but above all it shows that the real aim of racist fundamentalism is to restrict freedom of religion and opinion."
"All this should prompt Europe to stress its wholehearted support for the basic principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, making respect for those principles a prerequisite determining the very nature of the bilateral relations Member States maintain with countries which flagrantly disregard them."
"Mr President, I shall begin with the resolutions on the death penalty."
"The Commission shares the general concern of the European Parliament on this issue, especially in respect to the United States."
"We believe that in all cases in which the death penalty is imposed the guarantees laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international instruments should be respected."
"We welcome the adoption by the Council of Ministers of general guidelines on the issue of the death penalty in June 1998."
"These guidelines make it clear that the objective of the European Union is to work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"We also welcome the adoption by the UN Human Rights Commission on 2 April 1998 of a resolution which calls for countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty to apply a moratorium on the execution of death penalties with a view to abolition."
"EU Member States co-sponsored the resolution, which had been introduced by Italy, and it is striking to note that the United States voted against it."
"The Commission is greatly concerned about the rising number of executions taking place in the United States."
"The European Union has raised this question a number of times with the US authorities."
"As the Commissioner responsible for relations with the United States, I have no embarrassment or hesitation in raising this issue with them: it is appropriate that one should do so with a country with which we have close links and which has expressed on numerous occasions its concern about human rights elsewhere."
"The European Union follows closely individual cases in the United States and has made a number of démarches in specific instances."
"In the event that it concerns a person having the nationality of one of our Member States, the Union will pay special attention to compliance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963, which in Article 36 provides arrested foreigners with the right to consular assistance."
"I turn to the specific case of Mr Peltier, who, of course, is not on death row but is a long-term prisoner."
"I can only say that anybody who heard the speeches made from diverse parts of the House, with different political viewpoints, could not but be moved by what was said."
"The Commission, through its delegation in Washington, is looking into the circumstances of the medical condition of Mr Peltier and will do its utmost to support the actions of the European Parliament in this regard."
"We will carefully follow up this case, and look forward to the exchanges on this issue at the next meeting between the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the United States and the United States' Congress."
"Not only is it legitimate that this subject should be discussed but, in the circumstances described, it is inevitable and natural."
"On the question of freedom of religion, I am glad that it has been broadened out and has not concentrated entirely on the situation in India, because it is right to say that there are problems, to put it mildly, with regard to freedom of religion in many countries, and it would be misleading to focus only on India."
"As far as we are concerned, freedom of religion is a fundamental human right and we should defend it wherever it comes under attack."
"Nonetheless, there has been a certain topicality with regard to the reports about attacks on Christians in India, which are deeply worrying."
"The Commission's delegation, which continues to keep us fully informed on the situation as it develops, is fully associated with Member States' missions in monitoring the situation."
"Sadly, ethnic and religious violence is not a novelty in India, but violence against Christians on the scale reported is new."
"The issue is now highly politicised in India and it has the potential to affect the political situation there - reference has been made to the statement by the Prime Minister which, of course, we have noted."
"The issue is dividing not only Opposition and Government but is also controversial within the BJP itself."
"There is no doubt that the principle of secular government and the protection of minorities is deeply ingrained in Indian democratic tradition."
"There can also be no doubt that opinion leaders and civil society in India are deeply shocked about the events and the damage done to India's image, and that is amply reflected by the wide press coverage which these events have received since they began."
"The Commission is convinced that responsible Indian politicians, together with a strong consensus in civil society, can succeed in mobilising the necessary political momentum to control violence."
"We strongly support the continuation of the quiet and persistent work of our representatives on the ground, our ambassadors, NGOs and concerned Indian citizens as the best guarantee to check the current situation, and for that they were recently thanked by the Archbishops of Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore."
"The Commission fully endorses the objectives of racial tolerance, social harmony and full respect for human rights which underpin the European Parliament's motion for a resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on the situation in Guinea-Bissau:"
"B4-0136/99 on behalf of the UPE Group; -B4-0168/99 on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-0173/99 on behalf of the PPE Group; -B4-0183/99 on behalf of the V Group; -B4-0191/99 on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-0202/99 on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group; -B4-0211/99 on behalf of the ARE Group."
"Mr President, the situation in the West African state of Guinea-Bissau is extremely worrying."
"After the November 1998 agreement and the new agreement at the start of this year, violence has broken out once again between the troops of President Vieira and General Ansumane Mane."
"The conflict of June 1998 has returned and people are once again fleeing in large numbers."
"The civilian population are suffering yet again as a result of the destruction caused by this war."
"The Abuja peace agreement has been suspended and the foreign troops are committing countless human rights violations."
"It is extremely important that the Abuja agreement should once again be applied in full."
"All foreign troops - except of course for the ECOMOG forces - must leave the country and the government of national unity must try to organise proper elections, which would be an almost unprecedented event."
"Europe must be prepared to do something to help here."
"Great efforts are needed in West Africa to prevent conflicts from spilling over into other countries."
"There are far too many transnational conflicts."
"We must do everything we can to prevent the proliferation of light weapons, and the Union must offer ECOMOG technical and financial support and humanitarian aid for the people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, war has returned to Guinea-Bissau."
"The European Parliament must show its solidarity with the people of Guinea-Bissau, who are suffering in this civil war."
"Hundreds of people have died, thousands of civilian refugees have had to leave their country, hospitals are short of medical supplies and are struggling to cope, and hunger and disease are spreading."
"There was an agreement in Abuja which provided for a cease-fire and arrangements to contain the conflict."
"Despite this, military operations have started again, and everything points to this being the responsibility of President Vieira's troops."
"We deplore the political irresponsibility and shortsightedness of political and military leaders who put their own interests above the interests of their people."
"The European Parliament must demand respect for the Abuja agreements which provide for the formation of a government of national unity and the organisation of presidential and legislative elections, respecting the independence and territorial integrity of Guinea-Bissau."
"There is a danger that the conflict will become international, given the situation in Casamanca."
"The presence of foreign troops, notably from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, whom international human rights organisations are accusing of human rights violations against civilians, is aggravating that danger."
"So the withdrawal of all foreign troops is a fundamental prerequisite for restoring peace."
"The only troops that should stay to guarantee the cease-fire and ensure compliance with the agreements are the ECOMOG troops."
"The people of Guinea-Bissau desperately need help, and this means strengthening humanitarian aid and ensuring that aid actually reaches the people who need it."
"Here I would stress the importance of neutral non-governmental organisations operating on the ground."
"Finally I call on the European Union to support the efforts of the Prime Minister designate, Francisco Fabu, to establish a government of national unity capable, above all, of serving the interests of the long-suffering people of Guinea-Bissau."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Guinea-Bissau is tragic. There are thousands of displaced persons, and widespread hunger and misery caused by a war which it seems nobody wants and is of no use to anyone."
"It is vital to restore peace and to silence the guns in Guinea-Bissau."
"It is vital to observe the Abuja agreement and rapidly establish ECOMOG, the peace-keeping force of the Economic Community of West African States."
"President João Bernardo Vieira and General Mané have to bear the heavy responsibility of enabling and ensuring compliance with the agreement they have signed, by stabilising the situation in Guinea-Bissau, installing the new government of national unity, organising free elections and allowing the country to develop."
"Europe can and must help, and that is what our compromise resolution is about."
"Humanitarian aid and technical and financial support are needed, but we can also help by firmly condemning the escalation of the war and demanding the immediate withdrawal of the foreign military forces involved in the conflict."
"Without that withdrawal the human rights abuses will continue and peace will not be possible."
"In this case, Parliament's recommendation that the Council should speak with one voice on this matter is very apposite."
"And given much of the news published in the media, I would like to ask if the Commission can give Parliament any information guaranteeing that there are no military forces from any Member State of the Union involved in this sad conflict, which we hope to see ended as rapidly as possible."
"Mr President, the acts of violence in the West African State of Guinea-Bissau are causing us serious concern."
"President Jean Bernardo Vieira and General Ansumane Mané concluded a peace agreement in Abuja on 1 November 1998, and it is absolutely essential that they observe the terms of that agreement."
"The Council and the Commission must insist on that."
"The agreement requires the withdrawal of foreign troops, especially from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea."
"Here too, it is up to the Council and Commission to exert pressure."
"The deployment of ECOMOG troops was requested, permitted and wanted."
"The peacekeeping forces of the Economic Community of West African States are essential as guarantors of the peace."
"Since 3 February another cease-fire has been in force."
"We support the territorial integrity of the country, or so I believe."
"We call on the government to reform itself into a government of national unity."
"If that is done, the Commission should then provide appropriate aid, since thousands of people have fled their homes."
"Refugees are being produced here, and famine is being produced here."
"We should also mention that much of the misery has been caused by weapons from Western Europe."
"The politicians and the armed forces must abide by the terms of the peace agreement."
"If they do not do that, they are irresponsible, uncaring and blind to the lessons of history."
"They must observe international law and human rights."
"Their observance of international law and human rights is the basis on which we can provide humanitarian aid and support ECOMOG through the Council and the Commission."
"I believe that would be a strategy for underpinning the peace."
"It is up to the two sides in Guinea-Bissau."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first I would like to welcome this joint motion for a resolution and stress our joint condemnation of the new wave of violence in Guinea-Bissau and our demand for full implementation of the cease-fire agreed on 3 February."
"Recent events have frustrated the hopes raised by the Abuja agreement of 1 November, hopes that the conflict might be over and that Guinea-Bissau, and especially its martyred people, might enjoy the peace needed to recover from a situation of enormous economic backwardness, aggravated by the destruction and chaos provoked by the conflict which broke out last June."
"That hope must be urgently rekindled, above all in the Guineans who have witnessed and been victims of this senseless confrontation, which can only be ended through negotiation, peace and respect for the agreements."
"We also want to highlight and denounce the destabilising role of foreign troops since the beginning of the conflict. That role is all the more serious because it may be one reason why the Abuja agreement is not being respected."
"Withdrawal of all foreign military forces not in the territory in strict compliance with that agreement, like the troops from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, is a prerequisite for implementing the agreement and for the government of national unity to take office in line with that agreement."
"The West African intervention force has a peace-keeping mission, and that mission must not be complicated by other foreign forces hindering its action or pursuing other purposes."
"This conflict must not be turned into some kind of cockfight for the only perch in the chicken coop."
"A political solution must be found which guarantees peace, respects what has already been agreed, does not undermine the independence and territorial integrity of Guinea-Bissau and puts an end to a tragic situation which is destroying a country and a people."
"Initiatives to bring humanitarian aid, particularly food and medical aid, to the people are urgently needed and should be welcomed and encouraged."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is a sad fact that the situation in various parts of Africa brings one question to mind: how far can the absurd, the ridiculous and the irrational go?"
"Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world. Before the recent conflict that began eight months ago, it had an average per capita income of around USD 220, which is equivalent to less than half an ecu per person per day."
"The situation was beginning to improve. The country was starting to see an increase in reserves, inflation was falling and annual growth stood at 5 %."
"This has all disappeared over the last eight months."
"The country will now have negative growth, in other words over the next few months the annual growth rate will be -5 %."
"The war there was undoubtedly the result of the conflicting ambitions of a president who seems to have been in power for ever and an ambitious general. As we know, it has left the country in a situation in which its citizens are fleeing, some are becoming refugees, people are starving and its limited reserves have been squandered."
"The conflict is even becoming international, with the clear involvement of troops from Senegal - moving from the conflict in the southern region of Casamance - as well as troops from the Republic of Guinea."
"We must ensure that foreign troops are withdrawn and that only the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces remain. Finally, given that the cease-fire that was renewed in February - only a few days ago, in fact - has already been broken, we must provide the Prime Minister designate with the power he needs to allow the people of Guinea-Bissau to resolve their future in peace."
"Mr President, I can be comparatively brief because the Commission shares the view set out in Parliament's proposed resolution."
"We are closely monitoring developments in Guinea-Bissau and are aware of the tremendous difficulties faced by the civilian population."
"Through ECHO we are providing, I hope, speedy and effective humanitarian assistance to meet the population's needs."
"We also support the mediation efforts currently underway and call on the parties involved in the conflict to comply with the Abuja agreement."
"We are ready to resume cooperation with Guinea-Bissau once democracy has been restored."
"We are aware of the role played by ECOWAS in the international community's efforts to maintain stability in the region and we support the Abuja agreement including the deployment of ECOMOG troops in Guinea-Bissau."
"Reference has been made to the suggestion that troops of some Member States are participating."
"I am aware of those rumours but I am not in a position either to confirm or to deny them."
"We are consulting Member States, however, on ways to finance aid in the form of supplies and non-military equipment for the ECOMOG forces."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions concerning natural disasters:"
"Storms in the Canary Islands"
"B4-0128/99 by Mrs Sierra González and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group; -B4-0163/99 by Mr Escolá Hernando and others, on behalf of the ARE Group; -B4-0193/99 by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-0207/99 by Mr Fernández Martín and others, on behalf of the PPE Group; Earthquake in Colombia"
"B4-0192/99 by Mr Newens, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-0203/99 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group; -B4-0206/99 by Mrs Banotti and others, on behalf of the PPE Group.Storms in the Canary Islands"
"Mr President, the order of speakers was not really very important."
"What we are talking about here is the catastrophe that devastated the Canary Islands, and I must point out that this catastrophe adds to the problem of the region's ultraperipheral location."
"The storms affected its entire port and coastal infrastructures, as well as its agriculture, in other words the tomato and banana crops which are fundamental for the region's economy."
"We do not need the full minute we have been allocated as we merely want to urge the Commission to make additional efforts in its structural programmes to help this remote region to overcome this catastrophe."
"It is called a 'natural' catastrophe, although we may soon have to consider the fact that such catastrophes are not so natural and that they are sometimes the result of the damage we have done to the environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at the beginning of January a violent storm struck the islands of Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Palma and Hierro, doing untold damage to port infrastructure, coastal roads and shore installations. It also affected the tomato and banana crops, and other fruit and horticultural production."
"As these are islands, there is no alternative infrastructure, so it is vital to the life of the archipelago for it to be in full operation."
"Agricultural production in the islands in 1997 amounted to 105 495 million pesetas and the damage to agricultural production represents 14.4 % of the damage to infrastructure and about 16.7 % of 1997 turnover."
"Furthermore, the largest tomato producers in the Canary Islands have suffered damage amounting to 5 664 million pesetas, equivalent to 19 % of production, and the damage in the banana sector amounts to 7 393 million pesetas, corresponding to 20.5 % of 1997 production, while damage to infrastructure amounts to 2 470 million pesetas."
"That is why we are asking the Commission to check the extent of the damage quickly, and to include the Canary Islands and specific projects for repairing damage caused to the coastal infrastructure in the Union's structural programmes."
"We are also concerned about the effects of the storm on the turnover of agricultural producers for 1999 (and consequently, on the Canary Islands' economy) and we call on the Commission to provide the aid necessary to mitigate the damage suffered in this sector."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while I have the floor I want to take the opportunity to express my deep sadness at the news of the devastation caused by the Colombian earthquake of 25 January 1999, which is said to be the worst earthquake to have struck the country this century, killing over a thousand people and injuring countless others, most of them from the poorest communities in the region."
"So I want to express the solidarity of the Group of the European Radical Alliance with the victims and the families of the dead, and with the people of Colombia."
"According to news from the area, the Colombian army apparently faced great difficulty, despite sending thousands of soldiers to the region, in preventing widespread looting in the city of Armenia, where the looters fired on the rescuers and public disorder is hindering rescue operations."
"There is also the danger of corruption, which may also prevent all the international aid reaching the people it is actually intended for."
"So I urge President Pastrana and the Colombian Government to take firm measures to restore public order in the disaster areas while respecting human rights, and to take all measures necessary to ensure that emergency aid reaches its proper destination."
"But most of all I hope this terrible event will not disturb the peace process under way in Colombia, which is already difficult enough."
"Finally, Mr President, I also want to express our satisfaction that the Commission made EUR 1.5 million available immediately, including EUR 0.5 million not spent last year, and to applaud the constructive cooperation of the Red Cross, Oxfam and other NGOs operating in the region."
"And I call on the Commission and the Governments of the Member States to cooperate with the appropriate NGOs in making every possible effort to resolve this crisis and to implement a special development programme to meet the medium- and long-term needs of the earthquake zone."
"Thank you, Mr Posada. Of course you did not mention just the problems of the Canaries, but those of Columbia as well, which is the next item on the agenda."
"Mr President, we are fortunate that Commissioner Brittan is present here with us because last night he took the trouble to stay here until midnight to discuss an issue that is very closely related to the ultraperipheral regions and the Canary Islands, that is, the banana industry."
"Mr Brittan, I am addressing you directly because if you read our motion for a resolution you will see that it relates to the serious damage that has been caused to agriculture in the Canary Islands."
"To be specific, and although this is not mentioned in the motion for a resolution, I can tell you that as far as banana production is concerned, there has been so much damage that neither in 1999 nor in 2000 will we come close to the minimum guaranteed production of 420 000 tonnes per year. This is because not only parent banana trees but also young banana trees were destroyed."
"I am telling you this because when we hold talks in Washington with a government that talks about defending free competition, I think we should let them know that our banana plantations have to contend with adverse climatic conditions and that in some regions of the Community, both in the West Indies and in the Canary Islands and Madeira, such catastrophes often occur."
"I believe that this is an important argument."
"However, the aim of the resolution we are moving is rather different."
"I would like to read something unusual to the Commissioner as I think it is very interesting."
"It comes from the Las Palmas newspaper La Provincia today, 11 February 1999, which states that the representative of the federation of fruit and vegetable exporters in Las Palmas, Roberto Góiriz, welcomed the agreement that the European Parliament is about to adopt and pointed out that it would be an institution based in Strasbourg that would eventually find the solution to a problem that affects everyone living there."
"It is unusual that regions as remote as our own now look to the Commission as a source of inspiration and a source of aid."
"The Commission has always been very receptive to the problems experienced in these regions."
"We are now asking, among other things, that it should implement as soon as possible the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides for special measures for these regions precisely because of the adverse conditions affecting their economies."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Fernández Martín, as he has had to leave."
"As has already been pointed out, and as you are all aware, at the beginning of January the Canary Islands were hit by a violent storm that has led to significant economic losses in terms of both infrastructure and agricultural production."
"I must emphasise that the losses do not just translate to the significant figures contained in the resolution of around EUR 90 million between the banana and tomato crops, which, as you know, form the basis of the region's economy, a fact that has been highlighted. In addition to these losses, there were also significant losses in terms of infrastructures, totalling approximately EUR 15 million."
"We therefore call on the relevant institutions within the European Union, and particularly the Commission, to take account of the scale of the destruction and to launch specific projects to remedy the damage caused to the infrastructures. We also ask that adequate measures be taken to provide effective and rapid aid to the people affected by this catastrophe and to the regional government to repair the damage that was caused."
"Earthquake in Colombia"
"Mr President, the tragedy caused by the earthquakes in the Colombian regions of Pereira and Armenia come on top of other violent catastrophes that have destroyed people and property in Central America and parts of the Caribbean."
"Europe's response in every instance has been rapid and united. This has allowed us to alleviate some of the devastation and bring a little hope to the victims."
"Clearly, the extreme circumstances affecting Columbia were aggravated by the destruction of infrastructures, which delayed the arrival of aid and the implementation of the emergency plans."
"It is therefore extremely regrettable that some unscrupulous people are exploiting the tragedy to rob, steal and trade in the scarce resources that were already in the region or that were able to get through."
"Nonetheless, these regrettable facts must not overshadow the heroic acts or the excellent example of civic-mindedness demonstrated by the non-governmental organisations, the civilian population, anonymous individuals and the army, who are all involved in the recovery and rescue operations."
"We must highlight their positive responses, as well as the rapid reaction of ECHO and the European Commission in distributing the aid that is so important at the moment. I congratulate them on that."
"After the damage has been assessed, we will have to follow up the present project with a further programme aimed at helping the recovery of those regions that have been totally devastated."
"Unfortunately, we can do nothing for those who have disappeared apart from extending our condolences to their families."
"Indeed, there is very little we can do to predict other earthquakes."
"However, we can see to it that the donations from European and other countries are used as transparently and effectively as possible so as to prevent any doubts about embezzlement or the misuse of the funds."
"I would like to end by saying that this resolution supports the commitment made by President Pastrana to combat corruption. We call on his government to make every effort to guarantee security in the region and respect for human rights."
"Mr President, there is very little I can add to what our colleague Ana Miranda de Lage has just said on this issue."
"In my view, the same thing has happened with this earthquake in Columbia as happened with Hurricane Mitch. As usual, it is the poorest people that are affected."
"More than 1 000 people have died and many have been injured."
"In my opinion, we must first of all welcome the rapid response of the European Commission in releasing EUR 1.5 million, which is a considerable amount, and its work in collaboration with non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross, Oxfam and others."
"It is important for the European Commission to guarantee, in some way, that the aid sent reaches those who are genuinely affected."
"On previous occasions, a certain section of the population has taken advantage of the confusion - as is now the case - and exploited the breakdown in public order to use or sell goods that were intended for those who were most severely affected. There have also been cases where the aid was not distributed as it should have been and did not reach those most in need."
"So the European Commission can perhaps play an important role in this respect."
"We must also welcome the fact that Mr Pastrana has made a commitment to eliminate corruption and that while those most in need are receiving aid, human rights are being respected in Columbia."
"Mr President, I can certainly subscribe to the previous speakers' remarks, on behalf of my group."
"It is not the first time that Colombia has been hit by such a great disaster, and on this occasion it appears to have occurred in a part of Colombia with relatively few problems."
"It is all the more tragic that a region inhabited by people who, though dependent on help, had hitherto managed to eke out a decent living, has now been struck by such a disaster."
"Our urgent plea to the Commission is that it should cut through the red tape wherever possible, that it should ensure as far as possible that the aid goes directly to the people in need."
"We are pleased that action has been taken so quickly, since we often criticise Colombia here."
"It is our biggest headache in several respects, as you well know, Commissioner."
"I believe that if we can take this occasion to show clearly to Colombia and President Pastrana that we are also capable of constructive intervention when practical humanitarian assistance is needed, we shall have achieved a great deal."
"Mr President, in joining in the expressions of sympathy for the victims of the Colombian earthquake, let us ensure that the European Union provides the long-term assistance required to help people rebuild their lives."
"Still today the communities affected lack basic storage containers for clean water, have too few latrines or waterproof shelters and not enough equipment for food preparation or tools to help clear and reconstruct their homes."
"Barefoot children lack shoes to climb over the rubble of their former homes, and lives have been destroyed."
"Though agencies like Oxfam are seeking to help 8 000 families per month, over 400 000 people have lost their belongings or their livelihoods."
"We must learn the lessons too, for despite the early announcement of assistance which we welcome, no international aid had arrived locally a full 48 hours after the earthquake struck."
"Finally, in a situation which should unify the disparate groups in the Colombian conflict for absolutely clear humanitarian reasons, I have to express disbelief at reports that paramilitaries may have used the disaster to cover the killing of human rights defenders in the NGOs in Colombia and that it may have been the pretext for withdrawing a bill condemning forced disappearances at an extraordinary session in the Colombian Parliament last week."
"We call on President Pastrana not simply to attack fraud and corruption but also to promulgate that bill."
"The twenty-fifth of January is a date which will be etched in the memory of the Colombian people but, regrettably, for the wrong reasons."
"It was a tragedy of immense proportions, as has already been pointed out, resulting in over one thousand deaths and many thousands more being injured."
"It must be said that the Commission is to be congratulated on the speed with which it responded to the crisis and in particular the way in which it cooperated with NGOs in the region."
"However, the aid sent from the European Union and other donor countries is a mere token, given the scale of the destruction and suffering, and particularly in view of a statistic mentioned by Mr Howitt: almost half a million people have lost their homes and their belongings."
"Therefore, a very comprehensive aid and development programme is required to meet the long-term needs of the country and its people."
"It is vitally important that, if this aid is forthcoming, it is properly coordinated and channelled to those who need it most."
"The resolution is right to point out the danger of corruption and the need to eliminate it."
"I welcome, as does the resolution, President Pastrana's commitment to ensure that this does not happen."
"The resolution is also right to point out that, in trying to restore public order, it is vitally important that human rights are not violated."
"Mr President, everyday life in Colombia is grim."
"Every month we could discuss the latest human rights violations, the paramilitaries, attacks on the Indios and the black population, people driven from their homes and the disappearance of individuals."
"This time, however, the cause of our concern is what we call a natural disaster, namely the earthquake in the city of Armenia."
"It has heaped untold suffering on the population, and I do not propose to repeat everything my honourable colleagues have already said on the subject. Nevertheless, the natural disaster has been compounded by a home-made disaster in the form of corruption and incompetence, partly within the Colombian government apparatus, which are hindering the effort to ensure that help reaches the victims and reaches them quickly."
"We must be particularly worried by reports that the allegedly rapid assistance provided by the European Union has failed to arrive in many places."
"There is an urgent need to find out how accurate this information is."
"An official report on this matter is urgently required."
"In the wake of the earthquake, the paramilitaries have launched a campaign to annihilate human rights activists."
"Politicians and others at home and abroad insist that it is high time President Andrés Pastrana took decisive action."
"Alas, we have seen too little of that."
"Here too, there is an urgent need for the Commission to demand that the Colombian Government act to stamp out these violations of human rights in the aftermath of the earthquake."
"Mr President, dealing first with the situation in the Canary Islands, the Commission is well aware of the terrible storms which hit the islands between 6 and 9 January."
"I am grateful for the further information supplied by the honourable Members in their resolution and also in the speeches that have been made."
"As far as the issue of bananas is concerned, I am well aware of the particular role that industry plays in the economy of the Canary Islands and have particular sympathy for what has occurred, coupled with the other problems which we dealt with last night."
"I would like to express the Commission's sympathy and support for the local population affected by the storms."
"We are very sensitive to the difficulties that have arisen as a result and we will be looking carefully at the situation as a whole in the light of the instruments and regulatory provisions that may be available to give assistance."
"So that those involved can make a proper study for the Commission, what we would like the Spanish authorities to do, is to provide, as soon as possible, detailed information about the nature of the severe weather, its impact on production and production potential in the region as well as the damage caused to the infrastructure."
"If we receive a formal request from the Spanish Government at the next meeting of the monitoring committees for structural assistance in the Canary Islands and the Objective 1 Community Support Framework for Spain, we will look into the possibilities of reprogramming current structural assistance in partnership with the national and regional authorities as well as any allocation from other resources available as a contribution to repairing the infrastructures damaged by the storms in question."
"Turning to the situation in Colombia, preliminary official figures show that the number of dead has risen to over 900, of whom 582 are in the Department of Quindio and the number of injured to approximately 3 400, and 200 000 persons are homeless."
"Clearly the immediate priority is to respond to the emergency needs of the most vulnerable sections of the population throughout the region hit by the disaster."
"A detailed needs assessment confirms that it is essential to provide temporary shelter, food, blankets, kitchen utensils, medicines and chlorine as a matter of urgency."
"Pending a more exhaustive analysis of needs, a relief programme, amounting to EUR 1.5 million has so far been prepared by ECHO."
"The Commission was able to announce on 26 January a timely contribution to international relief efforts, and I am grateful for the kind words that have been spoken this afternoon about what the Commission has been able to do."
"This first contingency plan is being implemented by various European NGOs in cooperation with the Colombian Red Cross."
"ECHO is considering the adoption of a further relief programme for the victims of the earthquake."
"In the context of their mission to Colombia next week, the Commission services will begin to study possibilities for the long-term rehabilitation of the earthquake areas."
"But I would add that we fully share the view expressed in the European Parliament that President Pastrana's government must take steps to restore public order and combat corruption, whilst fully respecting human rights, and should ensure that the killing and kidnapping of human rights activists and of local NGO workers is fully investigated and the results of any such investigation are acted upon with firmness and speed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"In view of the fact that the debate has ended early and we cannot proceed immediately to the vote, I am obliged to suspend the sitting until voting time."
"The sitting was suspended at 5 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m."
"We now come to the vote on topical and urgent debate."
"After the vote on the joint motion on Kazakhstan"
"Mr President, I congratulate the House on its unanimous adoption of the resolution on Kazakhstan."
"I have the German version in front of me."
"It consists only of the following phrase: 'beauftragt seinen Präsidenten, diese Entschließung an die und die weiterzuleiten ' (instructs its President to forward this resolution to such-and-such)."
"The only other thing on this sheet is two straight lines."
"I just wanted to ask whether others have read the resolution and whether their versions contain the text."
"Mr Posselt, I am sure every Member has read it."
"There must have been a mistake in the particular text that you were given."
"After the vote on topical and urgent debate"
"Mr President, I have to say that my previous remark was not meant as a joke but as a formal protest."
"The resolution on Kazakhstan, at least in the German version, consists of two straight lines."
"Laughter"
"May I ask you to declare the vote null and void."
"According to our Rules of Procedure, a vote is invalid if the text is not available."
"Failure to annul this vote would establish a precedent."
"Mr President, that is not the case."
"There is a complete version of the German text."
"Perhaps you have been given the wrong sheet, Mr Posselt."
"I will gladly provide you with a copy so that you know exactly what you voted for!"
"Mr Swoboda, I have also been shown a full version."
"I was suggesting to Mr Posselt that there was something wrong with the printing in the version he had obtained."
"Mr President, could it be that an honourable Member of the Christian Social Union has one or two blind spots?"
"Laughter"
"Surely not."
"VOTES (continuation)"
"Mr President, I wish to make one or two points about the vote."
"Firstly, I apologise that there are more than 200 amendments; we tried as best we could to reduce the number."
"I should like to explain the meaning of 'compromise amendments' in connection with tonight's vote."
"They are not compromise amendments in the way we normally understand them, that is to say compromise amendments between political groups."
"They represent the results of an informal trialogue which took place in Brussels over the last couple of days and weeks and amount to a considerable amount of work put in by myself and the other water rapporteurs."
"It is absolutely imperative that we, having agreed those compromise amendments between the water rapporteurs, now agree to endorse them because the German presidency, which was not represented at last night's debate, has stated in a letter: 'The German presidency is hoping to achieve a common position on the draft directive at the March Council."
"They will do their best to include in that common position the text that came out of the informal consultations.'"
"A prerequisite will be that this text is included in the decision on the proposal that Parliament will be taking tonight."
"So we need to fulfil our side of the bargain: endorse the so-called compromise amendments, and then we have the beginnings of something we can take further after the second reading when we move to co-decision."
"Mr President, at the end of the votes this morning, I requested that the vote on this report be postponed to the next part-session in Brussels."
"I would like to repeat this request, given the importance of this report, and ask that the vote be taken in Brussels."
"You are quite correct that the point was raised this morning but the Rules say that it either has to be a political group or 29 Members."
"I have had no formal request from any of the political groups or any wish expressed by 29 members."
"So I intend to take the vote."
"With good will I do not think it will take us very long."
"Mr President, what you have just said about the request is proper but the trouble was that I could not get the consent of my Group to have this matter put over until next week."
"I apologise to the Spanish delegation."
"After the vote on Amendment No 165"
"Mr President, I wonder whether the political groups which are asking for so many roll call votes are aware that each roll-call vote costs the European taxpayer EUR 300."
"Mr President, may I simply ask the questioner whether he knows how important it is for the public to know who bears political responsibility and how much that knowledge is worth?"
"Mr President, there is not the slightest doubt that our citizens have the right to know, and we are under an obligation to inform them. But not about every proposal and every political group."
"Colleagues, we have had a long week and we are all tired."
"Let us move on."
"Mr President, I merely wanted to reassure the honourable Member."
"We are all in favour of budgetary thrift, Mr Anastassopoulos, and when I cast my eye over your group and see all the empty seats, it is clear that many Members will only receive half of their per diem allowance today, which will no doubt please you."
"Laughter"
"I am tempted to have a roll-call vote on whether roll-call votes are worthwhile but that would be absurd."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"Mr President, this has been a very long and complicated vote but it is a very satisfactory conclusion."
"However, I want to draw the House's attention to the fact that, firstly, it was made necessary by the fact that the Council reached a political agreement on this at a very early stage."
"This is an example of the unwisdom of the Council in reaching these political agreements."
"Secondly, the satisfactory result would not have been possible without the immense work by Mr White."
"But I want to stress that it would not have been possible without the cooperation of his fellow rapporteurs on water, Mr Eisma and Mr Florenz; it would not have been possible without the coordinators of all the political groups; it would not have been possible without close cooperation with Commission staff, with the chairman of the German presidency's Working Group on Water and without the secretariat of the Environment Committee."
"I hope that people recognise these people are due recognition, because without them Mr White would not have been so successful."
"I am glad to hear the water directive was 'overflowing' with cooperation."
"Mr President, I am interested in the number of roll call votes we have been having on this report."
"In the vote on the previous report you always identified the group which called for the roll call vote, which caused some discomfort for our colleagues in the Green Group."
"In this instance, not once have you identified who has asked for the roll call vote."
"Surely we should be told who has asked for a roll call vote."
"If you really want I can read it all out but it will only take up more time."
"On Amendment No 44"
"Mr President, I should like to point out to the House that in Amendment No 44, in the second indent of point 2(a), the German wording 'entfernen pyrotechnische Komponenten ' must be replaced by 'neutralisieren pyrotechnische Komponenten ' in order to make the wording consistent with the rest of the legislative text."
"In an engineering dissertation the wording would be excellent, but it is entirely unsuitable for a legislative text."
"As the rapporteur confirms that, we will ensure that the German text is amended accordingly."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"I have received a request under Rule 129 from the Group of the United Left to refer this report back to committee."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I request that the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report should be referred back to committee, under Rule 129, for the following reasons: we think the adoption of the report at this time may be interpreted as interference in the electoral processes of a sovereign state, Israel, and - regardless of its merits or intentions - as explicit support for one of the more controversial parties in the election, specifically that of candidate Benjamin Netanyahu."
"Mr President, if we had to refer the reports back every time there were elections in the countries concerned, we would no longer vote on any reports."
"I therefore do not believe that we can refer this report back."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I believe we should vote on this report now."
"Any delay would be detrimental to Israel as well as to the Palestinians."
"Parliament decided against referral back to committee"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I just wanted to table an oral amendment, but one that I feel is appropriate."
"I propose that after the words 'regional integration', we add 'through the abolition a priori of the principle of non-reciprocity in ACP/OCT/UPR relations as soon as the new EU/ACP general agreement enters into force', so as to provide us with a better understanding of the amendment."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group supports Mr Aldo's motion for a resolution in general terms. However, the oral amendment he is proposing is quite serious, so we cannot accept it at this stage."
"It is not a simple formal amendment; its content is very significant. We therefore oppose the oral amendment."
"More than 12 Members indicated their opposition to the oral amendment"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"In the 21st century, good quality water will perhaps be of greater strategic importance than oil, which is a good reason for thanking Mr White for the efforts he is making now to ensure that we have good quality surface water by 2010."
"The river basin approach enables the Member States to pursue policies which are specifically tailored to river basins, which we think is an excellent idea."
"If the best use is made of local knowledge, such as the water boards can provide, it will help to achieve better results."
"Involving those who are directly concerned makes it much more likely that new policies will be accepted."
"Establishing a new framework directive is certainly going to take some doing: the way it was dealt with at first reading was extremely confusing."
"Our examination of the draft framework directive was postponed several times, mainly because of the 'premature position' that the Council adopted last June."
"All in all, it was a strange state of affairs."
"After that, with the Amsterdam Treaty in mind, progress started to be made towards reaching a political agreement, though this has only been successful in a small number of areas because certain Member States refuse to be flexible."
"This is a pity, because it is often much easier to reach agreement at an early stage before opinions become too firmly entrenched."
"The compromise amendments which I and others have tabled are a rather disappointing result after a very promising start."
"Amendments Nos 189 to 193 on the wetlands are designed to maintain a buffer water capacity which is essential in order to prevent floods and drought."
"Compromise Amendments Nos 194 and 195 take account of the fact that the protection of marine waters is already covered by international agreements."
"We are in favour of organising occasional conferences on water policy, which all parties concerned, including NGOs, should be able to attend, as proposed in Amendment No 198."
"The re-injection of water for certain necessary activities must still be possible, provided that it is done in a responsible manner, and Amendment No 201 creates adequate safeguards here."
"With the emission limit values, all the various sources must be considered, not just the major polluters."
"The difficulty here is in enforcing the polluter pays principle, and we therefore wonder whether Amendments Nos 65, 67 and 68 can really be implemented in practice."
"The Commission's proposal establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy is a reworking and combination of a number of directives currently in force on the quality of surface and bathing waters, waters used for fish and shellfish farming and waters for human consumption, on the protection and management of groundwater, the treatment of municipal waste water, control of effluent and pollution by nitrates."
"In addition to simplifying the situation, the main new feature of this proposal for a directive is its underlying approach, which is based on the notion of river basins."
"Good management of these will ensure that the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater are safeguarded, whether these waters belong to one Member State only or straddle a border."
"By the end of the year, the Commission is to put forward technical specifications which will form the basis for all data collection and analysis operations, notably regarding the definition of river basin districts and the analysis of their physical, demographic and economic characteristics, analysis and monitoring of water quality, and the evaluation of water quantity and quality."
"Each management plan will consist of a programme of measures to be fully operational by 31 December 2007 at the latest."
"The objective of 'good status' must be achieved by the year 2010."
"Responsibility for implementing these requirements will very largely rest with the Member States."
"In response to this proposal, I tabled 17 amendments on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, most of which were adopted either on their own or as part of a compromise amendment."
"These amendments naturally included wetlands and their specific ecosystem in the context of these Community measures."
"But we also pointed to the importance of agriculture and the specific link between this industry and water."
"We needed to take account of the special features of agriculture to ensure that it was not restricted by too bureaucratic an approach."
"We voted against compromise Amendment No 201 on the underground storage of natural gas and LPG."
"The Commission proposal introduces a derogation for existing stores, but would ban any plan to develop further storage of natural gas in aquifers, whilst the French experience of storing gas underground (since 1957) and LPG in abandoned mine workings (since 1965) indicates that all requisite measures for protecting the environment are in place."
"We did, however, vote for Amendment No 160, which authorises underground storage where this does not compromise the environmental objectives of this directive."
"This directive recognises the importance of the advances in certain areas and therefore concentrates on the quality of water, leaving aside the quantitative aspects of the problem."
"There is a serious shortage of water in southern countries, which means that it is becoming a limited resource."
"We must therefore restrict the temptation in wealthier, more developed and more powerful regions to transfer water from other areas, as is the case with the River Ebro."
"Through Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 75 the White report puts an end to such practices by limiting this water policy."
"I was therefore happy to vote in favour of these amendments and the entire report."
"To begin with, we should welcome today's adoption at first reading of this framework directive on water policy which Parliament has been pressing for hard for a long time."
"This text will clarify and simplify the existing Community legislation, which is fragmented and labyrinthine."
"Secondly, I must deplore once again the fact that political agreement was reached in the Council before Parliament had had its say."
"Moreover, after his report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr White, outside all the normal channels of official procedure, negotiated 12 'compromise' amendments with the representatives of the Council."
"I find it most regrettable that he did not take the trouble to inform the Committee on the Environment at any stage of his dealings."
"Over and above that, I deplore the fact that he added on his own initiative a thirteenth Amendment No 201 which was never agreed with the Council delegation."
"The rapporteur made this addition without respecting the elementary rules of transparency, and without even consulting the authors of the amendments which his compromise proposal was designed to replace."
"This is no way to do things."
"On principle, therefore, and also because the content of Amendment No 201 was not consistent with the wishes of the PPE Group, we voted against this amendment."
"Despite Mr White's best efforts, his attempt to reduce the number of amendments to this text as far as possible only succeeded with the Council on points which, whilst useful, were thought to be of minor importance."
"We have had to vote in today's sitting on nearly 200 amendments."
"That proves, Mr President, that Parliament is using the powers granted it under the Treaty, despite the dubious practices employed by the Council of Ministers."
"This explanation of vote is mainly concerned with those sections of the report dealing with PVC."
"Although we appreciate that PVC is not the only issue here, we are ready to back those amendments which seek either to ban or to restrict the use of PVC."
"We naturally support reduced use of traditional PVC, but we do feel that today's technology offers ever more ways of cutting back on those component substances in PVC that are a danger to the environment and health."
"We also know that industry, and in particular the automobile sector, is working actively on many fronts to find alternatives to PVC, or to use less hazardous forms of it."
"We therefore hope that the Commission will very soon come forward with a proposal for a directive on the whole issue of PVC, without this being restricted to any particular sector."
"As to the disposal of PVC, we believe that the optimum solution is reuse or recycling; the second-best choice would be incineration, coupled with energy production."
"Landfill has to be seen as the option of last resort."
"Adopting Amendment No 25 fails in our opinion to do justice to the important area of producer liability."
"We therefore voted against this amendment."
"The following order of priorities is used in the treatment of waste in the European Union: prevention, reuse, recycling, incineration and landfill."
"The same order must therefore also be used in disposing of vehicles, particularly when we consider that there are huge numbers of end-of-life vehicles each year and that the first priority must be to ensure that the dangerous substances they contain are given appropriate treatment."
"As regards the prevention of PVC waste, we feel that this would be better dealt with in a horizontal directive, and we are expecting a proposal from the Commission on this shortly."
"This is why we voted against Amendments Nos 8, 19, 21 and 56."
"The best way of ensuring successful collection is to enable the last owner to deliver the vehicle to an authorised treatment facility free of charge."
"The treatment costs can then be passed on in the price of new vehicles."
"In many countries, however, it happens all too often that vehicles are dumped illegally, even in surface water, with all that this implies."
"We voted for Amendments Nos 22 to 25, even though they do not take adequate measures to prevent these problems from happening."
"The existing arrangements for the collection of two and three-wheeled vehicles must be left in place, and it is therefore a good idea to exclude them from Article 5."
"We voted for Amendment No 18, despite the fact that all the provisions on prevention, reuse and recovery have been dropped."
"On the subject of treatment, we wholeheartedly supported Amendment No 30, and the same applies to Amendment No 34 on the percentages for reuse and recovery."
"As everyone probably knows, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is currently possible and economically viable."
"This would mean a reduction in the shredding of such vehicles."
"The targets set out in Amendment No 34 are certainly attainable: in the Netherlands, for example, we have already reached 86 %."
"We are in favour of Member States concluding agreements with the economic actors concerned, so that the directive can be implemented flexibly."
"I am glad that the European Commission and Parliament are at last planning to legislate on the recycling and proper disposal of end-of-life vehicles."
"Motor vehicles are one of the most important areas of capitalist production."
"In the European Union, as we approach the year 2000, close on 10 million vehicles are scrapped every year."
"To quote just one of the many eloquent figures, the non-recyclable waste which remains after crushing and shredding makes up 10 % of the total volume of hazardous waste."
"In the case of vehicles and other major consumer items, a fundamental principle could usefully be adopted on a large scale. The producer should also be made responsible for disposing of and recycling his products."
"The purchase price would of course reflect the cost of this responsibility."
"In this way numerous pollutants, often harmful to the environment, would be eliminated and this would enable the process of recycling and disposal to be organised more efficiently."
"European standards should be put in place for the various product categories to regulate their collection, processing, reuse, recycling and the monitoring of these operations."
"I think this idea will also enable many pollutants to be eliminated at the production stage, since the producer himself will have to make provision for recycling his products in the simplest and safest way possible."
"I naturally welcome any proposal which aims to improve waste management in the European Union."
"Clearly, the waste which results from lack of control in the motor industry has become unacceptable, and measures are needed to address the problem."
"To that extent, I support the report and the means of improving waste management contained in it."
"However, I am not satisfied that due regard has been given to motorcycles."
"Motorcyclists, if anything, have been more environmentally friendly than those of us who travel on four wheels."
"There is a strong tradition of recycling motorcycle parts."
"I was therefore concerned when the original proposal was put forward that it appeared to ignore this tradition by putting two-wheeled vehicles in the same category as four-wheeled vehicles."
"My own view is that motorcycles, as well as vintage cars, should have been excluded from the legislation and that separate legislation should be drafted which would ensure compliance with genuine environmental concerns."
"Mr Antony's tirade in this morning's debate on research and development cooperation with Israel in which he accused Israel of producing ethnic weapons that would select their victims on the basis of race tell us more about Mr Antony's views than Israel's research policy."
"Only a racist could give credence to such nonsense."
"Only someone who believes the world is composed of sharply-defined 'races' arranged in a neat hierarchy with them at the top of the food chain could imagine such a horror."
"It is not possible."
"There are more similarities in the genetic make-up between so-called 'races' than between individuals within such 'races'."
"Anyone who started such a programme would have already demonstrated they lack the scientific knowledge to carry it through."
"As I said this morning I will be voting to support this report with the few reservations I indicated then."
"Mr Antony's views have only reinforced this decision."
"The document we are considering is what is called an own-initiative report in the European Parliament. Such reports present the European Parliament's point of view on issues directly or indirectly connected with the European Union, some of which may not have been dealt with in Community legislation."
"This is therefore the European Parliament's unilateral position, and it does not have any immediate or concrete impact on the issues it relates to."
"Nevertheless, the report does have the merit of drawing attention to real problems, and that means it can initiate the legislative and decision-making process applying in the European Union, as the Commission may implement some of the report's highly positive recommendations for the ultraperipheral regions, namely:"
"1.The creation of a devolved Commission service in the ultraperipheral regions will help to physically strengthen the presence of the UPRs within the Community as a whole.2.Establishment of enlarged regional markets for the exchange of products originating in the UPRs, the overseas countries and territories and the ACP countries in the same geographical area.3.Facilitating the development of inter-regional exchanges, with the focus on the areas of training and culture, sea and air communications, environmental protection and so on.But I do have one reservation about this report, which is that it might open the door to interests alien to the ultraperipheral regions, allowing them to misrepresent the specific nature and particular circumstances of what is meant by ultraperipheral, which is already defined in Article 299(2) of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I pointed yesterday to the unacceptability of the retaliatory customs measures announced by the US against European products, even before the WTO has looked at the new common organisation of the market in bananas."
"And this threat of sanctions has a definite effect, because even before it is put into practice, it is prompting the economic players to react."
"No WTO member has the right to take such measures unilaterally: they must use the procedure for settling disputes laid down by the WTO."
"What do we see on the European side?"
"Firstly, we are seeing every day the very regrettable consequences of the European negotiators' failure to secure adequate guarantees in the GATT agreements allowing us to preserve our preferential relations with the ACP countries."
"Secondly, we deplore the apparent willingness of certain European Member States to sacrifice European solidarity on condition that the US exempts them from its sanctions."
"Lastly, the attitude of the German Presidency does not seem to be altogether unambiguous, in that it has sought a direct settlement with the US without consulting its partners."
"We for our part wish to encourage the European Commission to show the utmost firmness - which for once it seems intent on doing, albeit very late in the day - and consequently the Europe of Nations Group chose not to sign the compromise of the PPE and PSE Groups, the content of which seemed to us insufficiently robust, but proposed a more forceful compromise text instead, together with four other political groups."
"We wished in particular to reaffirm in strong terms our support for our ACP partners, to whom we are linked by an international agreement."
"We wished also to indicate Parliament's fundamental disapproval of unilateral measures and deplore in no uncertain terms the USA's declared intention to apply Section 301 and 'super 301', the spectre of which we were told had been banished for ever thanks to the Marrakesh agreements."
"In the absence of a European 'super 301' we would also like to know how the Commission will react to safeguard our interests if the US should take the unilateral measures it has threatened."
"That concludes voting time."
"Statement by the President"
"At a meeting today the Conference of Presidents decided, pursuant to Rule 10(4) of the Rules of Procedure, to bring forward the second March part-session to 22 and 23 March."
"The part-session will begin at 5 p.m. on Monday 22 March and will continue on Tuesday 23 March."
"Voting time will be at 3 o'clock on Tuesday."
"The Conference of Presidents has decided to include in the agenda of Monday 22 March a Commission statement followed by a debate on the action to be taken on the report of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"The deadline for tabling motions for resolutions will be Thursday 18 March at 5 p.m.. The deadline for tabling amendments and joint motions will be on Monday 22 March at 10 p.m."
"The other items on the agenda will be decided by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on 4 March."
"It should be noted that it will be possible to hold a political group meeting on Wednesday 17 March at 6 p.m. and possibly on 18 March at 10.30 a.m. as well as on Monday 22 March before 5 p.m."
"Committee meetings already scheduled for 22 and 23 March will be postponed until 24 and 25 March."
"Further details will be provided by the committees involved."
"Mr President, I am afraid I do not intend to respond to the remarks made by Mr Hänsch, who was probably inspired by the Carnival in the Rhineland, because he could not possibly have been inspired by the election results in Hesse. No, my intention is to raise the question of the Kazakhstan resolution again."
"Since making that point before, I have received faulty copies from other Members, and I now have this pile of 63 faulty copies of the Kazakhstan resolution, each comprising only straight lines."
"Following our earlier exchanges, I checked at the desk outside - this is no laughing matter, gentlemen - to see whether proper texts were available there."
"They do not have a single text that is properly printed."
"I do think we ought to take our parliamentary work seriously enough for me to be able to ask you to check what has happened here and for you to ensure that it does not happen again."
"We are going to check again but I have been assured that a fresh batch of properly printed resolutions were made available at the distribution desk."
"Mr President, I would appreciate it if you could tell me whether or not the statement you have just read out has been printed and is being distributed in some way to Members. We have naturally taken note of it, but there are too many changes to the calendar."
"It would therefore be better if we received a written copy this evening, perhaps in a fax to our offices."
"Mr President, I should like to ask whether there will also be a vote in plenary on this change of date, because as far as I am aware, the original calendar of part-sessions was adopted by us here in the House. If there is to be a vote, when will it take place?"
"I understand that the answer is No."
"The Conference of Presidents has the power to alter the date."
"I cannot answer detailed questions as I am no more informed about it than you are."
"Mr President, I am interested in your announcement about the changing of the date of the mini-session."
"I am sure you are aware that visits are arranged for people from many parts of the world in the light of the timing of the mini-session."
"This change will certainly cause great difficulty as far as some of my visitors are concerned."
"Could you give me an explanation, that I can pass on, as to why the mini-session has been changed?"
"I am sure there must be some very clear political reason but I did not quite understand what it was - I did not quite hear what the explanation was."
"As I say, I am learning as I go along."
"I am told it is because the original date clashed with the European Council meeting and we wish to meet before that meeting."
"Mr President, just to give an explanation to Mr McGowan."
"The problem is that we have to hold a debate on the results of the Committee of Independent Experts in that mini-session."
"This has to happen in the presence of the Commission."
"But on the same date the Council is meeting in Berlin and it is impossible for the Commission to be in two places at the same time."
"Therefore, the only solution was to find another date for the mini-session."
"As it is a sensitive issue, we could not postpone it until the month of April."
"That is the real political explanation."
"Of course, normally we would hold the mini-session on 24 and 25 March, and the committee meetings would take place on 22 and 23 March."
"So this is reversed: the mini-session will be on 22 and 23 March and the committee meetings on 24 and 25 March."
"That is the whole explanation."
"It is useful to have someone who attended the meeting to explain the situation."
"However, the plenary is not the place to debate this."
"It was a decision taken by the Conference of Presidents."
"If you have a problem with it speak to your group leaders and raise the matter in your political groups."
"Combined transport: dimensions and weights (continuation)"
"Mr President, I hope that I can find my bearings again in the debate which we interrupted."
"The role of combined transport is to shift goods transport from the roads to the railways."
"It is capable of doing that despite its structural disadvantages, thanks to the preferential measures designed to enable it to compete with the transport of goods by road."
"Nevertheless, it has not developed to the extent that we transport policymakers had hoped and expected."
"The main reason is that the railways are taking a very long time to develop into modern service enterprises, if they are developing in that direction at all."
"Combined transport is also the forerunner of a future model, namely that of intermodal transport, which will improve the flow of traffic for all types of carrier."
"A decisive breakthrough in the development of intermodal transport will naturally require a sea change in the political regulation of transport in Europe."
"What we are asking about today are the conditions under which the present superannuated form of combined transport can be sustained for long enough to develop into that model of the future, without it grinding to a halt and simply being overrun by the road-transport juggernaut."
"The new proposal for a directive starts off in the right direction, broadening the definition of combined transport to pave the way for intermodal transport."
"We are naturally calling for a precise limitation of the ratio of road legs to total mileage."
"The second step in the Commission's proposal, namely the European harmonisation of preferential measures, also points in the right direction, in my opinion."
"The issue of grants poses fewest problems."
"The maximum weight of 44 tonnes and the exemptions from driving bans, however, remain bones of contention."
"I personally consider them necessary for a transitional period until a level playing field has been created for all modes of transport and intermodal transport has become an everyday phenomenon."
"I share some of my colleagues' fears, however - firstly that the abuses which are already occurring today will become more widespread, and secondly that the increase in exemptions from driving bans and derogations from weight limits could open the political floodgates for the extension of these privileges to road hauliers in general."
"For that reason, we insist on follow-up negotiations to review the situation."
"Madam President, both Parliament and the Commission agree that there is a need to actively promote combined transport by increasing the efficiency of the means of transferring transport of goods from road transport to more environmentally-friendly, safer and more energy-efficient modes which are less prone to congestion."
"I welcome Parliament's support for this approach."
"However, I regret that the report before the House rejects two of the three main measures proposed by the Commission to promote combined transport and substantially amends the other."
"The suggestions set out in the report would not achieve what both of our institutions and the majority of Member States want and that is the further development of combined transport as an efficient and viable alternative to current dependence on road transport."
"Therefore, it would be useful to pursue discussions on this text at a later stage to allow us to take Council's view on this proposal into account."
"Meanwhile, on Mr Wijsenbeek's amendment, it is generally acceptable, since it developed some of the ideas in our proposal, while remaining faithful to the existing directive."
"But I am aware that Mr Wijsenbeek's colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism do not share his views."
"Let me briefly comment on two of the three components of the proposal: exemptions from driving bans and derogations from weight limits."
"The Commission proposed Community-wide exemptions of the road legs of combined transport from restrictions on driving at weekends, during the night, holiday periods and during periods of high pollution."
"Such exemptions would improve the competitiveness of combined transport, by comparison with road transport, and would ensure greater reliability and regularity of combined transport services without jeopardising social and environmental standards."
"Obviously combined transport would have a major advantage if clients could have their goods moved and delivered when unimodal road haulage was forbidden."
"At present, there are about 47 lorry bans in existence in the Community, with many detailed exceptions to them for combined transport services."
"That needs serious improvement because combined transport obviously involves several links and if one is not allowed, for example on Sunday night, the whole chain is jeopardised."
"If a ban ends at 10 p.m. there just is not time after the trucks have reached the terminal to form a rail train that would allow arrival the next morning."
"That means all transport operation starting at 10 p.m. would go totally by road; and in international road container traffic, that means average driving distances of about 1 000 kms."
"Is it really safer, or more socially acceptable, or more efficient to do that than to have a road journey of about 100-150 kms to or from a rail terminal on a Sunday?"
"The environmental congestion, social and efficiency arguments all point in one direction."
"Secondly, we believe that transport operators should have the option of using a maximum authorised vehicle weight of 44 tonnes for road transport when it is specifically used as part of a combined transport operation involving the movement by different transport units in the whole Community."
"That is not just a marginal incentive."
"It may lower costs by 10 % and is, of course, only applicable over the shorter road legs of the combined transport journey."
"It is an efficient way of making combined transport more attractive."
"For these reasons, I am at this stage only in a position to accept two technical amendments in addition to Mr Wijsenbeek's ones, Nos 3 and 6, and I have to reject the other ones."
"It would be most productive to revisit this issue at a later date, against the background of the Council's common position, and after detailed discussion of the arguments."
"I hope we could then take a joint view about how a satisfactory compromise could be developed so that we could fulfil our common objective of supporting combined transport."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Article 366a of 4th ACP-EC Convention"
"The next item is the recommendation (A4-0013/99) by Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the draft Council Decision on the framework procedure for implementing Article 366a of the fourth ACP-EC Convention (5644/98 - C4-0156/98-96/0050(AVC))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, about two years ago the Council consulted the European Parliament about the procedure for implementing Article 366a of the Fourth ACP-EC Convention, which deals with how the European Union reacts to serious human rights abuses or the total failure of democratisation processes and so on, as a result of which the Union may suspend cooperation with the country concerned."
"The whole issue has been dragging on for two years now because of a fundamental disagreement between Parliament and the Council about the role that Parliament should be allowed to play in this process."
"Originally it was the view of the vast majority, in fact nearly all Members of this House, that we wanted the assent procedure to be applied, but this was rejected out of hand."
"We then decided to go for the consultation procedure."
"In connection with this, I had informal contacts - not really enough to merit the term negotiations - with the UK Presidency on behalf of the Council, but these proved fruitless."
"The issue was raised again during the Austrian Presidency, which then ensured that the Council was formally consulted to see whether it would agree to the consultation procedure."
"The result was that only two of the fifteen Member States were prepared to agree to Parliament's request."
"So once again we came back empty-handed."
"Since then the Council has made a small change to the text of the proposal, which had originally called for a qualified majority for any decision to be taken in this context."
"The qualified majority still stands, but unanimity is now required in the case of full suspension of the application of the Convention."
"It is important to note that up to now this has never actually happened, even in very difficult situations such as with Nigeria a few years ago."
"It was always the case that a number of articles were suspended, but never the entire Convention."
"The situation today is as follows."
"If Parliament decides to refuse to give its assent, then in any event as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force - and that is not so far off now - all that is required under the provisions of the Treaty is that we should be informed."
"That is the only right we have in this context."
"So there is little point in obstinately refusing to give our assent here in Parliament, given that this will only result in the unanimity rule applying for the remaining months if cooperation is to be suspended."
"This is certainly not likely to promote rapid and appropriate action by the Union in cases of serious human rights violations."
"So because we would much prefer rapid action to be taken where possible by a qualified majority, I did not think I would be justified in calling for us to stick to our guns and refuse to give assent to the Council's draft decision."
"Against my will, therefore, but in consideration of the practical consequences, I therefore recommend that we accept the decision as it stands, knowing that we have one small consolation, which is that whenever such a measure is to be taken, the Commission will inform Parliament at the same time as the Council, so that Parliament can react in good time."
"I have to say that it is thanks to our particularly close cooperation with the Commission on this document that we are able to relinquish the genuine consultation that we should have had with rather less distress than would otherwise have been the case."
"Madam President, we have already debated the implementation of Article 366a of the Fourth Lomé Convention on many other occasions. It lays down the procedure for suspending cooperation with countries in violation of the essential provisions of Article 5."
"This was one of the principal innovations of the Fourth Lomé Convention, and it makes cooperation dependent on respect for human rights, democracy and the principles of good governance."
"I also want to thank Mrs Aelvoet on behalf of the Socialist Group. Under her wise guidance as rapporteur the European Parliament tried to democratise the procedures the Commission proposed, by making Parliament's opinion compulsory through the assent procedure."
"But the Council's intransigence, plus the objective legal restrictions of the Lomé Convention, made it necessary to move towards a compromise."
"As the rapporteur says, all things considered, the result is better than nothing."
"The decision in the Council is no longer required to be unanimous but is to be by a qualified majority, and the Commission undertakes to inform Parliament in good time of any major change in the implementation of the suspension procedure."
"Parliament will obviously be extremely vigilant and insistent about this."
"It is, effectively, better than nothing, so our group will vote in favour of the draft decision, as recommended by the rapporteur."
"Madam President, as always Mrs Aelvoet has produced an excellent report on a very delicate subject."
"However, it is a sad indictment of the world we live in that Article 366a has to be written into the fourth ACP-EU Convention at all."
"Having just returned from Africa yesterday and hearing of the latest events in Zimbabwe, it is vital the Commission has the power of suspension and is able to act quickly."
"Of course it would be good practice if Parliament - and by that I assume the Committee on Development and Cooperation - could be consulted before suspension took place."
"But I have to be honest and say that we live in the real world."
"There will be occasions when the Commission has to act quickly to convey the message to any nation abusing human rights before it has the opportunity to ask Parliament."
"The key to the report is the sentence that the Commission, wherever possible, will inform Parliament in advance of any suspension or indeed resumption of cooperation."
"I believe that is a fair compromise between the Commission and Parliament and therefore support the proposal that Parliament give its assent to the draft Council decision."
"However, there is an interesting situation which will arise after the year 2000, under the new Lomé Agreement, whatever that may be."
"As the Commission will know, the proposals for any new ACP-EU agreement could be based on regional cooperation and integration, with funding being distributed via the regional organisations rather than through individual nations and national indicative programmes."
"I wonder how Article 366a can operate in such circumstances, as the Commission will have lost the ability to sanction an individual nation within a region."
"It would be unfair to sanction the entire region."
"Perhaps Commissioner Brittan could pass on that particular question to the appropriate Commission service for an answer at a later date."
"As there are a number of difficult situations building up in various African states I hope the Commission will use Article 366a in its widest form."
"Human rights, to me, should include pluralism, good governance, an independent judiciary, a free press, as well as free and fair elections."
"My group will be supporting this report."
"Once again, I congratulate Mrs Aelvoet on the work she has done on behalf of this Parliament."
"I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Aelvoet for all the work that she has done to make it possible for Parliament to give its consent and for the realistic and reasonable approach that she has shown, as have other speakers such as Mr Corrie and Mr Vecchi."
"I would like to reiterate what we stressed when the interim report was discussed here last June, namely, that we intend to keep Parliament fully informed of any initiative which we might take or any proposal which we might submit to the Council with regard to the implementation of Article 366a of the Fourth Lomé Convention which sadly, as has been said, is not something that can be regarded as a purely theoretical possibility."
"I would add that in the only case so far in which Article 366a was invoked, against Togo, the Commission immediately informed Parliament of its intentions, as the rapporteur has acknowledged in her report, for which I thank her."
"We will continue, as ever, to take very seriously any opinions or resolutions adopted by Parliament which might affect implementation of the consultation and suspension procedure laid down in Article 366a."
"With regard to Mr Corrie's query about how it would work in a situation where the regional element is to the fore, I will certainly convey that query to those who are handling this matter on a day-to-day basis."
"The Commission is pleased that with Parliament's assent the framework decision will take effect, giving us a proper and transparent procedure for taking appropriate measures if essential provisions of the revised Fourth Lomé Convention are violated."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Macro-financial assistance to Albania"
"The next item is the report (A4-0041/99) by Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing macrofinancial assistance to Albania (COM(98)0507 - C4-0590/98-98/0273(CNS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate on the granting of EUR 20 million in macro-financial assistance to Albania, I think it is extremely important to look at the political and economic context in which the assistance is being provided."
"Let me pick out a few points."
"Albania freed itself from Marxist dictatorship much later than other countries in the eastern bloc, and this means that the problems of developing a pluralist society are persisting for longer than in any of the other countries, where some progress has been made."
"The economic and social conditions are such that, in my view, Albania can rightly be described as a third world country on the Union's doorstep."
"The collapse of the pyramid schemes, the plundering of the munitions depots - which we all remember very clearly: a Kalashnikov now has a street value of five to ten dollars - the effects of the conflict in neighbouring Kosovo: all of these things have led to the enormous tide of refugees who are now on the move, with economic refugees coming to the Union and political refugees fleeing Kosovo for Albania."
"In short, Albania does not just have serious internal problems to resolve."
"Because of its geographical situation, it cannot escape being politically influenced by surrounding countries in the Balkans."
"Mr Imbeni made this point very clearly during the Kosovo debate yesterday."
"However, there are some glimmers of hope."
"Last November a new constitution was approved with a 90 % turnout, and a new leader, Mr Majko, seems to be making good progress towards guaranteeing independent roles for the president, the legislature and the judiciary."
"However, Albania's political recovery is closely linked to the priorities to be met for economic recovery."
"Last October, the Albanian authorities in Tirana assured the group of donors that they will promote the development of an action plan to combat corruption and introduce legislation to create the climate needed to encourage investment, which is currently at a very low level - there is almost no investment from outside the country - so that investors will also have a better guarantee of getting their money back in future."
"It is also important here to monitor whether the new Customs Code does indeed consolidate customs and tax revenue collection, and then the main concern is the further winding-up of the pyramid selling companies, though it is still not known whether Albanians will ever see any of their money again."
"Unfortunately, we can do nothing to ensure that they do."
"Since 1991 the European Union has been the largest donor to Albania, and in view of the country's economic and financial situation, international aid is still desperately needed, if only to keep the current account going."
"This is why it is vital that we should flesh out the ECOFIN Council decision of last April as quickly as possible."
"The Commission is in an excellent position to do this, with its considerable experience of Albania."
"Up to now we have mainly provided donations, but this time it is a loan."
"However, in my view we must prevent Albania from falling into the disastrous vicious circle of being financially dependent on outside help."
"For this reason, in the extremely successful cooperation which I had with Mr Brinkhorst from the Committee on Budgets, for which I would like to thank him - unfortunately he could not be here this evening - I proposed that a coherent assessment should be made of the direction and state of progress of the political and institutional reforms in Albania."
"I have therefore asked the Commission not just to rely on the technical evaluations of international financial bodies such as the IMF, but to involve the Committee on Monetary Affairs and the PHARE committee in its assessment."
"The aim is for Parliament to have a comprehensive picture of the reforms before the second tranche is paid."
"The intention is not to put Albania under the microscope, but to promote sound and efficient management."
"In my opinion, this is not just what EU citizens want, it is what Albanian citizens want as well."
"I should like to thank the members of the Committee on External Economic Relations for their critical yet supportive views, and I hope that tomorrow the House will accept the amendments which are before us, because almost a year has already passed between the ECOFIN decision and the start of implementation, and Albania is simply raring to go."
"Madam President, we know that Albania is still facing many intractable problems, especially problems in connection with internal security and public order which are affecting all other areas."
"Nevertheless, in the midst of all these problems, relatively speaking I am amazed at the success this small country has had in implementing the six-month contingency programme from October 1997 to March 1998, which allowed it to tackle the social crisis and the civil war in the spring of 1997."
"We therefore have initial proof at least that, by following a specific programme in a well-disciplined manner and with adequate technical support, the Albanian Government can be effective and make progress."
"However, as was clear from the serious regression which took place in September last year, the problems of Albania centre more around the lack of communication and dialogue among the country's political powers and their inability to reach agreement on a minimum joint programme to extricate the country once and for all from the crisis it is in, rather than on the genuinely deep economic recession."
"The European Union and international organisations must give generously all the help they possibly can to enable this country to find positive solutions to its problems."
"Albania is part of Europe, it has contributed to the history of Europe and, from this standpoint, it is a potential applicant country for the European Union."
"It must nevertheless be made clear to all the political powers in Albania that responsibility for the progress and future prospects of the country lie fairly and squarely with them."
"The European Union is granting macro-financial aid to support the efforts made by Albania, but this must in no way be taken as a shifting of responsibilities."
"The Albanian Government must intensify its own efforts to solve its problems, and it must push forward policies and economic reforms to ensure that democratic institutions run smoothly and that the rule of law operates correctly."
"The adoption of the constitution was of course a major step in the right direction. However, we must have guarantees that human rights will be respected, that there will be a smooth transition to a market economy, financial stability and, above all, a revitalisation of the credit system."
"The EUR 20 million are rather less than what the Albanian Government had hoped for and, more importantly, less than what the country needs to tackle its problems."
"Nevertheless, strengthening the credibility of the country and ensuring economic and political stability will gradually increase its ability to take on loans and, above all, will attract foreign investments, which Albania desperately needs."
"We all know that my country, Greece, sincerely hopes that progress will be made, and it supports in every way the attempts of the Albanian Government to carry forward the necessary policies and institutional reforms which will bring Albania closer to the European model."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs van Bladel for her excellent report."
"It has our full support."
"As she said, and as my honourable colleague Mrs Karamanou has just stated, Albania is not only one of the weakest countries in economic terms, it is also lagging far behind the other countries in the development of democratic structures."
"Its situation is similar to that of Bosnia-Herzegovina; in other words, Albania has to be financially drip-fed by the European Union."
"We not only provide food aid."
"We not only provide general reconstruction aid."
"The European Union also spends money on the refugees from Kosovo who have found a temporary abode in Albania."
"But the crucial point - and this is where we start to see the light - is that the last government reshuffle and the adoption of a constitution in Albania have laid the foundation stone for the construction of a stable system of government."
"It is important to us, of course, to have a partner in whom we can have at least a reasonable degree of trust, and whom we can provide with the necessary funds to develop the structures of government and to ensure that the police and the armed forces return to their role as servants of the democratic order instead of being a law unto themselves, with all the problems which that has entailed in Albania over the past two to three years."
"It is also crucial that Albania should gradually win over the confidence of the international financial system and of investors, that Albania should thereby become an interesting location for prospective investors in the long run, and that at the same time the conditions should be created in which welfare capitalism can flourish."
"We have come a long way."
"What we must do is to make sure that the control which is now required can also be extended to cover macrofinancial aid to a certain degree."
"The very idea of macrofinancial aid, of course, is that it is not designed to fund specific projects, but to provide the state with a pool of funds with which it can perform and develop the tasks of government."
"But I nevertheless consider it important that we strike a good balance between trust and verification, a balance that will also encourage the Albanians, the Albanian Government, to progress along the right path."
"I have the impression that this financial aid of ours represents a small mosaic tile that Albania needs in order to go on constructing a stable future, and I hope that we shall soon see appropriate verification measures from the Commission to help ensure that this goal is achieved."
"Madam President, my comments on the report and the rapporteur's amendments are very brief."
"Our group supports them in their entirety."
"As regards the aid, although we feel this should be granted under the most favourable conditions possible for the time being, there must also, of course, be a number of conditions attached, as both the Commission and the rapporteur propose."
"Let me just mention one of these."
"We think that it is high time that the investigation into the pyramid selling schemes was completed; the capital collected should be paid out to the creditors and legislation should be introduced to combat money laundering."
"The schemes demonstrate the need for better financial controls on all sorts of institutions, including banks."
"That said, the greatest risk still remains, as the rapporteur pointed out, that one hand will be paying out what the other receives, in other words that one loan will be applied for in order to pay another loan off."
"This would be a disastrous development for a country that does not need one loan after another but productive investment, including from the European Union, so that it can generate its own, independent economic development."
"This is what Albania needs in the long run."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must compliment Mrs van Bladel on her report."
"Obviously the European Union has made a good many mistakes over Albania, and this EUR 20 million loan will not fundamentally change the situation."
"That said, this loan will be something of a shot in the arm for Mr Majko, who is making heroic efforts but has very little room for manoeuvre."
"It is the European Union's general attitude on Albania which is wrong."
"We are witnessing the growth of criminal activity, encouraged ultimately by the European Union."
"The Union should be far bolder in its policy."
"We should do what to some extent our Greek friends are doing - but not other countries, starting with Italy - and set very generous immigration quotas in order to break the power of mafia groups which feed on the traffic in labour and other commodities, such as drugs."
"We should generously open our universities and give thousands of study grants to Albanian students."
"Measures are needed to block the rise of opposition to the legal authorities in Albania, to prevent pyramid selling operations and situations of general political instability, notwithstanding the good intentions and intelligence of the current Albanian leadership."
"In the absence of such measures, Albania will mark time for a good many years to come."
"I therefore call on the Vice-President of the Commission in particular and the Commission in general to urge the Member States not to regularise the situation after the event, as has been done now in Italy, where 250 000 people have been legalised as immigrants - because in the meantime the emigration mafia have netted their profits."
"We should act ahead of the event and set quotas in all countries of the European Union."
"I think that if the burden were spread over the Union as a whole it would not be too severe, and this is what we need to do to tackle the root of the problem."
"Madam President, I should also like to begin, of course, by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who in my opinion has truly produced a very, very good piece of work."
"I believe that when we speak of Albania, we must not forget that it is a country which has had to make an unimaginably huge leap forward within a few years and still has an enormous amount of ground to make up."
"During the Enver Hoxha era the country was virtually dragged back into the Stone Age, and now it needs to progress by leaps and bounds at a time when the entire surrounding region is far from stable."
"I believe our aid can only be a drop in the ocean, but it may serve a useful purpose inside the country, helping to overcome the barriers that exist there."
"We must remember that Albania is divided into two large areas, the north and the south, with the Gegs and the Tosks respectively, traditional enemies who naturally continued to wage war during the Stone Age into which Enver Hoxha led the country, and that many of the conflicts we see today have their roots in that antithesis."
"It is even reflected in the party structure we find in Albania today."
"The new Albanian constitution has naturally raised high hopes."
"I very much hope that it will be possible to give the opposition a suitably constructive role to play in the Albanian political system, because I believe it has adopted very constructive positions in many areas."
"Only then will it be possible for Albania to bring the problems with its neighbours under some sort of control."
"Naturally - and this has been emphasised several times this evening - it will be necessary to introduce appropriate verification mechanisms."
"Only if these mechanisms exist, particularly in relation to the Albanian democratisation process, will the aid from the European Union be able to achieve anything."
"Many other verification measures have been mentioned, especially the mechanisms designed to curb the corruption, the arms trade and the drug trafficking that exist in Albania."
"We cannot achieve complete control in these areas; we can only do a little here to help the Albanians to help themselves, but we should do whatever we can."
"In that respect, Mrs van Bladel's report and the efficient aid that should result from it represent a step in the right direction."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellence of her report and also thank her for the support given by Parliament to the Commission proposal."
"The purpose of the macro-financial assistance of a maximum of EUR 20m for Albania is to shore up the country's official exchange reserves."
"This operation forms part of the global strategy pursued by the international community, and in particular by the European Union, since the crisis began at the end of 1996."
"It supplements the actions we have taken under the PHARE programme, the priorities of which are institutional reform."
"The specific purpose of this operation is to support the programme of structural economic reforms embarked on by the government under the aegis of the IMF."
"Even during and immediately after the crisis that broke out in the country at the end of 1996, after the collapse of the pyramid saving schemes, fiscal and monetary policy management was actually extremely prudent and, as a result, the macro-economic situation has improved in recent months."
"The budget deficit as financed domestically has been reduced substantially, inflation has fallen dramatically, but the external payments position is still precarious."
"The shoring up of foreign exchange reserves that the Community operation will permit will, therefore, help the Albanian authorities in pursuing a prudent macro-economic policy."
"Of course, the Commission will pay special attention to efforts to combat corruption by improving customs procedures and the management of public expenditure."
"I turn to some of the amendments: the Commission supports and welcomes Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 6, some of which, in particular No 3, will enable us to adopt a stronger negotiating position with the Albanians in sectors which we think are very important."
"Generally speaking, our rejection of the other amendments stems from our concern to safeguard the effectiveness of the implementing arrangements and the integrity of the objectives being pursued."
"These implementing arrangements have stood the test in numerous similar operations managed by the Commission, and to make them unduly onerous would prejudice the effectiveness of the operation."
"For example, the mandate of the PHARE Committee does not provide for it to be consulted in advance on a macro-financial operation and on the financial conditions attached to the associated borrowing and lending operations."
"But the Commission will ensure that the operation is fully consistent with and complements the objectives of the PHARE programme in Albania."
"Under the proposed arrangements, the Commission will send to Parliament and the Council, at least once a year, a report evaluating how the decision is being implemented."
"It does not make sense to go beyond that."
"In the context of the evaluation provided for, the Commission will keep Parliament informed of the conditions attached to the loan."
"Furthermore, we are, of course, prepared to reply to any questions Parliament might put to us, both during the operation and after it has been completed."
"But negotiating the conditions of disbursement, which lies at the heart of such an operation, necessitates some room for manoeuvre and the observance of the confidentiality requirements that the authorities of the countries concerned might impose with regard to the substance and timetable of reforms."
"It is essential to protect the objectives of an operation designed to underpin stability and economic reform."
"Its scope would be over-stretched if immediate policy objectives were also assigned to it."
"As we have invariably done in the past, the Commission will, of course, examine during the implementation phase whether the political context is compatible with disbursement in accordance with the principles of sound management."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, the work which we have carried out this week could not have been done without the help of interpreters."
"It has come to my knowledge that we have 300 freelance interpreters whom the Commission has not paid properly since October."
"This week the Commission published a document on how it is going to improve things in the administration."
"We have 300 interpreters who have been without proper pay and who are experiencing some financial difficulties."
"Could Commissioner Bangemann take this back to his colleagues, and would President Santer, when he has some time away from meeting farmers, arrange to meet the interpreters who work for us and settle this problem?"
"We take note of that, Mr McMahon, but at the moment we are dealing with the approval of the Minutes."
"I would ask that only Members who wish to speak on the Minutes should ask for the floor now."
"If you have a point of order, please say under which Rule you wish to raise it."
"Madam President, I would just like to reiterate something that was said yesterday in the minutes about the large number of roll-call votes."
"We have 245 pages of roll-call votes, and it seems that the smaller the group the more roll-call votes it wants."
"I defy anybody to tell me whether there is one citizen anywhere in the European Union who wants to know how David Hallam voted on the second part of Amendment 20 of the Florenz Report."
"It is a ridiculous situation and a waste of money, and should be brought to an end."
"That point was raised yesterday, Mr Hallam."
"We take note of your comment."
"Madam President, it is recorded in the Minutes that I raised an objection yesterday to the effect that we did not have a correct German text of the Kazakhstan resolution."
"My objection was not about the lack of a correct text, but rather the lack of any text at all!"
"Lines drawn below the heading 'Kazakhstan' and crosses and dots can scarcely be called an incorrect text; quite simply, there was no text."
"That is why I must insist on asking for a check to be carried out to ascertain why such a document was distributed."
"The reason why some Members mistakenly thought that the proper text was available is that copies of the text were produced for a meeting of the group leaders yesterday morning, but by yesterday evening the distribution desk only had this version with the lines and crosses."
"The point I am making is that all Members of the House must receive printed texts and not only individual representatives of the groups, otherwise we might as well abolish the Chamber and conduct all our business in the Conference of Presidents!"
"I can understand your dissatisfaction, Mr Posselt."
"The matter has been looked into, and it appears that there was indeed a version such as you have described, although there was the other version too."
"We shall investigate why the proper text was not the only one to be distributed."
"At least the rest of the House did have the correct version."
"But we shall look into how it was possible for this to happen."
"Madam President, it grieves me to have to agree with Mr Hallam, but the point I would like to make also concerns the number of roll-call votes which was discussed yesterday."
"What concerns me is not the actual number of votes - I know this is already in hand - but rather why every single Member has to be presented with this weighty tome, when far fewer copies could be produced for those sad Members who actually wish to go through and check how they voted."
"Alternatively it could be available on the Internet which would save an awful lot of money."
"Likewise, with the huge book of minutes."
"I am sure it is very important, but there are large numbers of Members who have already departed from Strasbourg but are still getting a copy of this in their pigeonholes."
"It represents a vast expense of time and effort, and could be made available just to those Members who want it or drawn down off the Internet when people wish to refer to specific items."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can understand your agitation, but the Rules of Procedure provide for this to happen."
"If you wish to change this, you have the opportunity of submitting amendments to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"Every Member is entitled to do that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I know there is dissatisfaction, but I should like to explain the legal situation to you once again."
"According to Rule 10(2) in Chapter II of the Rules of Procedure, which deals with the sessions of Parliament, Parliament shall itself determine the duration of adjournments of the session."
"This therefore means that we decide once a year on the dates of our sittings for the year ahead."
"In addition, Rule 10(4) states that the Conference of Presidents, stating its reasons, may alter the duration of adjournments decided pursuant to paragraph 2 at least two weeks before the date previously fixed by Parliament for resuming the session; the date of resumption shall not, however, be postponed for more than two weeks."
"Now, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is saying that he opposed this in the Conference of Presidents."
"However, it was announced to us - and most of the chairmen of the political groups are present here - that this was in fact the decision taken by the group chairmen in that body."
"In legal terms, that is perfectly in order, even if you are expressing your dissatisfaction at what was decided."
"The reasons are as follows - only a few Members were present yesterday, and Mrs Aelvoet made the same point, and she is also a member of the Conference of Presidents: the Conference of Presidents decided to bring forward the part-session in Brussels to Monday, 22 and Tuesday, 23 March to enable Parliament to express its views on the report by the Committee of Independent Experts before the European Council meeting on 24 and 25 March, and in the presence of the President of the Commission."
"That is quite clear, and we do not need to discuss it any further."
"The decision has been taken!"
"If you are unhappy, please take the matter up with your group chairmen."
"There is no point in discussing it any further now, since the legal situation is quite clear."
"Madam President, you were kind enough to announce that Mr Posselt's legitimate objection will be examined."
"May I ask another favour of you: would you please inform the House what will happen if it transpires that Parliament really did vote on a series of lines and dots?"
"I am sorry to interrupt you, Mr Vallvé, but we are still dealing with the approval of the Minutes!"
"It says on this postcard that the new building is the new hemicycle, the new plenary chamber for the Council of Europe."
"Did we really erect this building, I wonder, for the Council of Europe?"
"Madam President, during the last two part-sessions of this Parliament we have sat in this Chamber and voted on hundreds of amendments in various different reports."
"Many of those reports have then been sent back to committee."
"Is it not about time that we looked at the Rules of Procedure and tried to decide that if any report comes forward with a certain number of amendments to it, it goes straight back to committee without wasting the time of this House?"
"We would then have more time to get on with debates, which is what we should be doing as Members of Parliament."
"Let me repeat: if any Member feels that the Rules of Procedure need to be changed - and incidentally there will be a debate on this subject in March - then they should simply take the necessary measures."
"Each and every Member is entitled to propose amendments to the Rules of Procedure."
"There is no point in just calling for these changes and then not following this up with any action. If you think that things are not being done in an appropriate way, then you can submit your proposals."
"Madam President, you rightly said, and substantiated it by reference to the Rules of Procedure, that the part-session dates are laid down and can be changed again within a certain time-limit."
"I do not question that. Nevertheless, I should like to remind everyone that the report by this committee of wise men has been produced in response to the whole question of how we should deal with the discharge for 1996."
"To that extent, it is only right that the committee responsible, namely the Committee on Budgetary Control, should be able to deliver its opinion on the issue."
"Applause"
"If we did that through resolutions by the political groups, that might be a solution, but at the end of the day this report is floating in thin air somewhere, in the sense that it is not in any way incorporated into our parliamentary work."
"I wish to point out that we should initiate a proper procedure here to avoid the possibility of the report falling victim to political discrepancies and thereby failing to shed any light on the issue, in which case Parliament could do nothing with it."
"That is why I insist that this report by the wise men be dealt with in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mrs Theato."
"Your comments will be passed on and recorded in the Minutes."
"They will be dealt with by the appropriate body."
"Madam President, may we therefore assume that the committee meetings which would have been held on the 22nd and 23rd have now been postponed until the 24th and 25th?"
"That is indeed the case."
"However, you will be informed of that again in writing."
"Madam President, still on the subject of the Minutes, may I say that you quoted the Rule correctly, but that Rule 10 in Chapter II also has a fifth paragraph, which states that, exceptionally, after consulting the Conference of Presidents, the President shall convene Parliament at the request of a majority of its Members or at the request of the Commission or the Council."
"So this means that, provided a majority of Members so wish, we can indeed discuss these dates."
"That is correct, Mr Rübig, but at the moment no such request has been submitted."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to find another date for the mini-session, because otherwise the Commission would have had to be in two places at once - with us in Brussels to hear Parliament's assessment of the report of the committee of wise men, and in Berlin discussing Agenda 2000 with the Council."
"That was not possible."
"So we agreed at the Conference of Presidents - I did, my group did - that the mini-session should be brought forward."
"That is one part of the story."
"The second part of the story is the question of why this is being discussed here in the plenary."
"I maintained that this should be dealt with through the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"But I was in a minority, as other people were too."
"So if the House thinks it would be better done through the Committee on Budgetary Control - as I do - we should plan to hold a vote on it, and we can easily do that at the March part-session here in Strasbourg, because that will be coming up first."
"So I propose that we schedule a vote on this for the March part-session, and then it will be over and done with."
"Thank you, Mrs Aelvoet."
"Since some of the members of the Conference of Presidents are also present, that will no doubt be discussed again."
"Madam President, I had not intended to intervene but some of the questions that have been raised here and in the debate are based, perhaps, on a certain misunderstanding."
"Mrs Aelvoet has dealt with the issue of the date."
"There was a preference in the Conference of Presidents to bring the date of the plenary session forward."
"That was for a number of good reasons."
"We wanted to have present at our debate President Santer from the Commission."
"If the House insists on maintaining the original date, President Santer will, instead, be at a European Council meeting."
"It would not make sense for us to have a debate without the President of the Commission."
"A second point on the timing: this Committee of Experts will make its report available - if I recall correctly - on 15 March."
"In my view, the Conference of Presidents rightly considers that this House should express a political view on that matter at an early date."
"We should not have a report on which everyone in Europe has their say but the people who commissioned the report are not players in the field."
"That too means we should come forward earlier, and not later."
"The Committee of Experts was established, as you will see if you read the terms of reference and the original vote in this House, under the auspices of Parliament not one of its committees."
"In the first instance Parliament will then need to have the work of that committee returned to it and express political conclusions in a debate in the House."
"At the Conference of Presidents it was also said, acknowledged and understood that in the normal course of events, apart from that political debate, the substance and conclusions of the work of the experts will revert to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The Conference of Presidents assumes that the committee will then wish to incorporate any of the relevant observations and conclusions into its proper, ordinary work which serves this House so well."
"So we should not have a debate based on misunderstanding."
"No-one is highjacking the work of the committee."
"The House set up a group which reports to the House and we have a general political debate."
"But within the House there is a committee responsible for incorporating the substantive work."
"Nothing was done at the Conference of Presidents to undermine, diminish or set to one side the substantive or procedural work of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"If that was the case I would have objected."
"It was not the case and hence I did not object."
"Madam President, Rule 24 deals with the duties of the Conference of Presidents."
"It is high time the chairmen of the groups, Mrs Aelvoet especially, grasped the fact that our calendar of part-sessions is set by the plenary a year in advance."
"If the dates of meetings of the Council of Ministers then clash with those of our part-sessions, it is the Commission's duty, since it is the Commission which is under scrutiny here, to be with Parliament and not the ministers."
"Mr Wijsenbeek, the Rules also say that in an exceptional case the reasons must be stated, and that has been done."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am disinclined to contribute to this debate."
"I feel a little bewildered."
"Various group leaders are each giving their version."
"What we need is an accurate account of what was decided yesterday at the Conference of Presidents."
"Parliament needs to be informed in the case of sensitive procedures like these."
"That seems to me the right way to do things."
"The wrong way is to have each member of the Conference of Presidents standing up here and giving his version of what was decided."
"I am in favour of this decision, and I shall vote for it."
"There was no majority in favour of some of my views, but I think that if Parliament is to function properly we must have decisions reported here properly, by the President of Parliament, for example."
"Madam President, as Mr Wijsenbeek says, the Council manifestly takes no account of Parliament's calendar, since it sets dates which clash with ones we ourselves earmarked over a year ago."
"But I think we should have held the debate yesterday evening, when the announcement was made, and when there were still enough people in the Chamber to hold a vote, if necessary."
"Personally, I suggest quite simply that we get on with our work this morning and proceed with the votes."
"My colleague Mr Martin was in the Chair yesterday and announced the facts of the matter to the House."
"The sitting then continued as usual, without any debate."
"I would assume that most Members were at first somewhat taken aback and needed to reflect on the situation."
"However, it must also be possible for such a topic to be discussed outside the normal schedule, since that is in all Members' interest."
"Madam President, I simply want to express my absolute agreement with the comments made by Mr Cox, not just as regards the outcome of the decisions which he expressed but the reasons which guided the decisions that were made yesterday in the Conference of Presidents."
"He was absolutely correct."
"Madam President, these dates were set by the former German Government."
"I thought Mr Poettering would like to know that."
"There would seem to be no further comments on the Minutes."
"The Minutes were approved"
"VOTES"
"It is a good thing to be giving macro-financial assistance to Albania."
"Events in Kosovo are having a major economic and social impact on that country."
"Various international embargos, including that of the European Union, are a partial factor too."
"So we cannot deny them macro-financial aid."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the Commission proposal."
"I did not, however, vote for Amendments Nos 5 and 12 to the van Bladel report."
"These amendments make the provision of aid contingent on political criteria which are far too demanding."
"Of course a healthy political climate is necessary for economic progress."
"But you could equally well put it the other way round."
"We have taken on political obligations which we cannot evade, even if the political situation in Albania is other than we would wish."
"My second reservation concerns the breadth of the criteria."
"To my mind, a good customs code is not a sensible criterion for granting aid."
"These reservations do not mean that I think aid should be given with no strings attached."
"The European Union has a clear policy here."
"There is the human rights clause, for example."
"For individual countries, general criteria provide the guideline for decisions on whether or not aid should be given."
"EAGGF: recovery of claims"
"The next item is the report (A4-0009/99) by Mr Bardong, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and of agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value-added tax and certain excise duties (COM(98)0364 - C4-0392/98-98/0206(COD))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive we are debating today and on which we shall be voting relates to mutual assistance between Member States in the recovery of tax debts."
"There is certainly a great deal of scope for such assistance."
"Member States can even enforce judgments in these matters."
"The proper functioning of the single market depends in part on the effectiveness of this mutual support."
"That, sadly, is far from being the case at the present time."
"Nevertheless, since 1993, the annual number of recovery requests has averaged about 1 000, the total sum claimed amounting to ECU 50 million."
"This enforced payment of tax debts always becomes particularly difficult for both parties when the debtors have deposited all or part of their assets in another Member State to protect them from seizure."
"The result is that only 3 % to 5 % of such debts are actually recovered."
"Directives which were adopted back in 1976 and 1977 contained provisions designed to deal with this problem, not only for agricultural levies but also for customs duties, and subsequently for VAT and excise duty too."
"In 1990 the Commission made an additional proposal, but it was voted down."
"It is now proposing new amendments to improve and modernise this procedure, because some aspects of it are no longer in tune with present-day requirements."
"The crux of the matter, to which I shall restrict my remarks, consists of three points."
"Firstly, taxes on income and property are brought into the scope of the directive."
"This may come as a surprise to many people, because it is not even mentioned in the title."
"In Article 2 of the amended directive, however, it is explicitly stated."
"We welcome that, and surely cannot do otherwise, but I wonder why the Commission did not deal with this more clearly and why this aspect of the directive is not really apparent from the title."
"Secondly, when one state asks another to recover tax debts for it, the requested state must take the same trouble that it takes to collect its own taxes."
"Thirdly, executory titles transmitted by a requesting state are to become directly enforceable in the requested state."
"This means that there should be no more of the delays that have hitherto resulted from the need for official recognition of the titles, sometimes entailing an additional authorisation process."
"Executory titles will therefore be directly enforceable, even in the other state in which the debtor is being pursued, and no requested state may insist on implementing its own validation procedure."
"We believe that the Commission proposal is right in principle and is necessary if the single market is to function properly."
"In our view, however, it does not go far enough in some points to provide the basis for really decisive improvements."
"For that reason, the Committee on Budgetary Control is proposing a number of further amendments."
"First of all, to combat fraud and tax evasion more effectively, we need to guarantee the assistance of the other Member States for a longer period of time."
"Instead of a three-year lifetime for claims, the committee proposes five years."
"If the period is made any shorter - and there could certainly be reasons for so doing - the notice or decision that the attempted recovery has failed will be delivered more rapidly, but fewer cases pending does not mean a higher success rate."
"In addition, Member States must accord the same priority to claims from another Member State as they accord to their own claims."
"Community claims, indeed, may even take priority over national claims."
"These statements have only been included in the recitals."
"We hope that they will ultimately be included in the operative section too, but for the time being we are happy to see them in the recitals."
"At the same time, the Member States are absolutely free to decide whether and how the costs are to be shared in cases where recovery causes particular problems or is especially costly, for example when it is a matter of trying to combat organised crime."
"Irrespective of the proposals before us, I believe that the Commission still has much to do."
"For example, the training of tax officers in the Member States under the Fiscalis programme needs to be improved."
"Efforts are also needed to assimilate or at least harmonise the different recovery powers of the various Member States."
"At all events, this is another area where solidarity and mutual trust are indispensable."
"These qualities are essential to the projects in question."
"Allow me to say in conclusion that the financial interests of the Community and the Member States, as is often the case, would be well served by the plans presented here."
"Not only the Community, but also - and to a greater extent - the Member States will benefit from an efficient recovery procedure."
"Some of the calls for amendments which the Commission has now answered have come from the Member States."
"They ought therefore to ensure that the Council makes the right decision."
"As for the Commission, however, if you think about the length of time that elapsed before it tabled a proposal, the Commission does appear to have been rather dilatory."
"Madam President, on a point of order. I ask for your clarification."
"The title of the report we are discussing appears to concern the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund but the comments of the rapporteur went very much wider than that subject."
"Is there an error in some respect in the title or is the report broader than that?"
"Secondly, the text of the rapporteur's report refers to tax havens and raises that question in relation to Amendment No 5."
"However, that amendment does not mention the subject matter."
"I wonder whether there is another problem with this report there."
"These are really things which should be discussed in committee, However, Mr Bardong will say something briefly on that as rapporteur."
"Madam President, I shall be brief. The report and even the title of the report are certainly broader, or at least cover more types of taxes and public charges, than may appear from your documentation."
"The effects on incomes are clearly formulated in the Commission proposals."
"All I was criticising was the fact that they do not feature in the title too, because I consider them to be important."
"We are not going to have a debate here which ought in fact to take place in committee."
"Under which Rule do you wish to raise a point of order, Mr Mather?"
"I am sorry, Mr Mather. To repeat, we are not going to have a debate here which ought to take place in committee."
"You could have gone to the committee and expressed your views on this there."
"Also, you did not ask for the floor through your group, and you cannot force your way into making a speech now, even though you were not down to speak."
"Everyone might start to do that!"
"You must now listen to what other Members have to say, and then we shall vote on the matter."
"Madam President, I did ask for the floor, and my name is down on the list to speak at this point."
"I hope I am not pressurising you unduly on this Friday morning."
"The title of the directive on which we have to take a decision today could hardly sound more technical, but for all that, I believe Mr Bardong's report manages to pack a powerful political punch."
"We know that any freedom can be abused."
"This is also true of the freedoms which the common internal market offers the people of the European Union - freedom to travel without frontier checks, freedom to settle in another Member State."
"Welcome though these freedoms may be, they have also occasionally been abused for purposes such as tax evasion."
"The instruments we have today to protect ourselves against such abuses are not effective enough."
"Since 1976, there has been a directive which provides for mutual assistance between Member States, but the main purpose of the directive was originally to collect customs duties or levies in the framework of the common agricultural policy."
"Today, with the spiralling volume of intra-Community exchanges, this provision is no longer sufficient."
"That is why the Commission has put forward these proposals on which we have to decide - for example, the proposal that Member States should be able to collect each other's fines and fixed penalties in response to a request for administrative assistance."
"We in the Socialist Group support this proposal as well as the other proposals, because they target all forms of tax evasion and fraud."
"The Commission is also proposing procedural improvements, for example that administrative assistance should be requestable in future even before all domestic means of recovery have been exhausted."
"This is designed to prevent crafty lawyers from stalling for time and to eliminate abuse of the legal system."
"As far as the rapporteur's amendments are concerned, he has our full support for all of them."
"I shall mention three points, some aspects of which have already been addressed by Mr Bardong."
"Firstly, the statute of limitation proposed by the Commission is too short and should be extended from three to five years."
"This view is substantiated by practical experience in past years."
"Secondly, when a case of enforced recovery relates to both Community claims and claims in favour of a national budget, the Community claims should be accorded priority."
"Thirdly, liability for the costs arising from administrative assistance should be determined by common consent between the Member States."
"The precise division of costs is something that a directive does not have to dictate to Member States."
"Let me sum up: despite the technical nature of your report, Mr Bardong, it is a very important document that will help to secure the long-term functioning of the common market in the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, beyond the technical complexity of the subject - after all even the title is quite a mouthful - I think this report should be hailed as a further contribution towards achieving the objective so dear to many European citizens, namely transparency."
"Transparency in public administration means rectitude in Community systems for distributing resources and fighting fraud, both public and private."
"The rapporteur reminds us that there has been a strategy for mutual assistance in recovering claims since 1976, but because of anomalies in implementation, recovery cannot be fully guaranteed for either legitimate creditors or the Community and its budget."
"The rapporteur - whom I compliment on the work he has done - mentioned an average recovery figure of 3-5 %, which verges on the ridiculous."
"This figure is bound to worry people who are talking, with increasing conviction, of common fiscal systems, Community contributions policy, and intra-Community VAT and excise regimes."
"Indeed, the introduction of the two latter regimes in 1993 has led to a considerable rise in claims to be recovered, and many Member States are already demanding their rights."
"Member States themselves are calling for so-called direct taxation, mutual control of potential evaders and the fight against tax havens, which are easily established today not only inside the cumbersome banking systems of third countries, but also inside those of Member States."
"It is a bold step from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund to tax havens, a strange departure by this report, but it serves to demonstrate that large systems, including fraudulent ones, start small, at individual level, and then become widespread."
"That is why the strategy for demolishing them must be based on the general interest, but must also be able to reach right down to the very roots of fraud in order to eradicate it."
"Madam President, Mr Bardong's report now under discussion focuses on how the recovery of claims, agricultural levies, customs duties and taxes relating to the EAGGF can be made more effective."
"The subject is a difficult one, as it is a delicate area."
"I wish to thank Mr Bardong for what is a well prepared and expertly explained report."
"Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is becoming ever more important."
"With the establishment of the single market it will be much easier for those with tax liabilities to move their assets and income from one country to another."
"There is a danger that tax havens will start forming within the European Union."
"This would mean conditions that were all too ideal, especially for organised crime."
"The European Union's problem is that it has its own budget but does not have the proper machinery to implement it."
"Member States are taking practical steps to improve the situation regarding both the payment of levies and the recovery of claims."
"However, the Member States are independent economic units which are primarily concerned with their own affairs in respect of revenues, and the recovery of other revenues takes second place."
"Thus only 3 to 5 % of requests for recovery in the EU have been successful."
"The second problem is that the act of recovery itself, the recovery of claims, the seizure of property and other matters connected with the process, fall under the second pillar of the Union."
"The matters that fall under this pillar are not a proper part of the EU decision-making process, but they do call for cooperation among Member States."
"Member States are very sensitive to the threat of violation of sovereignty in this area."
"For that reason, the recovery of claims, and the degree of cooperation which that demands, are politically sensitive questions."
"Despite everything, it is clear that the recovery of claims in respect of taxes and overpayments must be successful in the EU context too."
"For this reason, Mr Bardong's report and the Commission's proposal are to be strongly supported."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Bardong for all the effort he has put into this important report, although I too wish to comment on its title, which fails to do justice to the full range of the subject."
"A large part of the problem could well be that the Commission does not want to admit what is really at stake."
"The question of how much power the EU should exercise in this area has been the subject of much debate, not least in our Member States."
"Perhaps that is why the Commission is beating about the bush in this way."
"Several speakers have commented on Amendment No 5."
"The Commission proposes that Articles 4, 5 and 6 should apply only to claims not more than three years old."
"I believe that it is right for us to be calling for five years, since these matters take a great deal of time to process."
"If the articles in question are to have any impact at all, the Member States must have more than three years to complete their work."
"Amendment No 2 causes some difficulties for me personally."
"I am not sure that we should be saying that national claims are secondary in importance to claims payable to the Community budget."
"This strikes me as unfair."
"My feeling is that national and Community claims should be treated equally; it would be wrong to give precedence to one set over the other."
"As I said, however, this is my personal view."
"The Green Group will be supporting the report, together with the amendments from Mr Bardong and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"This is a good report, Madam President."
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control are good too."
"We shall vote in favour of them."
"All of us here are aware that some shameless debtors may organise their insolvency in such a way that the creditor Member State is obliged to apply to another Member State to whose territory the recalcitrant taxpayer has transferred - or where he holds - assets that are available for enforcement."
"I should like now to put a very specific question to Commissioner Bangemann."
"One scenario envisaged by the Commission as part of Agenda 2000 is that Member States should cofinance the CAP."
"In that case, who in the event of fraud will be responsible for recovering sums disbursed in error out of the portion cofinanced by the Member State?"
"How would one recover a sum paid in error to a fraudster who had transferred assets to another Member State or who had assets in another Member State?"
"Before proposing a scenario, we need to consider the legal procedures that are essential for it to come about, because in this case, where operations are cofinanced, it is the European institutions which decide on the amount of agricultural aid and thus the amount payable by the Member State in question."
"The separation between the party deciding and the party paying will pose real legal problems when it comes to debt recovery, and these may hamper the implementation of cofinancing as envisaged by the Commission - one more obstacle along a road which appears decidedly rocky."
"Madam President, I should like to convey my special thanks to Professor Bardong for his excellent work on an insoluble problem."
"The report, which has been criticised in some points, such as the inconsistency between its title and its content, shows quite precisely the real sort of jungle in which we find ourselves."
"I should like to say a few words on that."
"There have been repeated references in this discussion to tax havens or, as we call them in German, 'tax oases'."
"Let us consider what that expression means."
"Where do we find oases?"
"In the desert, of course."
"This means that when we speak of tax oases, we have to admit that everything in this landscape that is not an oasis is a desert."
"That is the very nub of this entire discussion."
"Our difficulties derive from the build-up of bureaucracies and technocratic measures; above all, they are indicative of the way in which our whole tax system is becoming increasingly complex and incomprehensible."
"In that respect the report is truly excellent, and I shall vote for it, because it is technically correct and shows us precisely where the problem lies, namely in the fact that in the individual states, but also to some extent in the Union as a whole, the situation is becoming ever more complex for our citizens, which naturally gives crooks the opportunity to exploit that complexity."
"I should like to see us addressing that problem very seriously, because if we do not establish a clear picture here, if we cannot adopt and implement simple solutions, we shall continue to have the same problems."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I wish to draw your attention to the fact that during the speech of Mr Souchet and also during part of Mr von Habsburg's speech, Mr Mather was using a mobile phone, which I believe is not allowed in this Chamber."
"I should perhaps point out again that using mobile phones in the Chamber is not allowed."
"Please switch them off!"
"Madam President, this is indeed a very important report."
"I have to say that I am not a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, but I am certainly rather confused after everything I have heard."
"Now I must ask Mr Bangemann this question: if the system is extended, can it happen that, for instance in the case of value-added tax, excise duty ? well, just give us some examples of charges that might be covered here."
"If we were then to have a withholding tax on interest and dividends - which heaven forbid - what would the situation be with regard to recovery by one country on behalf of another?"
"Please tell us what this monstrous title covers."
"I am not at all sure any more whether I can support this proposal."
"Is Commissioner Bangemann prepared to answer that question?"
"Madam President, I shall answer any question from Mrs Lulling, since she voted in favour of the Commission."
"Laughter"
"I shall also answer questions from the Members of Parliament who voted against the Commission, though somewhat more briefly!"
"Well, Mrs Lulling, the areas covered by the draft directive are indicated in the proposal."
"Claims for value-added tax can certainly be subject to the recovery procedure."
"It is indeed possible, and the proposal refers explicitly to that possibility."
"At the present time, of course, we cannot include a reference to a withholding tax on interest and dividends, because it does not exist."
"Should such a tax be introduced, a separate provision on its recovery would have to be inserted, because that type of tax is not covered by the proposed legislation."
"Since there is no withholding tax on interest and dividends, there are no provisions for its recovery."
"Should it be introduced - against your ardent wishes, which are naturally inspired by your concern for the future of Europe and for justice and are totally unconnected to the situation in your own Member State - the directive would have to be supplemented so that any outstanding amounts of withholding tax could be recovered."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"European standardisation"
"The next item is the report (A4-0501/98) by Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament 'Efficiency and Accountability in European Standardisation under the New Approach (COM(98)0291 - C4-0442/98)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a Commission report on efficiency and accountability in European standardisation under the new approach."
"The new approach for the field of technical harmonisation was introduced in 1985 and is based on four principles."
"Firstly, the European legislator sets out the essential health and safety conditions which products must meet before they can be placed on the market."
"The standards institutes then draw up the technical specifications which the manufacturer needs in order to manufacture products to those requirements."
"There is, however, no obligation on the producer to produce on the basis of the standards."
"Lastly, the authorities are required to associate products that comply with the harmonised standards with a 'presumption of conformity' with the essential conditions."
"The Economic Affairs Committee judges the new approach to be a good one, above all because the harmonisation of legislation is restricted to the essential conditions."
"This is a policy matter and separate from the compilation of technical specifications, which is the business of the standards people."
"In other words, every man to his own trade."
"The market-oriented character of the new approach contrasts too with the mandatory nature of the legislation."
"No one is forcing the manufacturer to comply with the technical specifications."
"A new approach makes flexible legislation possible, which can be rapidly adapted to keep pace with technological progress."
"More efficient and more transparent standardisation work is the province of the independent institutes CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, but the reviewing of progress and the process of checking that the institutes take account of deadlines remains a crucial responsibility of the Commission."
"At regular intervals, the Commission has to remind the standards institutes of their duty of responsibility, using cost-benefit analyses."
"It can also benchmark the standardisation process vis-à-vis our main trading partners and study market effects."
"Lastly, and we attach great importance to this, it can take the Member States to task when it comes to transposing the European standards into national standards if they record a poor performance on the internal market scoreboard."
"We are against a merger of the three institutes, for the simple reason that this would dramatically impair efficiency."
"Nor am I sure that the use of formal voting is desirable at an early stage of the standardisation work with the aim of speeding up the process."
"After all, the new approach requires the involvement and mutual trust of all the partners, namely the national standards institutes, small businesses, employers, employees, consumers and the environmental groups."
"Another important factor is the extent to which national bodies recognise each others' technical approval or declarations of conformity."
"For many manufacturers this is a real problem, especially in the building materials sector."
"In effect, they cannot export their products to all the Member States."
"So the Commission needs to tighten up the procedures for dealing with infringements of the principle of mutual recognition."
"More generally, firms need to have a clearer idea of whom to contact if they have complaints about the mutual recognition of test results."
"A unit at the Commission? Or is there another solution, Commissioner?"
"The European Parliament has already said that the parties concerned, namely small businesses, employers, employees, consumers and environmental groups do not have the funds or staff to keep abreast of everything happening in the standardisation field."
"So I suggest the Commission looks at whether they might get more help from Europe."
"But there is not just a problem at European level; consumers are involved, for example, in only seven Member States."
"I think something needs to change there."
"The Commission is asking CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to have an independent assessment made of the way in which the European standardisation process is funded."
"I support it on that."
"Lastly, we must ensure that standards institutes in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are involved more closely in the work of the European institutes, and that the parties concerned in those countries are able to count on aid from the European Commission."
"These are the main observations of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"My thanks to honourable Members for their interesting and useful contributions to this report."
"I have two more questions for Commissioner Bangemann."
"The first concerns closer involvement of the parties involved in standardisation."
"As I said earlier, it is a matter of money."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if he has any concrete proposals which will allow small businesses and other organisations to take a more active part in shaping the European standards."
"My second question concerns the problem of harmonising plugs and sockets."
"I deliberately did not cover that in my report."
"But the question comes up regularly and questions are asked about this."
"As we all know, the debate has been going on for 30 years."
"I would like to hear from Commissioner Bangemann if there is actually a solution - is it a matter of money, or technology?"
"Is there actually the political will to do anything about this?"
"These are my two questions to the Commissioner."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we want to move from an internal market to a domestic market, and for that we need principles, and an important determining factor here is standardisation."
"Standardisation is an economic instrument which will guarantee us freedom of movement for goods and services in future too."
"But we want modern legislation."
"We want the new approach, and specifically in the area of standards we have seen that it is necessary to reflect together on how we can secure better procedures."
"The story of the tractor seat has shown that it makes better sense to opt for the new approach, that is to say to let the standards institutes in the individual countries operate independently of one another."
"I think it is important nevertheless to have legislation - a directive - for this area in order to provide a political framework."
"But there is a clear division here between the legislator on the one hand, who does not want to have to compose weighty tomes full of rules which are often difficult to understand - we want legislation which is lean and efficient - while on the other hand there are the voluntary and independent standards organisations where manufacturers and users quite simply meet and discuss areas which they know extremely well and where they can decide very precisely what it is they want."
"We had a good example here in the House with the bus directive, the so-called European bus."
"We had 142 pages of proposals, and Parliament managed to trim this proposal down to three pages."
"There is no reason why buses in Europe should all look the same, from a hot and dusty village in Sicily to the rush hour in London or the distant wastes of Finland."
"We think the legislator should really confine himself to specific points here, to a few requirements which have to be observed throughout Europe, while the rest should be decided on freely within standards organisations, so that here too there can be competition which does not hamper innovation but ensures that good products get on to the market safely and fast."
"A further part of the system is the CE symbol."
"I think the CE symbol gives us a guarantee that existing legal provisions are not being flouted."
"But in addition we need to have voluntary symbols of conformity which are designed to ensure that subsequent production is monitored by independent bodies."
"Madam President, when my group told me that I had 1 1/2 minutes to speak on normalisation and standardisation this morning, I was worried that it was part of a New Labour process to apply standardisation to candidates across Europe."
"But I discovered, to my relief, that it is in fact a very good report by my good friend, Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, which I commend to the House."
"There is a serious issue which I want to raise on the report and I hope Commissioner Bangemann might respond to it."
"He may remember a constituent of mine, Simon Hossack, who wrote many letters to the Commission and I tabled many questions on his behalf."
"He was an inventor who had produced a very ingenious device which made any electrical apparatus standard across Europe."
"He found that it was impossible for him to market this device because the standards committees were dominated by the big plug manufacturers of Europe who were perfectly happy with the situation where a variety of different plug forms across Europe were allowed to operate because this allowed them to retain their market share."
"By refusing to allow his device the standards committees prevented him from entering the market."
"I know that Commissioner Bangemann as a good free-market deregulator would not approve of this and I hope that he will take account of this in making sure that the standards committees are fully representative of all the people in the Community, including new people who want to enter the market, as well as the existing large monopolies."
"Finally, Commissioner Bangemann, I voted to sack you last month and I will vote to sack you again next month, so you can give me a very short reply."
"Madam President, like the rapporteur, I think the Commission's report on European standardisation under the new approach is broadly satisfactory."
"It wants harmonisation of the legislation to go no further than is essential for safety and health."
"The machinery of standardisation is based essentially on consensus between the professionals and the institutes."
"The report does not prohibit manufacturers from making products which do not meet the standards, and the responsibility thus lies with the market."
"There is of course one sector where problems remain, that of building materials."
"But the general line adopted seems to be satisfactory."
"However, it would seem opportune to mention here the problem of standards being used for protectionist purposes on markets outside Europe."
"I am thinking of the USA and Japan."
"The subject was not strictly speaking considered in the report, it is true, since the report dealt only with the functioning of the internal market, but I think it needs to be looked at by the European institutions."
"In fact, the subject is not unrelated to the setting of internal standards for Europe: the external and internal aspects cannot be separated."
"There is no reason, for example, why these internal European standards should make it easier for American imports to come in, unless there are reciprocal arrangements over the setting of standards in the USA, product for product."
"So the European standards institutes cannot disregard the policy pursued on the other side of the Atlantic."
"I should like to see this too being taken into consideration in the future."
"My thanks, Mr President, to the rapporteurs and those honourable Members who have spoken. I shall try to deal briefly with some of the questions raised."
"We follow the work of the three European standards organisations with close attention."
"We meet with them at regular intervals."
"The last time was just two weeks ago."
"We talk about problems, for example the issue of transparency and efficiency, and we try to make the overall procedure as efficient and helpful for consumers and industry as possible."
"Misconceptions will always arise, for example the misconception that our standards might create technical barriers, or alternatively that if we allow other countries such as the USA and Japan to use our standard, the Americans and Japanese will not reciprocate."
"All these are misconceptions of the principle which underlies our standardisation work - and the work in the USA and basically in Japan as well."
"I must repeat that, with an eye to the charge of protectionism levelled against us by the Americans."
"We are not accusing the Americans of some kind of protectionism; it is the Americans who constantly accuse us of it, the latest example being UMTS."
"This is quite untrue, because - and I say this once again most emphatically, since it is the essence of this policy - with a few exceptions which are necessary for reasons of safety or security, there are no standards which are mandatory."
"No standards which are mandatory! In other words, anyone - including this ingenious inventor with his universal plug - can market his products."
"He does not have to comply with a standard."
"He can market a product which is constructed quite differently."
"What we want, especially with interoperable systems, is that a standard agreed on by the parties concerned, including consumers, trade unions and so on, should also to some degree be attractive, so that people accept it."
"The attraction is basically that the manufacturer of a product - without any need for recognition by other Member States - can make the claim that this product meets the requirements of the European Union."
"That is then the CE symbol and it gives him an advantage, if you like."
"That is the system."
"Now to your individual points."
"Firstly: we already fund small and medium-sized enterprises and their participation."
"We have no objections at all to transparency."
"Anyone with a legitimate interest is free to take part in this process."
"It may be a little longer as a result, but it is altogether possible."
"Thirdly, I should say for the benefit of the rapporteur, Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, that we have taken numerous initiatives involving potential new Member States of the Union, and with great success."
"CEN, CENELEC and ETSI work very closely with the standards organisations of these countries."
"We fund this work under PHARE and other accession-oriented financing programmes."
"So in principle all that is being done."
"One last comment regarding plugs: since the standards organisations are supported by business and industry and their work is funded by business and industry, it is perfectly understandable and obvious that in the current situation - which is not a problem for manufacturers, only for consumers - business and industry are not unduly interested in hearing that we ought to have standard plugs throughout the Union."
"So they do nothing about it."
"Member States too - and we could of course resolve this by political pressure, admittedly not for reasons of safety, but certainly very much in the consumer interest - are totally uninterested in applying a standard of this kind unless the standard adopted is the one already used in their own country."
"Thus Denmark would be very keen to see Danish standards becoming European standards, and so on. But that cannot of course be the right answer."
"The right answer can only be to devise a European standard that is fully consistent with modern technical requirements."
"We would then treat this standard the same as others; it would not be mandatory, but would bring certain advantages to the manufacturer."
"If everyone manufactured their plugs to this standard, this would then mean not only that future plugs and sockets would look like that, but also of course that all existing plugs and sockets would then have to be converted, and you can imagine how much all that would cost."
"That is why neither business and industry nor the consumer is all that keen on changing things."
"But this report goes to the Council as well as to Parliament, and we shall be discussing it again with the Council."
"In effect, this is a clear example of something on which there has been no European standardisation, although it has nothing at all to do with the work we do, and do successfully."
"The way we go about the work of standardisation is the best in the world."
"To quote just one example: GSM, the second generation of mobile phones."
"With this standard, European manufacturers have captured two thirds of the world market."
"If we complete UMTS, the third generation, successfully - and work is still ongoing because there are a few problems with intellectual property rights - if we succeed in this, and American and Japanese firms have also been involved with the work right from the start, we shall probably capture a bigger share of the world market than we did with GSM."
"So we have no need at all to be modest about standardisation."
"We are the world leader here!"
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Before the vote on paragraph 5"
"Mr President, I just wanted to point out that in the English version on page 9, it says binging instead of binding and I know Commissioner Bangemann would not want to be associated with binging."
"Thank you very much for letting Mr Bangemann and Parliament as a whole have that information."
"That warning will be noted."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Euro-Mediterranean partnership in the transport sector"
"The next item is the report (A4-0438/98) by Mr Kaklamanis, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament concerning the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in the Transport Sector (COM(98)0007 - C4-0102/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a follow-up to the Barcelona Conference on Euro-Mediterranean Cooperation."
"It also attempts to gradually implement the decisions taken at the meeting of the European Council in Cardiff on the same issue."
"The report aims to turn the Mediterranean Sea into a bridge of political, economic, developmental and cultural communication between all the countries of the European Union and the third countries on the shores of the Mediterranean."
"It discusses all modes of transport from the European Union to these third countries and vice versa."
"It attempts to set out guidelines for developing modes of transport within the third countries of the Mediterranean and establishing links between them."
"I hope that the Forum on Transport in the Mediterranean, which will meet on 24 and 25 March in Malta, will turn to good account the green light which I am sure the European Parliament will give today, and that the Council will draw up a list of priorities relating to the implementation of the plan to develop modes of transport in the Mediterranean region."
"I hope that the EU's budget will be able to reinforce this attempt, but I must confess that I am not very optimistic. You only need to look at the EU budget for 1999, or at what has already been discussed in relation to the budget for the year 2000."
"I should like to draw the attention of the Commission to the question of the continuous monitoring of the proper use of funds which will be made available to the third countries of the Mediterranean region. We know that in a number of these countries there are problems of democracy and transparency, and that in some of them there are also problems of political stability."
"The European Parliament strongly emphasises the need to protect the environment during the implementation of this programme - especially the marine environment - from all types of pollution, mainly involving toxic and nuclear waste."
"I should like to draw the Commissioner's attention to this last point in particular, because of the decision that has been taken by the Turkish Government to construct its own nuclear power station on the shores of the Mediterranean, in the region of Akuyu. This comes at a time when we know that the epicentre of the major catastrophic earthquake which struck Adana just a few months ago is just 50 kilometres from the proposed site of this nuclear power station."
"Moreover, it is Parliament's view that it should have taken place earlier to enable us to put forward more specific proposals. Be that as it may, we hope that you will keep us informed of the decisions that are taken there, above all in relation to the list of priorities I mentioned earlier."
"In conclusion, I would like to make a correction to paragraph 3 on page 6. The Malta Euro-Mediterranean transport forum, which was to have taken place in February, will now take place in Malta on 24 and 25 March, and the corresponding changes need to be made."
"I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and indeed the Commission. Our opinions may have differed on certain points of detail, but cooperation overall has been very good."
"Mr President, first of all may I thank the rapporteur for his report, and above all for his critical approach to the Commission communication."
"We are constantly talking in Parliament - and not just here, but in international organisations in general - about globalisation."
"This report brings home to us the fact that this concept of globalisation is not always appropriate."
"The fact is that we cannot even manage to establish a proper order and structure in our immediate vicinity which is beneficial to a body like the European Union in matters that concern its immediate sphere of interest."
"In talking of the Mediterranean region, I think we must of course look too at its common history."
"We should not forget that the Mediterranean was once really an inland sea in Europe and only later became Europe's southern frontier."
"This common history means that the goals we have set ourselves, such as the creation of a free trade area by the year 2010, should really be perfectly feasible if the necessary infrastructure can be put in place, if it is possible to do that."
"Inadequate infrastructure, especially in transport and telecommunications, is the main barrier to the development of this area's foreign and interregional trade."
"I think it is most important to look at transport not just for the states immediately bordering on the Mediterranean but for the region as a whole, including the various Balkan states."
"These countries must be included, and they must be included in a report of this kind."
"I think a critical eye is important and necessary to ensure that this debate, this support and also the involvement of Parliament continue, and that communication between Commission and Parliament also continues in future to help bring about progress in this region."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think it is very positive that we are talking about the Mediterranean today, the southern border of the European Union, and that we can hold a debate specifically on transport in the Mediterranean."
"It is nearly four years since the 1995 Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference, and I believe that the Commission has acted positively in presenting this document on transport in the Mediterranean."
"Transport is the means of communication which makes trade possible."
"The last speaker said that the Mediterranean was an inland sea, but for many years it divided the North from the South, a developed North and an undeveloped South, a North with a stable population and a South with a rapidly growing population, a generally Christian North and a Muslim South."
"And this division has made dialogue and mutual understanding difficult."
"The major challenge of the Barcelona Conference was greater mutual understanding and a closer relationship between the North and the South."
"There is talk of a free trade area for the year 2010, but this needs groundwork."
"Communications must be improved as must the relationship between North and South."
"If that relationship does not improve, then unfortunately the only transport on the Mediterranean will be those little tubs full of immigrants, struggling across the Straits of Gibraltar to find the answer to their problems in the European Union."
"Better transport and more mutual understanding can lead to development in this area, which should be an area of close relationships and mutual comprehension to the benefit of all concerned."
"As our poet says, there should be ' un pont en la mar blava' , a bridge across the azure sea."
"Mr President, the Commission is very busy."
"We all know that, and not a great deal can be done about it in the short term."
"What we need to do is to set priorities amongst all the work which is planned."
"A number of comments on this initiative therefore suggest themselves."
"I do not altogether agree with the objectives of the agreements, although I do believe that the effort put into ties with the Mediterranean countries is certainly justified, in view of the agreements reached by the various parties."
"In the first place, I think the Union has a duty to improve relations between the Union and the Mediterranean countries."
"Once we have done that, we can worry about relations between the various Mediterranean countries themselves."
"These countries must also make efforts of their own to improve their position."
"Moreover, the Barcelona declaration on the Euro-Mediterranean partnership mentions transport, and specifically infrastructure."
"This means that the European Union does not have to concern itself with promoting particular transport services in the Mediterranean countries."
"It must, however, ensure that investment is consistent with the policy of sustainable transport initiated by the European Parliament."
"This must lead to prime consideration being given to sustainable connections between the sea ports of Member States and those of the Mediterranean countries."
"Only at a later stage should connections between the Mediterranean countries themselves be addressed."
"Naturally, these connections too must be consistent with efforts to achieve a sustainable system of transport."
"I am all the more sure of this when I see that the trade flows between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries, in themselves not all that large, are considerably larger than the trade flows between the Mediterranean countries themselves."
"To my mind, this makes the reservations which the rapporteur mentions in his report somewhat relative."
"In short, we have to respect and abide by agreements."
"So I would like to see us upholding the agreements we have concluded with and in respect of the Mediterranean countries."
"But this must not be at the expense of other, equally important tasks."
"Hence my amendment, which seeks to ease somewhat the pressure which the rapporteur is putting on the Commission."
"Mr President, following approval of the communication being debated here today, the recommended working party has already been set up."
"The programme has been drawn up, so we have made a fair amount of progress."
"We shall of course monitor the work of this forum and make suggestions in the context of the priorities set at the Barcelona conference."
"We do not need to change those."
"For example, environmental measures too have already been dealt with there as a priority."
"We shall also - and this is the other matter arising from the debate - support and prepare the first meeting of the forum to be held in Malta on 23 and 24 March."
"The European Parliament will be fully briefed on this."
"All the texts presented and adopted there will be published."
"Here too, there is already a clear emphasis on environmental activities."
"So I think that we are currently well advanced with our efforts and have no need to fear a lack of success."
"Of course - and that is really the problem with all this work, and with industrial cooperation too - success depends not only on our goodwill, but on that of our partner countries as well."
"This goodwill on the part of our partner countries is certainly there, but to varying degrees."
"Some partner countries in the Mediterranean area will certainly react very positively to all these activities."
"Others would like to, but for a wide variety of reasons cannot, so we shall probably have to reconcile ourselves to a variety of results."
"But that is not down to us, it is down to the partner countries themselves."
"We in any case will do everything necessary to ensure a successful outcome."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Europe's relations with its neighbours to the south will undoubtedly be the major challenge in the years ahead."
"The minimum degree of economic prosperity, social balance and security that is desirable in the region depends on the revival of a dialogue which is currently faltering, and which needs to produce greater consideration for the interests of the countries on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"In 1995, the Barcelona conference came up with an answer, launching the MEDA programme which built a new partnership on three pillars - political, economic and human."
"The communication placed before Parliament outlines a general strategy for transport."
"This text has the virtue of restating the importance of transport links towards the south, which have to be balanced against the extension of the trans-European networks, the TENs, towards the east."
"But like our rapporteur, I wonder if the will to rebalance the TENs is really there."
"There are no concrete plans for financing them at all."
"Are they to remain merely a pious wish?"
"We need to launch, support and give practical form to a genuine Mediterranean project."
"There is no apparent will to do this, and that must be deplored."
"Let us get away once and for all from all the shilly-shallying and endless fine words that never turn into deeds."
"If we look at the fact that the MEDA programme has been translated only into one or two association agreements, it must be said that all this falls well short of the intentions stated and the resources promised at various summits both before and after Barcelona."
"Salmon"
"Mr President, the Commission deeply regrets the heavy losses suffered by the Scottish salmon-farming industry due to the presence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA)."
"This is a severe blow to a sector which is already under strain on account of the fragile market situation for salmon."
"The Commission services are following very closely the evolution of the disease and the measures taken by the UK authorities to combat the disease."
"We trust that the measures taken are in compliance with EU legislation."
"These measures impose compulsory slaughter at infected sites and movement restrictions on suspected farms."
"We are concerned about the consequences of both the disease and the eradication policy for the sector."
"I draw your attention, therefore, to the possibilities that exist under Community legislation for Member States to grant national financial aid in case of disease outbreaks in the aquaculture sector."
"Any request to the Commission from the competent authorities in the UK to establish a compensation scheme will be examined rapidly."
"Provided such a request meets the required criteria under the present rules for approval by the Commission, we will not hesitate to act accordingly."
"We further believe that the disease is so serious and its presence puts such a heavy burden on the future of salmon farming in the Community, that eradication of the disease is justified."
"If this policy proves unsuccessful, we could, of course, consider submitting proposals to change this policy."
"Mr President, it is very apt that Commissioner Bangemann is taking this speech at the end of the week."
"He may remember a previous occasion when he and I had an exchange of views about the Commission's position, after I had spoken to Scottish farmers."
"I welcome wholeheartedly the Commission's views."
"It is a very serious issue in the Scottish farming industry."
"It is a disease which started in Norway and has affected several farms in Scotland."
"It started off in Glen Nevis in a fish farm in the Highlands."
"It is extremely serious indeed coupled with the threat from the Norwegian government dumping salmon within the European Union at prices which threaten the livelihood of many salmon industries."
"In Scotland and Ireland we have about 6 000 people employed in aquaculture."
"It is important that we ensure that the type of chemicals that the salmon industry uses are not harmful to the marine environment."
"As in all fishing policy we have to marry the exploitation of resources with the proper treatment of the environment and conservation of stocks, although the salmon farming world would obviously not want to conserve the stocks."
"I welcome the Commissioner's statement."
"This week my own government has very generously committed itself to offer GBP 9 million - GBP 3 million a year over a three year period - to assist the salmon farmers."
"They are asking for matching funds and it is going to be administered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the industry itself."
"This follows on from discussions which the Scottish office has had with the industry."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is not going to stand in the way of Member States because the second major condition is that the EU competition policy allow these salmon farmers to benefit from this assistance."
"This is particularly important, given the ownership of many of the salmon farms in Scotland by Norwegian companies."
"Indeed in the Shetland Islands, 50 % of the salmon industry is owned by Norway so it is extremely important that the Commission does not stand in the way and responds, as the Commissioner very generously promised, extremely rapidly to the moves and to any approaches from the Scottish office."
"I will be contacting Callum McDonald and John Sewell immediately after this meeting urging them to put in a quick request to the Commission."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Commission for the vigour it has exercised in tackling this issue of salmon in Scotland."
"Meanwhile, I would like to point out that Scotland is not the only region to have suffered from salmon diseases, which are partly due to the very efficient breeding of salmon in nets, as practised in Norway."
"Stocks of salmon are under threat in Finland too as a result of this sort of intensive farming, particularly as the dreaded salmon parasite has spread to the waters of southern and central Norway."
"It has spread north up as far as the Skibotn river, and therefore to the top of the arm of Finland, as it appears on the map, and the Tenojoki river is under imminent threat."
"The Tenojoki is Europe's longest salmon river."
"The Finnish authorities have been involved in intensive talks with their Norwegian counterparts, but no solution has been found for the protection of natural salmon stocks in the Tenojoki river."
"An added danger is the net breeding that is practised by the Norwegians in the Teno fiord."
"On the one hand, it threatens the genes of the salmon in the Tenojoki and their future survival in Europe's northernmost salmon river, and, on the other, the spread of the salmon parasite threatens the whole salmon stock in the Tenojoki."
"I would hope that the European Commission will embark on vigorous action to save the salmon stock in the European Union's longest salmon river for future generations and prevent it from being sacrificed on the altar of intensive fish farming."
"Mr President, this is the third instance of this type of infectious anaemia in the North Atlantic."
"Previous outbreaks occurred in Norway and Canada, and now Scotland is affected."
"These situations arise because large numbers of salmon regularly escape from fish farms."
"Last year, for example, at least 70 tonnes of salmon disappeared from a fish farm near Oban."
"To make matters worse, we happen to know that the presence of infectious anaemia was suspected at this particular site."
"I believe it is only a matter of time until the disease spreads to wild salmon too - in which case we really will have serious problems, given that wild salmon stocks are already so depleted."
"A whole host of problems surround aquaculture and salmon farming in general."
"All aspects of the question need to be brought together; perhaps a thorough investigation of the whole practice of aquaculture is now called for."
"I wonder whether the Commission would support such an initiative."
"Another parasite called gyrodactylus sallaris is also present in Scandinavian waters."
"Norway recently came forward with a plan to treat 20 rivers with rotenone."
"That was an extreme decision, since such toxic treatment also extinguishes all other forms of life."
"What a desperate attempt to get to grips with this parasite!"
"Perhaps Commissioner Bangemann could tell me whether the Commission is aware of the presence of this parasite in fish in Scotland, Ireland or elsewhere."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his helpful statement and for his recognition of the fragility of the salmon market and for the concern he expressed about the consequences of this disease for the hard-pressed fish-farming industry, particularly in Scotland, where it is of vital economic importance to areas such as the Highlands and Islands where there is very little alternative employment."
"Around the coastline some 340 salmon farms are supporting some 6 000 jobs in some of the most rural areas of Europe."
"It is an industry that is well organised and well managed, but it is in crisis due to infectious salmon anaemia."
"This disease, which is a kind of salmon 'flu, was exotic to the European Union until it first appeared in Scotland in May 1998, since when millions of healthy fish from just ten affected farms have had to be destroyed."
"ISA has been known to cause very high mortalities in farmed salmon cages, but it is a disease that cannot affect human beings and it does not render the affected fish inedible."
"European Union directives as well as UK regulations aim for eradication."
"However, the eradication policy does not address the social and economic consequences of the destruction of millions of fish."
"The reality is that mass destruction brings with it the prospect of financial ruin for many of the small family firms which are involved."
"It can destroy the whole financing of smaller enterprises."
"Since this issue was put on Parliament's agenda, the Secretary of State for Scotland has acted, recognising the employment consequences."
"As Mr McMahon said, the government has promised GBP 9m over three years, but this being on a matched funding basis with the industry, it is now under negotiation."
"It may not be possible for the small farms to meet the matched funding and so what sounds generous may, in fact, for some small enterprises be meaningless."
"Banks have indicated that they will not lend on the security of fish stocks, so unless the larger companies are prepared to act as a financial umbrella, it is difficult to see how the offer will stave off financial ruin for these small firms."
"The big companies might be able to buy up the small ones, but in many cases it is the small companies which have a fine investment record in our rural areas."
"Norway has tacked this problem with a policy of containment rather than slaughter and the question must be asked whether consideration should be given in the European Union to alternative methods of combating the disease."
"It is vital that we take action."
"Scottish salmon farms are standing at a critical juncture, with decisions on buying next year's smolts now imminent."
"It is essential that urgent consideration be given to what further measures, including compensation, may be possible to assist the small-scale enterprises I have referred to."
"I cannot emphasise enough the seriousness of this situation."
"Swift and determined action is essential if we are to avoid the severe consequences being felt in some of Europe's most economically vulnerable communities."
"Finally, Commissioner, may I ask you to confirm whether you would be prepared to consider the introduction of a Community-funded eradication programme should the current national proposals fail?"
"Mr President, it may seem odd that with my constituency in Hampshire, I should want to intervene in a debate about Scottish salmon."
"My constituency is called Itchen, Test and Avon, and these are three rivers famous for their salmon."
"I listened very carefully to Commissioner Bangemann."
"He mentioned the treatment of the areas affected."
"Does he specifically exclude any veterinary or pharmaceutical treatment of the disease, either where it occurs, or as a prophylaxis in areas which could in future be affected?"
"Mr President, as I said, the Commission is awaiting the proposals of the British Government."
"Some measures have been announced but we have received no plans giving detailed and concrete proposals and their financial impact."
"But, as I indicated, we appreciate the seriousness of the situation, so no measure is by definition excluded."
"I have outlined the policy we are following for the time being."
"If it becomes necessary to add a new policy, we will, of course, try to be as helpful as possible."
"That also applies to research measures - as far as I know - I am not an expert in research."
"As far as we are aware, we have not undertaken any research so far."
"But, as always, in our fisheries policy there may be funds available immediately."
"If there is a need for additional research from the Community side, of course we could do that as well."
"I repeat, we are waiting now for concrete proposals and then we will do our utmost to authorise them and, if necessary, add something more."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"Parliament has now completed its agenda."
"The Minutes of today's sitting will be submitted to Parliament for its approval at the beginning of the next sitting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our work in what has been an interesting week."
"I gather from Parliament's services that we have broken a record."
"We can put this week in the Guinness Book of Records, because we have held over 150 roll-call votes."
"I cannot comment on the advantages or otherwise of roll-call votes from my position in the Chair."
"They are governed by our Rules of Procedure."
"But in any event, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that each and every one of you has made a great effort, and so have Parliament's services."
"Our officials and interpreters have had to make a special effort, so it is my pleasant duty to thank them for their cooperation, and I say that with special emphasis today."
"After a week of snow this city has presented us with a wonderful day, so let us thank the city for this wonderful day and hope it will accompany us to the various points of the compass to which we shall now disperse to continue our work for the European Union."
"Before we end, Mr Bangemann has asked to speak and it is an honour and a pleasure for me to give him the floor."
"You have the floor, Mr Bangemann."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask, if you are going to have this number of roll-call votes entered in the Guinness Book of Records, please add the speech I made yesterday."
"It was the shortest speech ever given by a Commissioner."
"Applause"
"Mr Bangemann, I think there should be a double entry for that, firstly because it was the shortest speech, and secondly because it was made by you and your answers are usually very comprehensive, which is much appreciated."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 11.15 a.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 12 February 1999."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, several Members and political groups have drawn my attention to the fact that over the last few weeks a number of avalanches have taken place in France, Italy, and more recently in Austria, and there have been a great many casualties."
"Indeed, the latest avalanche in western Tyrol was the worst for the last 50 years."
"Five people lost their lives and 33 more are still unaccounted for."
"I am sure I speak for the whole House in expressing our condolences to the authorities and to the victims' families, as is our custom after disasters of this nature."
"I am quite certain that you all share in the sadness following these events within our Union, in France, Italy and Austria."
"Applause"
"Mr President, let me give you warm thanks on behalf of my delegation and also of the delegation of Austrian Social Democrats for your words of sympathy on the avalanche disaster in Tyrol."
"Let me also make a point of order."
"As you said, this was the worst avalanche disaster in Austria since the second world war, although of course other Alpine regions have also been hit, in Italy and France and in a non-Member State, Switzerland."
"In Austria, the National Assembly observed one minute's silence for the victims."
"I think it would be fitting for the European Parliament also to observe one minute's silence in memory of the victims of the Galtür avalanche."
"I would add the further request - addressed to the Commission representatives - for funds to be allocated from the 1999 budget, from budget line B4-330 for protection against environmental and other disasters, to help the regions concerned."
"Aid that is given rapidly is doubly useful."
"Thank you."
"Thank you, Mrs Stenzel."
"I am sure the Commission will have taken note."
"It is not Parliament's custom to observe a minute's silence following disasters of this nature, for the simple reason that we would have to do so frequently since they are, unfortunately, all too common in Europe, and Europe is so large."
"Nevertheless, I am quite prepared to agree to your request."
"I invite Members to observe a minute's silence if they feel this to be appropriate."
"Parliament observed a minute's silence"
"In the past few days, I have also received a number of complaints from certain Members concerning the decision to cancel the meetings planned for last Monday."
"I should like to take this opportunity to explain the precise impact of this decision and the reasons for it."
"I must first emphasise that the European Parliament did not close its doors."
"It remained open throughout the whole of Monday, and the minimum services required to support Members and any visitors were provided."
"For example, Vice-President Imbeni was able to meet a delegation of Italian farmers on Parliament's premises."
"Secondly, it is worth pointing out that the European Parliament is not empowered to guarantee public order in the immediate vicinity outside its buildings."
"That falls to the Belgian authorities, who were responsible for the decision to seal off the area surrounding the Community's institutions."
"Thirdly, in view of the fact that due to the arrangements put in place by the Belgian authorities, it was impossible to guarantee the presence of the staff needed to ensure the smooth running of the parliamentary committee meetings - which, as you know better than I, require the attendance of a whole range of officials, interpreters and so on - the wisest course of action seemed to be to cancel the meetings."
"That decision was taken by the Secretary-General, who had been in constant contact with me. It was taken on my express authority, following consultations with the Quaestor responsible for security."
"Finally, it should be made quite clear that at no time did the demonstration's organisers request a meeting with any European Parliament body."
"However, the farmers who took part in the demonstration held in Strasbourg during the last part-session did request a meeting, and I myself met them together with President Santer, Mr Colino, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, and Commissioner Fischler."
"The meeting lasted approximately one hour."
"On this last occasion, the demonstrators were targeting the Council, not Parliament, which is why no meeting was requested."
"Had such a meeting been requested, the necessary arrangements would certainly have been made. Naturally, any delegation would have been officially received if it had been possible to do so."
"The decision taken may or may not have been the right one, but I can assure you that it was based on the practical difficulties of gaining access to the premises and on the perceived need for caution."
"It should not be interpreted as a slight, nor as an attack on the right to demonstrate or to put political positions to Parliament. Parliament always welcomes citizens' political views."
"Mr Nassauer, you have the floor."
"Mr President, did I really understand you to say that the Belgian state informed you, the President of the European Parliament, that it could not guarantee the security of sittings in this Chamber?"
"Secondly, where does it say in the Rules of Procedure that with the agreement of the President the Secretary-General can cancel duly convened parliamentary sittings or other meetings?"
"Is that not a matter for the Bureau or the responsible bodies?"
"Applause"
"Thirdly, do you really think it fitting for the European Parliament to abandon its sittings under pressure of an announced demonstration and to bring its political activities to a halt?"
"Would it not have been more appropriate for Parliament as such to have spoken to the demonstrators, rather than simply closing its gates?"
"Applause"
"I shall certainly reply to your three questions, Mr Nassauer."
"With regard to your first question, the Belgian authorities did not tell us whether or not we could hold meetings."
"What they did say was that they intended to seal off the area, that public transport - the underground, trains and buses - would be unable to reach it, and that there would be three access routes for cars."
"It did not seem possible to guarantee that committee meetings could go ahead in the light of these plans, as the presence of the officials and interpreters required to support the meetings could not be relied on. I should point out that this was the only parliamentary business cancelled."
"Concerning your second question, this decision was made public by the Secretary-General but authorised by me. In taking it, I was merely exercising the powers granted to me under Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure, according to which I am empowered to ensure that parliamentary business, and therefore committee business, is properly conducted."
"If I am unable to do so, because I cannot guarantee interpretation and the support of the relevant officials, it is my duty to request the Secretary-General to cancel the meetings in question."
"Turning to your third question, business was not cancelled as a result of the demonstration, but because the Belgian authorities had decided to seal off the area in which the European institutions are located. This affected not only Parliament, but also the Commission and the Council."
"A number of Members have asked for the floor."
"I have no wish to deny the floor to anyone, but I would point out that as Mr Verheugen is unable to be present through illness, the Council will be represented today by Mr Volmer. Mr Volmer also has commitments in the Bundestag ."
"The more time we spend discussing this matter now, the less there will be to discuss the items on the agenda."
"Mr President, on a separate but related point: when I came into this building this afternoon there was some sort of demonstration taking place at the very doors of this Chamber."
"A huge banner was being raised - it does not matter to what end."
"I have in the past written to you, Mr President, and I have received a reply from the College of Quaestors to say that demonstations of that nature at the door of this Chamber will not be allowed."
"This afternoon such a demonstration took place."
"Can I be assured that if we cannot keep order in the streets of Brussels, we can at least keep order inside the Parliament building?"
"Mr Perry, unfortunately it was our own Members who were demonstrating."
"I presume you are not asking me to ask the gendarmerie to disperse them."
"Five Members were involved and we felt it was better to let their demonstration take place than to help their cause by breaking it up."
"I do not think we should continue with this discussion."
"I see there are six people asking for the floor."
"I regret it very much but we must proceed with the approval of the Minutes of the last session."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 12 February 1999 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, my name appears to be missing from the attendance register for the last sitting, although I was definitely there and even remember signing the register."
"I am therefore very surprised at this omission and would ask that my presence on Friday, 12 February be recorded."
"We shall check that without delay."
"Mr President, I have a comment, or rather a request, to make to you about page 7 of the German version of the Minutes of the sitting of 12 February 1999."
"In the point of order recorded in it, I said that the expected Wise Men's report should also be referred to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Let me ask you to forward this report to us officially for our committee meeting on 15 and 16 March."
"We need it for consultation, we need it so that we can, if necessary, consider it in the light of the discharge procedures that are still pending."
"I said that this committee is the right forum for deciding the appropriate steps to take."
"The report is quite clearly of great relevance to our committee."
"So I would ask you to ensure that we receive the documents in good time for our meeting."
"Applause"
"Mrs Theato, the Committee of Independent Experts is due to submit its conclusions at 5 p.m. on Monday, 15 March. The report will be made available to your committee as soon as it has been translated."
"This should be on the following day, as the translators will work overtime. The Conference of Presidents has decided that the groups may present their own resolutions on this report, but your committee will naturally receive the report in order to consider the outstanding issues."
"Mr President, I asked to speak about the Minutes."
"The Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General seem to be able to see the demonstrating farmers in the distance better than they can see the Members in the Chamber."
"On page 1 of the minutes, my speech has been recorded rather too concisely in my opinion."
"It says that I described the decision taken by you and referred to by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, as inopportune and legally inappropriate."
"I would like the Minutes to record that I quoted Article 5 of Annex V of the Rules of Procedure as the basis on which the Committee on Budgetary Control should receive the report of the Committee of Independent Experts. My speech should not have been presented so concisely, even in the Minutes."
"We shall check the transcription of your speech, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, and make any necessary corrections."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Agenda"
"At the request of a number of political groups, the following changes to the agenda are proposed:"
"Wednesday"
"from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. in fact now from 3.20 p.m. to 4 p.m.: Council and Commission statements on the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan and the need for a political solution to the Kurdish question; -from 4 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.: Council statement on the refusal to approve the draft agreement with South Africa negotiated by the Commission; -from 4.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. and 9 p.m. to midnight: the agenda to be changed as follows: the Commission communication on competition in sport to be deleted; the recommendation for second reading by Mr Bazin on vehicle registration documents (A4-0033/99) to be taken without debate and put to the vote tomorrow, at the request of the Committee on Transport.Mrs Breyer has the floor."
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, the Green Group requests referral back to committee of the Grossetête report."
"I would justify this as follows. I believe we should not vote on reports that have already passed their sell-by date."
"The Commission is already working on a new proposal and has also spoken to a number of MEPs and made it quite clear that a completely revised version now exists."
"I do not think there is much point voting on a report that is totally out of date."
"I also think it would make us look a little ridiculous."
"There is enough other work to be done without embarking on this kind of Sisyphean task."
"So I would ask for this report to be referred back to committee."
"You need only ask the Commission, which will confirm that a new draft will be available in the very near future and that there is little point deciding on a report that is already out of date."
"Mrs Breyer, I cannot put your proposal to the vote."
"The agenda was approved in Strasbourg."
"The only proposals I have made now concern modifications previously discussed with the political groups, and I have done so because there was general agreement amongst them."
"You are raising a new issue, which nobody has been able to debate, at a time when, according to the Rules, it is not possible to do so."
"I cannot put your proposal to the vote because you should have submitted it earlier so that it could have been debated, or at least submitted it prior to the fixing of the agenda."
"I will put to the vote the modifications to the agenda proposed in agreement with the political groups."
"Parliament agreed to this proposal"
"Mr President, I do not think you are proceeding entirely correctly."
"Rule 129 states quite clearly: 'may be requested ... when the agenda is fixed or before the start of the debate'."
"Let me also point out that at its last meeting the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy actually asked for this item not to be included on the agenda because of the new Commission proposal."
"So let me urgently repeat my request - and you are welcome to give the Commission the floor again."
"After all it really is outrageous for us to debate a totally obsolete report."
"So I urgently ask you to put this motion to the vote!"
"Detention of Abdullah Öcalan and Kurdish question"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan and the need for a political solution to the Kurdish question."
"I give the floor to Mr Volmer, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have this first opportunity to speak to the House."
"Unfortunately, the matter we are about to debate is a regrettable one."
"Following the arrest of Mr Öcalan by the Turkish authorities, and the inability or impotence of the international community to find an international solution to the question of how he could be brought to trial, there has, unfortunately, been a rising tide of violence in nearly every European country, which has caused loss of life, injuries and very serious material damage."
"We utterly condemn the use of violence."
"We cannot tolerate or accept political problems, however serious, being tackled by the use of this kind of violence."
"Ever since this issue erupted into a crisis, people at all levels, in all the European states and in the European Union, have been discussing how they can help to resolve the conflicts in south-eastern Turkey."
"You, ladies and gentlemen, took note of the EU's joint statement of 22 February 1999 on the subject."
"There are increasing calls to the effect that after the PKK riots in Europe this is now an EU foreign policy issue."
"I agree."
"We must not forget that the excesses of the last few days were precipitated by a conflict that is occurring primarily in the country of a NATO partner that will one day also be an EU partner, namely Turkey, where it also has its origins."
"In any case, the thinking behind much of what has been said in the public discussions over the past few days needs to be sorted out."
"Let me try to contribute to this."
"In my view it is true that the PKK has discredited itself by its acts of terrorism and violence."
"It has also discredited itself in terms of its claim to represent the legitimate interests of the Kurdish people."
"But Öcalan's PKK, as it is seen and perceived today, with the role and power it has today, would certainly not have been conceivable were it not for the present internal situation in our partner state, Turkey, which lives in constant fear of its territorial integrity being put at risk."
"In that sense the PKK, its aims and its methods are in part the symptom of a more deep-seated problem."
"And it is precisely for that reason that we cannot regard it as the legitimate expression of Kurdish interests or as a warring party that we should recognise."
"On the contrary, because of its random acts of violence, the PKK has repeatedly discredited itself as a political force."
"There is now an unmistakeable risk that this will also discredit Kurdish concerns as such among large sections of European public opinion."
"The PKK is largely responsible for the fact that today Turkey still perceives almost any movement towards ethnic identity as a threat to its national unity and territorial integrity."
"If Turkey is to be in a situation in future where it can satisfy the legitimate demands of ethnic groups and distinguish them from terrorist threats, the first need is to allay these fears."
"The major if not only obstacle to such a process is that a group that is prepared to use violence and all too often does so in Europe too is presenting itself as the legitimate representative of Kurdish interests."
"If we really want to see progress here, we must have the courage to speak the truth and the strength to promote reconciliation."
"The first step along that road is having the courage to speak the truth in all friendliness, however uncomfortable or inconvenient that truth may be."
"In my view we must recognise, first of all, that there is a Kurdish question."
"Secondly, in the end that question can only be resolved in Turkey."
"Thirdly, we should start a dialogue with Turkey on the best way of resolving this question."
"We believe that every nation and every ethnic group has the right to cultural autonomy and to at least partial self-administration in this area."
"But that right must be clearly distinguished from the right to national independence, which implies separatism."
"This distinction between cultural autonomy and national separatism was the key to the Contact Group's attempts during the Rambouillet negotiations to seek a peaceful settlement, and in our view this same distinction is also the key to resolving other regional conflicts."
"We hope the Turkish Government will grasp the opportunity presented by Öcalan's arrest and that it will perceive the difference between national separatism and cultural autonomy."
"We could also argue on the basis of international law."
"The people's right to self-determination does not automatically imply the right to form a state; but conversely minority rights, such as the right to cultural autonomy, must not be rejected and suppressed simply on the grounds of a justified or unjustified fear of separatism."
"We hope we will be able to start a dialogue with Turkey that has a fruitful outcome."
"Some statements from Turkey itself encourage us in that hope."
"For example, President Demirel suggested there could be an amnesty for PKK fighters who laid down their arms."
"Prime Minister Ecevit spoke out against the death penalty."
"The Turkish Parliament has drafted a bill providing for a degree of regionalisation in Turkey."
"These are encouraging signs, which we will gladly follow up in the hope of reaching a viable result both for the Turkish State and for the Kurdish minority."
"Our stand is entirely clear: Turkey has a quite justified interest in maintaining its national integrity."
"We will support it in that."
"On the other hand, the Kurds also have a quite legitimate interest in developing their cultural autonomy."
"We support that position too."
"We will discuss the open questions with the Turkish Government."
"The conditions for a dialogue are better than they were in the past, now that Turkey has been informed from various quarters that there is a prospect of it becoming a full member of the European Union if it satisfies all the conditions laid down in Copenhagen for all applicants to EU membership."
"In particular, these conditions relate to standards of democratisation and human rights."
"The discussions on improving citizenship rights in Germany - to turn for a moment to the domestic politics of my own country - have also led to a considerable improvement in the terms of our dialogue with Turkey, which is one of the most crucial prerequisites if we assume that the problems of refugees and asylum-seekers must be resolved in the country where their causes lie."
"In that respect our German discussions on reviewing citizenship rights fulfil an important function."
"I hope Turkey will grasp the opportunity inherent in the present situation and that by resolving the Kurdish problem on the basis of democracy, human rights and minority rights Turkey will itself move a step closer to Europe."
"Applause"
"Time is short, Mr President, so I will be brief and simply echo what has been said by the presidency and emphasise that the Commission naturally endorses in every respect the statement adopted last Monday by the Council."
"That once again condemns acts of terror in the most explicit terms, but it applies not only to measures which Turkey takes against extremists when they break the law but also to acts perpetrated by the Kurds, of the kind we have regrettably seen subsequent to Mr Öcalan's detention and removal to Turkey. Secondly, and equally, there is a reaffirmation of the territorial integrity of Turkey, which should not be an issue in this whole debate."
"We also want to see Turkey abiding by the agreements it has signed, allowing a fair and independent trial and respecting the rights of the accused to defend himself. We expressly urge Turkey to do that."
"Lastly, we urge too that there should be no let-up in resistance to terrorist activity, and we must of course support Turkey in this."
"We do not accept terrorism in our own countries either, but we should not leave it at that, and should look afresh at ways of finding a political, non-violent solution to what has come to be known as the Kurdish question."
"Recognition that this question exists is the first step towards a solution."
"We agree with the Council that it is not right simply and solely to criticise Turkey."
"On the question of upholding human rights, neither the Council nor the Commission has pulled its punches in criticising Turkey."
"But the Kurdish question as such is of course enormously complex and complicated, with broad repercussions in all directions."
"And with that in mind, I would remind your President and the House of earlier proposals which the European Commission made in an attempt to help improve the situation in the south-east of Turkey, in particular the social and economic underdevelopment there, by means of MEDA programmes aimed specifically at that region, knowing as we do that areas of social underdevelopment are usually a fertile breeding-ground for terror."
"The Kurdish question is not intrinsically an economic one, of course, but economic factors have to be considered alongside political action to find a lasting solution to the Kurdish community's legitimate claims to respect for their cultural identity and their minority rights."
"Mr President, until today whenever we have raised the Kurdish question, the response from Turkey was that, firstly, it is an internal matter and, secondly, it is a question of terrorism."
"The events of the last days and months, and in particular, the recent demonstrations in Europe have proved that it is an international question with important implications for European peace, stability and security."
"My group believes and has stated on many occasions that terrorism is a symptom of problems and that terrorism can only be tackled if the causes which nourish it are eliminated."
"Just as in Northern Ireland, Bloody Sunday created a ready-made recruiting ground for the IRA, the destruction of villages in the south-east of Turkey and the impact of the state of emergency on civilians have only served to strengthen terrorism."
"In my constituency in North London live many thousands of Kurdish refugees, mainly from Turkey."
"Anyone like me who has spent time listening and talking to those people cannot doubt their despair or their passionate desire for peace, and their genuine desire to exercise their culture, language and tradition as Kurds."
"Those of you who watched your TV screens last week will have seen a 15-year-old Kurdish girl set herself on fire in London."
"That young girl lives in my constituency in Wood Green."
"She and her family live as refugees."
"I want to reject any suggestion that those people, who we all saw demonstrating last week, were nothing but a bunch of terrorists."
"Applause"
"This is simply not true."
"Of course, amongst those demonstrators were those who support terrorist activity and we all actively condemn them."
"But the majority were people as concerned for peace as you and I. That is why my group would now make an appeal to Turkey to recognise that this moment represents a chance for the Turkish authorities and political parties."
"The arrest and forthcoming trial of Mr Öcalan provide an opportunity to demonstrate that even in the most sensitive of trials, Turkey's judiciary can act in a fair and transparent manner, fulfilling its international obligations."
"People ask if we have a right to even ask that question."
"Of course we do."
"I have spoken to Turkish ministers who have told me that there are extrajudicial murders in Turkey and torture in prisons."
"So of course we have the right to state those demands."
"However, a bigger opportunity exists."
"Turkey could now move to address the legitimate grievances of its Kurdish citizens."
"I welcome the Council's statement in that context."
"It could reform the political system to allow the Kurdish minority to express itself within the political system."
"It could move to address the stark economic inequalities between the south-east and the rest of the country."
"It could ensure that Kurds in Turkey enjoy the right to have their children educated in their own language."
"As we approach elections in Turkey it could put an end to the harassment of HADEP and give them the chance to participate on an equal footing with Turkey's other parties."
"Applause"
"These are the steps which would convince us that Turkey is serious about its application to join the EU."
"These are the steps which would immediately promote stability and security both for Turkey and the European Union and would receive the most enormous support from this House."
"Applause"
"Mr President, everyone of course, including the press, is saying very clearly just now that there must be a fair and public trial for Mr Öcalan; even for someone who will probably be found guilty of manifest acts of terrorism; even for someone who has not shrunk from acts of violence, a kind of action with which we have never had the slightest sympathy, any more than we like the brutal repression exercised by the Turkish army in the south-east of the country."
"Öcalan has to have a fair, just and public trial, and not just because of our concept of the values of the European Union, and because otherwise Turkey cannot aspire to become a member, since it would of course be strange to hold a fair and public trial for those reasons alone."
"And in any case, we have quite a few other political problems to resolve over our relations with Turkey before there can be any question of its joining the Union."
"I am surprised by the reactions we hear along these lines, sometimes from the foreign ministers too, the Dutch minister amongst them."
"We in the European Union must realise that this trial is symptomatic of a deeper problem, a problem which is relevant to us all, since there are so many Turks and Turks of Kurdish descent living in the European Union."
"Year after year, generation after generation, they have become used to democracy and the rule of law, and many of them would be willing to hold talks, would really like to enter into a dialogue."
"I would urge those who speak for the Union, and the Council and Commission, to support the people in our Union, Kurds and Turks, who would be willing to engage in a dialogue from here, from inside the Union, in order to help Turkey to resolve its minorities problem, because these people are moderates who might succeed in finding a solution here."
"Mr Öcalan's arrest prompted more than just violence."
"We unreservedly condemn that violence, but there were also demonstrations, including ones in Amsterdam at the end of last week, which were very dignified and in which the Kurds showed that their numbers include a moderate and democratic community of people."
"We ought to listen to them."
"I think Turkey must now make use of this development and show generosity - generosity in resolving the problem of the Kurds."
"I think we all want a state which is seeking membership of the European Union to give proper heed to this minority issue."
"It can be resolved without disturbing the territorial integrity of Turkey. I think we all agree with the President-in-Office that you have to make a distinction between self-determination and the justification for separatism."
"Self-determination is possible when you live in a democracy where the rule of law applies."
"Turkey needs to seize the opportunity of moving resolutely in that direction."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, there are two aspects to Mr Öcalan's arrest."
"Firstly, we have here the man who is the tough leader of a terrorist organisation, the PKK."
"This House has never expressed the slightest support for the actions of this man and his PKK, however tragic and hopeless the fate of the Kurds might have seemed."
"But we are pressing for a public trial before a civil court."
"If Turkey seriously wants to join the Union, it goes without saying that it must show itself to be a state truly based on the rule of law."
"Secondly, the arrest of Mr Öcalan once again puts the tragic fate of the Kurds on the political agenda."
"I would refer the House to a report by my former colleague, the Italian Liberal Mr Gawronski, which was adopted seven years ago in this House by a very large majority and which examines ways in which Parliament, the Commission and the Council might place the Kurdish question on the agenda."
"This, as you know, is a people numbering 25 million souls, whose existence is not recognised."
"They were the victims, it is said, of internal discord, and they were scattered over seven countries, but above all they were denied a national identity by the international community at the beginning of the 1920s, when France and the United Kingdom were still world powers."
"The PKK is not the same thing as the Kurds."
"This radical movement speaks for only a fraction of them."
"There are many organisations among the Kurds which do respect the rules of democracy."
"The Turkish Government is wrong to ban all these organisations, and Mr Oostlander touched on this."
"In so doing, it alienates the forces of democracy and encourages the Kurds to be more radical, closing the door to possible solutions."
"What can our Union do?"
"The Union must continue to promote democratisation and the rights of Turkey, and we must send observers, yes, of course."
"The Union must press Turkey to respect the rights of its citizens and minorities."
"Its citizens must have the right to their own language and culture."
"Democratic parties, such as HADEP, must be given their rights too."
"When are all these Kurdish members of parliament, currently held in detention, going to be released?"
"Turkey must move forward with the social and economic development of south-eastern Turkey. I have a whole list of other things it must do."
"Without meaning to, Turkey has indeed put the Kurdish question on the agenda."
"Perhaps, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, we too can put something on the agenda."
"We must have a common position on the Öcalan case."
"We did not have this before."
"As a Union and as Member States we should have determined our responsibilities, had our contingency plans ready, for a problem which has been in existence now for 20, 30 or 40 years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after years of guerrilla fighting and repression against the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, resulting in thousands of deaths, Turkey has now managed to arrest the main instigator of this violence, the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan."
"Our aim must not be to criticise, which is easily done when not personally involved in a conflict, but to try and highlight the positive aspects of the new situation caused by Öcalan's arrest, in order to promote peace in the region."
"For more than two decades, the only means of expression open to the Kurdish people living in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria has been violence."
"Clearly, we condemn all forms of terrorism and all acts of violence, which are never helpful to a cause. However, now that the leader of the main organisation responsible for these attacks is in prison, an urgent solution must be found to the problem which this population of thirty million presents."
"The last twenty years of guerrilla war have obscured the cultural, linguistic and humanitarian rights of these people. The international community's role should now be to work for a peaceful diplomatic solution which gives the Kurdish people the right to a certain degree of autonomy within the current borders of the four countries involved."
"Öcalan's arrest must also be used to highlight the fact that the PKK is not the only representative of the Kurdish community. It is our duty, in this respect, to stress to the Turkish authorities that the whole Kurdish community should not be held responsible for the actions of Öcalan, who has taken it upon himself to act as spokesman for all the Kurds."
"We must also insist that the Turkish authorities should ensure that the trial is conducted in such a way that the international community and also the Kurds themselves can assess the true merit of the reasons for his arrest and imprisonment."
"My last point concerns the violence which has occurred in Europe and the hostage-taking at various embassies by Kurds demonstrating against the arrest of their leader."
"Whereas these violent actions were clearly very well organised, it is apparent that the European Union was totally disorganised."
"This should act as an incentive for us to strengthen links between our respective police services in terms of exchanging information so that we can crack down on international terrorism in our countries."
"Mr President, the Abdullah Öcalan affair started badly last November and it has continued badly."
"The countries of the European Union were agreed that Mr Öcalan should not be handed over to Turkey, but they did not give any answer to the question of where he should stay."
"No one, not one country either individually or as part of a group, offered him political asylum."
"That of course was the other side of the coin."
"If you state one part of your position, you have to state the rest of it as well. Europe did not do that."
"In Turkey itself, despite the many triumphalist pronouncements made there, we now see the dawning realisation that Öcalan's arrest has not resolved the Kurdish question."
"The question now is whether Europe can take any action which is politically relevant."
"It is true that the Kurdish problem is a political problem, an international one, but also that it is primarily an international problem arising within Europe."
"We do not have the feeling that the measures taken by the United States took account of the implications for Europe."
"We believe that what Europe can do in specific terms is, firstly, to continue exerting pressure on the way in which the trial is conducted."
"We see that the criticisms to date have already had some degree of success, in that Turkey is beginning to soften a little on the fact that the case is to be heard by a state security court, where normal independent jurisprudence does not usually apply, by starting to take some limited measures to appoint only civilian prosecutors and so on."
"We must persist in consistently attacking the idea of a military court."
"And we must send a delegation from the Union, with doctors, lawyers and people well versed in human rights issues, to ensure that Öcalan gets a fair trial and is kept in a decent state of health."
"Secondly, we think it is crucial that in the run-up to the elections there should be room for democratic Kurdish voices to be heard."
"HADEP currently has great difficulties in this regard, and we need to make it clear that, in a normal and fair electoral process, all parties must be free to take part without impediment."
"That is not the case at present."
"The European Parliament should take an initiative here, and it can do that very well by sending a delegation."
"It is only in a democratic Turkey, a democratised Turkey, that a solution to the Kurdish question can be found."
"Madam President, in my opinion this House is too fond of giving lectures as an easy way of salving its conscience."
"We will once again be voting tomorrow to denounce the grave threat to the life of Abdullah Öcalan. We will also rightly be demanding a political solution to the Kurdish question."
"In my opinion, we should also take this opportunity to examine our own consciences, which we have not done either in this resolution or even in this discussion. Öcalan's friends who have tried to support the PKK leader's cause and who have actually, I believe, speeded his downfall should also examine their consciences with regard to the attitudes that we have been led to adopt in the European Union."
"A country which should have requested Öcalan's extradition did not do so."
"The very least we can say is that Italy hesitated too long instead of choosing the only route which might have prevented what happened subsequently."
"Öcalan is in Turkey, yet everyone said this was the last place he should go."
"Italy should perhaps have shouldered our responsibility for us, given that neither Germany nor the European Union managed to find the political solution needed, perhaps by strengthening the Schengen procedure and the asylum procedure."
"In my opinion, Italy should have accepted the rules of the terrorism convention and shouldered its responsibilities by judging Öcalan itself."
"This has not happened and I believe that Europe must acknowledge that it was at fault in order to act as a lesson for the future."
"Without political union, such cases are likely to occur again, and the Union's reputation is hardly enhanced by them."
"Madam President, every people has a right to its own nation, and anyone accused of a crime has a right to a fair trial."
"Turkey is oppressing the Kurdish people, and I have no confidence that Mr Öcalan will get proper justice."
"I believe that even now he is being tortured."
"I have never known of anything else in the course of my work with political prisoners in Turkey."
"Once I was with a group of politicians drawn from most Western European countries who accompanied two exiled politicians to Ankara."
"We were to be their shield."
"As soon as we arrived at the airport, they were arrested and sent directly for interrogation and torture."
"We tried to visit them in prison but were not allowed in."
"In the entrance hall I saw two boys of the same ages as my own children - 8 and 11 - in handcuffs with their hands behind their backs."
"How can adult human beings treat children as criminals before they have even reached puberty?"
"When we visited Ankara for the second time during the trial, I delivered a personal letter from the President of Parliament, Lord Plumb, to the two detainees."
"In that way I was able to get through the barrier and talk to them."
"They told of serious torture."
"The worst was not the cigarette burns or electric shocks."
"The worst was that they were woken every time they fell asleep for fresh interrogation and torture."
"The European countries must tell Turkey once and for all that torture is a crime against humanity."
"It is not possible to have normal relations with Turkey as long as it continues to torture and as long as it continues to oppress the Kurdish people."
"May I propose that we send members of our Turkey delegation to take turns in attending the trial as observers?"
"Madam President, Alleanza Nazionale is prompted by the Öcalan affair to make a number of comments."
"Firstly, the Kurdish minorities in Turkey, Iraq and Iran are entitled to recognition of their identity, specific character and aspirations to large-scale autonomy; secondly, the PKK is neither the sole nor the largest party capable of representing these aspirations; thirdly, in its struggle the PKK has resorted to outright terrorism and deployed the most unscrupulous methods of funding itself, including drug trafficking; and fourthly, the Europe of left-wing Socialist governments has proved unable to handle the Öcalan case in a united and coherent way."
"Having said that, a summary trial by Turkey without any guarantees is unacceptable; we call for the trial to be conducted with respect for the rights of the accused, rather than under threat of the death penalty."
"It is equally unacceptable for our cities to become the scene of clashes and gratuitous violence on the part of those who are allowed entry for humanitarian reasons."
"Finally, I would refer to the extremely serious statements made by the President-in-Office."
"It would indeed be a cause for concern if a Member State such as Greece really had been supporting the PKK - more or less indirectly - on the grounds of a deep-seated and, these days, incomprehensible antagonism towards the Turkish people."
"Madam President, the President-in-Office of the Council said in so many words that the Council and the European community of states have shown that they are unable find a common position on the Öcalan issue."
"Yes, this inability is there and it is a scandal how it has been demonstrated in the last few months."
"But what annoys me especially and what is particularly scandalous is that even after Öcalan ended up in Turkey - against his will - a statement was issued that is not worth the paper it is written on, for it does not once mention the Kurdish problem or the Kurdish situation."
"It refers to problems that need to be resolved."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are not specifically responsible for that document."
"You have spoken out quite clearly here."
"You did not treat the PKK gently, but at least you spoke clearly and unequivocally."
"I would like to see the foreign ministers or the Council get round to speaking unequivocally instead of producing documents that merely reflect their inability to reach a common position."
"Secondly, we are also dealing here with the Öcalan case and not just with the Kurdish question in general, and Pauline Green very clearly described our position in regard to achieving a peaceful political solution."
"We regard Öcalan neither as a great hero nor as a particularly nice man, but like many others he deserves fair treatment, treatment that respects his health, treatment that is fair, decent, public and transparent, treatment that allows him to be visited by lawyers, whom we hope he really can choose freely."
"That is why we are also discussing Öcalan, because he has become a symbol, a symbol for many other proceedings in Turkey which unfortunately go unnoticed and which are unfair, untransparent and make a mockery of the constitutional state."
"For Turkey it is not just a question of humanity, it is also a question of political wisdom that it conducts at least these proceedings in an objective, fair and public manner."
"We call on Turkey - and will not cease to do so - to change its approach and seek a political solution to the problem, to take a political approach to the problem of the Kurds and the rights of the Kurds - and here I entirely agree with what you said on the matter."
"If it takes that approach, then Turkey can be sure that every Member of this Parliament will try to convince the Kurds that they too must make their contribution towards a peaceful, political solution."
"It takes two sides, it takes Turkey and it takes the Kurdish organisations, who must do their utmost to achieve a peaceful settlement."
"But we in this Parliament will not cease to support a peaceful solution to a question that can only be resolved by peaceful, political means."
"Madam President, it is a fact rather than a value judgement that once a man's name becomes - or is made - synonymous with a political problem, it is then difficult to distinguish one thing from the other."
"We should have learnt as much from the Arafat precedent!"
"In other words, just as the name Arafat was and is connected with the Palestinian question, so the Öcalan case raises the unresolved problem of the Kurdish people."
"Like it or not, this should be Turkey's starting-point in tackling what is a domestic problem, by granting autonomy to the Kurds and fulfilling one of the conditions that will enable it to make a dignified entry into Europe at some date in the future."
"And yet the events since Öcalan's illegal arrest do not give us much cause for hope."
"When a prisoner is shown off - proudly - in the conditions in which Öcalan was shown, every human right in the book is being flouted."
"When lawyers find it difficult even to meet with their client, it is doubtful that the procedural rules are being observed."
"When a special tribunal is appointed, one of whose members is a colonel, one has the impression that the rule of law is no longer a valid concept."
"And finally, when the shadow of the gallows looms over the outcome of the trial, Turkey should be informed of Europe's views, for the sake both of Turkey and of Europe itself."
"Madam President, when crises flare up, as they did after the arrest of the PKK leader Öcalan, we only discuss the immediate symptoms rather than the general political background to these conflicts."
"That is true of the Kurdish problem, it is equally true of the problems in Kosovo or the trouble spots in the CIS states."
"Of course we must call emphatically on Turkey to observe the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Similarly, we must condemn the death penalty worldwide."
"But over and above day-to-day politics, we should use the Öcalan case as an opportunity to take long-term measures, to develop an active European peace policy; but that also means imposing the appropriate sanctions on countries that systematically violate human rights."
"Human rights and the right of the people to self-determination must take precedence over economic interests."
"Unfortunately, at present the reverse is true."
"Every time we stand by and watch basic injustices continue for years without raising our voice, we ourselves become accomplices."
"Madam President, Mr Swoboda has just reproached the Council communiqué for not including the word 'Kurds'."
"Let me quote a Turkish newspaper, the Turkish paper Radical which praised this text as being 'rédigé avec finesse et précaution ' - carefully and delicately worded."
"So in other words it is an exceptionally hypocritical text."
"I agree with the Council that the problems in Turkey must be solved by political means."
"I welcome the Council's statement that '... all genuine efforts to separate the fight against terrorism from the search for political solutions ...' must be made, but my problem is that the Council does not say that efforts of that kind are conspicuous by their absence at the moment in Turkey."
"Mention was made of the HADEP trial before a state security court, a trial which significantly is being held before the elections, to be concluded after the elections, so that voters know that they risk voting for the wrong party if it has just been banned."
"The number of intellectuals sentenced or still before the state security courts for doing precisely what the Council wants to see happening in Turkey is alarmingly high."
"There is not a word about this in the whole of the Council document. That is what I regret most."
"A word or two on what Commissioner van den Broek said just now about aid to south-eastern Turkey."
"I agree with him."
"But I think it has so far been extremely difficult to give aid to an area where two parties are engaged in military confrontation."
"Aid is then always aid to one side which gets used against the other."
"The situation at the moment is somewhat clearer, in that the PKK really has been pushed back quite a bit by the army, so that rather more can be done in the region."
"But the Commissioner might also have said that the European Union, with Parliament's backing, is currently addressing this, and that we have initiated some fairly sizeable health and vocational training projects aimed at that region."
"The problem remains, though, that the Turks have still not signed the cooperation agreement and therefore cannot currently accept this aid because the financial basis is not yet there, and that is their fault."
"One more small point. I think it is essential for the Commission to support the NGOs in Turkey in order to bring about the civil society, the democracy and the human rights we need there."
"I think it is quite dreadful that the Commission, by insisting that the NGOs provide financial guarantees, sums which they do not have, has currently brought these kinds of programmes to a complete halt."
"Urgent action needs to be taken on that, and very soon."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament too must take a definite position on the arrest of PKK leader Öcalan."
"I find that the opinion delivered by the Committee on External Economic Affairs, Security and Defence Policy of 17 February does not do so, for in my view there is no doubt that the European Parliament must condemn the PKK's terrorism most emphatically."
"We must also very strongly condemn the acts of violence committed by PKK fighters throughout Europe."
"So we call on all the states to take consistent action to combat this use of force and terrorism, as they keep declaring they will do."
"Some EU Member States have not covered themselves in glory in recent years when it came to Öcalan and the PKK."
"Let me tell the state minister, Mr Volmer, that these states include Germany, not just Greece."
"I can only repeat what we said at our delegation meeting in Istanbul, as President Dankert noted: for Turkey, this arrest is a total success, given the attitude of the European states."
"The result is clear to see: acts of violence throughout Europe."
"We must be clear about a number of things."
"One: Mr Öcalan deserves a fair trial, has a right to a fair trial."
"Two: Turkey must also guarantee an independent judiciary."
"Three: independent observers must be admitted."
"Four: if Mr Öcalan is, as expected, condemned to death, Turkey must allow him to live."
"Five: although we totally condemn the PKK's acts of terrorism, Turkey itself must take steps to find political solutions to the Kurdish problems."
"Six: Turkey would be sending out a clear signal if it allowed the Kurdish party - which obtained 4.6 % of votes last time - to participate in the elections on 18 April."
"That is another demand that is not set out in the statement!"
"Madam President, much confusion has been created, both intentionally and unintentionally, around the issue of Mr Öcalan."
"Government propaganda, secret services, mutually opposed organisations, as well as a multiplicity of interests, have whipped up and continue to feed public opinion in Europe, thereby diverting it away from the responsibilities of the European Union."
"Amid all this confusion, we are overlooking the simple and universal principles which must be observed."
"Firstly, the civilised world abhors terrorism and condemns it whatever its aims."
"The end can never justify the means."
"Secondly, however, until guilt can be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt, everyone must be protected so that they can defend themselves."
"It is a sad fact that in Europe, the birthplace of these principles, their implementation was not called for."
"All those responsible tried, each for their own reasons, to rid themselves of the Öcalan problem."
"Germany could have tried him, since it acknowledges that he was the leader of a terrorist organisation in Germany."
"Instead, Mr Öcalan finds himself on trial in a country where there is not the slightest guarantee that he will get a fair trial. And now we are uttering vain wishes that Turkey will hold a fair trial, when just the other day the Council of Europe decision was issued regarding the tortures that are taking place there."
"Madam President, I very much regret that Europe will have to apologise, not to the terrorist organisation, the PKK, but to the blood-soaked Kurdish nation, which has been persecuted by Turkey for 60 years."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all Members of this House who carry out their democratic function here day in and day out do of course earnestly hope that Mr Öcalan will receive a fair trial in the presence of external observers and with all the rights to which a defendant is entitled."
"Many of us are nevertheless aware that what has happened is the natural outcome of many years of war, death and destruction throughout which Mr Öcalan has led the Kurdish Workers' Party."
"Those who resort to violence regularly must be aware of the danger of having it turned against themselves."
"Recent events are certainly regrettable inasmuch as they cast a shadow over Europe's handling of matters of public order. We must hope for a solution to the Kurdish problem and continue to call for such a solution."
"The natural right of the Kurdish people to express themselves in their own language must be recognised together with their right to their own culture and way of life. Such recognition should not, however, jeopardise the stability of old European nations."
"Turkey is undoubtedly one such nation as although it is not part of the European Union, it is certainly an important member of the Council of Europe and of other European bodies."
"We must therefore appeal to all sides to remain calm."
"We must urge the Kurdish Workers' Party not to spearhead more violence nor to resort to the shows of force which have endangered their leader's position. Let us hope that justice will prevail and that the legitimate rights of the Kurdish people will be recognised both within Turkey and in neighbouring countries."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that by far the majority of speakers have in principle supported the Council's basic views on this matter."
"I get the impression from this debate that there is very far-reaching agreement on some points, which I would like briefly to summarise again."
"One: we very definitely condemn all use of force or terrorism."
"In any case the EU ministers of the interior will be meeting to discuss this question in the next few days."
"Two: we must recognise politically that the Kurdish question does exist."
"The Kurdish question must not be suppressed any longer."
"Three: we must distinguish clearly between the PKK and the Kurds."
"Only a minority of Kurds commit acts of violence."
"The majority of Kurds are peace-loving people, as we all are, and simply want to live in peace and security."
"Four: the Kurdish question is no longer a domestic Turkish matter, for the violence on our streets shows that it affects every European country."
"Five: drawing a distinction between separatism and cultural autonomy can be a key to progress in resolving this problem."
"Six: we agree that we must call on Turkey to conduct a trial that is in accordance with the law and that we reject the death penalty on principle."
"Let me add that a troika mission of political directors will be visiting Turkey before April, followed by a troika mission at foreign minister level."
"We will use these opportunities to hold talks with Turkey, drawing on the discussion we have held here and on the points I have just addressed."
"Madam President, I just have a brief question for the President-in-Office of the Council. Is he prepared to submit what he has just said as a general statement to the Council and to ask the Council to accept it?"
"Madam President, I hope what I just said was recorded in the Minutes and that we can put the Minutes before the Council."
"Madam President, I spoke earlier about the three Kurdish women who are in an embassy in Nairobi and I asked the Council to give assurances that, since they have foreign passports, they would be able to go in safety to the country which issued them with their passports."
"Their lives are in danger."
"The President-in-Office did not give me an answer. Would he please tell us whether he will do something about this matter?"
"Madam President, the Council has replied."
"As I understood it, the Commission was going to reply too, but I saw that vanish from the screen all of a sudden."
"That seems a little strange to me."
"The Commission has not expressed the wish to do so."
"Did the Commission wish to say something on this?"
"I do not want to make life difficult for you, Madam President."
"In reply to Mr Dankert, I shall look into the problem which he mentioned about NGOs being asked to provide a bank guarantee."
"For the rest, I agree with him that at the moment Turkey is not cooperating in the implementation of programmes at all, let alone wholeheartedly."
"In any event, I am grateful to Mr Dankert and his colleague Mr McMillan-Scott for their efforts to get these programmes up and running."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Draft agreement with South Africa"
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the refusal to approve the draft agreement with South Africa negotiated by the Commission."
"Madam President, the European Union has been negotiating an agreement with South Africa since 1995."
"Among other things, the draft agreement provides for the creation of a free trade area within the space of ten years and for the wide-ranging development of cooperation in the political, economic and development policy fields."
"The negotiations proved very difficult from the outset, especially because of the problems on both sides in regard to opening up their agricultural markets and because of the divergent positions on the use of designations of origin for port and sherry produced in South Africa."
"Sensitive agricultural products can only be exempted from the liberalisation to a certain extent, because otherwise the agreement might not be WTO-compatible."
"Despite these problems, the European Union has repeatedly confirmed its great political and economic interest in the agreement with South Africa."
"The Vienna European Council called for the agreement to be concluded by the time of the Berlin special Council at the latest."
"A global compromise was negotiated between Commissioner Pinheiro and the South African trade minister Mr Erwin in Davos on 29 January, on the margins of the world economic forum."
"The German Presidency of the Council tried to achieve political agreement on the conclusion of that agreement in the Council on 22 February, on the basis of this compromise package, which was to have been formally confirmed in the Council on 22 March."
"But it emerged at that Council meeting that there was still no consensus within the European Union on the conclusion of an agreement based on the compromise package negotiated by the Commission."
"The main problem is the reservations expressed by several Member States about the proposed rules on the use of designations of origin for port and sherry."
"In practice it is a question of the use of the designation port and sherry on the South African market for products produced in South Africa."
"What is a particular headache for some Member States is that unsatisfactory rules might create a precedent for relations with other trade partners."
"Similarly, some Member States are not happy with the negotiated import quotas and tariff-dismantling timetables for tinned fruit and fruit juices."
"Given this situation, the Council welcomed the progress made in the last round of negotiations and requested the Commission to submit proposals for resolving the pending questions as soon as possible, with the aim of reaching political consensus on the conclusion of the agreement at the next Council meeting on 22 March."
"At the same time the presidency confirmed that the EU was resolved to reach consensus before the special European Council meeting in Berlin on 24/25 March."
"The Commission has already gone to work and opened bilateral talks with those Member States that still have problems with this."
"We do not yet know the details of a possible solution."
"Perhaps further talks will be needed with South Africa."
"In the run-up to the Council of 22 January the South African leader of the negotiations, the trade minister Mr Erwin, sent a letter to Commissioner Pinheiro in which he actually categorically rejected any amendment of the compromise reached in Davos."
"The German Presidency is fully aware how important this agreement is to political and economic relations with South Africa and of its importance as a clear sign of support for South African democracy and as a contribution to stabilising southern Africa."
"In the next few weeks we will therefore resolutely support the Commission in its difficult task."
"We are firmly resolved to keep to the timetable laid down by the European Council in Vienna - conclusion of the agreement by the time of the special Council in Berlin."
"We are confident that all concerned will show the necessary flexibility to resolve the few remaining points of dispute."
"You may rest assured that the German Presidency will do all in its power to ensure that the Council assents to the conclusion of the agreement in good time."
"Madam President, ever since the abolition of apartheid in South Africa, the leaders of the European Union have constantly given President Mandela assurances that a fair agreement on trade would be concluded - a much-needed, strategic agreement which would encourage development in the poorest regions of South Africa, and which is of the utmost importance for the peace, stability and development of the whole southern African region."
"The negotiations, which have been in progress for nearly four years, have not always reflected those fine promises, but have been marked on numerous occasions by the worst sort of protectionist tendencies, regardless of whether the goods involved were fruit and vegetables, wine, potatoes or cut flowers."
"Time and again, Parliament and its delegation for relations with South Africa have called for the finalisation of such an agreement."
"The Heads of State and Government, when they met in Cardiff and Vienna, promised to conclude the agreement as soon as possible, and no later than March 1999."
"The reasons are obvious: the negotiations have been going on for far too long, the South African Parliament is to be dissolved in March, and Nelson Mandela's term as President will come to an end."
"To put it mildly, it is embarrassing that now, in the final stages of the negotiations, some countries are prepared to assume the enormous political responsibility of jeopardising the agreement and thus the whole credibility of the European Union in the eyes of the third world."
"How is anyone to feel confident about negotiating with the EU if we cannot finalise this agreement with South Africa?"
"What has Europe done?"
"Well, our predatory pricing tactics have forced down the price of tomatoes on the South African market, thereby putting thousands of women out of work - women who, in turn, provide for seven or eight other people - and now, at the last minute, we are quibbling over port and sherry."
"This is an issue that has already been resolved during the negotiations."
"I assume that the constructive approach which the Council has shown here will actually be carried through."
"Of course, it is not just the European countries that are protesting with whom we should be having discussions: South Africa should also be a party to the talks."
"South Africa also has to have something to show its citizens."
"Should we really be jeopardising Europe's good name in this way?"
"Madam President, I shall open this debate on a positive note by expressing our thanks to Commissioner Pinheiro, who really did everything possible to put a good compromise on this agreement before the General Affairs Council."
"Mr Pinheiro stuck his neck out."
"I think it is in fact a great shame that he was let down by four Member States."
"In my opinion, the issues involved - wine names, quotas of wine, fruit and a couple of juices - really did not merit such a fuss."
"But I am glad that the matter of cut flowers, which was causing quite a few problems in my own country, has at least been resolved."
"The talks have taken four years."
"It was a very difficult dossier."
"We knew that."
"But the fisheries problem had already been sorted out, because a round of talks was held at the same time."
"So I find it all the more regrettable that the problems were not resolved beforehand in the specialist Councils."
"Thirdly, the social and economic situation in South Africa is downright bleak."
"It is a great deal worse than we had expected back in 1994."
"Surely - and I put this question to the Council presidency - part of the reason is that we continue to close our European market to them?"
"So I wonder if we are not partly to blame."
"Remember Cardiff: remember the promises made to Mr Mandela there."
"And remember what was agreed in Vienna, that the dossier had to be completed."
"My question to the German Presidency is this: what rabbits can you pull out of your hat in order to unblock the dossier?"
"I do not doubt that you have done your best."
"But how are you going to unblock it?"
"I am calling on the presidency here, and in fact I am issuing you with a challenge: let us see what you are made of, and try to find a solution, because the people of South Africa are entitled to our continuing support."
"Madam President, we Europeans have good reason to be ashamed of the totally inadequate support we gave the people of South Africa during apartheid."
"Are we to be shamed yet again?"
"We have often said how much we respect South Africa for the way it has tried to heal its wounds following the abolition of apartheid, and how much we admire and esteem President Mandela."
"Consequently, we are mortified to learn that our Council of Ministers has been too weak to give its approval to the trade agreement with South Africa, an agreement that has taken an unconscionably long time to negotiate - three and a half years, to be precise."
"The arguments put forward by the French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ministers for not approving the agreement are trivial and petty in the extreme."
"There is some cause for concern that their true objective is to leave the door open for a renegotiation of the whole agreement."
"Consequently, I should like to ask the representative of the presidency if he can give his assurance that my concern is unfounded, that all the main elements of the agreement stand and that it will be approved in the near future, in other words by 22 March, without undergoing any substantial change."
"If the European Parliament receives such an assurance from the presidency, then today's debate will have been worthwhile."
"For my part, I can assure the Council that indignation is rife in the House over what we see as a betrayal of the strong desire that exists in Europe for an expansive and warm relationship with a country and a continent that are close to our hearts."
"Madam President, after more than three years of often difficult negotiations, the Commission and South Africa have achieved a draft agreement."
"This House has already underlined the importance of this agreement by asking for the negotiations to be speeded up."
"Having helped to eliminate the odious system of apartheid, we cannot ignore the fate of the people of South Africa."
"Every effort must be made to ensure that the black population which has suffered so much finally sees an improvement in its living conditions. The European Union must help with this."
"This is why my group is disagreeably surprised by the Council's rejection of this agreement."
"Obviously the reasons cited must be taken into consideration, but they could be resolved at a later stage without jeopardising the whole agreement."
"I must stress this point. Surely the agreement could be implemented and the problems raised could be sorted out later."
"The Council's rejection sends the wrong signal to the South African people."
"Therefore, on behalf of my group, I must ask you, Mr President-in-Office, to intervene in order to ensure that the Council urgently gives the go-ahead to an agreement which can only serve to help South Africa develop."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first I would like to welcome you to your first part-session here."
"I can assure you that this new presidency of the Council already enjoys a good advance reputation and we hope that good reputation will be reflected in an equally good outcome to the negotiations with South Africa."
"We are surprised that at its last meeting the Council did not accept the compromise Mr Pinheiro negotiated with South Africa."
"Four years of negotiations means of course four years of toil on both sides."
"We expected a great deal of South Africa after the bitter times of apartheid, a policy that was supported by many EU countries and not just financially."
"I think it is, therefore, only appropriate that the European Union should support South Africa, and time is pressing."
"Mr Mandela has tried his best."
"He needs the support of this agreement for the forthcoming elections - for it is not just European elections that are about to be held, but South African elections too - and support not just from the Member States but from the presidency of the Council."
"We do not want the debts of apartheid to have to be paid, because that the would mean that the population, the people of South Africa, would have to pay twice over."
"That is one point."
"But we also want to try to accommodate them, not just in regard to the wine and sherry market but also in an area that seems to be causing difficulties - for Germany, the Netherlands and Austria - namely the emigration clause."
"I believe it is up to us to show that we can reach a rapid outcome by March, and that is what we request and urge you to do as President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone thinks that the agreement with South Africa is necessary to maintain a burgeoning democracy in a country that could act as a role model for other African countries in the same geographical area."
"Although we understand the United Kingdom's special attitude towards the South Africans, we would like to see the same understanding and tolerance of our own position on products which rival those of our Mediterranean economies, as 40 000 farmers reminded us the other day. I particularly have in mind products with such revered names as sherry, port and grappa, which are flooding our supermarkets."
"We are not just opposed to the quantity of these products. Our opposition is chiefly aimed at labelling, which sparked off this dispute."
"Consumers need clearer and more informative labelling, particularly as regards origin. France is waging a campaign in defence of French names such as champagne and cognac."
"They are even tackling the Russians because of their Champansky. It is only logical that we should be anxious to protect our own designations of origin, because these reflect the cumulative cultural effect of generation upon generation of producers, and this is certainly appreciated by connoisseurs."
"In addition to products covered by agreements on fishing, textiles and imports of competing agricultural products, the question of designations of origin is also a legitimate source of disagreement. We cannot accept this situation."
"Madam President, the Council has acted wisely and consistently in rejecting the Pinheiro-Erwin compromise on the grounds that it does not respect the negotiating mandate which the Council itself gave the Commission."
"This latest example of the Commission exceeding its mandate highlights the need for strict supervision of its role in trade negotiations."
"The negotiating mandates must be sufficiently precise and their execution must be subject to constant monitoring by the Council."
"The Commission must not be allowed to sign draft agreements which appear to be binding on the Council and which put the countries with which we are negotiating in an uncertain position."
"It must be made clear that it is not the Commission which gives undertakings on behalf of the EU but the Council acting as the representative of the Member States."
"In the present case, although the Commission may be acting with the best of intentions in trying to reach an agreement with South Africa, it should not be allowed to exceed its mandate and irresponsibly offer to sacrifice the interests of whole sections of our agriculture, particularly at a time when, as we saw on Monday here in Brussels, European agriculture is experiencing very serious social problems."
"Madam President, as a veteran observer of these four-year long negotiations I suppose I should not have been surprised by the attitude, particularly of France and Spain, at Monday's meeting of the General Affairs Council."
"How can they argue that the Davos package is too generous to President Mandela's South Africa?"
"How can such a ridiculous proposal as that on port and sherry be allowed to scupper the greatest opportunity that we have to offer real and practical solidarity to South Africa?"
"Contrary to what we have heard over here, South Africa has made considerable concessions on port and sherry in the interests of making a wide agreement."
"The South African negotiators have brokered a very significant consensus in their own country in a very difficult situation."
"Alex Erwin, the Trade Minister, speaking this morning in Cape Town, said that the decision on Monday was extremely disappointing."
"He does this against a backdrop of increasing nervousness in the agriculture, industry, trade union and other sectors in his country."
"Mr Erwin asked Europe to see sense, to avoid re-opening the package, and once again to talk about trade, development and cooperation."
"We do not want to open up the wider negotiations, to talk about multilateral negotiations regarding trips and the WTO."
"The time has come for all EU Member States to display realism, generosity and vision, and less of the petty short-sighted protectionism we saw on Monday."
"Political vision is what we need to see now."
"Both the South African Parliament and the European Parliament are anxious now to sign off this agreement once and for all before both in South Africa and here we move on to elections."
"March 22 is the EU's last chance to complete this agreement and to show real solidarity with our partners in South Africa."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of the delegation for relations with South Africa, I should like to thank the House for having agreed to draw up rapidly a resolution aimed at safeguarding our relations with this great country, following the collapse of the five-year compromise which was operated by the Commission and destroyed by the Council."
"In my opinion, the Council has taken no account whatsoever of the political aspect of our relations."
"South Africa needs help in consolidating a democracy which at present still seems very fragile; it needs to develop and progress; it needs people to teach the inhabitants how to work and how to become part of a world which is unknown to many of them."
"South Africa should be helped and not humiliated, especially now that the second democratic elections are about to take place, in May."
"Europe must not miss this opportunity."
"Europe is expert in the art of work, it has strong traditions, it can provide training, and it has SMEs that are ready to teach others how to see a job through and how to develop employment."
"All these talents should be passed on, so as to help promote a great nation which, until a few years ago, did not know the meaning of freedom, democracy and progress."
"The Council should consider all these aspects and not dwell on four fruit juices."
"Next Monday, our delegation will be in South Africa."
"I should like to take President Mandela and the Speaker of the South African Parliament, Mrs Juvuala - who was our guest in Strasbourg three months ago - a message of hope and fraternity and a positive response to their request for assistance."
"I should like to tell them that we wish to negotiate as equals but with understanding for their problems, not merely to listen, and also that we can overcome the obstacles which - regrettably - have emerged on our side and have wrecked the compromise."
"I hope that the joint resolution will be adopted tomorrow, so as to restore a relationship which is currently looking rather jaded, it seems to me."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as I have been involved in politics I have fought against apartheid and I do not think there is anything I do not know about the subject."
"I say that by way of introduction to my comments on this issue."
"I think that the Council did the right thing in blocking this agreement until the points on port, sherry and other related issues have been rectified. These points are very important for our citizens and electors."
"Whereas we as Members of this House represent our electors, Commissioner Pinheiro only represents himself."
"Let me repeat that: he only has himself to represent."
"That is why he can afford to be so relaxed about solving the sherry and port issue."
"Therefore, whilst I am all in favour of rapidly concluding an agreement that would meet the key requirements of our friends in South Africa and strengthen the anti-racist democratic system in that country, I am also appealing for a sensible approach which recognises the interests of our own producers."
"My English friends who have spoken in this debate will know from their history lessons that port is produced in Portugal."
"Furthermore, they are linked to that history themselves."
"That is why they should be defending the authenticity of this product."
"I would be pleased if those historical links did not stop with the Methuen Treaty, but continued with present-day port."
"Madam President, I am not particularly pleased about the reason for this debate, but I am pleased that in this case we have to settle two fundamental questions in a short space of time."
"Mr Volmer said in his charming fashion: we are firmly resolved, we are confident, we will do our utmost."
"In the same breath he added: but we do not yet know what the various components of the solution will look like."
"Thirdly, he said: South Africa has rejected any amendment of the agreement out of hand."
"Somewhere in the middle of all this is the discretion that we actually have at our disposal."
"Like all the previous speakers on this subject, I personally regard what we are doing with South Africa as a scandal."
"Anyone who looks at developments in South Africa can see that things are going downhill, that social conditions are getting worse and worse, that social conflict can be expected when Mbeki takes over from Mandela, because the people who were promised the moon can be given nothing."
"We had all hoped this southern African country could hold the promise of economic growth, from which we could draw some hope again for this supposedly lost continent."
"And what does the Council do, and incidentally not just after this rejection?"
"The whole business has been dragging on since 1995, with one scandalous decision after another!"
"The Council is deliberately allowing a country that needs our help to go downhill."
"That has psychological consequences too!"
"It is a question of credibility, of honesty, which is why you, esteemed representative of the Council, must be as tough and rigorous as you can!"
"Germany also hesitated for a long time before openly discussing the agricultural problems, but now, like other countries, it is doing so."
"I beg you not to underestimate the implications this also has for the European Union!"
"Madam President, I want to make two points."
"Firstly, we are talking here about a package."
"Both sides have made compromises."
"If you try to re-draw the package at this stage you will lose the whole deal."
"Various Members have talked about wines and spirits and the labels for port and sherry."
"They should read what is in the agreement."
"South Africa agrees to phase out the labels in third countries within five years."
"In any case, it is a minuscule market."
"They will phase them out in SADC over eight years."
"They will keep them in SACU for twelve years pending settlement in the WTO."
"The EU should not try by thuggish pressure to subvert South Africa's position in what are multilateral negotiations."
"Secondly, I agree with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that Commissioner Pinheiro has behaved well."
"That does not apply to all the Commission."
"DG VI has been at its protectionist worst and everyone knows that is very bad indeed."
"Behind all the arguments about wines and spirits, port and sherry lies raw agricultural protectionism."
"Spain raised problems with agriculture."
"France raised problems with export refunds."
"If the Heads of Government cannot assert themselves and overcome these sectional interests we risk losing the whole agreement."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken very careful note of your criticisms of the decisions, but I feel that in principle you have tended to support the approach of the presidency of the Council."
"After all, the Council has made enormous efforts to finally get this agreement concluded, for we rate its importance as highly as many of the speakers here."
"Considering that we introduced economic sanctions in the past to bring down the apartheid system, it would be only logical to give economic aid now in order to support the process of democratisation."
"The European Union must take a decision of principle between solidarity with developing countries that are going through a difficult phase of transformation and the national interests of individual Member States."
"I think that what many Member States are demanding for themselves, namely the improvement of their own development chances by structuring their economy in a certain way, applies all the more and all the more clearly for third world countries. That is why basically all I can do is take up your criticism and your ideas and put them before the Council in the hope that the countries that are blocking the conclusion of the agreement will also take due note of what you have said and perhaps review their position again."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Harmonisation of social legislation on transport"
"The next item is the report (A4-0032/99) by Mr Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on transport policy and the harmonisation of social legislation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it certainly was a most interesting enterprise to examine the social legislation on transport on behalf of the House, for the different rates of development of liberalisation, which is far advanced in air, sea and road transport but lagging behind in rail and inland waterway transport, also affect the development of social legislation."
"These nuances had to be taken into account in the report."
"The social aspects on which the report focussed naturally concern working time, safety and health, qualifications and training, mobility in general and not least employment."
"As an important economic branch in freight and passenger transport, the transport sector is clearly situated in a field of tension between the demands of competition on the one hand and safety and working conditions on the other."
"In road and rail transport, it forms part of the public service and is also the basis for the mobility we want for all citizens; with 6 million employed and 3 million self-employed workers, it also represents an important branch of employment."
"For these reasons we believe we must look at the social provisions in the field of transport separately, for in areas where liberalisation has occurred without the necessary minimum social rules, competition has had an adverse effect on working conditions and the safety of workers and therefore also of the public."
"This unregulated competition not only has destructive social effects but also has questionable economic effects."
"So the kind of realistic and pragmatic harmonisation proposed in this report does not conflict with sensible liberalisation measures - quite the contrary."
"It will provide the stable foundation this economy needs for sustainable growth."
"I regard that as the basis of this report, namely complementarity between liberalisation and social harmonisation."
"Of course - and this is the first aspect on which the report focussed - dialogue with the social partners is vital in the preparation of all the measures to be taken."
"In this context it must be ensured that they are fully represented; but even if the negotiations do not produce any results, the Commission will have to take legislative action and must not use the inconclusive negotiations as a reason for delay."
"The directives on working time must now cover every sector of transport."
"Road transport is a good example because it shows, on the one hand, that the Commission needs to take initiatives but on the other that this is not just a matter of driving time and rest periods."
"In addition, the concepts of mobile and non-mobile workers and the various activities involved in the job need new, common definitions in all areas, especially road transport."
"The flexibility proposed in this report must relate to the various aspects of transport, including working time, but must never call in question the principles of the health and safety of the employees and therefore also of the public."
"Fifty thousand transport-related deaths - there is a report that speaks volumes about road safety."
"Strikes that paralyse whole countries in a matter of hours, ferry disasters - these were signs of the need for action here."
"We believe we should not wait for accidents or strikes to create new pressure for taking initiatives in areas where they are still needed."
"But good rules are not enough in themselves."
"They will only be effective and even revive the market if uniform checks are carried out and inappropriate behaviour carries uniform penalties in all European Union states."
"No country may fall short of the minimum controls and Parliament must not be made to wait another four years for the reports evaluating these controls."
"In this context, modern technology that can improve safety must be used to full advantage and in our view there are no economic interests, such as producers' interests, that allow or justify any failure to draw on technological progress."
"I need only cite the example of the tachograph."
"Compared to the technology available now, I would describe the tachograph that is still in use today as well-nigh medieval."
"The report also places great emphasis on access to employment."
"Qualifications and their mutual recognition are one of the cornerstones of transport policy, as is working time."
"They guarantee a quality service and safe working conditions."
"In air transport, for example, the Council seems reluctant to clear this hurdle, although the aircraft cabin crew perform important safety tasks."
"Taking account of social aspects in the transport system also implies ensuring the mobility of the public in its various forms, which includes the needs of persons with reduced mobility."
"This concerns the public service and, of course, calls for a very general discussion."
"Let me conclude by commenting on the employment aspect of transport policy."
"Every year our Member States spend more than EUR 180 billion on employment, which is why our committee believes that every proposed measure must always be examined as to its employment impact."
"Finally, I would say that if we want to create a transport area in the European Community, in which working conditions are no longer detrimental to the health, safety and quality of life of its citizens, we must consent to a minimum of social harmonisation, for there are aspects we need to regulate that the market alone will never be able to regulate."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam may offer us limited means of doing this."
"So it is in our hands."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, Mr Grosch's report introduces wide-ranging issues covering all the social aspects of transport."
"The fact that his report was carried virtually unanimously in the Committee on Transport and Tourism shows that there is a great deal of support within Parliament for provision in the social area of transport."
"Indeed, Mr Grosch's report will be complemented by the forthcoming report from Mr Chanterie, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment dealing with the extension of the general working time directive and my own report on lorry drivers' hours."
"There is no doubt that there is a direct link between the proper regulation of working time, the health and safety of employees and, of course, most important of all, passenger safety, irrespective of the mode of transport used."
"The Commission must be congratulated on assisting the social partners in the railway industry in achieving an agreement on 30 September last year."
"We rightly believe that a similar agreement should be found in the other transport sectors."
"Unfortunately, this has not happened and that is why I am producing a report on lorry drivers' hours because the Commission was forced to resort to the legislative route."
"The other area which gives us some cause for concern is the slow progress being made in the harmonisation of flight times and rest periods for air crews."
"We are particularly perturbed about this."
"In conclusion, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment supports the report."
"We believe several difficulties have arisen with the transport industry as a result of liberalisation."
"I would mention in particular postal services."
"In many Member States liberalisation of the postal services has resulted in considerable problems in this sector."
"As a consequence, postmen throughout the Union are being put on part-time contracts, in many instances without adequate pension cover."
"I believe that the concept of universal service should be the norm and it should be applied in the postal services operating throughout the European Union."
"Madam President, Mr Grosch is trying with this report to rekindle a discussion which has been going on for fifteen years or so, aimed at improving Regulations Nos 3820/85 and 3821/85."
"In the meantime, the Social Affairs Council has adopted a common position on the proposal for a working-time directive."
"I think it is outrageous to regulate all activities in the private and public sectors and yet to leave unregulated a sector such as road transport which employs over seven million people."
"In my opinion, in order to put a stop to all the abuses which have occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future, we must consider annualising working time in the transport sector. We must also decide that any hours worked over and above the standard 48 hours must be classified and paid as overtime, including social security contributions and taxes."
"I believe this is the only way of persuading employers to stop requiring workers to do unpaid overtime, and it would have the major benefit of allowing professional drivers to take advantage of the right to retire at 55 because of the number of hours they have worked annually and the contributions they have paid."
"Finally, I realise that Commissioner Kinnock recently proposed to allow the working time of a professional driver to include all work, in other words all the time when he is at his employer's disposal."
"This is a long-standing trade union demand."
"In addition, in a fairly specific sector like the transport sector we could go along with Mr Kinnock's proposals to extend the 48-hour week to 60 hours if the average of 48 hours per week is not exceeded over four months."
"However, this complex concept will certainly pose problems in practice, and I believe that not enough thought has gone into it."
"Although calculating 48 hours over four months may not pose any problems for a large company, it could be difficult for small and medium-sized firms. The supervisory authorities in the Member States would also find this difficult."
"The new tachograph will clearly help, but until then this idea will only cause problems."
"In any case, the supervisory authorities responsible for implementing the regulations must be required to set up a system of checks and sanctions which is both effective and acts as a deterrent."
"Mr Grosch's report should lead to the House exerting the necessary pressure on the Commission and the Council of Ministers in order to ensure that the intolerable situation in the transport sector ceases once and for all. In this respect I must thank the rapporteur."
"Madam President, the liberalisation of transport markets, a process started in 1993 as part of the implementation of the internal market, has resulted in greater dynamism and diversification of supply and has in general led to lower prices for consumers."
"However, the downside of these benefits has been the heavy social and professional cost paid by workers in the transport sector."
"The general public is normally only aware of such problems when heavy goods vehicle drivers periodically paralyse the whole of Europe with long-running strikes which inflict serious damage on the economy as a whole and capture the media limelight."
"The truth is that the climate of exaggerated competition in the transport sector - between companies, between the Member States themselves and between the European Union and the Central and Eastern European countries - has led to instability on the job market, lower wages, less consistent social security provisions and dumping in terms of prices, taxation and the vehicles used."
"The extent of liberalisation in the various transport sectors - road, air, rail, shipping and postal services - still ranges from total liberalisation to a monopoly of the few."
"This range is also reflected in the working conditions and social protection enjoyed by workers."
"But there should be a guaranteed minimum level."
"That is why the Council and the Commission need to intervene to provide for harmonisation of social legislation in the transport sector, as improved safety, greater job security and improved health protection for the workforce also implies higher productivity for companies and enhanced safety for passengers."
"Nevertheless, there are two particular points that cannot go unmentioned. The first relates to road transport and is the issue of working time."
"This includes not only driving time and time spent loading and unloading the vehicle, but also all the other time during which the worker is at his employer's disposal. This needs to be approached cautiously and impartially, because if companies are faced with an unreasonable definition of working time, they are in danger of becoming non-viable and possibly going bankrupt."
"Lastly, although we support the Commission's firm approach in not extending the scandalous fiscal privilege of duty-free sales, we also exhort the Commission to adopt specific support measures for the sea transport sector, in view of the serious consequences that this change will have on existing jobs."
"In conclusion, we would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report."
"Madam President, I too am happy to add my own words of appreciation to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job here, and to the three previous speakers, namely Mr McMahon and my friends Mr Schlechter and Mr Mendes Bota."
"I have said right from the start that working time has to be the decisive factor in the transport sector, inclusive of other activities over and above merely sitting behind the wheel or otherwise travelling in a vehicle, ship or whatever."
"On the other hand, however, there has to be the necessary flexibility in implementing the rules, so that hauliers are not forced to be on the road or travelling for longer than is strictly necessary."
"If you work longer hours in one week and can be compensated with shorter hours another week, that means that you have to be able to work longer hours in order to complete or conclude a journey."
"Mr Grosch is mistaken on one point."
"We have already introduced rules for the digital tachograph."
"All we are waiting for now is the latest technical data and then these can be made generally applicable, but the rules are there, and the Commission has been waiting to put forward this proposal so that both things can be dealt with together."
"We must be careful not to get it wrong."
"The frequent reports of driving and rest periods being exceeded - and grossly exceeded, according to the press - are prompted mainly by the fact that rest periods which are too short are counted as not having been taken at all."
"This gives rise to idiotic figures of 48 hours' consecutive driving time, which does not happen and is impossible."
"I have just one or two more comments to make."
"Firstly, there must be no discrimination between countries."
"Secondly, the safety risks of road passenger transport must not be exaggerated."
"It is the safest mode of transport that we know, with the lowest percentage of accidents per kilometre travelled."
"And lastly, in maritime transport it is essential, in order to maintain proper levels of infrastructure and training, that we should indeed have very strict rules on this for European crews too, but especially shorter sailing times overall, not working hours, not work and rest periods, but simply a reduction in the length of time that ships are under way."
"Madam President, the work of Mr Grosch and the Committee on Transport and Tourism deserves close attention."
"Social harmonisation in the transport sector is essential and must be keenly pursued."
"It is essential first for the sake of economic efficiency, which means addressing the glaring inequality between modes of transports, particularly rail and sea transport compared with road transport."
"Secondly, it is essential in order to improve working and living conditions for employees and to encourage employment."
"Finally, it is very important for safety, particularly in road transport."
"The improvements suggested by our group and accepted by the committee confirm certain important ideas. These include the need to reduce working time without cutting wages, the development of social dialogue and the principle of social non-regression, so that progress for some does not lead to a backward step for others."
"These principles, together with the demand made in Mr Grosch's report for a clear definition of working time in the road transport sector, which should include all the time when a worker is at his employer's disposal, and the confirmation of the role to be played by the public services, should help to promote a progressive approach to the construction of Europe with technical progress and know-how being used to ensure the advance of civilisation."
"This involves using everyone's skills but without opposing existing diversity, which would bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator."
"Finally, I would stress that we must be very careful to ensure that the proposals in the Grosch report are more than just good intentions. They must be incorporated into all the specific decisions which Parliament is called upon to make, particularly in sectors excluded from the working time directive."
"The view which the people of Europe have of the European Union is dependent on the assertion and effective implementation of the principles of social justice."
"There is a major deficit in this area which must be remedied without delay."
"Popular sympathy, support and participation are required in order to breathe life into the objective of social harmonisation at the highest level so that the Europe that people want can be constructed."
"Madam President, people's increasing mobility and the very rapid growth of the travel industry make it urgently necessary to approximate certain social rules at a high level, if only for transport safety reasons."
"This particularly concerns transport by air and road."
"In the field of bus and coach transport, which is a welcome form of transport for environmental reasons, we need Europe-wide rules to guarantee that overtired drivers do not put passengers and others involved at risk."
"I want to address recitals D and G, in which the rapporteur says that social harmonisation should eliminate competition which is damaging to health, quality of life and mobility and that working time is an important factor in protecting transport safety."
"Any move to eliminate competition is dangerous on principle."
"But I believe that in this case, and especially since it is a question of people's safety, it is justified."
"Madam President, harmonisation of social legislation in transport policy has been the focus of much attention from our committee and the Commission, and I am sure that everyone in this Chamber can see the problems."
"I also think that we can agree on certain solutions, but when it comes to decisions in the Council, that is when things slow down."
"Should good conditions give way to inferior ones?"
"That is what is at stake when harmonisation is under discussion."
"How do we harmonise?"
"The report shows the extent of the problem, or shows how many opinions there are on this matter."
"Transport is a cross-border process and is therefore a suitable area for drawing up common rules."
"There must be common traffic rules and there must be common provisions on the environment and working time, as the rapporteur also pointed out."
"On the other hand, we have very large national transport industries."
"But national rules and traditions are so divergent that social provisions often determine the ability to compete, another point that has been raised here this evening."
"We have the employees on one side and the transport customers on the other."
"Safety and working time go together, and that must not be at the expense of competitiveness."
"In my view, there should be European rules where they are needed, but to a certain extent we need to take account of national agreements and traditions."
"As soon as we bring social conditions, taxes and duties into the harmonisation context, things go badly wrong."
"I think that we have an excellent document here, but if we are to achieve a reasonable result, we must see what the possibilities are in the Council of Ministers, and we must see at what level we need to harmonise."
"I repeat my question: must good conditions give way to inferior ones?"
"That is what we should be discussing."
"Madam President, let me begin by thanking Mr Grosch for the effort he has put into preparing this report."
"There is much that is constructive in the report, on which we now have to take a position, for example where the rapporteur states that the aim of harmonising social legislation is not to control market forces."
"I am one of those who has doubts about carrying harmonisation of social legislation in the different countries to extremes."
"As I see it, social legislation is mainly the responsibility of the individual states."
"I think this is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, which we refer to in many other contexts, and so to a large extent this would be the appropriate way to go."
"I would also question whether it is actually possible to proceed in any other way."
"There are already huge differences in the conditions that exist in the Member States, and they will increase dramatically with each enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Eastern Europe."
"However, that is not to say that certain areas of social policy would not benefit from having common rules."
"For instance, there is a need for greater traffic safety, and no one would dispute that having common rules would improve the situation."
"In my view, however, the rapporteur oversteps the mark when he says that a reduction in working time without cuts in wages is one of the major objectives in the transport industry."
"I do not believe that an across-the-board reduction in working time is the answer where traffic safety is concerned. Instead, the hours that people work at a stretch should be reduced and regular rest periods introduced."
"Clearly, there is good reason to find a common solution at European level."
"Madam President, I would like to join with others who have spoken in the debate in congratulating Mr Grosch on his report which is generally complimentary towards the Commission."
"Naturally therefore, I reciprocate by thanking him and his colleagues on the work they have undertaken introducing this report on social harmonisation in transport."
"It is a helpful reminder that, whilst liberalisation to strengthen transport performance and systems must be pursued, it is essential to ensure that it is undertaken in a way that pays proper regard to the reasonable need of employees and to the security and service of the general public."
"That is a point Mr Grosch has made himself and it has been echoed throughout the debate."
"On the major issue of working time, it is clear that there is hardly any divergence of view between Parliament and the Commission."
"I have to advise the House, however, that, as most honourable Members will know, the Commission has absolutely no power to make proposals relating to the desire that reductions in working time can take place without loss of wages, a point made by Mrs Moreau and by others in the course of the debate."
"The Community directive on working time - and therefore the current proposals - are based, as the House will know, on the protection of the health and safety of workers."
"Whilst it is obvious that proper application of that principle could bring about reductions in working hours in some cases, management of the practical consequences of changes in the law must be left to negotiations between employers and employees, preferably through normal social dialogue."
"Management of that kind obviously cannot - and, indeed, should not - be done by the Commission or by the law."
"Concerns have been expressed about the levels of checks on driving and rest periods and also about the levels of fines and penalties imposed for contraventions."
"In response, I would say to the House that I agree that controls must be effective."
"Otherwise, they are meaningless."
"As Mr Grosch's report recommends, the Commission will consequently propose an increase in the minimum number of checks that have to be carried out."
"The Commission has also been aware of the concerns relating to fines and penalties for some time and we are currently therefore preparing a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement measures."
"That report will address all aspects of these questions."
"Naturally I will acquaint the House with our findings when we have completed that work."
"The report before us suggests that there is a need to evaluate measures in the transport sector in terms of their effect on jobs, working conditions and mobility in general."
"I hope that everyone in the House will accept that neither I nor my colleagues in the transport sector would neglect such issues when preparing proposals."
"I have to say, however, that I do not think there is any significant added value to be gained from drafting a general report that considers these issues."
"The House will be aware that all the proposals we present take account of such issues by providing for flexibility or for derogations or for transition periods."
"I hope the House will recognise that this is a practical and transparent way of doing things and has the essential effect of being a continually applied principle of policy rather than a periodic report which merely offers comments."
"That is, however, a relatively minor point in the overall context of this report and it should not detract in any way from the substance of the work done by Mr Grosch and his colleagues which I am very glad to be able to commend to the House."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Including Turkey in Socrates and Youth for Europe"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now spent nearly three years considering whether Turkey can participate in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"Now that these programmes are coming to a close at the end of this year and we are already discussing follow-up programmes, this subject has finally come onto Parliament's agenda."
"One reason why it has taken so long is that people tended to link the subject of this report to the basic question of relations between the EU and Turkey and of Turkey's full membership of the European Union."
"Article 28 of the EU-Turkey Association Agreement already provided for the possibility of Turkish accession to the EU."
"The December 1997 European Council in Luxembourg, and in particular the June 1998 Cardiff European Council, confirmed the importance of binding Turkey more closely to the European Union in every area."
"From the outset that also implied Turkish participation in Community programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe."
"However, the Council has repeatedly noted that the applicant states must first achieve institutional stability, as a guarantee of a democratic and constitutional system, of the protection of human rights and of respect for and the protection of minorities."
"There is no doubt that the human rights situation in Turkey, especially in regard to the treatment of minorities, remains unsatisfactory, as reflected in the most recent annual report by Amnesty International."
"Moreover, Turkey's policy of obstructing Cyprus' application for accession is not acceptable."
"Let me say that quite plainly."
"But I do not want to go into any further detail today on the current human rights situation."
"We have made our position on this clear on several occasions and in a variety of reports, as most recently in the Swoboda report by our committee on the development of relations with Turkey and on the European strategy for Turkey."
"We have said all that needs saying on that subject."
"Parliament's demands have been set out in numerous documents."
"So this report confines itself to the question of Turkey's participation in the education and training programmes."
"The wider-ranging discussions on Turkey's accession to the EU distract us from the objectives we are actually pursuing with the exchange programmes and which should really be our main yardstick when we look at this question."
"The Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes were developed in order to teach young people the values of tolerance, democracy and active citizenship."
"A declared aim of the European Union in establishing these programmes is to enable young people to play their part in building Europe, for young people who are brought up in a spirit of openness and tolerance are the most promising architects of a peaceful and humane Europe."
"That is precisely why we should try to bind young people more closely to the idea of Europe and to its values."
"That is why we began by opening these programmes to young people from the EFTA states and then also to young people from the associated Central and Eastern European states and also Cyprus and Malta."
"That is why we must not simply leave Turkey out in the cold."
"One of the tasks named in the justification for the first phase of Socrates was to put Europe within the reach of the man in the street and to give it a human dimension."
"With that in mind, Turkey seems almost predestined to take part in the exchange programmes."
"Europe must be brought into the field of vision of young people in Turkey, for it is these young people who are open to change in their country and are forward-looking enough to bring it about."
"Moreover, young people have a very basic and responsible role to play in the process of democratisation and rapprochement between peoples."
"The potential that exists here is shown by the fact that people under the age of 25 make up more than 50 % of Turkish society."
"That offers a huge opportunity!"
"Of course we can only reach a fraction of these young people with our programmes."
"But just think of the enormous amplifying effect produced by young people who gain positive personal experience from these programmes."
"That is why we must offer young Turks a chance to get to know our western European culture and the way we treat fundamental rights and human rights for themselves."
"This does actually work, as we have seen from the existing cooperation schemes between European youth and students' organisations."
"Let me also emphasise again that we will seek fair participation of minorities and especially Kurds when we carry out the programmes."
"The violent disputes that are now occurring on European soil make no difference here."
"But we cannot achieve that through votes or suchlike."
"Instead, we must carefully monitor the participation of the various minorities by drawing up an annual report."
"In conclusion, let me just say that in my opinion we should remember the well-known saying by Jean Monnet, who kept emphasising that all European efforts at integration must in the end be based on bringing people closer together and not just uniting nations."
"Closer cooperation among young people and the offer of exchange grants are important factors for strengthening democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey."
"So both are an important step in terms of binding Turkey to the west in the long term."
"I would therefore ask you to support me in calling for Turkey to participate in the Community's education and training and youth exchange programmes."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exchanges between pupils and young people from Turkey and from the European Union offer an excellent opportunity to promote mutual understanding between our people and citizens."
"They also encourage Turkey to open up more to the democratic and constitutional states of the European Union."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations therefore unanimously endorses Mrs Renate Heinisch's excellent report."
"We want to see young people in Turkey participate more closely in the long-term construction of a pluralist society within a constitutional state, as the Turkish social partners have repeatedly demanded."
"The adoption of this report would also be a sign that the European Union is gradually living up to its responsibility towards our great neighbour in the south by formulating a medium and long-term strategy for Turkey, and that areas of cooperation are constantly growing and being strengthened so that in the long term they will manage not only to eclipse the conflicts of the day - indeed we have been discussing Öcalan today - but also to eradicate them in the long term, with the growth of a new society in Turkey."
"Commissioner, the European Parliament for its part is prepared to promote cooperation in other areas too, in addition to the areas covered by this Heinisch report, so that the European Union can successfully complete all its unfinished homework - here I am thinking mainly of financial aid."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief."
"My group is also in favour of extending the Youth for Europe programme to Turkey, although this decision has nothing to do with our everyday political relations with Turkey or with our serious reservations about certain domestic conditions in Turkey."
"Why?"
"The Youth for Europe programme pursues its own educational objective, which is to promote tolerance among young people towards other ways of thought and life in other countries, through projects of intercultural encounters and exercises in solidarity based on practical participation in local schemes, to name one example."
"The programme is aimed at encouraging personal experience and making young people less vulnerable to nationalist movements."
"The young Turks who visit my country, even if some of them are hand-picked, do have their first chance to really get to know Europe and to correct the biased picture of Europe they may have received from their national press."
"The softening of set ways of thought and the advent of a new generation can bring about socio-political change in a country."
"That is precisely why we must support the dialogue with young people in Turkey, with the help also of this democracy programme. To all those who are against it I would say: the young Turks we invite to our countries should not be made to pay for the wrongs of their government."
"We cannot combat nationalist attitudes while at the same time saying no to a cross-frontier dialogue with young people in Turkey."
"Madam President, although Mrs Heinisch's report is a very good one, it clearly poses a political problem, as has just been mentioned. This is because it proposes to let Turkey benefit from the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes even though, by the rapporteur's own admission, the human rights situation in Turkey is still giving cause for concern."
"Recent events are also not indicative of any change for the better in Turkey: I am of course referring to the arrest, detention and trial conditions of Abdullah Öcalan, and also to Turkey's reactions to the European Union's statements and proposals calling for Turkey to solve its human rights problems."
"What has Turkey's response been?"
"It has said that the EU's statements simply add to the list of items to be resolved prior to cooperation being extended between Europe and Turkey."
"The mind boggles!"
"In view of this situation, the sensible course of action might have been to refer this report back to committee in order to allow time for reflection."
"However, this will not happen and so we must decide what to do."
"Some people may consider, as has just been said, that the young people of Turkey cannot be held responsible for the current problems in their country and that perhaps closer ties with the EU could in the long run steer Turkey towards greater democracy, greater respect for the resolutions of international organisations, improved justice and more freedom."
"However, others, myself included, consider that to vote for Mrs Heinisch's report would be tantamount to telling Turkey that it can take any liberties, that it can refuse to make any gestures and that it can continue to take everything offered by Europe without giving anything in return. We would also be saying that Turkey can continue to violate human rights while arrogantly ignoring the fact that the basic principle of the EU, to which Turkey wants to accede, is actually absolute respect for human rights."
"You cannot be heavy-handed in negotiations, as Turkey has been, but I feel that the European Union is being too timid with Turkey, whereas with the applicant countries of Eastern Europe the EU is being very demanding about their legal systems and the protection of human rights."
"The ELDR Group wishes to give the young people of Turkey a chance, which is why we will not be voting against the report, although it would be wrong to think that Turkey's current attitude is not supported by its young people."
"Nevertheless, we should still give them a chance, but Turkey should not be allowed to regard a positive vote as another victory and as a ratification of its current policy of arbitrary executions which are attacks on freedom of expression."
"This is why our group intends to abstain."
"Madam President, this report on including Turkey in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes has been the subject of much debate in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media. We have also been awaiting decisions for a long time given that the first exchange took place in September 1996."
"The programmes concerned will end in 1999 and the new Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes will start in 2000, when they should be open to Turkey in accordance with certain procedures to be established."
"In the current context, I am therefore wondering what sort of urgent message we need to send to Turkey."
"Clearly, such programmes are a way of imparting the values of a community based on democracy and tolerance of other people and other cultures, not to mention all the other virtues of education and training."
"In this respect, I agree that the Socrates programme should be extended as broadly as possible."
"However, I must point out that an amendment tabled by my colleagues on the Culture Committee, which stated that this decision should enter into force after the European Parliament has verified that human rights are being respected by Turkey, has been rejected."
"For this reason, the members of our group are to vote freely and according to their consciences on this report. I myself intend to abstain."
"Madam President, I think that human rights can only be assured in a country if there are enough people there who stand up for them."
"And that is precisely the point of today's debate. We unreservedly support Turkey's participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes because we believe that we can make an important contribution by giving young people in Turkey a chance to use the opportunity offered by our programmes to turn their country, Turkey, which, sadly, is rightly described as not sufficiently democratic at this moment, into a democratic republic."
"In that sense we regard Mrs Heinisch's report as very useful."
"We certainly endorse it and believe that this report, today's discussion and, I hope, the vote in favour will act as a signal in Turkey."
"Madam President, happily we do not need to wait for Turkey's young people to learn about Europe."
"There are a lot of young Turkish people living in Europe, and they spread the word within Turkey."
"So I do not see such a pressing need for decisions today."
"In 1996, the Commission submitted its proposal to have Turkey included in the Socrates, Youth for Europe and Leonardo programmes."
"In the meantime other countries have been admitted, but specifically because of its human rights record, Turkey remained excluded."
"The European Parliament backed that exclusion in 1996."
"At this stage too, the Social Affairs Committee wonders, to my mind quite properly, whether we should not hold back on budgetary measures for implementation of these programmes until there has been more progress on solutions to the Cyprus and Kurdish questions."
"After all, our debate a few hours ago on the Kurdish question and the Öcalan affair are proof enough that Parliament still regards the situation in Turkey as highly problematic."
"Everyone recognises the value of the programmes as a means of promoting mutual understanding and respect amongst individuals and peoples."
"But what guarantees do we have that participation in these programmes will be open to young people in Turkey from all the various population groups?"
"I have no illusions about this at all."
"It would surely be sending the wrong signal if we approved Turkish participation and opened the door now, at this dramatic moment just before the elections."
"We know very well that a start cannot be made before the year 2000."
"So why should we start making preparations just as Parliament is pressing Turkey to show some real movement on human rights?"
"We must be logical and consistent and not send out the wrong signals."
"We are basically in agreement with the proposal, but we shall abstain because we think that this is absolutely the worst possible time to be sending out this signal."
"Madam President, first of all I would state my firm belief that as Europeans we have every interest in having the best possible relations, political and cultural, with all our neighbours, and naturally that goes for our neighbour Turkey as well."
"However, I have the feeling, with this proposal to admit Turkey to the group of countries eligible for Socrates and Youth for Europe, that Parliament is firstly making itself seriously ridiculous and, secondly, that we are committing an error of principle."
"We are making ourselves ridiculous here in Parliament because for years now, and in any case since the final talks on the Customs Union in 1995, we have been threatening Turkey that there had to be progress on Cyprus or on the Kurdish question, otherwise we would have to see, and Parliament would then block this or that dossier."
"Well, I should like to know what progress there has been since then, on Cyprus for example."
"I am not aware of any."
"Parliament makes itself ridiculous by constantly uttering threats and not following them through."
"Secondly, we are committing a particularly grave error of principle in embroidering further, without protest, on the position of the Council and the Commission and in seeing Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union."
"That is absurd!"
"Historically, culturally and even in purely geographical terms, Turkey is not part of the continent of Europe - or at least only 3 % of it is."
"Europe is not a product like a soft drink or dog food; unless I am very much mistaken, it has evolved from a social, cultural and historical base."
"In short, and I will end here, Parliament should have the courage to tell our Turkish neighbour that we wish to maintain ties of the greatest friendship and cooperation, but that Turkey is not a European country and so cannot be a candidate for membership of the European Union."
"Madam President, this whole debate in fact shows up the dilemma of human rights discussions in the European Parliament."
"We support this report, perhaps also because we believe that there should be no abstentions when it comes to human rights questions."
"We must decide for or against, support or impede the process."
"We think Turkey must be included in the educational programmes because the level of education of a society always has a direct bearing on the progress of democracy."
"We can and must certainly use every political means of persuading Turkey to become more democratic."
"But we must not punish the young people for the sins of their political leaders."
"These leaders will not change their behaviour if we exclude young people from the educational and cultural programmes."
"Perhaps it is a sign of political intelligence if for once we show the ability to differentiate."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian group Alleanza Nazionale very much welcomes the proposal for Turkey to be included in the European programmes for training and young people."
"We cannot, however, refrain from voicing our disappointment that this House is only now being consulted on a proposal which was put forward by the Commission back in May 1996."
"There can be no denying that this delay has been caused by obstructionism, resistance, hostility and reluctance in various quarters and at various levels, with regard to Turkey's inclusion in the cultural programmes."
"The Turkish Government, it is maintained, does not yet provide sufficient guarantees regarding human rights."
"Of course we share this opinion and concern, in spite of the considerable improvements in Turkey's legal order in recent years; our concern is compounded by the continuing affair over the terrorist leader Öcalan and the uncertain and - for us - distressing fate of the Kurdish people."
"Nevertheless, the European Union cannot penalise Turkey for the reprehensible slowness of its democratisation process by abandoning to dangerous international isolation that very section of the Turkish population which is most sensitive to change and to the basic principles of civil coexistence: I refer to young people, in other words 50 % of the population of this Mediterranean country, since youngsters are the main beneficiaries of the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"This rich and opulent Europe, this pacifist Europe - which is as strongly critical in words as the sternest public prosecutor, but timid as a rabbit when it comes to action - already bears the responsibility for not having intervened to prevent the Öcalan case from degenerating."
"It must not now make itself similarly responsible for preventing Turkish youth from acquiring - by means of cultural exchanges - those values of democracy, freedom, tolerance and justice through which Turkey will soon become a new reference point in the policy of enlarging Europe in the Mediterranean area."
"This at least is our wish, as pro-Europeans and citizens of the Mediterranean."
"Madam President, this new report by Mrs Heinisch marks a new phase in the European Union's prevarication towards the situation in Turkey."
"It aims to allow exchanges between Turkish and European young people through the Leonardo, Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"However, it should be pointed out that Turkey's population, language, culture, religion and history are not European."
"In December 1995 we denounced the agreements on the Customs Union - which were what the United States of America wanted - warning that they were an unacceptable first step towards the integration of a non-European country into the Union."
"Now, by extending European youth and education programmes to Turkey, the EU is taking another step down this road."
"The European Union is also being inconsistent in its relations with Turkey."
"On the one hand it is concerned about human rights in Cyprus and the rights of the Kurdish minority, yet on the other hand it is aiming to strengthen its political and cultural relations with Turkey."
"This is a contradiction and is not a serious-minded or responsible attitude."
"Madam President, may I say first of all that I am pleased to see that a large majority of honourable Members are now in favour of admitting Turkey to these Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"With specific reference to the previous debate and the many earlier debates we have had on the European Union's relations with Turkey, I would say that I agree with all those who think, despite the many political problems we have with Turkey and our many differences of opinion, that we have to make an effort - precisely towards Turkey's young people - to develop and strengthen our mutual understanding further and seize the opportunity through these exchange programmes to exchange and share our views on democracy, tolerance and citizenship."
"Catch them young, as the saying goes, and I am sure that this is true of programmes such as these as well."
"I must also compliment Mrs Heinisch on her report and her perseverance in producing this recommendation, after long discussions in the Committee on Culture, and seeing it supported."
"I should add that we do not really have any problems with the proposed amendments, although as regards Amendment No 5, which refers to the need to ensure fair representation of minorities - something altogether consistent with Commission policy - we are rather less happy that this may create the impression, when it comes to implementing the programme, that a quota system is to be applied, albeit informally, for the numbers of participants from minority groups."
"We think these minorities must be assured of success without that assurance being introduced into the text in this way by the amendment in question."
"I hope that the rapporteur and other Members of the House will go along with us on that."
"Lastly, decisions on Turkey's participation in the context of the current proposals do not, as we know, mean that Turkey can take part in the programmes straight away."
"After discussions with Turkey, a decision has to be taken on the implementing rules, the financial aspects of participation."
"Parliament will of course be consulted on this."
"It is already assumed, however, that the new Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes running from the year 2000 to 2004 will include Turkey, and approval of the draft decisions now before us will give the green light for a series of preparatory measures which are absolutely vital if Turkey is to participate satisfactorily in these programmes."
"Decisions to allow Turkish participation are, I think, one more positive signal from the European Union to civil society in Turkey that the EU is prepared to develop its cooperation with Turkey in certain sectors further."
"We are hoping for a positive reply and a positive response from the Turkish side."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Socrates programme (second phase)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0062/99), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0018/99-98/0195(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing the second phase of the Community programme in the field of education (Socrates) (Rapporteur: Mrs Pack)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to discuss the fundamental importance of this education and training programme."
"We have done so often enough over the past months and even years."
"Basically we know it all."
"Perhaps I could say to the President-in-Office of the Council, although he is not present, that good Europeans do not grow on trees!"
"They are educated for Europe in Europe."
"We have to create the necessary European added value, the European dimension in the education and training system, by creating a European area of education and training."
"We are not trying to take over any of the obligations of national, regional and local politicians to carry out European education and training activities; but we want to give them the extra help that is more than ever needed to achieve coexistence on a basis of tolerance in Europe."
"At the first reading we already found that the Commission had greatly improved its Socrates II proposal."
"The procedures are simpler, access is easier, there is less red tape."
"We also achieved one small thing that was important for many in the Comenius programme, namely that where necessary, exchanges of pupils can also be arranged in the framework of Comenius."
"I will confine myself now to the amendments we are tabling today and will be voting on tomorrow that I consider important."
"First I want to say that I believe it is particularly important for people living in frontier regions to be taught and learn languages."
"Frontier regions where the inhabitants do not understand their neighbour's language cannot fully experience the single market at local level."
"Learning English is of little use to them; for instance in Saarland, where I come from, on the frontier between Luxembourg and France, French is useful, which is why the inhabitants should learn French, from nursery school on!"
"It is in their interest to do so."
"A second point we made is that we absolutely must strengthen the system of recognition of studies pursued abroad, what is known as the ECTS system."
"We need to do so to ensure that the time young people spend studying abroad is credited to them when they return home rather than being a waste of time in that respect."
"There is another aspect we consider very important."
"The Erasmus programme study grants are very small, given the shortage of funds, but young people cannot go to a foreign country with only 100 euros in their pocket."
"They can only do so if they have parents or relatives who will finance them."
"If they have parents and relatives who will do so, they might not even need the 100 euros, so perhaps it would be a good idea if the universities looked at students' financial and economic circumstances before handing out grants."
"If someone wants to go abroad as an Erasmus student and can finance their studies themselves, it would be better to save these euros three, four or five times over."
"A less well-off student could go abroad to study with four or five times these 100 euros."
"So that is what we have urged and I hope that at this next sitting the Council will show more understanding here than it did before and perhaps endorse our approach."
"Of course we have suggested something else too, for given that the programme now runs for seven years rather than five, which we have accepted, we obviously need an evaluation at the end of the year 2002."
"This evaluation can no longer relate just to quality but must first and foremost also be financial."
"That is why I hope the Council will agree that given the length of the programmes we should carry out a mid-term review, but a serious one, not just a piece of paper!"
"The main point of dispute facing us now is, of course, as it has always been with Socrates since 1994, when I first dealt with it, funding."
"The Commission wanted EUR 1.5 billion for a five-year period."
"We said: that is not enough, we need EUR 2 billion."
"And we do need that in view of the extension of the programme to all the countries that want to join in."
"We have just been talking about Turkey today, but Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia also want to join. The Council promises all that in its Sunday speeches, and then on Monday we do not have the money to pay for it."
"So we need more money."
"Now the Council has played a very clever trick."
"It has extended the programme to seven years and given us EUR 1.55 billion."
"But all that is rather symbolic, for it has given us less than we used to have for the five-year programme."
"So we have made a very wise proposal: we want EUR 2.5 million."
"We do not want it for ourselves; we want it for all the young people in the European Union, for the 300 million people eligible for this programme, from the cradle to the grave, as I said last time. For this is a programme of life-long learning that begins at school and continues into old age."
"It would be a pity if the Council did not keep all its promises to allocate substantial funding."
"For then we really could do something for the citizens of Europe, and in view of the coming European elections, I believe we must fight for this together."
"I assume you will join me in this!"
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mrs Pack on her report and I am glad we reached broad agreement in committee on the direction of the future programmes."
"We have had enough discussions about the principles of this most successful Socrates programme."
"One thing I want to highlight today is the totally inadequate funding proposed by the Council."
"Unfortunately, thousands of people are still barred from taking part in this programme, as shown by the high number of applicants whom the agencies concerned have to turn away each year for of lack of funding."
"Here the EU could do more to demonstrate its support for the European exchange programmes."
"That is why my group has called from the outset for more funding, in order to give young people a chance to experience living abroad and also to make the current Socrates programme less socially biased."
"Sunday speeches may well tell of a Europe in which young people meet each other, a Europe of tolerance and a common education and training area; in practice, however, great difficulties arise when it comes to funding decisions."
"But surely it would be a good thing, and reflect a genuine European vision, if as many young people as possible could receive part of their education in a neighbouring country."
"Let me also point out that a wider knowledge of foreign languages and early awareness of the cultural situation in other countries are excellent means of promoting mobility on the European labour market, which forms part of an active employment policy."
"Labour market experts have long recognised this as an accepted fact."
"The call for EUR 2.5 billion for the new programme period agreed by the committee is the absolute minimum."
"In contrast, the Council's proposal of only EUR 1.5 billion for seven years is not really an increase in funding but, as Mrs Pack rightly said, no increase at all if you consider the total duration of the programme, if you look at the extra tasks of adult education and opening up the programme to Central and Eastern Europe, if you seriously want to remove the social bias apparent in some parts of the programme."
"The Erasmus grants, for instance, which currently amount to about EUR 70, really offer little added incentive to young people from socially disadvantaged families to do some of their studies abroad while those who can afford it in the first place get this extra funding anyway."
"For the rest I am very pleased that the socio-political demands my group made in its amendments were carried, for instance that universities should in future take more account of the applicants' means when allocating Erasmus grants and that Comenius should focus on mobility measures, especially for young people from vocational schools and in vocational training, because this group has always had fewer chances of taking part in exchange projects."
"I also welcome the fact that the committee agreed that aid for learning the official neighbouring language should become one of the priorities under the Comenius programme."
"That will promote cross-frontier activities and the creation of bilingual areas, as for instance in the region where I come from."
"We want to create a bilingual area on the southern upper Rhine, and if we could do so, with the approval also of the Council, that would be a wonderful means of supporting this development."
"All this will do much to show the public the practical and useful side of Europe, something that is often lacking in European policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mrs Pack very warmly for her strong support for the Socrates programme."
"In particular, I am in favour of a financial boost for this programme."
"As rapporteur for the report on the European year of life-long learning, I know how important the Grundtvig III action is, which supports life-long learning for young people without adequate basic training and also for adults who want and need to widen their knowledge and abilities."
"If we want to work together in partnership on education and training at European level, we must keep all the parties concerned informed about education and training issues."
"In terms of schools, that means we must first of all inform parents and teachers, so that they can recognise and promote the European dimension of education and training jointly with the young people involved."
"Especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, in Cyprus and in the Baltic states, parents and others involved in education and training expect to be given the means to support the process of democratisation in schools and in society."
"I spoke earlier about the report on Turkish participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes and I discussed this question with young people and teachers in Istanbul last week, as I did this week in the delegation with our Lithuanian counterparts."
"They all regard adult education as a big chance of moving towards a more democratic society in their country."
"Here again the old saying I learned at school about adult education still applies: it is often more important to educate and train parents and adults than young people."
"So I am glad this programme offers support in that area."
"Mr President, Parliament is now discussing the second phase of the Socrates action programme and the Council's common position on it."
"I would like, at this stage, to thank Mrs Pack for all the very hard work she has done for the good of the Socrates programme, which is evident from the report now under discussion."
"Socrates has been one of the most successful of EU programmes."
"Within its framework thousands upon thousands of Europe's young people have been able to study abroad, gain knowledge and stimulation, and have their image of the world enriched through actual international experience."
"The programme has been particularly invaluable for Member States with small populations."
"It has both opened new doors for students in those countries and brought new students in from other countries, thus strengthening highly-valued European interaction."
"The Council has now reached a common position."
"The main difference between Mrs Pack's report and the Council's position is that the latter is offering a sum of EUR 1550 million, whereas Mrs Pack and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media are asking for EUR 2500 million for the next seven years."
"When we consider that the EU will, in all likelihood, enlarge in the next seven years, EUR 2500 million would seem to be the right figure."
"It is further justified by the fact that European industrial and commercial competitiveness depends greatly on the level of education we can offer our young people and our older citizens too."
"Concerning the content of the Socrates programme, I would like to raise just one question: the report specifies that the study of languages should be limited to the official languages of the EU, as well as Irish and Letzebuergesch."
"As the languages of the Member States' neighbouring countries are not often learnt to any considerable extent within the EU, it would be appropriate to remove this harsh restriction and broaden language learning to embrace the often ignored but important languages of our neighbouring countries."
"In this way we would be advancing the cause not only of EU enlargement, but also transnational cooperation."
"Mr President, I must firstly congratulate Mrs Pack, the rapporteur for the Socrates programme, on the work which she has accomplished not only in the House but also in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission to obtain EUR 2 000 million for the programme's operation."
"If there is one European programme which our citizens know about, it is Socrates."
"This is a programme that has proved itself, and its success has gone far beyond its financial scope. However, it is unfortunately helping to a certain extent to create a privileged class of people, namely those who have had access to Socrates."
"Socrates brings genuine European added value to the national dimension of our education systems as it encourages the learning of European languages and the study of other cultures all around us."
"Why is this programme so popular?"
"In my opinion, the answer is quite simply that it responds to people's expectation that Europe should be interested in its people, in their personal development and in their integration within their own territory."
"Socrates enables students and teachers to meet and it also allows cooperation between teaching establishments, improved recognition of qualifications and experience of other European educational systems."
"The Culture Committee tabled a number of amendments to improve the Commission's initial proposal, and in particular we requested an increased budget in order to include lifelong training in Socrates."
"The introduction of Minerva, which is intended to encourage the use of multimedia in education, is an excellent innovation in my opinion, as also are the joint projects to be conducted with other Community programmes such as Leonardo and Youth for Europe."
"Finally, I hope that the implementation of this programme will be effectively monitored, as I am sure it will, and that information relating to this will be distributed to those responsible for supervising the programme or even to anyone who wants such information."
"This is the second reading of this report and we are therefore drawing closer to the programme's implementation. I would therefore wish everyone well who benefits from our work and consequently comes to realise that Europe is for them."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her report."
"Mrs Pack has been a good fighter for Socrates in Parliament for the past five years during which time I have sat with her in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"Clearly, we are going to have to go on fighting the Council of Ministers."
"Although we managed to get an increase in the budget, it is clear that the increase is inadequate to meet the demands of the growing numbers of countries that want, quite rightly, to participate in the education programmes under Socrates."
"It is important that they do. If we are going to build a greater Europe, not just confined to the current 15 Member States, it is right that we should be expanding the programmes to other countries."
"The evidence is very clear from my knowledge of the programmes as a former lecturer in higher education, that the more we can get young people across Europe meeting and talking to each other, the more they will understand the importance of Europe and the importance of building Europe."
"I only wish that a few British journalists could take part in the programme as well."
"Then they might understand Europe a little better."
"I hope that Commissioner Cresson will respond positively to the report and will take up the battle which Parliament wants to continue, to expand the programme and expand the budget so that we can have a truly successful Socrates programme."
"Mr President, we are in the midst of a transition from an industrial society to a society based on knowledge, in which education is the new social issue."
"If every individual is to be in a position to pursue a variety of professions during their career thanks to technological change, then we have to create the necessary conditions."
"One major building block on the way to creating a Europe of knowledge is the Socrates programme for general education, as Leonardo is for vocational training."
"These education and training programmes improve individuals' knowledge and abilities and equip them for the future."
"Good quality school education and the application of our concept of life-long learning are a way of mastering many of the challenges facing us, for the profile of tomorrow's workers is as follows: the ability to develop leadership abilities and to act independently, while at the same time showing a team spirit and social skills."
"Workers and managers must be able to communicate and represent their own interests and aims while also showing an awareness of what appear to be alien cultures, identifying the differences and trying to break down the barriers."
"How else, if not by improving their linguistic knowledge, can people become more mobile, can they study away from home anywhere in Europe, can they complete a training course or find a job?"
"The fact that Socrates supports language teaching even in less familiar European languages is a plus in terms of solidarity."
"The proposals put forward by Mrs Pack, a proponent of practical policies, deserve unreserved support."
"I have learned from my visits to schools, at which Europe is put to the test nearly every Monday, how much support there is for Socrates, despite all the problems with applications for funding."
"Exchanges between pupils and encounters between teachers carry more weight than any number of glossy brochures."
"But what is the use of splendid ideas if they do not serve the general good?"
"The EUR 2.5 million we are calling for is a minimum if you look at the growing circle of recipients, if you look at the number of applicant countries."
"Socrates is an exemplary, sensible and verifiable investment in the future."
"Mr President, I want to address two particular points in connection with this debate on the excellent and important report drafted by Mrs Pack."
"We are talking about the cultural project of promoting cross-frontier language learning."
"Here we should take particular note of the situation in the Central and Eastern European countries. When we visit these countries we keep finding that their inhabitants have an excellent knowledge of our languages, but who of us in western Europe speaks their languages?"
"It is here that the European Union has a special responsibility to make sure that our young people learn the languages of their Central and Eastern European neighbours, for economic but even more for cultural reasons, for reasons of European policy."
"That is my first point."
"My second point is one that Mrs Pack has also addressed, namely our special responsibility for frontier areas."
"We are now seeing a phenomenon, especially in Austrian frontier areas, where after complaining for years about dead frontiers and deaths and the iron curtain we are suddenly afraid of open frontiers again."
"We must respond to this with cultural initiatives, with education and training measures."
"So it is most important that we institutionalise this."
"Exchanges between pupils, between teachers, but in particular bilingual, even trilingual schools can be a means of linking up these frontier areas not just economically but also in cultural, linguistic terms."
"We have the experience of a particular situation in Austria, in Kärnten, where we have very special Slovenian and German-language educational facilities because of the Slovenian minority."
"With the opening up of frontiers, we can now see how useful these young people with their training are in terms of general and cross-frontier economic development."
"So we have these examples, which is why I believe that money invested in this programme is money very well spent and well invested."
"Mr President, I join with previous speakers in welcoming the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate."
"Socrates phase one has been a very worthwhile experiment in transnational education."
"In my own country of Ireland there are many teachers and students who can testify to its success as a unique learning experience."
"Apart from its obvious educational dimension, Socrates has provided a sense of belonging and an opportunity for young people to share and enjoy the cultural diversity of the European Union and its Member States."
"It exposes young people through well-designed educational programmes to the differing lifestyles and individuality of each EU country, while at the same time helping them to appreciate more their own rich and diverse heritage."
"I welcome the fact that the Council has now reached a common position on future education and training programmes including the Socrates programme, that the operational time for the new programme is to be extended to seven years and that the budget is to be significantly increased."
"Europe, in my view, must continue to invest in young people."
"A skilled and mobile young population is our greatest asset in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive."
"Ireland has demonstrated how its young people are contributing in a major way to its significant economic growth."
"Mr President, first I want to warmly thank Mrs Pack for her report, and in particular for the commitment she has shown to the subject."
"The content of the second generation of education and training programmes was decided on the basis of the discussion on the White Paper on teaching and learning, by the Green Paper on cross-frontier mobility and by the Europe of Knowledge programme."
"The aim is to give all the target groups easier access to the programmes, to simplify the application and selection procedure and to achieve a participation rate of 10 % of schools and 10 % of students and pupils."
"Particular emphasis is also placed on removing all forms of discrimination."
"So at second reading we now have the additional provision that the economic situation of applicants should be taken into consideration in an appropriate fashion when grants are awarded, as should the promotion of equal opportunities for women and men and, which I particularly welcome, closer involvement of the social partners."
"One innovation found in Socrates II, as a consequence of the concept of life-long learning called for in all education and training programmes, is the inclusion of adult education in the Grundtvig programme."
"Another innovation is that we now have a training programme with a female name, in the form of the Minerva education and multi-media technology programme, another successful proposal by Doris Pack."
"In short, this means that Socrates is a good programme covering added aspects, that seeks a higher quota of participants and is open to a larger number of eligible applicant states."
"We must not forget that most of the applicant states can already take part in the training and education programmes and that more and more of them will be able to do so in the next seven years."
"That makes the Council proposal to reduce the Commission's proposed funding from EUR 1.4 billion for five years to EUR 1.55 billion - but for seven years - even more scandalous."
"That would mean that Socrates II had to do more for more participants for less money."
"So I ask the European Parliament to endorse the committee's justified amendment, that was adopted unanimously, providing for EUR 2.5 billion for a period of seven years."
"That really is the minimum we can ask for if the Socrates programme is to continue to be applied successfully for young people, for students and teachers and for all those who want to teach and engage in further education in Europe."
"Mr President, the Socrates programme is one of the most important channels of support for mobility and diversity of education within the Community."
"To include the student population of EU applicant countries and certain other countries close to us in the programme is a natural step towards an enlarging Europe."
"In the expanding Socrates process we need to ensure that individual participation in the programme is not made more difficult by such matters as underfunding."
"It is important to take account of the financial situation of participants when deciding how to allocate funds."
"The study of minority languages in the European area, as well as support for the Sami language as part of international policy, will preserve valuable local cultural traditions, which must be kept alive in an ever more internationalist Europe."
"The inclusion of adult learners and trained teaching staff in the programme will broaden its scope by appealing to a much larger section of the population."
"Their involvement will make it considerably easier to promote the mutual recognition of courses undertaken in different countries, which in turn will help the mobility of labour."
"Money invested in the programme will be recouped many times over in the future."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will the give this issue the consideration it deserves and that the present Socrates programme will have a follow-up which is just as good as the current programme, supported by the funding proposed by Parliament."
"Obviously, there are many parties with a claim to a share in the budget, but if we make cuts in the youth programmes, we will be making cuts for our future and the development of Europeanisation, which will be a be very shortsighted policy."
"Mr President, I should also like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on the tremendous proposal she has put before us."
"When we discuss any issues regarding education we have to see this as an investment in the future for our young people to give them the skills to adapt to the changing technologies in the changing world in which we live."
"It is also an investment in the future for a greater understanding of the diversity in the European Union - cultural, social and linguistic."
"That is why it is important, as the previous speaker has said, that the study of minority languages should be encouraged in the Socrates programme."
"I speak in particular of the Irish language."
"It is an official language of the European Union and should be given greater prominence."
"However, as many speakers have said, despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission's good faith regarding lifelong learning, there is a lack of commitment on financial resources."
"Therefore, I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to ensure that this new seven-year Socrates programme is given proper funding of EUR 2 500m."
"It is also important that we learn from mistakes made in the programmes in the past."
"I refer in particular to the Erasmus programme which dealt mainly with third-level student exchanges."
"It contained an element of exclusivity so that if a family could not afford to support a student studying in a foreign country that student could not benefit."
"It is incumbent on us to ensure that some financial support would be available under these programmes, either at European or national level."
"If Member State governments will not provide this, we should reduce the amount of money they receive under the Socrates programme and other education programmes."
"In conclusion, I urge all Members to support this and to give more hope for the future of the European Union."
"Mr President, I strongly commend these recommendations and the amendments which the rapporteur has put forward."
"I have not been so directly involved with the discussions on these programmes in Parliament of late but some five years ago I was co-author with Mrs Pack of Parliament's report on the first Socrates programme."
"Everything that has happened since has vindicated the strong support which Parliament gave to this programme."
"Other speakers have referred in glowing terms - and rightly so - to the value of the Erasmus exchanges and the school networking which these programmes provide."
"Not only do these programmes benefit the individual students who participate in them and the schools and colleges of which they are students, but we must also remember that they make a real contribution to awareness and a meaningful understanding of the work of the European Union itself for large numbers of students and their families."
"It makes it real for them."
"I am pleased also to see the inclusion of the applicant countries, together with Malta and Cyprus."
"I was in Malta last week for the joint committee and I can tell you they are very eager that Malta should be fully participating in these programmes."
"The key point is the funding."
"Unless we have adequate funding we cannot ensure that all young people who could benefit from these programmes are able to do so, nor can we avoid the elitism which means that only those able to afford it are able to participate."
"I very much hope we will support this figure of EUR 2.5 billion."
"It sounds a lot of money and Ministers quail at the figure."
"But what is EUR 2.5 billion?"
"It is EUR 1 per European citizen per year of the programme."
"For many people it is less than the cost of a cup of coffee or a newspaper."
"It is less than 5 % of Bill Gates' personal wealth - which is an interesting reflection."
"Perhaps we could ask him for a donation if we cannot find the money any other way."
"Mr President, Socrates is a wonderful idea."
"As a university teacher I can only endorse, year after year, what Doris Pack has described in general terms and has rightly highlighted as positive, as well as what she has rightly criticised."
"The idea is wonderful, but the stumbling block is the funding."
"Only a few weeks ago we had to award grants at my university and I well remember the enthusiasm of the young people who heard that they could now study in Rome, Paris, Trieste, Thessalonica and elsewhere, just as I remember the tears of those who could not do so because of lack of funds."
"I remember, and in fact see it again week after week with great pleasure, how much an Erasmus student can do for his or her place of study abroad during a traditional academic year."
"But as we said, the problem is the money."
"We keep enlarging, and we are right to enlarge towards the Central and Eastern European countries."
"We are deliberately trying to open up new horizons there."
"But - and this is something I have thought about very deeply in recent weeks - when I compare the applications before me now with the typical applications of two or three years ago, I find there is a huge difference, namely that a great many people apply for grants who really do not need them any more, who already have two, three or four study periods behind them."
"In fact, I no longer tend to receive applications or receive fewer and fewer applications from good, young candidates with linguistic knowledge, who are committed, who are prepared to make their contribution but who have not already had one or two previous study opportunities in the course of their curriculum vitae ."
"So I think we must not cut the funding but must jointly do all we can to offer the young people of Europe the kind of opportunities we would all wish them to have."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Pack, and Mr Elchlepp in our group who has helped to prioritise disadvantaged students in the programme."
"As everyone has said, Socrates is a success story."
"Its extension to schools is an incredible success and extraordinarily beneficial."
"I would just like to mention one project: four primary schools, four countries, entitled 'Water in our Culture'."
"The children have learnt that other countries, cultures and languages exist, that we share aspects of our culture and that we must protect the environment."
"They have also learnt how new technology can help them communicate across frontiers - an absolutely fantastic achievement."
"It is the cornerstone of the People's Europe."
"I know that Mrs Cresson joins us and appreciates this point."
"As has been said, EUR 2.5 billion must be found."
"It is a very small price to pay for building empathy and understanding between our children and our young people."
"After all, that is the real basis for long-lasting peace and understanding in Europe."
"Mr President, anyone who is seriously concerned about education and training, about mobility and therefore about giving the young people of Europe greater opportunities on the labour market must also be most concerned about Socrates II."
"Unfortunately the Council and Parliament have not yet managed to reach agreement on the amount of funding."
"Since the duration of Socrates is being extended to seven years, it is only logical to call for EUR 2.5 billion for this programme."
"Socrates must also be evaluated in both qualitative and financial terms by 31 December 2002."
"I support Doris Pack's proposals in every respect and hope they will be taken into account."
"Promoting linguistic knowledge, learning two foreign languages, of which at least one should be the language of a neighbouring country, is a vital means of giving our young people the chance to obtain qualifications, to make use of the single market, to find work and to develop a sense of Europe."
"I also fully support the proposal to change the way grants are awarded to ensure that people do not all automatically receive grants that are barely enough to keep body and soul together."
"Those who need the money should be given adequate grants."
"I hope these points will be accepted and that the Conciliation Committee reaches a satisfactory conclusion before the end of this legislative term."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must warmly thank the House for its unfailing commitment and support which will allow the second reading of the new phase of the Socrates programme to be concluded today, barely two months after the adoption of the common position by the Council."
"In particular I note the political will of Parliament to conclude the negotiations on the new programme as quickly as possible."
"This sends a strong political message to the people of Europe, just before the European elections, about our common desire to advance the construction of a European educational area."
"I must particularly thank Mrs Pack for her excellent report and also her colleagues on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for their constant support."
"I have previously emphasised the very positive attitude taken by the Austrian Presidency, which was strict but sensible in advancing the work within the Council so that the common position could be adopted in December."
"The signals from the German Presidency are also positive and encouraging, and show that a common political will exists to adopt this decision before the new Parliament is elected."
"You will remember that we had an opportunity during the sitting on 5 November to discuss three proposals on the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes."
"As you know, the Council of Ministers for Education of 4 December adopted common positions on the first two programmes, although a consensus was not reached on the Youth for Europe programme for budgetary reasons."
"I could not give the Commission's agreement to the proposal made, which meant that an overall agreement could not be achieved."
"The situation at the time meant that the Commission was unable to give the go-ahead."
"We hope that Parliament will deliver its opinion at second reading on the Leonardo programme before the end of this Parliament so that the final decision can be made under the German Presidency."
"As for the Youth for Europe programme, I hope that the situation will be resolved in the coming weeks so that a common position can be adopted at the Council meeting scheduled for 27 May."
"The Commission has examined your amendments in an open and constructive manner, and I can tell you that it will accept in full or in part 15 out of the 16 amendments tabled."
"These will be included in a revised proposal which will be submitted to the Council in the next few days."
"Many amendments are similar to the Commission's initial and amended proposals and therefore help to improve and even correct certain politically important aspects of the common position."
"If you will allow me, I will mention a few of the more significant examples."
"I must thank you for having accepted the 'European educational area' concept in Amendment No 2, as defined in our proposals."
"The term 'area of cooperation in the field of education and training' requested by the Council has excessively technical and abstract overtones and would be difficult for people to understand."
"On the other hand, 'educational area' sends a strong political message to all the citizens of the Union and clearly indicates to them the direction that the Community is taking in education and training."
"In this respect, I must particularly thank those who insisted on this term, namely Mrs Guinebertière, Mr Hyland and Mrs Hawlicek."
"Turning now to the procedures for selecting projects, I am pleased to note that Parliament agrees with the Commission's aim of increased simplicity, greater transparency and increased ease of use for programme beneficiaries, as indicated by Amendment No 14."
"Parliament's proposal to eliminate one of the Member State consultation stages within the centralised actions would considerably simplify and shorten the project selection procedure."
"I am also pleased that Parliament intends to introduce a revision clause in Article 12, as indicated in Amendment No 8, to allow the Commission to present a report on the results achieved, including on the financial framework, three years after the start of the programme, together with any proposals it deems appropriate."
"As the Council has decided to extend the programme's duration to seven years rather than the five proposed by the Commission, the clause introduced by Parliament will allow the programme to adapt flexibly to any new requirements."
"Obviously I accept Amendment No 12 which aims, when awarding Erasmus grants, to give priority to students whose financial situation requires special assistance."
"On this point I must thank Mr Rack and Mrs Tongue, who stressed the importance of this."
"Particular emphasis must also be placed on an aspect which other speakers have mentioned, which is that it is often students from the most-favoured categories who apply for grants. This is because they are less inhibited, they are used to travelling with their families, they hear discussions at home about events abroad and they are, perhaps, culturally better prepared."
"But the decisions are, after all, taken locally and we can have every confidence that those awarding the grants will distinguish between those who have ability and those who perhaps have greater merit but less ability and for whom the awarding of the grant will be more decisive in their professional and personal development."
"In this context, I would point out that, following Parliament's initiative last autumn, the Commission launched a study on the socio-economic situation of Erasmus students."
"The results of the survey, which covered ten thousand students, will be presented to you in the next few months."
"In addition, for two years now the Commission has been systematically urging universities and national agencies to take account of the financial needs of students when awarding Erasmus grants."
"This is something that I myself have monitored very carefully, and I would like to thank those who have looked into this question."
"I can also accept the principle behind Amendments Nos 10 and 16, which establishes the possibility of initiating pilot projects to allow young unemployed teachers to teach for a time at a school in another Member State."
"All the Member States really need teachers from other countries of the European Union - we have all experienced language teaching in our own countries."
"It is clear that being taught even for a short while by a teacher from a foreign country who can provide a unique view of his or her own culture is very important, particularly for young children."
"Such an initiative would allow young teachers to acquire vital professional experience while helping to give a real European dimension to teaching."
"Several other amendments aim to clarify and reinforce certain aspects of the common position and as such their substance or principles can be accepted."
"This is particularly the case with Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 (second part) and 15 which cover the following aspects, among others: the importance of the European Credit Transfer System; more support for young people undergoing training in the form of language learning projects; clarification of the procedures for the participation of Cyprus; a reduction in the minimum percentages specified by the Council for Actions 2 and 3; the priority to be given to languages less widely used and taught, and, in frontier regions, the languages of neighbouring countries."
"Several speakers were concerned about this last subject, namely Mr Elchlepp, Mr Kerr and Mr Mann."
"I cannot, however, accept Amendment No 6 on the financial article."
"I note Parliament's support for increasing the programme's budget to EUR 2 500 million."
"In its original proposal, in line with the priorities established under Agenda 2000, the Commission specified a financial framework of EUR 1 400 m for a five-year period."
"Applying the same priorities to a seven-year period, as specified in the common position, and taking into account the average growth rate, the Commission would have proposed a figure in the order of EUR 2 151 m."
"However, in order to achieve a common position at first reading, the Commission was forced to adopt the figure of EUR 1 550 m which was approved by a qualified majority."
"I am pleased that the Commission and Parliament agree on increasing the budget in line with our ambitions."
"I hope that after the negotiations the Council will feel able to agree with us and I also hope that we can move forward together during the conciliation procedure."
"Obviously, I will be determinedly on your side in this procedure."
"Finally, I would stress that I believe we are on course to achieve a final decision under the German Presidency which would allow us to prepare for the implementation of the new programme under the best possible conditions."
"Clearly I hope that a satisfactory agreement on the budget can be reached during the negotiations."
"I would like to end by again thanking the Culture Committee and its rapporteur Mrs Pack in particular for their excellent work and their constructive amendments, and also the House as a whole for the support which it has constantly given us."
"I am convinced that this programme will help to build a Europe of knowledge which will send out a strong political message and respond to the needs of the public."
"Thank you, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Tobacco taxes"
"The next item is the report (A4-0021/99) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Directive 92/80/EEC on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes and Directive 95/59/EC on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco (COM(98)0320 - C4-0402/98-98/0189(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1998 the European Commission submitted a report on the structures and rates of excise duty as well as a proposal for the amendment of three different directives on the taxation of manufactured tobacco."
"The report, which provides the basis for the proposed technical amendments and for the changes in the minimum rates of excise duty, examines whether current legislation guarantees the smooth functioning of the single market."
"Two factors are particularly important in this context: firstly the fact that tax fraud and smuggling are rife as a result of the relatively high rates of excise duty on tobacco and tobacco products and because of the wide disparities between the excise rates levied by the various Member States, and secondly the fact that the practical application of the rules governing excise duty has raised a number of problems which call for technical adjustments."
"The current system was introduced in 1993, and today's proposal has its origins in lengthy discussions in connection with the single market which date back to 1995."
"Excise duties on tobacco are a significant source of revenue for the Member States, varying from 0.4 % of GNP to 1.6 % of GNP in Greece, for example."
"The fact that duty is generally suspended when goods subject to excise duty are taken from one Member State to another creates problems with documentation, with the potential for forgery and with other aspects of such operations, and indeed the European finance ministers will scarcely be able to rest easy when they check the findings announced last year by the President of the Court of Auditors, which put revenue shortfall from excise duties at the alarming figure of EUR 75 billion per annum, with particular problems in the areas of value-added tax, excise duties on tobacco and duties on wines and spirits."
"This is an appallingly large revenue shortfall, which certainly calls for direct action on fraud and tax evasion in particular."
"Today, unfortunately, we are not dealing with the fight against tax fraud or even with the harmonisation of measures in that area, but rather with relatively modest adjustments."
"When we talk about tobacco duties, we have to distinguish between the excise duties on cigarettes and those on tobacco products other than cigarettes."
"These other products account for only about 5 % of the total market."
"Cigarettes account for the other 95 %, but as far as they are concerned, this report only deals with technical adjustments to the taxation regime."
"The system for calculating the minimum rates of excise duty is highly complex, and I do not propose to hold forth on that subject here, since only a handful of specialists understand it in any case."
"The substance of the proposal made by the Commission is that rates of excise duty may fall short of the minimum levy, which is 57 % of the retail price, for an adjustment period of up to two years."
"The proposal also provides for a very moderate increase in two stages, the first of which was scheduled for 1 January 1999; as you will be aware, that date has passed without the change having been effected and without Parliament having delivered its opinion. The second stage of the moderate increase is due to take effect on 1 January 2001."
"These amendments were supported by a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, with the tax increases only securing a narrow majority, and the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has now tabled new amendments which would upset the existing balance."
"If we were to accept these amendments, the minimum excise duty on loose tobacco for those who hand-roll their own cigarettes would rise drastically, which would make sudden 30 % price increases inevitable."
"We were opposed to this, and I ask the House to reject these amendments proposed by the Liberal Group, since they relate to a specifically Dutch problem and have nothing to do with young people's smoking habits."
"It is a fallacy that those who have just taken up smoking are most likely to roll their own cigarettes."
"On the contrary, the main purchasers of loose tobacco come from a particular age group and a particular income bracket and are established smokers."
"Young people go for lighter cigarettes."
"But we have also asked the Commission to present an interim report by 30 June 2000 on the subject of public health and in particular on the problem of tax fraud, and I should like to underline that point."
"Another reason why the interim report is necessary is that nothing has been happening in this sector."
"I should like to express my thanks for our past consultations, and I hope that the great majority of the House will approve the report as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Agriculture Committee, I would like to congratulate Werner Langen on the excellent work he has done, on the balance he has demonstrated, and on the common sense he has displayed in presenting an amendment requiring excise duties to be examined every four years instead of every five years."
"We welcome his committee's proposal."
"But, my goodness, here we are talking about tobacco taxes when a large proportion of these taxes are not even collected in the European Union."
"The truth is that, like alcohol, tobacco has an irresistible attraction for organised crime."
"And anyone who was present at the Committee of Inquiry on Community transit, anyone who regularly reads UCLAF reports or anyone who keeps abreast of current affairs in my own country, where 70 containers of tobacco disappeared just the other day, with the Portuguese Government claiming 14 billion escudos in compensation from a transport company, will know just how many millions escape the Community's financial checks."
"And this often happens with the connivance of the Member States and also of certain European institutions, as funding for scanners for border checks and for physical checks at ports is often not granted."
"Nevertheless, I think we should be talking about taxes."
"But it would also be advisable for the Commission to think about how it checks the payments due to it and how it could force defaulters to pay up."
"Another omission I identified in the Commission document was the lack of a programme to educate young people about tobacco."
"They are the smokers of the future."
"Madam President, the European Commission is very modest when it comes to the approximation of taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products."
"It gives the Member States more flexibility in applying the minimum rate of 57 % of the retail price."
"As a result, this percentage can actually fall below 57 % for a time."
"Whilst this is presented as a technical measure, we shall have to make sure that it does not distort competition."
"In addition to this flexibility, the Commission is proposing to adapt the specific duties on tobacco products to inflation in two stages."
"Given that actual duties are already higher everywhere than the minimum levels, this is primarily a cosmetic proposal."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, it was the view of the largest possible minority that the European Commission should have done more."
"Mr Langen made reference to this just now."
"We think that there should be an end to the preferential treatment given to shag and hand-rolling tobacco, which currently attracts a far lower rate of tax than cigarettes, with which it is in competition."
"There are, amongst others, three amendments tabled by the Liberal Group, Nos 6, 7 and 8, which my group supported and will support again."
"If there is any reason to tax hand-rolling tobacco or shag differently from cigarettes, then the tax should in fact be higher, because shag is generally more harmful than cigarettes."
"The lower tax on shag constitutes a price incentive which steers smokers towards the very product which is most harmful."
"That misguided incentive has to end."
"This does not in any way mean that the hand-rolling tobacco industry has to come to an end, but simply that it has to lose its fiscally advantaged status."
"In this respect, Amendment No 7 by the Liberal Group is less radical, since it raises the percentage of the price to the consumer accounted for by tax from 30 to 45 %."
"You have to compare that with the 57 % for cigarettes."
"The strangest of arguments are heard in the debate on equal tax treatment for cigarettes and shag."
"Not only should hand-rolling tobacco continue to enjoy a tax advantage because that is good for jobs in the small business sector, but shag is supposedly the poor man's cigarette, since the poor man cannot afford real cigarettes."
"But if you put a high rate of tax on tobacco products to dissuade people from consuming a product which harms their health, and all Member States do that, you cannot tax the most harmful tobacco products at a lower rate."
"If smoking is harmful to health, it is also harmful to the health of the poorest people."
"My group's view is that there is no place here for cynical derogations."
"Cynical is exactly the word to describe those who favour the present system."
"So the Commission proposal and the Langen report do not go far enough."
"I very much hope that the Commission will shortly come up with a more radical reform of the taxation of tobacco products."
"If my group has anything to do with it, Parliament will make a start on that tomorrow."
"Mr President, when we talk about tobacco products, we cannot overemphasise how much damage they cause to people's health, not just active smokers but also those who are passively exposed to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke against their will."
"Because of this, we need to give the protection of public health special attention, imposing taxes on tobacco products at national level and introducing legislation on tobacco at Union level."
"Revenue from tobacco products will in future have to be increasingly steered in the direction of preventive public health measures."
"Tobacco is not just a national or regional problem, but very much a global one."
"For example, the activities of American tobacco companies in Asia, where there is still no ban on tobacco advertising or legislation to protect public health, are positively scandalous."
"For example, there have been threats to move big sports events to countries where the interests of tobacco companies are viewed more sympathetically."
"The proposed directive now being discussed mainly contains technical amendments to Community legislation on taxation of tobacco products."
"In addition to the technical amendments, we also need to solve surveillance problems connected with the transportation of cigarettes."
"Organised criminal gangs smuggle cargoes of cigarettes to avoid paying duty, yet some Member States are against the introduction of effective surveillance systems."
"In my opinion, sanctions should be imposed on Member States in future if they fail to adopt modern and effective surveillance systems without delay within the framework of the taxation system that has now been proposed."
"Mr President, I can only agree with what Mrs Matikainen-Kallström said in her excellent speech and with her views on tobacco, which I entirely share."
"Tobacco and smoking cause harm."
"We must do everything we can to make poor wretches like me who smoke stop, and to discourage young people from smoking in the first place."
"Naturally, the Greens would like the tax on tobacco, or rather the price of tobacco, to be as high as possible."
"However, the internal market makes that rather difficult."
"In Sweden, for example, tobacco prices are among the highest in the EU; a packet of tobacco in Sweden costs an arm and a leg."
"However, our overall tax is among the lowest in Europe."
"Consequently, Sweden does not currently comply with the minimum tax rate in the directive of 57 %."
"It is therefore essential for the Commission to review the problem of taxation, so as to allow individual countries to impose higher taxes."
"Sweden, after raising the tax on tobacco two years ago, was then forced to lower it again because of a dramatic increase in smuggling and tax evasion, which compelled us to lower prices again."
"This should not happen, but we must have higher taxes on tobacco in order to force us to smoke less."
"Mr President, I do not intend to comment on Werner Langen's report, although I do congratulate him on it. I just want to express my regret that the Commission has not taken this opportunity to switch to an ad valorem tax on tobacco instead of the present system, which is largely specific."
"As I said here back in 1992, at the time the first regulations were adopted, this means that some types of tobacco bear a heavier burden than others, resulting in a distortion of competition. In this particular case, this distortion works in favour of American tobacco, which is more expensive, so that specific taxation amounts to a smaller fiscal burden, thus disadvantaging European tobaccos, which are generally cheaper and therefore more heavily taxed in percentage terms."
"The heavier tax burden on these cheaper European tobaccos amounts to a regressive form of taxation, as they represent a larger proportion of goods bought by people on lower incomes."
"It could be argued that this is conducive to the socially desirable objective of reducing total tobacco consumption, given that there are more poor smokers than rich ones."
"However, given that we should be equally concerned about the health of the poor and of the rich, it would be hard to justify a policy that benefited the health of the poor at the expensive of the rich."
"I cannot imagine what political philosophy could be used to justify this distinction."
"We cannot understand, and this is the point of my speech, why the Commission has not taken this opportunity to adopt a purely ad valorem form of taxation. It cannot say that it is a question of administrative convenience, given that there are precedents for this kind of taxation and given that it is extremely easy to levy taxes of this kind on a very limited number of well-organised producers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to ask the Commission why tobacco growing is still being supported to the tune of one billion euros, and in particular why lower-quality tobacco is supported rather than the high-quality varieties which are less damaging to health."
"And now moves are afoot, in the form of Amendments Nos 2, 5 and 6, to make marketing even more difficult by adding 30 % to prices, which would further increase the incentive to engage in smuggling and line the pockets of those responsible for transit fraud."
"I also believe that arbitrary censorship of tobacco advertising is a disaster in terms of health policy."
"What we need in tobacco advertising is rational, explanatory, quality-orientated information."
"If a blanket ban is imposed on advertising, there will be no means of advising consumers on their best course of action."
"I believe it quite simply represents a lost opportunity to educate smokers in the use of better-quality tobacco as a health protection measure."
"This arbitrary censorship scheme simply must be scrapped."
"We must be given the opportunity to advertise in a way that focuses on health, and in a way that can prevent young people from taking up smoking at an excessively early age."
"Perhaps the focus should be on sheer enjoyment and on moderation, to combat chain-smoking, and if some people smoke the odd cigarette for enjoyment, they should not be immediately subjected to social sanctions."
"Tobacco is a legal product, a highly taxed product, and I believe it is inappropriate to ban the advertising of such a product."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Langen for his report and for the conclusions that he has drawn."
"In general, Mr Langen recognises the need to make some technical adjustments to Community legislation on the taxation of tobacco products."
"These changes were seen to be essential during the last review of the rates and structures of excise duty on tobacco products, in order for the provisions to be interpreted and applied in a more uniform manner in the Member States, and also in order that they may be easier to implement, so that the single market can function correctly."
"Having consulted national governments, firms and interest groups, the Commission did not feel it was appropriate to carry out a fundamental review of the existing structure, and in particular of the minimum rates applied to tobacco products."
"With regard to the amendments proposed by Mr Langen concerning the extension of the period of review of the rates and structures, the Commission can accept a period of four years instead of the five years envisaged in its draft proposal."
"The report will take into account the proper functioning of the single market, the real value of the rates of duty and the wider objectives of the Treaty."
"With regard to the amendments proposed, in order to include the recitals on fraud, health and the links between these elements and the price of manufactured tobacco, allow me to say that I do not see the need for such an approach in the directives covered by Article 99 of the Treaty."
"The directives are limited to establishing a minimum level of taxation for the products in question, while leaving the governments of the Member States to fix the rates at national level, as long as the minimum levels established in Directives 92/79/EEC and 92/80/EEC are respected."
"Subject to this provision, it is therefore to a large extent up to the Member States to decide on the level of taxation that they apply and to take into consideration factors such as health and fraud."
"As the assessment carried out in order to draw up the report on manufactured tobacco products did not reveal any justification for progressively aligning taxes on hand-rolling tobacco with the existing taxes on cigarettes, the amendments concerning an increase in rates for hand-rolling tobacco are unacceptable to the Commission."
"The hand-rolling tobacco industry is less automated than the cigarette industry and therefore needs a more concentrated work-force."
"In order to safeguard their livelihood and also to safeguard employment, the lower rate for hand-rolling tobacco was deemed necessary."
"Once again, there is nothing to prevent Member States from fixing high national rates for this product if they consider this to be necessary for health reasons."
"Madam President, I refer specifically to Commissioner Cresson's closing remarks to the effect that, even before the amendments on a small increase in the rate of tax on shag and hand-rolling tobacco are adopted, she could not accept this because it would be so bad for jobs."
"She then ended by saying that tax on tobacco and tobacco products was so important for health. I really cannot follow that at all."
"She made reference to research carried out by Member States and professional organisations."
"I should like to hear from her what the interest groups to which she refers - for example health bodies and consumer organisations - have to say on this subject."
"Mr President, may I ask the Commission a question?"
"If what Mr Metten has said is correct, it would have to be an amendment that affects cigarettes, because 99 % of the market is unaffected by the proposals that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has tabled."
"They only affect one per cent, which is precisely the share of the market that is still in the hands of small and medium-sized businesses."
"The cigarette industry is highly concentrated."
"Can you confirm, Commissioner, that the plans to increase tobacco duty which Mr Metten is advocating here would only affect small and medium-sized businesses, which account for one per cent of total turnover, and that Mr Metten's health-based arguments are therefore unfounded?"
"I can only confirm what I said earlier: that it does not seem that these products, namely hand-rolling tobacco, are directly in competition with cigarettes."
"Moreover, as I have already said, the hand-rolling tobacco industry needs a much greater workforce, even though this product's share of the market is not very great, and it directly affects jobs."
"We therefore considered that it was necessary to safeguard employment and the existence of this industry through the lowest level of taxation for hand-rolling tobacco."
"Once again, there is nothing to prevent Member States, if they decide otherwise, from establishing national rates which could vary according to their assessment of the effect on public health."
"Thank you, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Regionalisation of common fisheries policy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0018/99) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on regionalisation of the common fisheries policy."
"Mr President, in tabling this report on regionalisation which is an own-initiative report from the Committee on Fisheries, let me immediately pay tribute to our former colleague Allan Macartney whose strong sense of European identity pervades this entire document."
"His outstanding contribution to the Committee on Fisheries strengthened and safeguarded the European fishing industry whose interests he stoutly defended during his lifetime."
"His presence, needless to say, is sorely missed in this House."
"But he will not be forgotten."
"His commitment to the European ideal lives on in this report to Parliament."
"There are many calls for and conflicting interpretations of regionalisation and its relevance to the common fisheries policy."
"This state of affairs arises from the belief among many fishermen that there is a lack of cohesion in the regional application of the common fisheries policy and Community institutions."
"It has been my consistent opinion that unless greater efforts are made to involve fishermen's organisations in the decision-making process the best efforts of Community legislators will fail."
"Consequently, this report draws attention to the potential for an already emergent regionalisation policy within a European context."
"In doing so it must be recognised that although renationalisation of fishing areas adjacent to EU countries is not an option, there is still an overriding obligation on Community institutions to safeguard the future of fisheries-dependent communities."
"Long-term survival of such communities will depend not just on a legal recognition of their legitimate historical rights safeguarded by the principle of relative stability and the six- to twelve-mile limits but also on a commitment by Parliament to ensure that future European policy reflects the need to facilitate their participation as stakeholders."
"The aim of this report is therefore not to discuss whether this regionalisation should be implemented but rather to explore how it can be widened, developed and institutionalised."
"No one should take the view that this report is to introduce regionalisation immediately."
"It is an opportunity to debate the issues and to explore how it can all be developed."
"The current common fisheries policy already includes large elements of regional variation and localised cooperation which could be explored more effectively in respect of stock conservation."
"Examples include the introduction of square mesh legislation."
"This is now part of my own country's legislation as a direct consequence of initatives by fishermen acting as responsible stakeholders."
"Other regional examples exist within the Community, such as the French local, regional and national committee systems, illustrating that developed regional management units, involving the industry and the decision-making process, can lead to a more rational, workable and realistic management system than presently exists."
"It is a wonder that, whilst large sums of European taxpayers' money are spent on largely irrelevant, theoretical, scientific and management studies, no effort is made by either Community scientists or legislators to study fully functional democratic management systems that already exist in the Community."
"In tandem with this report I would hope that Parliament would support my call for studies on existing regional management systems as a matter of priority, with a view to implementing them on a wider scale within Community regions."
"I refer to the amendments tabled by my colleagues, many of which I can support, and I personally endorse the amendments to extend the limits to 24 miles."
"In conclusion, while I would wish to draw your attention to the socio-economic implications if we fail to develop a cohesive regionalisation policy in Community fisheries in the very near future, I firmly believe that this report offers a ray of hope for a new departure within the common fisheries policy which will be acceptable to most, if not all, fishermen."
"I ask the House for its support by voting in favour of this report."
"Mr President, this report is the fruit of a good deal of work by the Committee on Fisheries and follows on from a number of its previous proposals to the House: the reform of the common fisheries policy, the regulations, the own-initiative report on international agreements and the discussion to be held within the next few months on the structural regulations, the FIFG and the Structural Funds."
"All of this will be better organised and implemented if the principle of subsidiarity is paramount, if bureaucratic structures and superstructures are eliminated, and if fishermen can be involved in managing the CFP; after all, this is the very essence of regionalisation."
"When referring to regionalisation, we are thinking of an aspect of the common fisheries policy which exists already."
"We are not of course thinking of a breach of Community solidarity; on the contrary, the involvement of local policies and active subsidiarity allowing for a local presence will make the reform of the CFP more successful."
"In this way, it will also be possible to take up useful innovations and to achieve a balance between fisheries and the environment, which is important for the preservation of Community resources, as well as providing worthwhile opportunities for fishing activities aimed at maintaining a balanced environment, such as small-scale fisheries and the creation of new jobs - which the fisheries sector is of course still in a position to offer, in a Europe where unemployment is so widespread."
"There is work not only for fishermen but also for other guardians of the sea, for example in aquaculture and handicrafts linked to the marine environment."
"In the Socialist Group's opinion, it makes sense to call for territorial waters to be extended to 24 miles; this request takes account of the ability to manage marine activities and resources in the coastal zone, and could maximise the involvement of associations."
"The common fisheries policy must take account of the various players operating in the sector."
"Here we insist, for example, that other players should be brought into the Advisory Committee, without however weakening the participation of certain important parties: the members of the Advisory Committee should comprise not only shipowners and - quite rightly - NGOs and consumers, but also a strong trade union contingent."
"This is our blueprint for the future, and in this way we shall make a contribution to the future of fisheries."
"Mr President, it is nice to see the Commissioner here with us tonight as this is a debate the European Parliament can be proud of."
"The report we are discussing follows logically on from the Fraga report which we discussed in November."
"The common fisheries policy was devised in 1973 and enacted in 1983, and it was believed at that time that we were setting up a policy for the long-term future."
"With hindsight we can recognise that a number of mistakes were made and the common fisheries policy is highly over-bureaucratised."
"It has failed to protect fish stocks."
"It has failed to sustain viable fishing communities around the coast."
"Many of the rules are arbitrary and unfair and abuse is rife."
"The Gallagher report is therefore a great opportunity for this Parliament."
"As the rapporteur said, it follows on from the basis set out by Mr Macartney."
"I agree with his sentiments that Mr Macartney's loss was a tragedy."
"The alternatives are quite clearly set out in the Gallagher report."
"In my own view we need to reinforce the localisation of the common fisheries policy."
"We need to make the local communities around the coasts of Europe feel part of the common fisheries policy, a policy which they currently reject."
"Therefore we have a huge opportunity to get the fishermen involved."
"We must recognise the fact that the local communities have to be assisted."
"They must be given the opportunity to look after, to harvest and also to husband the local fish resources."
"It is essential therefore to extend the 12-mile limit to 24 miles, to make that economic zone an area within which they can earn a living."
"It is the local fishermen one needs to look after."
"The 24-mile area is the one in which they work."
"If we deny them the opportunity of harvesting their own local resource they are not going to feel fully involved in the common fisheries policy."
"If they are involved they will police it and will make sure that the long-term management is in place for future generations."
"Anybody who really believes in conservation of fish stocks has to be involved in encouraging regionalisation and ensuring that the local fishermen are part of the common fisheries policy and operate it under Community rules."
"Mr President, regionalisation can mean different things to different people."
"As the report correctly says, to some it means renationalisation."
"It can also mean devolution of some aspects of decision-making to sub-national areas or managing on the basis of large bodies of water such as the North Sea or parts of the Mediterranean."
"There are many different meanings."
"While some sort of devolution may in some cases be acceptable or desirable, it must be remembered that fish swim around so management of fisheries must be achieved at an appropriate level."
"The same level of management authority is not necessarily appropriate for all stocks in a region."
"For instance, the difficulties in managing highly migratory species such as tuna are completely different from those for harvesting seaweed or some species of shellfish."
"The problem with the Gallagher report is that it does not address these points and simply argues the case for regionalisation."
"It never defines what is meant by the term or gives any guidelines about what should be regionalised or how."
"It simply states that there is a need for comprehensive regionalisation of the common fisheries policy."
"Without a clearer definition of what is meant by this, the Green Group cannot support the report."
"Mr President, I rise with mixed emotions today."
"Allan Macartney was my dear colleague and I am glad that his work is here before us."
"I am grateful to Mr Gallagher for carrying it on so ably and to the Committee on Fisheries."
"I am happy that Allan was succeeded by his own close friend and election agent, Ian Hudghton, who will be speaking later."
"I am passionate about this subject as my constituency has many fishing-dependent communities, including 90 inhabited islands, some of them going almost up to the Arctic Circle."
"Some of these communities are very fragile and totally dependent on the fishing industry."
"I have shared with them their despairs and their hopes, their tragedies and their disenchantment with this policy."
"I have been to sea many times both in calm weather and in gales."
"One thing I notice is that fishermen have great rapport with fishermen from other parts of the Community and, in fact, of the world."
"Perhaps if fishermen got together and made policy we would not have so many problems."
"There would certainly be more fairness and less bureaucracy than hitherto."
"We have to be able to offer a future to all our fishermen."
"They have to believe they have a future."
"Many of them do not have that belief at the present time."
"Mr Gallagher has offered a ray of hope."
"Amendment No 4 by Mr Provan is very dangerous, as was an answer he gave in a press conference today."
"Although the regulation comes to an end, the policy does not."
"We have agreed that the principle of relative stability continues."
"Any reference to expiry of the common fisheries policy without the addendum is very dangerous."
"Ms McKenna talked about fish being different because they do not stay put like animals in a farmer's field."
"This is recognised."
"The CFP was a derogation in itself from the Treaty of Rome."
"The aims were great."
"There was to be fairness, maintenance of dependent areas, a traditional way of life, stabilised markets, reasonable prices, relations organised within the Community and with third countries."
"It was wonderful."
"Unfortunately, the reality has fallen short."
"We have neither been able to protect the fishermen, nor the stocks."
"That is why I think regionalisation is necessary and I have given examples in Amendment No 24."
"We are already on the road to regionalisation."
"There are many examples."
"I will not read them out but you should all look at Amendment No 24 where you will see positive examples."
"Discard problems, for example, vary from country to country."
"If you think of the square mesh which could solve the problem of conservation in many areas, you will see that we are already on the road to a regionalisation policy."
"I would question Mr Novo's amendments."
"He talks about decentralisation as if it is the same thing."
"I would suggest that regionalisation could affect a whole region involving several states."
"Ms McKenna mentioned that."
"It could be the whole North Sea or the whole Mediterranean."
"Decentralisation suggests a relationship with one Member State only."
"So, although I admire Mr Novo's work and commitment, I have to say that I will not be supporting his amendments."
"I support Mr Teverson's amendments and, obviously, I support my own."
"I am grateful to Commissioner Bonino who has shown enormous calibre as a very hard-working, clever Commissioner for Fisheries, and to the Commission, which has arranged numerous places where there will be forums for everyone to get involved."
"But I go further."
"I go with Pat the Cope in wanting direct involvement of the fishermen and I support the regional management committees."
"Mr President, I would like to inform Mrs Ewing that we have withdrawn Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5."
"These may be in the form of regulatory measures specific to particular sea areas, or conservation measures particular to certain fishing regions, ICES areas or sub-areas. There are also restrictions affecting particular species and specific fishing grounds, involving various restrictions with regard to access to the waters or the halting of fishing during certain periods, varied regional regulatory measures decided by the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity, and urgent measures on conservation of resources taken on the initiative of the Commission."
"The fundamental issue is of course to know what exactly we mean by 'regionalisation of the CFP'."
"If by 'regionalisation' we mean 'decentralisation', that is with global decisions being centralised at national level by each Member State, particularly in planning and fleet management, and the delocalised application of those decisions, we are of course in favour of a certain degree of regionalisation of the CFP."
"If, on the other hand, by 'regionalisation' we mean a transfer of decisions from national level to the administrative regions, we are opposed to it."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be correctly applied."
"Although the Commission's task is to define general objectives, it should in no way lay down the decisions through which those objectives should be achieved."
"It is at national level that coherence should be defined for land management, coastal management and maintaining a balance between the various types of fishing - inshore fishing, high-sea fishing, deep-sea fishing - and, moreover, the regions have no desire to take the place of the national authorities on this matter."
"Boats from home ports in different administrative regions may in fact fish in the same areas."
"In this case, if different or even contradictory decisions were taken by different regional authorities, that could have damaging effects by causing the relocation of fishing boats or reducing the level of monitoring."
"It is therefore essential, given that the territorial administrative region and the regional fishing area often do not coincide, to establish a clear system that is coordinated by the national authorities."
"The regional authorities, meanwhile, are in a better position to implement, in a decentralised manner, both structural measures and measures linked to the marketing of fishery products."
"As a result, our group will vote in favour of the amendments which aim to encourage the development of a decentralised policy rather than an actual regionalisation of the CFP."
"We will reject all of the amendments and articles of the resolution which seek to transfer decisions which should remain at national level to the administrative regions, and we also reject the amendments which seek to alter the six and twelve mile zones."
"We know the position of certain Member States on the Boxes, but we do not think that this resolution should aim to alter the regulatory bases of the CFP."
"It can only deal with the functioning and organisation of the CFP."
"Our group will closely follow the development of the vote and will vote in favour of the resolution if national prerogatives with regard to decisions on the implementation of the CFP are preserved."
"Under no circumstances do we want the development of the application of the CFP to lead to the role of regional administrations being strengthened to the detriment of the role of national administrations."
"However, we believe that the elements of regionalisation in the current CFP, which I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, should be applied further, in order to respond in the best way, and in line with real needs, to the different characteristics, both in terms of fishery resources and in structural terms, of the various areas of production which constitute the fishing zones."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher on his work and to take my turn in recalling the memory of our former colleague Mr Macartney, who initiated this report on the regionalisation of the CFP."
"Mr President, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of other Members of the House about the colleague of the lady from Scotland who has just spoken."
"She knows how I feel about this matter personally."
"I am glad that Mr Macartney's influence in the committee lives on tonight and that we can help to achieve his goals."
"I would remind this House that early in the 1990s the Commission initiated a report on Northern Ireland fisheries."
"It found that in the three large harbours which carry on the fishing endeavour - and I refer to Kilkeel, Ardglass and Portavogie - all the fishing is carried on within a family system."
"The percentage of people outside the families who work in the industry is very small indeed."
"So the life of these communities rests in a proper appraisal of their needs and their voice needs to be heard."
"That is why I like this report."
"It believes that fishermen's support for fisheries regulations will improve by involving the local fishery organisations in the decision-making process."
"What is wrong with that?"
"That is what we need."
"We need the contribution of these people whose livelihoods are at stake."
"The fishermen will not find a regime legitimate unless they are able to make a contribution and their voice is heard."
"This whole programme can be made more acceptable if this happens."
"Northern Ireland is an Objective 1 area but this will possibly come to an end."
"What will happen to the system today that is geared into decommissioning fishing boats when we no longer receive Objective 1 funds?"
"Will we see to it that these little communities - and they are tiny compared with the big fishing industries of the rest of the Community but vital to us all - are safeguarded?"
"Those are the matters which really concern the fishermen of Northern Ireland."
"Mr President, in the past fishermen themselves could run fisheries, but technical possibilities have changed the fishing industry."
"It is not only regional or coast-based; it is that too, but not only that."
"I am in broad agreement with the rapporteur, in that we must be sure not to lapse into romanticism, because fishing has changed and that is what we should be addressing."
"We cannot turn back the clock and dwell on the good old days."
"I would therefore also like to comment on the 24 nautical miles question."
"Mrs McKenna mentioned that fish swim around; they may spawn in one area and be caught in another."
"If we start to be restrictive towards one another, we do not have a common fisheries policy, because what is the use of fish spawning in our area if we are not allowed to catch them ourselves?"
"Some cooperation and exchange of quotas are therefore necessary."
"I am also a little sceptical about what Mr Souchet said regarding the national level."
"We could talk instead about regional cooperation between several countries."
"We have really good experience of that in the Baltic."
"As regards over-bureaucratisation, which was mentioned earlier, we must aim for self-management and taking influence on our own situation."
"When people have responsibility, they can help in bringing their own situation under control, and that works against bureaucracy."
"We have reasonable cooperation in most places."
"In this connection I must not forget to thank Allan, with whom I worked in the North Sea Commission, precisely on these matters."
"Even though we have good rules, national exemptions may mean that a 100-tonne trawler with a rating of 1000 hp can suddenly turn up, roll out a net the size of a football pitch and simply clean out a sea."
"When there are two such trawlers in the Baltic, it hardly matters whether or not we have self-management and regionalisation."
"Two trawlers based in the North Sea can make life difficult for 50 small fishermen."
"Regionalisation therefore means self-management, responsibility and active participation."
"That demands something from us in the European Parliament, but at national level too."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Gallagher for taking over this report from Mr Macartney and for doing an excellent job in maintaining the concern and knowledge which Mr Macartney brought to the subject and his particular feeling for the industry and the people engaged in it."
"Mr Gallagher has the same qualifications as he comes from the same sort of region and has the same sort of experience of the fishing industry."
"We have to recognise that there is a repair job to be done so far as the common fisheries policy is concerned."
"When European farmers demonstrate in the streets about the common agricultural policy, it is not because they are against the policy but because they fear that they may be deprived of it."
"But fishermen, generally speaking, do not appreciate what we and the Commissioner have been trying to do on their behalf."
"We have to recognise that there is a sort of mutual misunderstanding in fishing ports throughout the European Union."
"Everybody believes that everybody else has a better deal."
"Therefore, it is important to break new ground, to offer fishermen the hope of greater participation than they had in the past."
"If we cannot achieve that we will not bring it home to them that the fight is about their livelihood."
"The fight is about preserving the resources they have and protecting the regions they live in."
"That is not always clear to them."
"I spent Sunday evening in Donegal."
"I met a lot of fishermen and generally speaking they were very unhappy people. If it was not the weather, it was quotas or bad prices."
"There are so many problems that they feel it is out of their hands."
"This proposal by Mr Gallagher is to reinvolve them."
"By no means do we want to tell fishermen that we are offering them anything like a renationalisation or that we are removing the common fisheries policy."
"What we want to do is get the regions and the communities involved in the design of the policy and updating on a regular basis."
"I welcome this report and I look forward to the discussion that will follow and the eventual policy we can redesign around those proposals."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gallagher and other speakers for their generous tributes to my predecessor, the late Dr Allan Macartney."
"He initially drafted this report to contribute to the current Europe-wide assessment of the achievements and failures of the CFP."
"In September last year Mr Gallagher kindly agreed to take over responsibility for this report and I should like to put on record my appreciation of his efforts in steering it through the committee."
"The original draft was based on the premise that the common fisheries policy is, and from its inception has been, partially regionalised."
"The draft looked at how more local involvement in resource management and conservation measures might best be achieved and called for the existing regionalisation to be consolidated and expanded through the creation of regional management units."
"Like Allan Macartney, I firmly believe that bringing the decision-making process closer to those who are most affected by the CFP and are responsible for its implementation would lead to more respect for the provisions of the CFP and for a more successful policy per se ."
"I would therefore like to call for greater involvement of fishermen and the fishing industry as a whole as an essential prerequisite to the success of the CFP."
"Complementary to involving the fishing industry in the decision-making process is the need to heed the concerns of the fishing industry as a whole under the banner of regionalisation."
"The causal link between the fish caught in a given region and the industry it supports within that region can be easily undermined."
"This was brought home to me last week when I met with fish processors based in my constituency."
"They expressed concern that fish caught in that region are not always landed there."
"Therefore, essential jobs in the processing industries in what are clearly fisheries-dependent areas are put at risk."
"Consequently, I should like to stress the importance of Article 12 of the resolution."
"The time has come to consolidate what de facto exists and to expand the principle of regionalisation of the CFP to all Community waters."
"This step is necessary if we are genuinely to involve fishermen in the decisions which affect them and offers the only clear and practical means of recognising the unique variables that exist in the fisheries sector."
"I am in no doubt that regionalisation would further the primary goal of conserving fish stocks through sustainable fishing so vital for the fisheries-dependent communities of Europe."
"At the committee stage Mrs Ewing and I successfully tabled a number of amendments to ensure that the fundamental principles of the CFP such as relative stability are not undermined."
"My group has now tabled amendments which complement the consistent regionalisation of the CFP and ultimately will help to secure a successful future for the policy."
"Regionalisation already exists, albeit in an ad hoc and inconsistent manner."
"These amendments address that anomaly and stress the importance of involving the fishing industry within the Advisory Committee on Fisheries."
"I would urge the House to support these amendments and the report as a whole."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Gallagher's report."
"It highlights two possible approaches in the reform of the CFP after 2002: an intra-state approach, devolving responsibility to regions within Member States; and an inter-state approach where Community waters are divided into regions with a devolved management structure."
"About a year ago the Commission sent out a questionnaire to all Member States and organisations throughout Europe, to people in the industry, consumers, processors and others."
"The Commission held hearings in various locations throughout Europe."
"A summary of the findings revealed that most expressed the great desire for decentralisation and regionalisation."
"So this is what the fishing industry throughout the European Union wants."
"It is my belief that the principle of decentralisation and regionalisation, coupled with relative stability, must form the cornerstone of any future reform of the CFP."
"The concept of relative stability was enshrined in the 1983 agreement and strengthened by the extension of the coastal bans to 12 miles."
"Indeed, I support Mr Provan's amendment to extend the coastal bans further."
"It is important that communities such as North-East Scotland, the Western Isles, Donegal, Cornwall, Galicia and Brittany are protected from the over-exploitation of fish stocks."
"It is important, therefore, that the European Union sets down various principles with regard to exploitation and conservation."
"There must be a stronger commitment within that policy of devolving fisheries policy."
"Regionalisation of the CFP will encourage the active involvement of fishermen in decision-making as well as the participation of producers' organisations at local level."
"In conclusion, I support Mr Gallagher's call for regionalisation of the European fisheries policy which is necessary if we are to remedy the current deficiencies of the CFP."
"Any reform, however, must retain the principle of relative stability which will best serve the interests of fishermen and the marine environment alike."
"Mr President, in the context of the necessary evolution of the common fisheries policy, changes should never be rejected outright simply out of fear of the unknown."
"I believe it is true to say therefore that changes leading to the sector becoming more actively involved in decision-making and to better implementation of the principle of subsidiarity are fully supported by Parliament."
"However, such features are not yet defining characteristics of the common fisheries policy though we would like them to be."
"Bearing all this in mind, the imposition of a system of regionalisation as proposed in the report - through the creation of regional management units whose composition and responsibilities are not specified - does appear to be a leap in the dark. It is bound to hinder the process of bringing the common fisheries policy closer to those most directly affected by it, given the lack of a consensus and of the consideration needed before taking such a significant step."
"Before even beginning to consider the form regionalisation could take, we should establish channels of communication with the sector and set in motion a decentralisation process reaching down to regional level. Many Member States do not even have the appropriate instruments for doing so, as many national governments have not devolved the administration of fisheries to the regions."
"Indeed, according to the replies to the questionnaires sent out by the Commission concerning the review of the common fisheries policy, the sector itself does not support the need for regionalisation, the only exception being the United Kingdom."
"Similarly, the request to extend territorial waters to 24 miles is also supported only by a minority."
"Any decision of this nature would involve significant changes in the status of the fleets and ought to be considered in the wider context of the review of the common fisheries policy. Indeed, even the details of this are unclear, as the figures of 24, 35 and 50 miles are all quoted when the review of the common fisheries policy is discussed."
"I am therefore opposed to Amendments Nos 6 and 20."
"Furthermore, the experts who looked at regionalisation on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries have stated that regionalisation would involve substantial changes to the principle of relative stability. Yet many Members who support such regionalisation are opposed to the modification of this principle, and I would be grateful if they could explain this to me."
"In addition, it would be necessary to redefine the balance between coastal and industrial fleets. This would call for a system of compensation."
"I am sure I have said enough to make it clear that in its present form the proposal for regionalisation is far from being a practical solution. Much more work and thought are called for if the idea is not to be stillborn."
"It only remains for me to thank Mr Gallagher for his work and to thank all Members present today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating our colleague Mr Gallagher, the rapporteur, whose meticulous work is well known to all those in the Committee on Fisheries."
"I offer him special congratulations on this report, despite disagreeing with it myself. Although he was not originally the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher was called upon to take charge of this report."
"In this context, it is appropriate to pay tribute again to the memory of our colleague Allan Macartney."
"It is becoming abundantly clear in this debate that the term 'regionalisation' does not have a clear meaning."
"What does regionalisation involve?"
"I think we should reach a consensus on what we understand by regionalisation of the common fisheries policy before discussing it."
"The terms 'regions' and 'regionalisation' have widely differing meanings in the 15 Member States, and carrying these differences through into an area like fisheries and the common fisheries policy means that, in my opinion, the report lacks clarity. I would even go so far as to say that it is contradictory and that it sheds very little light on fisheries and on the future common fisheries policy, where light is sorely needed."
"A process of decentralisation which involves greater participation and transparency has to be welcomed. It must, however, be carried out within the global framework of a common policy which respects the principles of equality and nondiscrimination and which is compatible with the fundamental principles of freedom of movement within the single market enshrined in the Treaty."
"The needs of fishing-dependent communities should not be confused with covert renationalisation through regionalisation. Such a move would represent an attack on the global nature of a common policy."
"Participation in Community decision-making certainly ought to be improved. However, this should not be at the cost of fragmenting the CFP with regional decisions, thus increasing bureaucracy and weakening the guarantees of impartiality in the decision-making process."
"Any review of the common fisheries policy must allow this sector to finally become part of the Community's economy and should naturally take into account the need to continue defending coastal fishing and fishing-dependent communities. The status quo needs to be maintained and there should be no extension of the coastal areas, contrary to what a number of amendments suggest."
"For all these reasons, we do not feel that the report before us today is appropriate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating Pat Gallagher on all the hard and positive work he has put in. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our former colleague, the late Allan Macartney, who was a great Member of Parliament and a great friend."
"Experience has shown that the fisheries sector is plagued by conflicts between fishing communities about access to fisheries resources, and above all conflicts between fishing communities in neighbouring countries."
"In order to keep such conflicts to a minimum, the common fisheries policy has always reserved a fixed area of the EU Member States' territorial sea for fishing by local communities."
"This limit was set at six miles in 1972, and was subsequently increased to 12 miles in 1983, under the present common fisheries policy regulation."
"However, that regulation expires on 31 December 2002, so that if nothing is done, the principles of the single market will apply, in other words there will be unrestricted access to fisheries resources in all EU waters."
"This would of course have a very negative impact on fisheries, especially small-scale fishing, which has a very important economic and social function in many Member States, not least in my own, Portugal."
"For this reason, it is essential to ensure that the principle of relative stability is adhered to and that the fishing areas reserved exclusively for national or local communities are not just maintained, but also extended."
"For the same reason, I have joined James Provan and other colleagues in tabling seven amendments to the Gallagher report to ensure that this principle of relative stability is safeguarded as of now and to start to have a more active influence on the negotiations on post-2002 common fisheries policy, with a view to extending the 12-mile area for national and local fishermen to 24 miles."
"Mr President, I would also like to say that as far as we are concerned, decentralisation is not a route to renationalisation: decentralisation simply means greater decentralisation and flexibility, or, in other words, greater accountability and efficiency."
"Mr President, I wish to begin, on behalf of the Commission and in my personal capacity, by echoing the words of sorrow and grief over the loss of your colleague, Allan Macartney, not without recalling that - when I was much younger and a Member of this House - Mr Macartney and I belonged to the same group."
"I would therefore echo your words both on behalf of the Commission and personally."
"I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that whenever we discuss fisheries - indeed, we have become a 'friends of fisheries' group, always more or less the same people - it is my impression that some of you think, or at least your words imply, that the fisheries sector once experienced a glorious and splendid heyday."
"I am something of a novice, having dealt with this sector for only four years, but none of the books or publications I have read on the fishing industry in former times refer to that golden age: the sector has always had an extremely tough existence, particularly at certain moments, constantly struggling to preserve the balance between extraction and resources."
"From this point of view, I believe that the Commission has proved very attentive and very open to suggestions from various quarters - Parliament, the Advisory Committee and also the sector itself - in an attempt to improve the situation."
"I have studied the Gallagher report carefully from this perspective, and I wish in all honesty to make two points: firstly, as you know, wide-ranging consultations are under way for the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002."
"We took pains to launch these consultations well in advance, so as to allow ample time for the debate."
"Not all the questionnaires have been returned, but judging by the overwhelming majority of those which have reached the Commission and are now being evaluated, only part of the sector in both the UK and Ireland favours this type of proposal."
"Indeed, Mrs McKenna is right on one point: we should first be clearer about what we mean, or what you mean, by regionalisation, and how exactly it differs from decentralisation - which entails greater transparency and greater involvement - and, above all, how the fundamental principle of relative stability, which many of you have stressed today, can be reconciled with regionalisation."
"I believe that this report is an important and useful contribution to the debate."
"Tomorrow morning, I shall be putting my proposed reforms to the Advisory Committee on Fisheries, but I would assure you that the present common policy already contains some very strong regional elements: for example, the regional MGPs and the whole section relating to regional cooperation and meetings."
"In short, a whole range of initiatives can be expanded on."
"The final point which I would draw to the House's attention - and this is why I say that further consideration is required - is a problem concerning the Treaty."
"While this report does not establish clearly what the Commission's role would be, there would undoubtedly be some difficulty at the final stage, that of the Council of Ministers, the 15 EU ministers."
"In my opinion, that stage cannot be seen merely as a rubber-stamping of decisions taken in the regions or by regional organisations."
"I hope that we shall continue to discuss this issue with one another, because I am sometimes aware of two overlapping elements: decentralisation - the proper application of subsidiarity, with greater involvement of local communities - which is very necessary, and regionalisation, which I think deserves much more investigation, since certain problems cannot be solved at regional level."
"I should therefore not like us to select the wrong approach and to devise radical reforms without having studied them in great detail."
"I hope that we shall be able to carry forward these ideas together, in order to make the necessary reforms to the common fisheries policy after having examined them in a little more depth."
"Thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Legal protection of inventions: grace period"
"The next item is the report (A4-0037/99) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the introduction of a grace period for innovations in national patent laws."
"Mr President, researchers, scientists and inventors in the European Union are faced with a problem."
"Either they publish the results of their research, their scientific findings, thereby waiving the right to subsequent protection by patent, or they steer clear of the academic discussion process in the expectation of a future patent. That is the dilemma facing researchers, scientists and inventors in the European Union."
"They are forced to choose between contributing to scientific knowledge and obtaining a patent. The problem has been solved in the United States; it has been solved in Japan; it has been solved in many other countries of the world, but not in the European Union."
"This has fatal consequences."
"European researchers, scientists and inventors can naturally apply in the United States for patents on what they have developed, on the scientific ideas they have publicised."
"Of course they can do that, with the result that they will naturally make further investments in the country in which they hold the patents."
"In other words, the lack of a grace period means that our rules in the European Union both impede innovation and discourage research."
"What does the grace period mean?"
"It means that a publication by the inventor himself or herself will not prejudice the granting of a patent to the same person."
"I hasten to add that this does not in any way alter the 'first to file' principle."
"Now there are some clever people in the European Union, for example in the Association of the Chemical Industry, who tell us that this is all a matter of legal uncertainty."
"The Americans, the Japanese, the Canadians and many other peoples in this world would rub their eyes in disbelief to see the German Association of the Chemical Industry citing legal uncertainty."
"They will scarcely share that sentiment."
"Another astonishing thing is that, when Europe negotiated with America in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) framework on the basis that they were introducing the 'first to file' principle, so we would introduce the grace period in Europe, the whole of European industry actually agreed with the introduction of the grace period."
"I know that the Commission, which incidentally held a hearing in October and, to the astonishment of the European public, communicated its conclusions the very next day, has said that it can only look at this in conjunction with the 'first to file' principle and with the issue of the 'first to invent' principle, which, as you may know, plays a major role in the United States."
"One thing is sure: the Americans will never deviate from the 'first to invent' principle."
"Now it is not my job to make recommendations to the other political parties."
"I shall not make any recommendations to the PPE or the Liberals; they may possibly reject all of this."
"That may well be."
"I merely wish to point out one thing: the position that the PPE seems to have adopted and the position that the Liberals seem to have adopted will both have to be abandoned."
"They will not be able to assert their positions."
"They will lose this argument."
"I am, of course, not entirely unaccustomed to having to wait until the second round before winning the day, but however Parliament may decide on this initiative, I know that we - my group - will succeed with it in the end; that is quite certain."
"We shall organise an international congress on this topic with the best people, and then we shall probably be able to tell the Commission how the world sees this question instead of merely presenting the narrow viewpoint of the Association of the Chemical Industry in Germany."
"My recommendation would be this: if I were the PPE or the Liberal Group, I should be somewhat more cautious."
"It is always difficult to have to give up a position that has become unsustainable because it is hostile to research, because it impedes innovation and because it has nothing to do with the international harmonisation of patent law."
"This position is untenable. You will have to give up this position, and so will the Commission."
"You will abandon it!"
"It would perhaps be wiser to line up on the side of common sense from the outset."
"So whatever the result tomorrow, whether we secure 314 votes or not, it will be of no consequence at all."
"If my group had not taken this initiative, the whole issue would not have arisen."
"The Commission, of course, would have preferred to keep the lid on this issue and not to have it discussed in connection with the Community patent."
"That is what the Commission would have liked best."
"The only problem is that we have now put it on the agenda."
"We shall talk about it, and whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote, the prospect of failing to secure the necessary majority does not perturb me."
"We shall conduct the real discussion in connection with the Community patent, and we shall ultimately win this debate and thereby strengthen the European Union as a location for research and industry."
"It continually puzzles me, when Europe's standing as a business location is being ruined by such anti-investment and anti-research instruments, how anyone can still wonder why the jobs are all being created elsewhere."
"That is why I am convinced that common sense will prevail in the end."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur who is one of the most imaginative Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"He was the first person to pilot an own-initiative report through Parliament on motor insurance which led to the Commission producing legislation."
"Yet again Mr Rothley has been imaginative on the subject of inventions."
"It is important that the European Union does not suffer competitive disadvantage, vis-à-vis other parts of the world, as far as our engineering skills are concerned."
"Patents are an important plank of legal rights to encourage inventions."
"Creativity is the engine of productivity in the European Union."
"Engineering is important in my constituency so I particularly appreciate the importance of patents and inventions."
"To cite just two examples: in my constituency Frank Whittle invented the jet engine and James Brindley invented the safety gears on bicycles."
"This report is important as a proposal because it would allow researchers a year to publish before the need to file for a patent."
"This would help researchers to publicise their work and would follow the example of the United States and Japan."
"We need to make the European Union as competitive as possible."
"We need to have a strong manufacturing base and patents are an important part of developing the industrial output of the European Union."
"Mr President, the legislative initiative before us today is based on the second paragraph of Article 138b of the EC Treaty and on Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure. As the rapporteur has explained, its purpose is to introduce a one-year grace period into legislation on patents."
"During this period the inventor may file for a patent without suffering adversely from prior publication of the invention. This therefore amounts to setting up a system similar to that which already exists in the United States and in Japan, where the grace period is six months."
"The attempts by the WIPO to introduce such a grace period have so far proved unsuccessful. The main reason for this has been the failure to resolve the issue of who has the right to the patent."
"Mr President, I have a great regard for my colleague Mr Rothley, as he knows."
"I truly believe that he is a great parliamentarian and a fine lawyer."
"Nevertheless, I do have to say that, in this case, I am completely opposed to what his report proposes."
"He has referred to the need for prudence."
"I am not sure whether it is more or less prudent to request a grace period than not to do so."
"My speech could in a sense be redundant, as Mr Rothley has already referred to the arguments I intend to adduce."
"He has anticipated what I have to say by presenting the arguments against such a request, and I can but wonder why."
"As we see it - Mr Rothley said so and I shall therefore repeat the point - the grace period results in a high degree of legal uncertainty and also in financial uncertainty for those responsible for the invention to which the patent relates."
"This is undeniable and, as Mr Rothley also pointed out, industry would clearly not be able to bear the costs of the uncertainty resulting from such a grace period."
"What is called for is a detailed study to establish the actual effect of the existing discrepancies between European and United States legislation, yet no such study has been undertaken. We must remember that the grace period currently provided for in the United States is the consequence of a risk capital system that differs greatly from that which exists within the European Union."
"It would therefore be inappropriate to provide for such a period within the Union, as it would not take account of the specific nature of our current financial system."
"It should also be borne in mind that in October 1988, the Commission organised a public hearing attended by representatives of the sectors concerned."
"The conclusion of this hearing was that for any initiative linked to the introduction of a grace period to be successful, it would have to take account of globalisation. Consequently, it would have to operate within the framework of a regulatory authority."
"We do not therefore agree that Article 138b of the Treaty can serve as the legal basis for this proposal."
"We believe that it is expecting too much of the Commission to ask it to take a legislative initiative of this magnitude. We do not consider that it would be prudent to do so, and Mr Rothley himself referred to the need for prudence."
"My colleague stated that the real debate will take place in the context of the patent and he is quite right."
"If that debate takes place, then a grace period is not required and could in fact prove counter-productive."
"Mr President, this is clearly no easy matter to deal with."
"As the rapporteur has pointed out, it would be advantageous in some cases, for instance scientific research and small businesses which are unfamiliar with the procedures."
"However, when we talk about the EU lagging behind in the number of inventions per head, this only applies at EU level."
"In my view, we should also be investigating the differences that exist between the Member States, since here the picture is not nearly as clear as the rapporteur is saying."
"The disadvantages that have been mentioned include uncertainty about the law and legal procedures, and the possibility that European businesses may end up in a worse situation than their American counterparts."
"We Liberals believe that the matter should be looked at in conjunction with some of the trade wars that are currently taking place between Europe and the USA."
"Clearly, what is at issue is intangible property;"
"I have in mind the UMTS dispute in this respect."
"We were evidently very close to a settlement some years ago, when it would have been better to have had 'first to file' rather than 'first to invent' as a general, worldwide principle."
"We should also have made provision for a grace period."
"We should not now give up the chance of bringing these two principles together through the unilateral introduction of a grace period."
"It is plain that the rapporteur, with this initiative, has goaded the Commission into action."
"I think we can see this in the Commission's last communication on Community patents, in which it specifically points to the need for some kind of interim arrangement for an enquiry to take place, whereby it is registered that something has been invented."
"Such a clear boundary is considerably better."
"Consequently, the Liberals are opposed to a formal initiative."
"Nevertheless, we are in favour of further investigations and of the EU holding to this course in the forthcoming trade policy negotiations."
"We have reached this decision bearing in mind the current state of relations between the trading blocs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there may be different views, or even very different views, about whether it was wise to abandon the European tradition of patent law in favour of adaptation to the US system."
"But what quite certainly cannot be done, and I believe the rapporteur is absolutely right here, is to refuse to accept the consequences of the decision after it has been taken."
"Adopting the US patentability criteria without taking the logical next step of introducing the grace period, which has long been in force in the United States, would mean placing European research at a blatantly unfair disadvantage."
"It would rob European researchers of the advantages that adaptation was supposed to bring, and would only result in their being compelled to publicise their work and apply for their patents in the United States."
"Going it alone at a national level is clearly not an option in this case, and it is equally clear that we need to adapt our rules to those laid down in the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation."
"The purpose behind the objections to the grace period that have recently been raised by the chemical industry is to ensure that scientists safeguard the industry's interests by keeping their discoveries secret."
"I believe it is the duty of this House to defend scientific freedom and the right of scientists to control their own intellectual property, which is why I ask the House to support the rapporteur's initiative as emphatically as it can."
"I should also like to convey my special thanks to the rapporteur for having taken this initiative."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is indeed an astonishing fact that our global players sometimes perform like teams in the lower reaches of the Third Division!"
"Here we have international groups and their industrial lobby actually trying to dissuade us from including a grace period in the patent laws."
"And the groups of companies that are trying to dissuade us from affording protection to inventors are the very ones that are coping very comfortably with such provisions in other parts of the world, such as the United States or Japan."
"Unlike the lobby, which condemns the grace period as hostile to research and a barrier to investment, I share the view of the rapporteur that European patent law cannot go on operating without the speedy introduction of a grace period."
"It nurtures research and protects small and medium-sized businesses, to which the European Parliament is very committed, and with good reason, since these businesses create jobs that are urgently needed and are the channels through which the technologies of the future are introduced."
"The ideas of young researchers at universities and research institutes provide the vital spark."
"They must be able to discuss and publicise their innovations without jeopardising their right to apply for a potentially profitable patent."
"Large companies can afford to conduct research behind closed doors and to keep new developments under wraps until the time is right to profit from them in the market-place."
"Researchers at universities, on the other hand, must be able to publish their findings in order to establish and confirm their academic credentials."
"The usefulness of the grace period can be seen in the United States."
"That is where the most frequently cited researchers live, in a country with an enviable wealth of innovative small businesses."
"If we want to compete with them, Europe will have to wake up - not gradually but as quickly as possible - whether or not it suits the large industrial groups."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of introducing a grace period for innovations in national patent laws is a delicate and, in several respects, important aspect of the current debate on the reform of the patent system in Europe, as implied by the rapporteur himself."
"For this reason, the Commission is grateful to the House, and in particular the rapporteur, for having taken this initiative."
"Having heard a number of speakers refer to the US and Japanese systems, I feel I must point out that, although US legislation does indeed establish the principle of a grace period, this must be understood in the light of one specific feature of the American law, namely that it operates according to the 'first to invent' principle, whereas the European legislation operates on a different basis: the 'first to file'."
"Whether we like it or not, any comparison with other systems must in my opinion acknowledge the different starting-points and rules on implementation."
"Secondly, as has already been said, the Commission held an ad hoc hearing of interested parties on 5 October 1998."
"The Commission does not take decisions single-handedly: the hearing was attended by 150 people representing all the relevant circles, and perhaps I should list them for your information."
"They included large, small and medium-sized enterprises, associations of inventors and researchers, national, European and international representative bodies, patent consultants, national and European patent offices, international institutions, Member States and international experts."
"Perhaps all these persons were mistaken; the fact remains that one initial, important conclusion can be drawn following this hearing: a legislative initiative concerning the grace period can be envisaged only at international level, through the World Intellectual Property Organisation."
"It emerged plainly that a unilateral European measure would not produce the desired result."
"Furthermore, according to the overwhelming majority of those attending the hearing, a grace period increases legal uncertainty by abandoning the principle of absolute novelty in favour of relative novelty."
"The grace period seems in fact to be regarded as an inadequate response to genuine problems, such as the complexity of the procedure for filing applications, the lack of relevant information and the need to disclose one's inventions before filing for a patent."
"In any event, the hearing on 5 October brought to light certain solutions which the Commission has undertaken to explore; moreover, it made such an undertaking in the communication on the future of patents in Europe, which was adopted in February."
"In particular, as regards the complexity of the procedure for filing patent applications, the Commission has undertaken to investigate the idea of filing an application provisionally, on the basis of simplified formalities and without payment of a fee."
"Our consideration of such matters will be completed by the end of 1999."
"Further, to meet the specific needs of inventors and SMEs, who need to disclose their inventions before filing for a patent, the Commission has undertaken to re-examine two exceptions to the principle of absolute novelty, which currently applies under European law: manifestly unlawful use to the disadvantage of the applicant, and presentation of the invention at international exhibitions."
"In these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has to say concerning the motion for a resolution that it cannot accede to the request to propose a Parliament and Council directive based on Article 100a of the Treaty."
"The Commission can, however, accept the amendment put forward by Mrs Palacio, calling on it to continue its deliberations, taking into account the conclusions of the hearing to which I have just referred."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Reinforcing cohesion and competitiveness"
"The next item is the report (A4-0027/99) by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on reinforcing cohesion and competitiveness through research, technological development and innovation (COM(98)0275 - C4-0491/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone agrees that research and innovation are the driving force behind economic development, but no-one dares to add that this economic development needs to be balanced."
"Indeed, it is trite to point out that fundamental research is demanding ever greater investment, and that it therefore seems to have to be carried out by only a few small powerful teams associated with a very concentrated intellectual and industrial environment."
"The demands of inter-continental competition lead to the appearance of major industrial alliances, and public investment, especially European funding, is welcome in order to help these efforts."
"The principle of developing research effort should itself be seen as standing for the progress, competition and attractiveness of the most powerful zones of activity and consequently for concentration."
"Cohesion, on the other hand, stands for efforts towards prior redistribution in favour of the development of less favoured regions."
"These are thus two opposing principles."
"It is clear that research processes cannot themselves lead to convergence and that future convergence will be underpinned by autonomous development."
"The less favoured localities and regions should therefore create, with the help of the entire Union, an environment which is favourable to initiative and innovation."
"The opportunity that we have is that instead of large-scale fundamental research carried out by concentrated teams, today a whole world of intercommunication is appearing, which will facilitate networks of small research teams spread out across an entire territory."
"We must seize this opportunity. All European programmes must take part in the convergence of economies, and the framework research programme should not escape this objective, which is set out in the Treaties and was also highlighted at the Amsterdam summit."
"In its communication, the Commission has put together a few paths to take in order to reinforce both cohesion and competitiveness through research and innovation."
"The drafting of this communication, interesting though it may be, cannot, however, disguise the discussion that is going on in the Commission on this issue, which is similar to the debate that we could have on regional planning: is it really possible not to reduce the European effort towards competitiveness while at the same time directing research funds to the less favoured regions of the Union?"
"In any case, several studies show the worrying increase in imbalances between the regions, while the figures for gross domestic product per inhabitant in the Member States of the EU continue to show a residual convergence."
"There is in fact a certain discrepancy between national growth and regional cohesion, but even at state level the differences are extreme: in research and technological development expenditure, Germany and France, for example, spent 60 % of the total research expenditure in the Union in 1993, while Ireland, Greece and Portugal spent only 1.3 % between them."
"Whether it is the capacity to translate basic research into innovations, the number of patents per inhabitant, or staff employed in research and development, all these criteria reveal the extent of the disparities in technological development."
"What is the balance of European action in this respect?"
"Let us note, for example, that a group of regions which includes the whole of Greece, with the exception of Attica, three Portuguese regions and Calabria in Italy, were only able to participate in 2 % of the third framework programme."
"It is true that since 1993 the Commission has endeavoured to encourage greater synergy between Community programmes and the objective of economic and social cohesion."
"We could also - and the Commission has thought about this - use Structural Funds more in order to correct the trend that has been observed."
"Nevertheless, the share of funding devoted under the various objectives of the Structural Funds to specific investment in favour of research and development has remained limited, even though it has increased from one programming period to the next."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I propose to you to strongly press for a more balanced distribution of the key factors of competitiveness in the various regions of the Union through programmes to support research."
"This House can, in terms of the Commission communication, underline what seems to be the key objective, namely the development of innovation in the SMEs in the less favoured regions."
"The idea is to encourage innovation in all the small undertakings that have neither the resources, nor the skills, nor the time necessary to embark on innovation and integrate it into the practices adopted by the undertaking."
"However, this type of development requires a well-defined regional commitment, a close synergy between the fifth framework programme and the strategies adopted by the regions as cofinanced under the Structural Funds."
"It is also essential that we now fix the criteria for measuring progress in achieving the feasibility thresholds above which the spirit of innovation and competitiveness can be developed."
"Without this prior conceptual work, we will find it hard to act in the most efficient manner in order to ensure that these thresholds are achieved in the less favoured regions."
"We must also call on the Commission to draw the full consequences from its correct observation that excellence in vocational training is of fundamental importance for the cohesion sought in this area."
"The only conclusion which the communication draws for the moment is that there is a need to promote vocational training courses in centres of excellence."
"We cannot stress the importance of human resources and then stop at such a weak conclusion."
"New funding mechanisms and boosting local policies for improving quality should at least be proposed."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication provides an interesting basis for discussing a new way of approaching cohesion issues, but much remains to be done in order to clarify objectives, criteria and procedures."
"Mr President, I think that, in his excellent report, the rapporteur has put his finger on the crux of the matter regarding the implementation and the effectiveness of the Union's political, economic and social cohesion. His report underscores the omissions and the wrong choices of the past which have impeded a speedier adjustment of the less-favoured regions, which would have reduced the existing regional imbalances in the European Union."
"The enormous disparities in growth which still exist among the different regions of the European Union are in great part due to the huge divergencies in the technology sector, especially in investment in research and technological development."
"Details that are available paint a vivid picture of imbalances in the European Union, with discrepancies in technology being double the discrepancies in revenue."
"As we have heard, just two countries in the European Union, Germany and France, spend 60 % of the total available funds for research and technological development."
"Of course we congratulate these countries on their capacity to absorb funds for research and technological development. However, we must also stress the need to fully integrate research and technological development into meeting the objective of economic and social cohesion and the reduction of regional imbalances, so as to achieve more balanced growth within the European Union."
"This can be done by strengthening the basic factors which shape competitiveness in the different regions of the European Union, and by increasing resources and support for attempts to make up for technological deficiencies, especially in the Objective 1 regions, where the problems of technological deficiencies are most pronounced."
"We need a more integrated approach to the problems of growth during the new development period 2000-2006 and, of course, more effective cooperation between the Structural Funds and the fifth framework programme for research and technological development."
"I believe that this must be one of the basic priorities for the new period of development."
"Finally, we all need to realise that cohesion is the ally of competitiveness and of the dynamism of our production system, and vice versa."
"In closing, I agree with all the proposals contained in Mr de Lassus's report and with the priority he has given to balanced support for the different regions of the European Union. I agree with the proposals he has put forward to assist small and medium-sized enterprises and, above all, with the proposals to strengthen the links between research centres and universities by means of local vehicles for growth."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the creation of jobs in the European Union is one of our priorities, we must devote the utmost attention to research, technological development and innovation."
"As Christian Democrats, we are utterly convinced that competitiveness creates the safest jobs."
"Businesses that seek to remain or become competitive, however, cannot achieve that aim without sufficiently outstanding research and development and without innovating."
"It is true, as the Commission and the rapporteur have emphasised, that there are huge regional disparities in terms of research, technological development and innovation."
"Most research, of course, is conducted in regions with high levels of economic development, and far too little research, or indeed scarcely any, takes place in underdeveloped areas."
"That is a fact of life. Our efforts must be channelled into encouraging a continuous exchange of information between richer and poorer regions."
"We are convinced that cooperation should indeed take place between the research programmes and the Structural Funds."
"But a clear distinction must be made between the finances allocated to each."
"They are and will remain separate support mechanisms. That does not mean, however, that they cannot supplement each other or that they are in any way incompatible."
"In short, we are saying yes to cross-pollination, but no to common funding."
"I can cite some successful examples of this approach from my own part of Germany, from Thuringia, which is an Objective 1 area."
"We have companies there which are household names in Germany and which have now established international reputations, such as Carl Zeiss Jena, Jen-Optik or the Jena ovenproof glass company. The European Regional Development Fund has helped to create the infrastructure conditions for the success of these companies, which have also launched some excellent pioneering research and innovation projects with the aid of funds from the fourth framework programme for research and technological development."
"From that point of view, however, we cannot entirely endorse the rapporteur's proposal for Article 21, which is why we have requested a split vote on that article."
"I do wish to emphasise, however, that this should not detract from our general approval of the report."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"A strange phenomenon is occurring in the European regions."
"While the figures for GDP per inhabitant reveal a residual growing convergence amongst the Member States, a process of rising imbalances between regions in the same state is taking place."
"In other words, there is a certain discrepancy between national growth and regional cohesion."
"An intelligent policy to disseminate technological innovation would be one of the skills to counteract this process of polarisation."
"Unfortunately, research and development are still a monopoly of the richest regions."
"In view of the sensitivities of this, the Greens have proposed three important points."
"There should be more structural assistance for technological development instead of heavy infrastructures in the less-favoured regions, especially in the Objective 1 regions."
"Secondly, we call for the application of a principle of positive discrimination in favour of the less-favoured regions under the new RDT framework programmes."
"That means the allocation of resources under the framework programme should be made applying award criteria on the model of the structural funds allocation criteria."
"And thirdly, an orientation of technological innovation in the less-favoured regions towards the promotion of sustainable development, promoting local skills and using local natural and human resources."
"Finally, we have tabled an amendment introducing the principle of positive discrimination in R & D for the poorer regions."
"Mr President, I must first congratulate the rapporteur, Mr de Lassus, on what I believe to be an excellent report on the fundamental issue of strengthening cohesion amongst European citizens."
"In this connection, I feel that research and technological development are crucial to the development of geographical cohesion amongst the citizens of Europe."
"This does not of course mean that research and development ought to be distributed throughout Europe, but rather that specific policies should be put in place to promote activity where maximum benefit could be derived from technological development. This would usually be in the most advanced regions, those most advanced at European Union level and at Member State level."
"Such regions are the real economic powerhouses and tend to be in a position to make a more effective contribution to the development of the other less favoured regions."
"The latter should not however be prevented from obtaining investment to improve their technological level and their competitiveness."
"Indeed, if they do not, cohesive development across the whole of the European Union will not be achieved."
"I should like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur again because I do feel that this report has identified the main issues relating to the achievement not only of economic and social cohesion but also of geographical cohesion amongst all the regions of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr de Lassus, although I do not want to preach a Ptolemaic view of science, which is always a temptation for modern western science, it is impossible nowadays to ignore the fact that knowledge, science and research are the real engines of both intellectual and economic progress in our societies."
"And in the face of enormous challenges from the United States, this is in danger of becoming the weakest link in the European Union."
"Whilst this is a fundamental challenge for the richer and scientifically better-equipped countries and regions of the EU, it poses an even greater challenge for less-favoured countries and regions: not as regards talent and creative capacity, because these are equally spread, but in terms of know-how and technological innovation."
"For these reasons, the Commission communication before us is to be welcomed in that it calls for greater Structural Fund spending on research and innovation, with a view to strengthening the weak scientific capacity and reinforcing the know-how and technological bases of industries in these poorer regions."
"Nevertheless, the strategy proposed by the Commission suffers from one great flaw which is flagged up in the excellent report prepared by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, on which I would like to congratulate him. This flaw is that it does not take account of the need for more equitable distribution of resources available under the RTD framework programmes."
"I do not have in mind some kind of populist geographical dispersal of major themes and priorities in the framework programmes, far from it. But I would like to see some decentralisation away from the more exalted centres of research and technology towards more modest centres and towards smaller and more flexible teams based in poorer regions."
"After all, although these framework programmes only represent 4 % of EU research expenditure, if spending under them were distributed more evenly, they could provide a powerful impetus for countries like Portugal, which up to now have been the poor relations of research and development in the European Union."
"Dissemination and absorption of scientific knowledge, technological progress and innovation should be one of the priorities of regional development and cohesion policy in the Europe of the future."
"Mr President, the rapporteur attaches particular importance to the need to promote innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"He has hit the nail on the head there, because the large combines negotiate directly with the research centres in any event."
"Small and medium-sized businesses are essentially in a difficult position."
"Our prime concern is to encourage innovation in those companies which are not large enough to devote time, money and human resources to deal systematically, and primarily on their own initiative, with innovative developments."
"It is a question of creating a real innovation culture among SMEs with a view to making European business competitive and safeguarding jobs."
"Any initiatives that will help to achieve this goal, especially those which encourage young entrepreneurs to invest in innovation, are particularly welcome."
"The most efficient approach would be to ensure that the largest possible slice of the budget for both the framework R&D programme and the Structural Funds is devoted to this aim."
"Mr President, Mr de Lassus's report raises a particularly important issue: how to promote cohesion and competitiveness in the European Union by supporting research, technological development and technological innovation."
"I believe it is important because, as we all understand, however many roads and railways we build, however many ports and airports we construct, however much we promote infrastructure, transport and the environment, research and technology represent an irreplaceable impetus for development."
"It is the quickest and most up-to-date road to growth."
"This growth will help the regions to help themselves and to create their own future, without the need to continuously struggle to keep up with the others."
"In the light of this, it is a sad fact that imbalances between the different regions regarding research and technology are much greater than in other sectors."
"According to Mr de Lassus's report, they are many times greater than differences in revenue. For example, the difference in per capita expenditure on research and technological development between Berlin and Macedonia is, more or less, in the ratio of 1: 100."
"There is also a considerable problem of concentration of resources. Sixty-eight per cent of people who are involved in the sectors of research, technology and technological innovation throughout Europe are based in just 10 % of the regions of the EU."
"These facts and figures may explain why, despite all the attempts to achieve cohesion which have been made over all these years, the differences in revenue among the regions continue to be huge and, in some cases, are becoming even larger."
"We must realise that research and technology are an important weapon in achieving cohesion and competitiveness in the EU, and this is why we must give them greater importance in the future."
"It is unfortunate, therefore, that the relevant Commission statement was issued after the drawing-up of the fifth framework programme for research and technology, and that its conclusions could not be included in the programme."
"In any event, emphasis must be given to promoting research and technology in the less-developed regions of the EU."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say that such actions must be given greater weight in the regional and structural policies of the EU during the next period, because this is the best, quickest and most far-sighted way for these regions to achieve growth."
"It is also the best way of promoting employment, because it will generate steady, sustainable jobs in sectors with future prospects, and it will help small and medium-sized enterprises to become the backbone and the major employers in this sector of production."
"However, Mr President, we must render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's."
"This is not the responsibility of the Commission, it is the responsibility of the Member States to promote these actions during the new programming period."
"I should like to take my own country, Greece, as an example. Unfortunately, Greece lags behind the other 14 Member States in this sector."
"Our expenditure is just 0.63 % of GDP, when the Community average is 2.4 %."
"This is therefore an opportunity for us to use the new Community support framework to promote research and technology."
"Mr President, birds of a feather flock together."
"This is the principle that businesses apply when they choose their locations."
"They prefer those central positions where the bulk of economic power is already concentrated, and then employees, educational establishments and infrastructure investment are drawn into these existing centres."
"Then we have phenomena like the Golden Arc or the Sunbelt on the one hand and the peripheral areas on the other, a scenario which calls for a regional policy to counteract this magnetism and prevent mass migration from the periphery to the main population centres."
"There are some especially effective ways of doing this."
"Research and technological development can be used to establish footholds in the hinterland, so that not only know-how but also employment can develop outside the economic heartland and the main population centres."
"This policy is convincingly presented by the communication from the Commission and by Mr de Lassus's report."
"My one wish is that the convincing words of both the communication and the report can be turned into action."
"One of my main interests relates to paragraph 15 of the report, which speaks of interregional and cross-border cooperation, because it is especially important to break new ground in these areas."
"Already this evening we have spoken about educational cooperation in connection with the Socrates programme when we discussed the Pack report, and we expressed our gratification at the fact that European Union funds had paved the way for closer cooperation in the field of education in precisely those areas."
"I hope and wish for all of us, and particularly for the regions at the external frontiers of the Union where Interreg is trying to reverse the manpower drain, that the promises made to us in the Commission communication and the de Lassus report will be fulfilled in those regions, so that some birds will start flocking to places where none of their feather have gone before."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr de Lassus on his report."
"This is an important matter for my constituency of Devon and for my region of the South-West and in particular for Cornwall, which the Commissioner will know has a very strong claim for Objective 1 status."
"There is a great deal of activity going on in the research field in our region already, which shows what can be achieved by way of generating local employment, not just at the universities of Exeter and Plymouth."
"There is a very exciting project at a small town called Holsworthy where a plant to create energy from agricultural waste is being developed with assistance not only from a research project, the Altener programme, but also from Objective 5b funding."
"This is a good example of the synergy of regional and research funds coming together."
"The most important thing for remote regions of the Community is the information technology networks and the potential they have for drawing together researchers from far-flung corners of Europe for mutual benefit."
"I am working at present on a report in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy for integrating environmental policy with energy policy."
"Here is a field where there is great potential for employment creation in the less-favoured regions."
"There was a rather interesting project a while back for a prototype hybrid bus running on a battery in the city centre and normal diesel fuel in the outlying districts."
"This was another example of where funding from Europe can materially assist projects for employment and for environmental concerns."
"I welcome the emphasis in this report on small businesses."
"In my constituency in Devon small businesses and the self-employed form a particularly large section of the economy."
"They are a vital generator both of jobs and of innovation and new projects."
"So I welcome giving emphasis to them in this report."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that we must beware of placing contracts for research work on geographical grounds alone."
"We must treat the merits of the project as the first priority."
"Otherwise we will damage the research work of the European Community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there can be few initiatives with sound and important recommendations more relevant to Portugal, which is a unique case as a country with an ill-balanced policy on the location of scientific and technological facilities, where balanced support would have an enormous effect."
"As is highlighted in the Commission communication and in the report by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, technological development is a key factor in the internal development of less-favoured regions and in reducing regional disparities."
"On the other hand, promoting technological development in just one or two already privileged areas, in line with centre-periphery or cumulative effect theories, is bound to aggravate imbalances, negating the effect of any overall balance in expenditure on infrastructure and services. Although this might have social benefits, it would not have any effect as regards self-sustaining developmental trends."
"The statistics on Portugal speak for themselves: 65 % of RTD funding, 82 % of state research and the lion's share of Community funding are concentrated in Lisbon."
"This means that there is no correlation with present levels of productive activity - the Lisbon area accounts for only 25 % of Portugal's industrial GDP and an insignificant percentage of the country's agricultural and forestry GDP. Nor is there any correlation with potential levels of activity, not to mention the social and political benefits that some if not all would see in balanced regional development of the country."
"A well-balanced spread of support close to existing and potential users would also ensure that the needs of Portugal - or of any other country - are met, whilst promoting a wider spread of company expenditure, which is also desirable. This would involve a different approach to that of the present major laboratories, which are remote from most economic activity."
"When all is said and done, we are talking about complying with the Maastricht Treaty, which clearly stipulates that support should be given to universities, research centres and to SMEs."
"I believe that this approach is correct and that it should be adopted throughout the European Union."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr de Lassus for this highly significant report and the motion for a resolution."
"I am delighted to note that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of our communication, and it should be appreciated that this is the first time we have tried to release the synergy between these two policies, as you have rightly been urging us to do, and to achieve closer coordination of our common research and development policy with our structural and cohesion policy."
"We share your view that research, technological development, innovation and modernisation of the production basis are essential means of creating steady jobs and reducing regional disparities."
"That is why, in the draft guidelines for the next structural programme, covering the period from 2000 to 2006, which it adopted on 2 February, the Commission reaffirms the approach that is also clearly outlined in the present communication."
"The competitiveness of a region is crucially dependent on whether or not it possesses an innovation strategy."
"In the guidelines for the next period of the Structural Funds, the Commission therefore recommends to the regions a whole raft of measures designed to encourage innovation, from new forms of funding, such as venture capital to promote business start-ups and innovative developments, to specialised services and facilities for technology transfer."
"The contributions to the present debate have further emphasised the fact that the transfer of knowledge and know-how and the dissemination of new techniques represent a vital contribution to the enhancement of regional competitiveness."
"For that reason, the guidelines state that payments from the Structural Funds should primarily help small and medium-sized businesses to acquire the skills they need in order to go on developing, but they should also be used to set up cooperative ventures and centres where knowledge and skills can be pooled and to fund involvement in Community and international research and innovation networks, not forgetting the business innovation centres and the various European networks through which we have already done a great deal to enable small and medium-sized businesses to benefit from the results of research conducted by other bodies."
"In response to your criticism of the fifth framework programme for research and technological development, let me say that this programme, as you know, was the result of two years of negotiation with Parliament and with the Member States, and that the framework programme is not primarily concerned with cohesion, but also focuses on the competitiveness of Europe as a global region in terms of leading-edge technology, which naturally implies that one of its aims is to enable Europe to compete with the United States and Japan."
"So the key point is that in pursuing the one aim, we do not neglect the other, and above all that we ensure not only that the development of research, particularly in the field of leading-edge technology, benefits the poorer regions directly but also that exchanges of researchers, which will be supported under the fifth framework R&D programme, can be used to promote innovation in the structurally weaker regions."
"If you look at some of the elements of the fifth framework programme - at the development of human resources potential in the field of research, or at the improvement of the socio-economic knowledge base - if you consider the Marie Curie homecoming grants for researchers from underprivileged regions and if you examine the development grants for research establishments in underdeveloped areas, you will see that the fifth framework programme responds to many of the needs of structurally weak regions and that its subject areas, such as the sustainable management of water supplies and water quality, sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries, rural areas, the town of tomorrow and the cultural heritage, are all of particular importance to regional development."
"The same applies, of course, to objectives such as the promotion of innovation and the involvement of small and medium-sized businesses."
"As the rapporteur has already indicated, we have made progress over the last ten years, not least in terms of funding."
"We started in 1988 with 200 million, and we now have 8.5 billion allocated to the Structural Funds for research and technology. It also has to be said here, of course, and I am grateful to Mr Hatzidakis for pointing this out too, that the Commission is not solely responsible, but that the Member States must also do more to ensure that such projects are included in their programmes."
"In a recent Objective 1 evaluation, we observed that more money spent on research and innovation does not automatically mean more innovation."
"In the cohesion countries in particular, the public sector is still largely overrepresented, while business innovations do not receive their fair share of funding, which is why I believe it is very important to put greater emphasis on the latter, because it is absolutely crucial that the regions themselves should be able to devise their own innovation strategies, which would be the best way to ensure that due account is taken of specific regional circumstances."
"That is why initiatives such as the regional information society initiative, in which the regions cooperate - across national borders, incidentally - and exchange best practices in the field of innovation support, are so important."
"That is why it is also important that the innovation dimension should become a more integral part of interregional and cross-border cooperation."
"Parliament and the Commission are, I believe, on the right path, but I agree with the rapporteur when he concludes that there is still a considerable way to go before we can say that the poorer regions have really started to bridge the gap in research and innovation, as well as in other areas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Conformity assessment procedure for packaging"
"The next item is the report (A4-0053/99) by Mrs Grossetête, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on marking and packaging and on the establishment of a conformity assessment procedure for packaging (COM(96)0191 - C4-0627/96-96/0123(COD))."
"Mr President, I would first like to directly address a question to the Commission, as there are a number of rumours flying around."
"I have reason to believe that certain manoeuvres have been undertaken and I would like to ask the Commission whether it is true that it is preparing a proposal that would encompass the directive with which we are concerned. If there is indeed a new proposal that we are to discuss in the near future, I would like to know if it really covers the directive that we are discussing this evening."
"If that is the case, depending on the Commission's answers, I will decide what attitude to adopt."
"Meanwhile, to come back to the main issues of this directive, I would like to point out that an initial examination took place in October 1997, and that work was suspended while awaiting precise answers from the Commission; however, having obtained those answers, after several months' delay, we were not satisfied."
"Without an active contribution from the Commission, I was finally forced to make a different proposal."
"The Commission was proposing two new symbols indicating the recyclability and reusability of packaging waste."
"However, these two symbols are completely new and do not provide sufficient information for the consumer."
"As the Commission itself recognises, recycling systems do not by any means cover the whole of Europe."
"We are now aware that the 1994 directive on packaging and packaging waste is not correctly applied across the whole of Europe."
"I therefore felt it was preferable to provide consumers with information which would allow them to be really active individually."
"Consumers must actively participate in the sorting of this packaging waste on the basis of symbols, which are already well-known, indicating the nature of the packaging material."
"This should help them in individual sorting."
"The symbols were chosen through the work of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)."
"The Commission was concerned about the appropriateness of these symbols, and I can reassure them as all of the symbols are in the public domain."
"I even know that certain companies have taken the trouble to write to the Commission in order to inform them that their symbols were at its disposal."
"The Commission's proposal also envisages a conformity assessment procedure for evaluating whether packaging conforms to the main requirements of the 1994 directive on packaging."
"It says that the manufacturer must draw up a declaration of conformity, establish technical documentation and keep it at the disposal of the national authorities that will carry out the necessary inspections."
"We are aware that the packaging sector is particularly complex and often involves a great number of professionals."
"In order to take account of this situation, I believed it was necessary to alter the text of Annex III to avoid any confusion for the packaging manufacturer and the product manufacturer, in other words not to force the manufacturer of the product contained in the packaging to take responsibility for any fault in the packaging. The aim of this is to take into account the responsibility of each party at their stage of contribution to production: the packaging manufacturer, the filler and the packer."
"I also had discussions with Mr Bowe, and we found common ground which is set out in Amendments Nos 19 and 20."
"To conclude, I would like to point out that the approach that I am proposing, which should enable us to find an intermediary solution while we are waiting for the latest revision of the 1994 packaging directive, is supported by all of the packaging sectors and by the consumers' associations, and it seems that the majority of Member States will agree to it."
"This is why I maintain my proposal and, while, of course, awaiting the debate, I hope to hear precise answers from the Commission, to which I addressed a question at the beginning of my speech."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have had the pleasure of serving as draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, where I have looked at the consequences of this proposal for a directive."
"I have the following comments to make."
"To begin with, I would point out that barriers to trade may arise with regard to partners outside the Community if a separate European reusability label is adopted."
"As I see it, an international label would have more impact and would not give rise to barriers to trade."
"It seems to me inappropriate to ask firms in Europe to spend money on introducing a European label if they will subsequently have to change over to an international one."
"Of course, the labelling scheme is voluntary, but it still has to be seen as a marketing 'carrot' or advantage to make use of the Commission's proposed label."
"According to what I have heard, the ISO will already have a label ready for the summer of 1999, in other words in a few months' time."
"And what is actually the point of the Commission's proposal?"
"The Commission's proposed label is not linked to a European collection scheme, which would justify the label's message that the material on which it is used is more environmentally friendly."
"For example, packaging which contains PVC could, according to my information, be labelled as recyclable."
"Consumers would interpret that as an indication of benefit to the environment, although the packaging in question would in Denmark perhaps go for incineration and not for more environmentally friendly recycling."
"No, against that background, I do not see anything that justifies the Commission's proposed labelling or the Commission's timing."
"I therefore have no objection to waiting for an ISO label."
"Then I have a few comments to make on the essential requirements."
"When we look at the Commission's choice of conformity procedure, I grant that the Commission has made a wise choice."
"Internal production control is welcomed by industry, since it can be incorporated into existing control systems for quality, the environment and health."
"But internal production control is based on the essential requirements of the packaging directive, Directive 94/62."
"These requirements seem to be too weakly defined."
"This is a view we have heard from industrial circles, but also from the national control authorities."
"It serves no good purpose for our firms to spend time and money unnecessarily because they are in doubt as to whether they are complying with the EU legislation."
"Similarly, it is not a good idea to leave the interpretation of these essential requirements to the national control authorities, with all the possibilities which that could entail in the form of technical barriers to trade and distortion of competition between the Member States."
"So, although I support the Commission's proposal for internal production control, I do not think it would be right to take this proposed directive any further before the essential requirements have been laid down in CEN standards."
"The Commission has itself admitted in our committee and in the Environment Committee that this proposal was put together in haste and is not as well thought through as might have been wished."
"I therefore believe, as our committee has concluded, that the only correct thing to do would be to hold the Commission to its responsibility and ask it to withdraw the proposal until the CEN and ISO have completed their work."
"Let me comment briefly on Mrs Grossetête's report."
"In the Liberal Group, we are very much in support of the proposed material identifications."
"The labelling scheme proposed by the rapporteur gives consumers real information and involves them in a positive way in relation to the environment."
"When consumers have to make a purchasing decision, they themselves can choose the type of packaging they prefer, and - most importantly of all - consumers are in a better position to sort the packaging waste."
"This information and this involvement of consumers generates a real, active and positive environmental effect."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report."
"I welcome attempts to harmonise the management of packaging waste while recognising the high initial cost of putting in place schemes for recovery, recycling and sorting of waste."
"The long-term benefits far outweigh these costs and will lead to a considerable reduction, if not total elimination, of the use of landfill as a waste disposal solution."
"We must take the long-term view when dealing with the disposal of packaging waste."
"Manufacturers must be encouraged to use far less packaging material."
"Quite often, for example, supermarket goods are wrapped several times."
"Marking symbols used on packaging to indicate in which category the waste belongs must not only be clear and easily understood but must use the same marking symbols and same colours right across the EU."
"Furthermore, bags and containers used for waste selection must also use the same colour codes and symbols in all the EU member countries."
"This is not the case at present."
"For serious package waste management to be successful such symbols must be easily identifiable by the consumer."
"Consumers will only participate in sorting and recovery schemes if they are simple to manage and if good collection of separated waste bags is available."
"Modern households living in confined spaces do not have room for holding or stockpiling waste for long periods."
"Children are naturally concerned about their environment."
"If they can be encouraged to give their support by starting their training in schools, the good practice will be continued in the home."
"The key message for success is to keep it simple."
"Otherwise it will fail."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speaker very clearly expressed what we should be trying to achieve with the packaging marking regulations under the packaging directive, which is that the consumer is actually able to select the correct means of disposing of packaging, in order to be as environment-friendly as possible."
"But we know that the Commission proposal is already obsolete, and it is now absolutely vital to wait for the Commission to revise the basic directive, the packaging directive of 1994, and incorporate its ideas and proposals for the marking of packaging accordingly."
"The Green Group intends to vote against this report, as, technically speaking, it would seem to be the only way to get the Commission to withdraw this obsolete proposal."
"Excellent though the work of Mrs Grossetête has been, I believe the only rational alternative is to get the Commission to withdraw its proposal."
"Mr President, the challenge is how to encourage the European consumer to sort packaging waste."
"I think the efforts of the Commission and the rapporteur to that end are well-intentioned, but will not achieve the desired effect."
"The Commission's proposal would mean that each Member State had to replace its marking symbols with European ones."
"I would not mind that if the markings were better, but in my opinion they are not."
"Given that there is no uniform collection system, all the proposed markings do is indicate that the product can be recycled."
"The sense of that escapes me."
"I would prefer, for example, the various Dutch symbols whose meaning is crystal-clear and which fit in with the Dutch system of collection."
"The proposals put forward by the rapporteur will not encourage the consumer either."
"She suggests indicating the type of packaging."
"This would use voluntary marking, but one form of marking only."
"The producer could not use any other form."
"So the Dutch bottle bank symbol, for example, would have to go."
"I do not think we are making it easy for the consumer if he has to decide for himself from a list of packaging ingredients how he should sort his waste."
"But I acknowledge that there are wide differences between the Member States in how packaging waste is collected."
"They do not all attach the same importance to environmentally friendly methods of collection."
"However, I think the solutions suggested by the Commission and the rapporteur are inadequate."
"There is a very real danger that they may be counter-productive."
"If accepted, these proposals may be very confusing to consumers not only in the Netherlands, but in other Member States as well."
"To conclude, if we want to provide an incentive for consumers, we must encourage the Member States to make serious efforts to set up an environmentally friendly system of collection."
"Until we have a uniform system of this kind, I see no point in harmonising markings."
"Mr President, the management and control of waste can be done through various processes: reducing the materials used, recycling, reusing and energy recovery."
"We support the development of all these methods of recovery and re-use, as the considerable development of the role played by packaging, with its functions of protection, safety, logistics, and especially of aiding marketing, means that we need to deal with the growing environmental burden it represents, without ignoring any procedure that could be useful."
"We will therefore vote in favour of all the amendments that have been tabled, except for Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 15 from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We reject Amendment No 13, because by specifying that packaging and packaging waste must be treated according to their marking, it favours one waste-management system over the others."
"We need all of these systems."
"Some people want to give priority to recycling and re-use of packaging, to the detriment of energy recovery: this approach is contrary to an integrated management of packaging and its waste."
"Amendments Nos 12 and 15 place all the responsibility for the conformity assessment procedure for packaging on the processor, and exonerate the packaging manufacturer from all responsibility: under the polluter pays principle, it is the packaging manufacturer who should be responsible for this procedure, not the packer."
"Moreover, it is much easier to monitor the packaging manufacturers, as they are much fewer in number than the processors: if we take the wine sector as an example, in France there are only a few bottle manufacturers for more than 30 000 bottlers, and this example is typical."
"To conclude, Mr President, if these three amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which we feel distort the nature of our colleague's report, are rejected, we will vote in favour of Mrs Grossetête's report."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament has put labelling of packaging on the agenda for today."
"As you all know, the Commission adopted this proposal back in 1996, and I would like to thank the Environment Committee and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, for the report."
"The reason why the Commission has presented this proposal is the obligation contained in Article 8 of Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste, which many speakers have also mentioned."
"Article 8 states: 'The Council shall... decide no later than two years after the entry into force of this Directive on the marking of packaging'."
"I realise that there has been some criticism, especially of the new symbols the Commission is introducing under the proposal."
"The intention of the symbols is to indicate to consumers that the packaging can be reused or recycled."
"However, the symbols are not meant to give any kind of assurance that the packaging will be reused or recycled, and that is clearly a problem."
"I was interested to see the report adopted by the Environment Committee."
"The proposed amendments - and this has also been made clear by the rapporteur herself - will completely alter the Commission's proposal."
"They will in fact turn it into a proposal on material identification."
"The symbols proposed by the rapporteur aim to inform the consumer on the packaging material."
"The symbols for aluminium, glass and plastic, however, also show 'chasing' arrows, thus indicating to the consumer that the materials are recyclable, and in this way could give misleading information."
"Then there is a further problem, in that we already have a Commission decision on material identification, Decision No 97/129, which was adopted on 28 January 1997."
"This establishes identification systems for packaging materials."
"Specific identification systems were introduced in the form of figures and abbreviations, applicable to plastics, paper, cardboard, metal, wood, textiles, glass and composites."
"The use of the identification system is voluntary."
"Under Article 3 of the Commission Decision, however, the system can be made compulsory."
"The proposed change from a labelling system for reusability and recyclability to one which serves as an identification system will not provide any value added in relation to the current Commission decision."
"For that reason - and this will hardly come as any surprise to the House - I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3 to 11, 13 or 14, nor can I accept Amendments Nos 16 and 18."
"There is another important aspect to the Commission proposal, and that concerns the procedure for the assessment of conformity."
"I would stress that there is an acute need for a procedure for conformity assessment, among both manufacturers and authorities, in order to check conformity with the essential requirements of Directive 94/62."
"I fully support Amendment No 12, which stipulates that all packaging must have undergone a conformity assessment procedure before it is put onto the market."
"Amendments Nos 2 and 21 are also acceptable, since they clarify and complement the proposal."
"It is important to stress that it is the manufacturer who is responsible for undertaking conformity assessments."
"I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 14 or Amendments Nos 19 and 20."
"Shared responsibility is not possible when conformity assessment procedures are to be implemented."
"The packaging manufacturer must ensure that the packaging produced and marketed is in conformity with the requirements of the packaging directive, i.e. Directive 94/62."
"In conclusion, let me stress again that I do not believe that consumers, manufacturers, authorities or the environment will gain any value added by turning this proposal into a proposal on voluntary material identification."
"Mrs Grossetête began by asking me a direct question, namely whether the Commission was already working on a new proposal."
"It is not."
"What may possibly have given rise to the rumours is that we have started discussions on a revision of the packaging directive, but we are still at a very, very early stage in those discussions, so it would be wrong to give the impression that we had a new proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0003/99) by Mr Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 79/112/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (COM(97)0020 - C4-0059/97-97/0027(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a report before us which has been occupying the European Parliament for a long time."
"Even during the preparation of the labelling directive, the question of listing the ingredients of alcoholic beverages was being discussed, but the move was blocked time and again by the Council."
"Commissioner Bangemann, so that we have no misunderstandings such as those which occurred at our last meeting at the same place and time, I should like to say from the outset that I am grateful for the timely presentation of this report."
"That is exactly what was agreed on during the conciliation procedure."
"I find that very professional."
"The Commission's proposal seeks to close a loophole, and that is to be welcomed."
"Unlike other foodstuffs and beverages, alcoholic beverages have hitherto been exempt from compulsory labelling of ingredients."
"For all the points under discussion, there is surely one thing on which the House is in agreement, namely that the labelling of ingredients has to be introduced in the interests of the single market and in the interests of proper consumer information."
"I should like to stress that we are all united on that point."
"Not only in the committee responsible for the report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but also in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, these Commission proposals have been supported and enhanced."
"The Commission proposal does not deal with the substantive aspects of ingredient labelling."
"Let me make that quite clear."
"It deals first and foremost with the question of the legislative procedures to be applied when the labelling provisions are laid down. Some widely differing ideas are surfacing here, and I must say that the situation starts to look precarious when the rapporteur and Members of the House attack each other, as for example in a press statement in which my honourable colleague Mrs Lulling implied that I had been guilty of obsessive behaviour and procrastination in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I should be grateful, Commissioner, if you would confirm afterwards that I came to see you a year ago and that we tried to urge the legal services of the Commission and Parliament to deliver a joint opinion."
"We do not seem to have succeeded in this, for I have not received any word as yet."
"That was also a reason why I hung fire, because I should have liked to know what was right."
"There are two divergent opinions on this matter."
"The proposal, in my view, is most probably designed to attract the support of the Council, but I do not think it is in any way logical."
"Three different legislative procedures for the same legislative measure, a measure of consumer protection, will elicit a protest from any Member of Parliament, especially if the codecision procedure is to apply only to spirits and aromatised wines."
"The Maastricht Treaty granted us the right of codecision in the domain of labelling, and I must insist on that right, not only in respect of spirits and aromatic wines, but also for beers and all other alcoholic beverages."
"It is surely high time we rid ourselves of this very frequent fault of ignoring expert opinion when we discuss wine and beer in the European Parliament."
"That is why I based my work on this report on the following principles: firstly, the provision of consumer information on foodstuff and beverage labels, including the labelling of alcoholic beverages, is essentially a measure relating to the single market, a measure of consumer protection."
"The relevant legislation is the foodstuff labelling directive."
"The listing of ingredients on labels must therefore comply with that directive."
"It is simply not true that, as someone is bound to assert in the course of this debate and as others have asserted before, the labelling of wine can only be dealt with in a set of special provisions because it constitutes agricultural produce."
"The agricultural aspect is irrelevant here; the issue is the labelling of products and the provision of consumer information."
"Secondly, when it comes to labelling the ingredients of alcoholic beverages, all such beverages must be treated equally."
"This applies both to the timescale, especially the simultaneous entry into force of the provisions, and to the procedures to be applied."
"There are no differences of opinion in Parliament on that principle."
"Thirdly, the equal treatment of all beverages does not exclude the possibility of specific labelling directives for each category of beverages to take account of the special features of the individual beverage types."
"The proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection allows for that option."
"The response of the industries concerned has shown me that equal treatment of all beverage categories is no mere pipe dream."
"It is not my job as a rapporteur, nor is it the task of Parliament as the legislative authority, to champion the cause of any particular industry."
"Our task is to provide a level playing field and to avoid discriminatory measures."
"That is why we insist that a uniform procedure must be applied and that the same timescale must apply to all categories of alcoholic beverage."
"This principle is enshrined in our committee's proposal."
"We shall have to decide tomorrow whether we want comprehensive parliamentary involvement or whether we wish to leave some labelling to the Council."
"I have to say, Mrs Lulling, that this is not obsessive; indeed, your press statement testifies to a lack of knowledge of this matter when it asserts that, under the Treaty, wine and spirits have to be labelled in accordance with the common organisation of the market in wine."
"Now that really is the most novel idea I have come across!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, emotions are running high in the Chamber."
"I believe the consumer should be informed, indeed the consumer must be informed."
"That is the principle, and we all agree with it."
"The difficulty comes when we have to decide in detail on the form that such information should take."
"We are talking today about the labelling of beverages with an alcoholic content in excess of 1.2 % by volume - an extremely wide variety of beverages, ranging from wine to fortified beverages and even to the so-called alcopops."
"Each beverage has its own special characteristics that distinguish it fundamentally from the others."
"Wine is a natural beverage made from grapes, and I believe the consumer is well informed about it."
"Above all, there are specific regulations which clearly define the ingredients that wine may and may not contain."
"It is a different story with the so-called designer drinks, the alcopops."
"A set of rules is urgently required here, first and foremost to establish that these are quite clearly alcoholic beverages, that they must be categorised as such when offered for sale and must not be placed on the same shelf as soft drinks."
"The Schnellhardt report does not deal with the details of labelling; our task today is merely to establish who should decide on these details at a future date."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports the Commission's proposal that labelling, wherever it may be required, should be prescribed in the specific Community provisions that already exist."
"We do feel, however, that the three-year period for implementation proposed by the Commission is too short, given the need to produce a sophisticated classification system, and we are therefore requesting an extension of that period."
"The labelling provisions for all other products should be laid down in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 189b of the Treaty."
"Criteria based on practical expertise must be paramount in the realm of labelling."
"Try telling wine growers and farmers that we need more directives!"
"For that reason we consider the Commission proposal to be acceptable, since we have specific Community rules in this area, and we can adapt them to cover labelling."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the best will in the world, it cannot be said of this report on the draft directive relating to the provisions on the labelling of alcoholic beverages that good things come to those who wait."
"For roughly two years the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been tinkering with its report, despite the fact that the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy delivered their opinions back in November and December 1997 respectively."
"Both committees adopted their opinions unanimously apart from two abstentions."
"In both committees, 74 Members took part in the votes on the opinions, which largely endorse the Commission proposal."
"The proposal only governs the procedure for labelling the ingredients of alcoholic beverages, but not the technical details of the information that should be displayed on labels."
"We have known since 1979 that the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament too are struggling to come up with a set of rules on the labelling of alcoholic beverages."
"Nevertheless, it is irresponsible of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection to fritter away a whole year after the submission of opinions by the committees consulted, only to present us with a hotly disputed report which was adopted in the first holiday week of January and for which only 24 Members voted, while 15 voted against it and one abstained."
"Why were such tactics adopted?"
"Because the rapporteur and the members of the Environment Committee who supported him simply refused to recognise that, under the Treaty, wine and spirits in their various forms are agricultural products, the production and marketing of which are subject to the common organisation of the market in wine."
"A different legal basis applies to all other alcoholic beverages, including beer."
"The European Commission has presented a logical proposal on where the rules relating to the ingredients in these two groups of alcoholic beverages will be determined - not how they will be determined, that will come later."
"The plain fact is that agricultural policy, whether it suits us or not, rests on the legal basis of Article 43, which only provides for Parliament to be consulted."
"As for the legal provisions on the labelling of other alcoholic beverages, which are industrial products, we now have the right of codecision."
"The fact that many people in this House plead the case for codecision and are trying - tous azimuts , on all fronts, as De Gaulle would have said - to achieve codecision where the Treaty does not provide for it may be understandable, although I personally have no time for such pettifoggers."
"The rapporteur's veritable obsession with securing a right of codecision on the labelling of agricultural products too - he was always speaking about it - is now reaching grotesque proportions, and as you are aware, Mr President, we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have reintroduced some reasonable amendments."
"We agree that the provisions on the labelling of ingredients for both beverage categories can enter into force simultaneously."
"We can also live with a three-year time limit for all of this, but anything else would be in contravention of the Treaty, which is why I hope that the House will agree with us."
"Mr President, I want to support the rapporteur against that attack from his own side."
"It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that this remained locked in committee for some time."
"It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that there has been a woeful refusal to see that common policies on labelling require common procedures."
"It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that there have - to put it mildly - been a number of obstructions."
"Most of the people in the committee believe that it is imperative and legitimate that Community provisions having the same objective should be subject to the same legislative procedure, namely that which is laid down in Article 189 of the EC Treaty."
"We want that to apply both to the specific Community provisions referred to here and to all other alcoholic beverages."
"We are not involved, and we do not want to be involved, in an argument about what should be on the label."
"That, for the moment, is the concern of another department."
"We do not want to be involved in a North-versus-South debate or one between those who have a particular sector of the agricultural market in their care against those who have other such sectors."
"We do not want to be involved in the stigmatising of alcoholic drinks with the sole exception of areas where new products may present a health hazard for the unwary."
"We want a uniform opinion."
"We want all recognised legitimate and traditional alcoholic products incorporated within it."
"That is why a series of amendments, most notably Nos 9 and 15, seek to include cider and perry on the standard list with wines, spirits and beers."
"I would appeal to the wine enthusiasts here to contribute to the spirit of compromise in bringing about a common procedure."
"We all have to do that."
"I have done it myself."
"I am prepared to accept Mr Bébéar's amendment, supported by the last speaker but one, with regard to the possible dangers of the new alcoholic beverages, the so-called alcopops."
"I do that in the full knowledge that these are made in my own constituency."
"The people who vote for me make these products."
"I am prepared to say on the record here and now that they can present health hazards and they need to be treated in a special way."
"I never hear any of that spirit of compromise from those who come here and tell us that the drinking of wine is a cultural experience, that somehow it should be left outside all the arrangements and scrutiny of this Parliament."
"Those who say that and make these rather dreary claims are not just insulting the intelligence of Europe's consumers - most of whom would strongly agree with Mr Schnellhardt and his long labours on this issue."
"Worse than that, they are insulting this Parliament itself."
"They are deliberately saying that there is an area of scrutiny and oversight in which this Parliament, in the matter of labelling, should play no part."
"I cannot accept that and I hope Parliament will not either."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beverages provide us with some of our nutrition."
"In my home state of Bavaria, we came to the conclusion back in the 15th century that the consumer also needed to know that his beer was brewed in accordance with precise rules, since beer, after all, is a significant part of the Bavarian diet."
"There are naturally other drinks as well."
"Doctors are now recommending that we consume at least three litres of liquid every day, and consumers have a wide range to choose from."
"However, it is important for them to know the quality that is available on the shelves."
"I do not believe that consumers would ever enquire whether a beverage comes under the common organisation of agricultural markets or under other areas of the single market. What they need is information that will help them to choose the right product."
"I am thinking of people who have perhaps already consumed too much alcohol and should not therefore drink any more, but this is also about people with diabetes, for example, who need to know how much residual sugar a beverage contains."
"These are all very important things nowadays, and I believe we need legislation that takes account of today's world and not only prescribes that beer and cider should be displayed in the opposite corner of the shop from wine, but actually provides us with a realistic legal basis."
"I only wish to appeal to reason."
"I believe that Mr Schnellhardt's report provides a rational basis, and I should be pleased if Parliament endorsed the material that Mr Schnellhardt has prepared."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Schnellhardt very much for an excellent report."
"I think it is important, as many of my colleagues have pointed out this evening, that we do not divide up the alcohol market in such a way that we have one thing in one corner and another somewhere else."
"It must be a precondition that uniform requirements for the labelling of ingredients apply equally to beer, wines and spirits."
"That is the first point."
"The second point is that the rules should come into force simultaneously, in order to avoid a situation in which different rules apply depending on whether one drinks beer, wine or spirits."
"And the third point is that, in order to ensure uniform rules, it is necessary that the same decision-making procedure should be used, that the same rules should be applied, with the full involvement of the European Parliament."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, therefore, I support Amendment No 1 calling for the addition of Article 129a as the legislative procedure."
"I also support Amendment No 23, which requires it to be indicated on the bottle how much alcohol or how many ingredients it contains, so that we car-drivers and others know how much we can drink from a health point of view."
"I also support Amendment No 12, which prefers the word 'ingredients' to the phrase 'prepared with', and finally - as I said before - it is very important that we treat alcoholic beverages uniformly, so I support Amendments Nos 15 and 9."
"I very much hope that we can adopt this report tomorrow."
"I am well aware that there are major differences between North and South, but I think it incredible - and I agree entirely with Mr Whitehead - that we should talk about culture in connection with wine drinking, whereas beer drinking is regarded as an expression of something completely different."
"In both cases, we are talking about liquids which are consumed at social gatherings or with a meal."
"So I very much hope that we can arrive at a situation in which all these things are dealt with uniformly and with the full involvement of Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive amending Directive 79/112/EEC concerns the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, in the alcoholic beverages sector."
"This proposal, which does not include rules on the listing of ingredients, nevertheless allows for the indication of these ingredients in the five Community regulations which already exist."
"The European Commission proposes that this information should enter into force within a period of three years from 1 July 1998."
"We would like to make the following comments."
"First of all we must congratulate the European Commission on taking account of the need for consumer information on the ingredients of alcoholic beverages."
"However, we must add to this the concerns that may arise regarding the new alcoholic beverages aimed at young people, known as premixes or alcopops, which are not mentioned in this proposal."
"The presentation and advertising of these drinks attract young people and could result in real damage to public health."
"It is therefore important that these drinks should be labelled with their ingredients and the percentage of alcohol."
"The European Commission urgently needs to present a text on these drinks, which are referred to as soft drinks but contain alcohol, and which must be displayed on the wines and spirits shelves in shops."
"Some of these drinks contain more than 3 to 4 % of alcohol by volume; the alcohol is of non-specific origin and the taste is covered up by sugar."
"With regard to the drinks that are affected by these labelling measures, and which are mentioned in Article 6(3), we should add to these aromatised wine-based beverages and aromatised wine-product cocktails, which are governed by Regulation 1601/91/EEC."
"Beer, meanwhile, is not subject to any specific Community regulation."
"It would normally be excluded from this article, which is why I would like to ask you to support Amendment No 14 and to reject Amendment No 9 by the rapporteur."
"This Article 6(3) fixes a period of three years from 1 July 1998 for the application of the labelling rules."
"This short period already seems to be impossible to apply, because it comes too soon after the adoption of the directive."
"The period proposed by Amendment No 14 is therefore much more realistic."
"Finally, as was pointed out by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the phrase ' élaborée à l'aide de' used in the French version seems less appropriate than the phrase ' préparée à l'aide de' ."
"We therefore prefer the latter form, which is also well known by consumers in the food sector."
"Mr President, 'grasp all, lose all', as we say in my country."
"I do not know whether this applies to Mr Schnellhardt, and I hope that his report, duly amended, will at last be adopted by this House."
"There is no doubt, however, that Mr Schnellhardt's desire to include wine among the beverages to be labelled in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 189b of the Treaty has caused a serious and inexcusable delay."
"Indeed, the Commission referred this proposal to Parliament on 10 February 1997."
"The committee responsible, the Environment Committee, appointed Mr Schnellhardt rapporteur on 16 April 1997, almost two years ago."
"And the proposal was an urgent one, all the more so because the Commission itself was behind the schedule laid down in Article 6 of Directive 79/112."
"Nevertheless, the Environment Committee - which normally examines and approves reports very rapidly, thanks to the efficiency of its chairman - had to discuss this matter no fewer than three times over the two years; this was compounded by an unspecified number of strategic postponements, sometimes due to elections."
"Why?"
"Because, believing that Parliament's decision should be as broad-based as possible - a view shared by us all - Mr Schnellhardt sought to remove wine from the scope of the specific measures relating to it, overlooking the fact that, in the case of wine, labelling forms an integral part of its definition: table wine, quality wine and so on."
"Those of us who represent regions which are proud to be major producers of wine cannot agree, and I am grateful to the group to which I have the honour of belonging for allowing me to say so in this House."
"No, we cannot agree."
"It is not - or not merely - so as to protect producers, even though that profession certainly does deserve our consideration, given the esteem in which it is held throughout the world; it is not - or not merely - so as to protect production in our regions; it is also, and I would say above all, so as to protect consumers in Europe and elsewhere."
"Among these, ladies and gentlemen, I would include keen beer-drinkers, just in case they should decide - and I hope so for their sakes - to drink a good glass of wine once in a while."
"Mr President, from a public health perspective it would be difficult to envisage a more important area of administration than the regulations governing food quality."
"From an agricultural perspective, it is to the credit of our farmers and the food processing industry that they are to the forefront in providing quality food products in a manner compatible with consumer requirements."
"From the point of view of agricultural reform, it goes without saying that the process of extensification is a credible production base for quality raw material for the food sector."
"While it has a cost factor for producers, it has not, unfortunately, resulted in a better financial response in the market place."
"Since the agricultural economies of European Union and third countries are moving steadily towards globalisation, it is crucial in the context of the next World Trade talks that those countries committed to food quality and consumer requirements are not put at a disadvantage by countries such as the United States, as is happening at the present time."
"I fully support the concept of clear, non-technical and standardised labelling of food products."
"However, we need to be careful, in our desire for traceability and transparency, to avoid over-regulation which could lead to lack of innovation and research into new products."
"On genetically modified organisms I would repeat my earlier statements."
"No food product which is genetically modified or contains ingredients which have been genetically modified should be released into the food chain until it has been fully tested, and only then with clear labelling."
"To allay consumer concern in this regard, I suggest the colour coding of all labels containing genetically modified ingredients."
"I also call for an educational programme on the process of genetic engineering as applied to agriculture."
"Concerns in this regard should be based on fact and not as a response to campaigns designed to play on the fears of consumers."
"From this point of view we must have an effective educational programme for consumers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schnellhardt, I think that you are all wrong."
"I do not think that you have understood our approach."
"I really think that you are mistaken."
"Mr Whitehead, I am a doctor."
"I do not accept that you could suppose for one moment that I support alcoholism."
"Every day I fight the battle against this scourge."
"I cannot accept you talking to us about alcopops."
"These are evil, deadly drinks which we should remove from consumption and which are dangerous to young people."
"Mr Whitehead and Mr Schnellhardt, I would like you to think a little about our European culture, which, Mr Whitehead, is represented by savouring a quality wine or whisky in moderation, as part of festivities."
"I do not think, my friends, that you realize that not long ago, less than a fortnight ago, we passed an essential reform, the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine."
"On that occasion we tried to defend the principles of quality and of regionalisation, and the principles of respect for our traditions involving wine and alcoholic beverages, in the interests of the consumer and the diversity that we have across Europe."
"Labelling, Mr Schnellhardt, is an integral part of what we adopted, providing rules for the presentation of wine and telling people what may be represented by descriptions and designations of origin, such as the châteaux, the Rivesaltes, Prädikat wines, as you say in German, Mr Schnellhardt, Q&A, and so on."
"In short, we are here to defend a particular culture."
"We are following our approach towards the recent common organisation of the market in wine."
"We want to respect consumers, we want to protect wine, and we will therefore vote against you, Mr Schnellhardt, tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his clear and concise introduction to what is a complex, emotive and difficult piece of legislation."
"As regards the labelling of alcoholic beverages, my position is that consumers have a right to transparency and complete openness."
"Labelling of all consumer products and in particular all food items, including soft and alcoholic drinks, is essential to give the consumer a clear description of the items concerned."
"I realise that traditional products have not normally carried labels as to their content."
"Also, labelling cannot solve all problems."
"Labelling must be accurate and checked to ensure consumer confidence."
"Inaccurate and uncontrolled declarations are useless and bring the whole system into disrepute."
"Despite all these problems, labelling has an important role and should apply to all food products including alcoholic beverages."
"In the vote I would like to see the proposal to include beer extended to include cider also."
"Therefore I will be supporting Amendment No 15 as well as Amendment No 9."
"To conclude, consumer information must be complete and accurate."
"I therefore support the declaration of ingredients on all food items."
"Mr President, I have been involved in these debates for eleven years now, and I have experienced all the various efforts to rationalise the area we are discussing again this evening."
"The Commission has now made another attempt, which actually focuses more on procedural and less on substantive issues, because if we begin with the substance, this proposal will suffer the same fate as the first two proposals."
"We shall not make any progress."
"For that reason the approach adopted by the rapporteur, which is the same approach we suggested in our proposal, is undoubtedly the right basis."
"I cannot interfere in internal disputes."
"It is true that I spoke to the rapporteur, but I do not know whether he delayed the proposal, Mrs Lulling."
"On the other hand, I have a natural inclination to believe everything you say."
"However, I have no wish to interfere in this matter."
"What did we propose, and what is this argument actually about?"
"I do not intend to involve myself in the question of whether one product is culturally superior, although a great deal could be said about that."
"After all, wine is mentioned in the Bible, and that is certainly something!"
"As far as these things are concerned, we should not be engaging now in any sort of Kulturkampf between wine and beer or between wine-growing areas and beer-brewing areas. We should be considering how we can ensure that the information which is important to the consumer is actually on the label."
"That, in short, is what we all want to achieve."
"That is certainly an aim on which there are no differences."
"If that is our common aim, we cannot ignore the fact that there are already very detailed specific rules for certain alcoholic beverages, as well as very experienced institutions which exercise responsibility for ensuring compliance with these rules."
"That is really no more than what we are proposing."
"We are not trying to say that there is a difference in quality between wine and beer, or between beer and grappa or whatever; the real question is whether we make use of what we already have and thereby avoid any duplication of effort."
"The wine market and the rules governing the sale of wine are already highly sophisticated, and if we were now to overlay the whole structure, as it were, with a set of general provisions, Mr Schnellhardt, the result would surely be a situation in which consumers would tend to lose their bearings and in which producers could face the biggest problems."
"That is really the only crucial difference."
"Now I could not fail to notice during the discussion that there are very widely differing positions on this issue in Parliament."
"That always suits us, because we can then wait and see which position prevails."
"That is precisely what I would suggest we do in this case."
"However, I can imagine that the Council will be more inclined to subscribe to our proposal."
"But there too, of course, we can wait and see."
"I should therefore like to move on now to say a few words on the various amendments, so that you can consider our positions on these when deciding how to vote."
"We can accept Amendment No 3, which proposes an additional recital enunciating the two aims of the proposal, namely consumer protection and consolidation of the single market."
"We certainly have no problem with that."
"The same applies to Amendment No 17."
"Amendment No 1 is unnecessary in our opinion, as there is no need to supplement the legal basis by adding a reference to Article 129a of the Treaty, because Article 100a also covers consumer protection."
"In any event, I have no intention of interfering in the dispute between the legal services."
"We made this proposal in the way we always make proposals."
"We chose what seemed to us to be the most logical legal basis."
"If there is a feeling that Article 43 should also be included because we are dealing with disparate products, that can naturally be done too."
"I have said that we make a distinction between wine, aromatised wines and spirits because we already have comprehensive Community rules for these, including provisions on labelling."
"It seems logical to us that the rules on the listing of ingredients on the labels of these beverages - we shall still have to reach agreement on the substance of those rules, of course - ought to be adapted in the framework of the new provisions."
"We shall certainly have new provisions, but they must serve as the basis for the adaptation of these specified rules, and not vice versa."
"For beverages that are not covered by Community regulations, such as beer and cider, the labelling provisions must be laid down in Commission directives."
"The question will then arise, Mr Schnellhardt, as to the legal basis we have to adopt and the form of parliamentary involvement."
"I appreciate that Parliament naturally prefers to work with a procedure that requires, or virtually requires, its consent and thereby strengthens the position of Parliament."
"But this cannot be taken so far that the principle is even applied in cases where it offers no practical benefit."
"There is no point in waging a conflict of competence at someone else's expense."
"I consider that very unwise."
"We can accept the improvements of wording in Amendment No 14, and we can also accept the extension to five years of the time-limit for the adoption of procedures."
"But that should then apply to all products."
"Amendment No 19 proposes that it should only apply to wine and spirits."
"We believe that this amounts to unfair treatment, which we cannot accept."
"For the same reason, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 11, 16 and 20 or the second part of Amendments Nos 9 and 15."
"The first part of Amendments Nos 9 and 15 is acceptable to us."
"Amendments Nos 2, 10 and 18, which are evidently designed to make Article 6 of Directive 79/112 directly applicable to other beverages such as cider or new industrial products, are unacceptable to us, because we should have to insist on the listing of ingredients on the labels of these beverages as soon as the amending directive was adopted, whereas the same requirement would not yet apply to wine, beer and spirits."
"This means that we should then have another case of unfair treatment, although this time the boot would be on the other foot."
"As far as these beverages are concerned, by the way, the real problem has more to do with consumers being misled, which is due in many cases to strict application of Article 2 of Directive 79/112."
"This could very easily be resolved through the watchdog bodies in the Member States."
"It is not so much a matter of new rules."
"We suggested in our proposal that the list of ingredients should be preceded by the words 'produced from' in cases where it is impossible to include every ingredient in the list."
"It could be decided, for example, not to include water among the contents of many of these beverages, such as whisky, because it is not one of the active ingredients."
"Mrs Schleicher put forward an argument that might be difficult to sustain."
"She said that when consumers are already under the influence of alcohol to a certain extent, they can consult the label on the beverage to see whether they can drink another glass of it, but I submit that by the time they reach that state, they will no longer be able to read the label anyway!"
"We are not happy with the wording of Amendments Nos 12 and 22, which implies in some languages that wine is the product of a manufacturing process, and so we do not wish to accept those amendments."
"We cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 and 13 either, but we shall incorporate the standard article on consulting the Scientific Committee; in other words, we accept the role of the Scientific Committee in principle."
"Amendments Nos 23 and 24 relate to the problem of alcoholism."
"That is no more a subject for this debate than the GMO problem - the honourable Member who raised the question of genetically modified organisms has left already."
"The problem, of course, has already been the subject of an expert opinion from the medical side."
"Mr Schnellhardt, by the way, is a medic too."
"You specialists can discuss this later among yourselves."
"Heckling"
"Vets are also medics, and animals are sometimes harder to treat than humans."
"On the other hand, I have to admit that alcoholism is not a great problem among animals!"
"Let me ask in conclusion that we establish our agreement on one point, namely that these are truly products with a long tradition."
"We need not pit one tradition against the other in a Kulturkampf , but it is clear that these traditions are worth preserving."
"The problem of alcoholism does not arise in connection with beverages that a consumer buys and drinks because he or she values its taste and quality."
"No consumer will buy a bottle of Pétrus or Amarone in order to get drunk."
"There are certainly cheaper ways to do that, and this is something we all have to appreciate."
"We cannot be indiscriminate and lump everyone together."
"That would be unfair to many people - including, incidentally, the average consumer of alcoholic beverages."
"Consumers are not so stupid that they cannot obtain information unless we prescribe labels for them to read."
"We should not think of consumers as beings that we alone can release from ignorance."
"I do not object to having a little more information on a label, but I know exactly which alcoholic beverages I drink and which ones I do not."
"Within the various categories too, I choose very carefully, even if there is no information at all on the label."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m."
"Year 2000 computer problem"
"The next item is the report (A4-0014/99) by Mr A.J. Donnelly, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The year 2000 computer problem (COM(98)0102 - C4-0233/98)."
"Mr President, this is an extremely important issue for the business community and for citizens within the European Union."
"Individual citizens own many products."
"They travel by different forms of transport."
"They use public utilities."
"All of these will be affected by the computer problem associated with the year 2000."
"While some months ago many members of the public believed that this was a problem only for computer companies, it is now very clear that the issue of the millennium bug will affect all citizens in every aspect of their lives."
"The most important thing for the European Union to do in the course of this year is to make sure that all social groups and every part of the business community are made fully aware of the potential complications of the millennium bug."
"I am less concerned about the way in which major multinationals are preparing to deal with this issue."
"It is pretty clear that if you are a major multinational you can afford and probably have had experts working on this issue for several years."
"But we know that within the European Union there are approximately 18 million small enterprises."
"How many of those have identified whether or not they have potential problems after 1 January 2000 because of systems they are operating within that small business?"
"In some countries - my own included - several thousand experts have been appointed to go round and help the small business community to identify whether a small business will be affected."
"But across the whole of the European Union, given the importance of the small business community to the EU, we need to make sure that as much pressure as possible is exerted on the Member States to provide the same facility in all 15 countries."
"I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could explain to us this morning whether there is any surveillance programme to identify whether all 15 Member States are providing expertise to help in advising the small business community on how the millennium bug could affect them."
"In relation to public utilities - electricity, gas, water and so forth - it is essential that they too manage their own affairs in relation to the millennium bug."
"It would be disastrous for citizens in the European Union if, because of inadequate preparation, the public sector and the public utilities found they had problems after 1 January 2000."
"What measures are being taken across the European Union to have a coordinated response and to ensure that proper information is going to the public services in this area?"
"As far as European Union legislation is concerned, there is a body of legislation dealing with liability for defective services, product safety and other liability legislation."
"What is not clear to me is whether we will be applying those product liability directives to any problem that might occur in relation to the millennium bug."
"In the United States, for example, they have considered waiving liability legislation so that companies are not affected by the failure of their products or services."
"Will European citizens be able to call upon product liability and defective services liability legislation in the European Union in the event of goods or services not operating as a result of the millennium bug?"
"This is a matter people in the European Union want answers to."
"Can they resort to law if they find they have problems?"
"There are two final points I want to deal with."
"What contingency plans are Member States making and what collective initiatives are taking place across the European Union in the event - God forbid - of a serious problem associated with a major industry within the EU?"
"What action is being taken by the civil authorities to prepare for a potential disaster in one or another part of the EU?"
"For example, are the Interior Ministers discussing whether or not there needs to be a contingency plan for 1 January 2000?"
"Some people may say that this is a Cassandra trying to paint a very black picture but the fact is that we do not know whether there are potentially very disastrous problems waiting round the corner."
"Finally, with regard to our external relations."
"Around our borders we have relations with the Eastern European countries and with the former Soviet countries."
"They have extensive nuclear installations which we know are already in a very serious state of decline."
"What work is being done by the European Union to secure these nuclear installations and other major utilities around our borders against potential disaster because of a lack of preparation by these other countries?"
"This is not just a European Union problem but could have very serious implications, in particular in very sensitive sectors such as the energy sector, unless we make proper preparations."
"This is critically important to us."
"It is not only computer buffs who should be concerned."
"It is for every citizen to recognise the danger to their own livelihood and risks to our safety."
"The Commission and the Parliament must make it very clear that we will push throughout this year to guarantee that all steps that can be taken are taken to secure the safety of our citizens, to secure the legal rights of our citizens and to secure the prospects for our business community, together with the safety of our neighbours at this very critical time, as a result of the changes in technology."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my good friend and colleague Mr Donnelly on an excellent report which covers most aspects of the problems associated with the millennium bug."
"This report has not come too soon - rumours of it being on the agenda of the December part-session are unfounded!"
"In my own country, estimates are that the millennium bug problems could cost up to 2 % of GDP."
"Given that growth in many countries is estimated at below 2 %, this is a very unsatisfactory position and everything should be done to try to minimise the impact of the problem, in particular with regard to public services, business, transport, domestic problems and, as Mr Donnelly mentioned, the threat to safety."
"The most worrying of all is nuclear safety and we know that there are problems in Central and Eastern Europe and possibly elsewhere."
"I should like to address three areas which give cause for concern."
"These are public awareness, liability in the case of failure and, thirdly, the issue we have touched on, namely safety."
"In terms of public awareness, I know that there are programmes in each Member State to give information to consumers in particular, but also businesses."
"I would call on the Commission to use the European Information Centres to distribute information to ensure that the public and businesses are aware of their responsibilities and the risks involved in not preparing for the year 2000."
"Business awareness is a problem for the reasons I have outlined and its effects on economic performance."
"The wait-and-see attitude which some businesses are adopting is unsatisfactory."
"The situation could be far worse than they could possibly imagine."
"In terms of liability in the case of failure, consumers should be protected."
"The present position of whether it is unavoidable failure or unforeseen is inadequate."
"Many insurers are trying to shirk their responsibilities."
"Consumers should be insured on the basis that it is reasonable for the consumer to expect recompense, given the age of a particular product."
"Finally, on safety."
"Obviously, the nuclear industry is an area of concern - and Mr Donnelly touched on this."
"Transport is another."
"All attempts should be made to build in fail-safe measures where there are doubts about the proper functioning of equipment after the year 2000."
"I commend this report to the House and congratulate Mr Donnelly again."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate Alan Donnelly very warmly on this first-rate report."
"I think he gives an excellent answer to all the questions of concern to the European Union here."
"It is not his fault that the report is late, it is just one of those things. It looks as if the European Union is reluctant to shoulder its responsibilities in this area, and I should like to put the following question to Commissioner Bangemann."
"At one of the meetings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, he said that the millennium problem was not really all that serious."
"We would find in the year 2000 that it had all been 'hype' on the part of the software manufacturers."
"What I actually want to ask him is how seriously does he now think we need to address the millennium problem at European Union level?"
"I will focus on four points."
"The first is the problem of 'chain reactions'."
"We all know that you cannot solve the millennium problem at local, regional or national level alone, you have to look too at the EU dimension as a whole."
"But obviously all these things are closely interrelated."
"The better we are able to map and resolve the problem of potential chain reactions, the more successful we shall be in tackling the millennium problem."
"From the point of view of the internal market, I therefore think it is most important that we pay attention to what develops with regard to potential chain reactions in this area and at European Union level."
"The example of electricity is a very familiar one."
"If the system cannot cope somewhere in one country, the integrated nature of the electricity grid means that this will have major repercussions on other countries in and outside the European Union."
"The second point is liability."
"We know that efforts are now under way in a number of Member States to discuss who will be responsible for what, if and when the millennium bug actually strikes."
"Some insurance companies have set aside funds, others have not."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner how he is handling this manifestation of the internal market?"
"Because if liability is well regulated in one Member State of the European Union and not in another - take the problem of embedded software, for example - how ultimately are we going to deal with that?"
"I do not think the European Union can remain passive on this question."
"My third point is awareness."
"Awareness of the millennium problem means firstly that plans have to be made, above all that tests have to be run, and also that the public has to be shown what we are actually doing and what the effects of our endeavours are."
"The more clearly we can show our people that we are on top of things, that we are working on the problem and that it is of course soluble, the more I think popular confidence will increase."
"I think that is most important."
"My final point concerns the nuclear sector."
"We have no idea what will happen here."
"So I think it is most important to pay a great deal more attention to this, because it may be an area of increasing popular anxiety."
"So I would urge the Commissioner and his colleagues to clarify what we are doing in Central and Eastern Europe and what we are doing in Russia, because there is of course a big question mark over that in particular, and so our citizens need to be given clear information on that point as well."
"Finally, Mr President, a question for you."
"What is the European Parliament doing to ensure that the European Parliament is millennium-compliant?"
"Perhaps you could tell us presently what Parliament is doing."
"I am very curious to know."
"Mr President, I too must compliment Mr Donnelly on his excellent report."
"I should like to take up one point which previous speakers have also made."
"On 1 January 2000 many computers will think, if they are not millennium-compliant, that the clock has suddenly been turned back to 1900."
"This carries great risks to the economy, to the environment and to people."
"Above all, I find the situation in Russia and a number of Central and Eastern European countries alarming."
"Due to the economic crisis there, efforts to deal with the millennium problem, which had in any case not received a great deal of priority, have virtually ground to a halt."
"Now I know that people there say that some computers do not have the problems we have in the West. But we cannot be sure of that."
"To be on the safe side, I recently paid a working visit to the only nuclear power plant which my country boasts."
"I found there that they had been working for a full year to make the plant millennium-compliant."
"I also raised the question of the Central and Eastern European countries, which they were certainly aware of, and they were not happy about what is going on there."
"So I am grateful to Mr Donnelly for having incorporating my amendment on this point."
"Mr van Velzen raised the matter of liability, and I would mention that all insurance policies exclude disasters involving nuclear energy or other nuclear disasters."
"So that is one more reason to give some thought to this question."
"I still believe that the European Union should give a lead here and be open and honest on the subject, together with Russia and Eastern Europe."
"It is high time that we accepted our responsibilities, and I think account must be taken of this in our aid programmes."
"A variety of studies show that it can be done at relatively modest cost."
"The total cost of resolving the Russian millennium problem is put at USD 100 million."
"I think that would be money well spent."
"If we, the citizens of the European Union, want to be sure of a safe roll-over into the new millennium, then we too must be prepared to get our wallets out."
"Time is getting on."
"We have no time left, and the responsibility rests with the West just as much as with the East."
"So I would urge Commissioner Bangemann to place this subject high on the agenda, not just because of the risks of not being insured, but above all because of the damage to the environment if things do get irretrievably out of control."
"Mr President, I should like to begin with a confession."
"I am a complete technophobe and clearly this is why my group has chosen me to speak on this complex topic."
"I have read Mr Donnelly's splendid report and commend him for it."
"A thought did occur to me."
"Has he checked out that the Labour Party computers at Millbank Tower have been programmed to take account of the change so that all Members will remain on message in the year 2000 as they have in 1999?"
"Clearly this is an important issue."
"One fundamental question which occurred to me when I read the report is: how did it happen that computer designers and software designers were allowed to make and programme machines in such a way?"
"Everyone knew that the year 2000 was approaching but it did not seem to occur to them to sort out this rather fundamental fault in the process of design."
"Then the question arises: what about the matter of liability for any damage that occurs if these machines crash?"
"Could we sue Mr Gates for his many billions of dollars for his responsibility in the process?"
"Or perhaps we could nationalise him as one US economist recently suggested."
"I have read that the British Government has done some serious preparation for this but I was slightly alarmed to read in the papers the other day that the Italian Government - I do not want to criticise my Italian friends - has just set up a study group, with no offices, no budgets and no resources, to look at this problem only nine months before the event."
"It seems to me a little late in the day."
"Indeed, Parliament is also a little late in the day with its report."
"But I am sure that Commissioner Bangemann will tell us that the Commission is well advanced with its planning."
"Finally, might I suggest that to restore confidence in Europe, Commissioner Kinnock could take to the air and fly on the eve of the year 2000 and that Commissioner Bangemann should resurrect his well-known feats on motorcycle with Mr Barton and travel through the traffic systems of Brussels on the back of Mr Barton's motorcycle."
"That would reassure the citizens of Europe that the Commission has the situation well in hand."
"Mr President, if computers jump from '99' to '00' on 1 January next, no one knows exactly what the consequences will be."
"They may be far-reaching."
"But it may also be that the millennium problem exists mainly in people's heads, planted there by software manufacturers eager to make a fast buck."
"The millennium problem brings us unequivocally up against the limitations of human knowledge and ability."
"To anyone who puts all his trust in technology, the millennium problem must be a huge disappointment."
"A mere trifle like leaving out the digits '19' from the year gives rise to a life-threatening situation."
"We are too quick to forget that all technology is the work of human beings."
"We can fool ourselves that we are all-powerful and talk about the 'triumph of technology', but meanwhile that same technology is an enormous threat."
"Recital C of the resolution rightly points the finger at the economic considerations which led to the year being displayed as two digits only."
"In a way, we wanted the new computer technology to produce economic results too fast."
"Is this not the root of a great number of current social and cultural problems?"
"We are addicted to the pursuit of profit and economic gain."
"Everything has to give way to that imperative, including the natural world and our very human existence itself."
"It is therefore particularly regrettable that Mr Donnelly's report embroiders further on the theme of the problem-solving ability of human intelligence."
"Of course we have to try to prevent possible disasters."
"But I think we need equally to reflect on the deeper cultural and religious causes."
"Mr President, it is not quite ten months to the turn of the century."
"Despite that, the testing of computer systems is lagging behind in many sectors, and has not even yet begun in all of them."
"There are some who do not even know anything about the problem at all."
"The European Parliament is quite rightly addressing the possible problems the year 2000 will cause, the so-called 'Y2K' problem."
"However, it lays the main emphasis on cooperation from its Member States and the western world."
"But the problems are not confined to here."
"It is well known, and it has been pointed out here, that in Russia and its immediate surroundings there is a lack of intellectual and material resources to solve the problem."
"Air traffic needs up-to-date computer systems, particularly for computer-based air-traffic control systems and in modern aircraft that rely on computers; and nuclear power stations are global problems that affect us all."
"Failure to upgrade systems could constitute a serious danger to health and present other types of risk for people in various parts of the world."
"The issue is neither a political nor an ideological one, and in dealing with it borders must not act as barriers."
"The EU must invest in finding a solution on a broad scale that transcends its own borders and that looks at the problem from the human angle."
"It is preferable to make this investment sooner rather than later, as delay could prove costly."
"The images of horror that have been painted by over-imaginative science-fiction writers, conjuring up apocalyptic visions, must not be allowed to come true."
"The responsibility is a global one."
"Mr President, I basically agree with Mr Donnelly's excellent report, though his comments about SMEs in recital D need to be modified a little."
"It is certainly not true that smaller firms lack specialist technical knowledge; on the contrary, SMEs are the ones that generate innovation and research in many fields."
"Their structure and specialist technical knowledge mean that they are able to react quickly to any software problems that come up."
"On the other hand, however, if major firms or public administrations have computer problems, these could have a massive impact on SMEs."
"The rapporteur's comments on the nuclear sector in Eastern Europe and Russia are extremely important."
"This is a field that is receiving huge financial support from the European Union, but up to now, unfortunately, we have not seen any significant improvement in the safety of nuclear power plants."
"It is now high time to make sure that the funding available really is used to improve reactor safety."
"It is probably unrealistic to hope that the nuclear power stations will be shut down by the year 2000, so we must at least ensure that there are no breakdowns caused by the year 2000 problem."
"We need to give top priority to eliminating any risk to the population of Europe, since Europe's taxpayers have after all provided a lot of money for nuclear safety in Eastern Europe and Russia."
"Mr President, the subject we are dealing with today, the 'Millennium bug', is an extremely impenetrable one for the majority of our fellow citizens."
"To save time, I will simply say that it is like a grain of sand that can cause the most sophisticated machine to grind to a halt."
"But we must look beyond this."
"I believe that it actually defines the limits of our so-called modern society, a short-term society built on sand, a society that often cannot see beyond the end of its nose."
"For the sake of saving a few minuscule bytes in systems software, two generations of computer programmers have deliberately ignored the advent of the new millennium."
"Even today, we still do not know how big an effect such irresponsible behaviour will have."
"As the saying goes, to govern is to predict."
"Well, this is proof that no-one is governing our world any longer."
"Mitterrand, Fabius and Clinton are all fighting the same war: that of the generation of those who prefer to use politics to serve their own purposes rather than their people."
"This is a generation where the irresponsible are in charge. This is a generation that knowingly lets populations slowly poison themselves with contaminated blood, that builds nuclear power stations knowing full well that one day they will blow up in our faces, and that would rather fly bombers over innocent crowds to detract from their sexual dalliances and conceal them."
"This whole issue of computer faults is not as innocuous as it may seem."
"It is a symptom, amongst others, of this climate of decline and of the widespread shunning of responsibility, where no-one has to answer to anyone any longer."
"Unfortunately, the other side of this issue is that, once again, our leaders will probably not take this new lesson seriously, and that is a shame."
"Mr President, it is not true that Parliament has come to this problem too late, because it is something we have discussed on a number of occasions over the past few years, and the Commission has constantly reported on what it has been doing."
"We have been looking at the problem for four years now and have tried to do everything we can."
"I would like to thank Alan Donnelly for spelling out in his report exactly what our responsibility is and where efforts can still be made over the next few months."
"I must point out straight away that he is no Cassandra, because Cassandra's predictions were always right."
"Her problem was that everything she said was always true, but this is not the case with Alan Donnelly."
"I am sure that some of the fears expressed here in this debate will not come true at all."
"Let me begin by telling you what the Commission has been doing."
"The first problem was to make everyone aware that there was a problem, and that it affected them."
"I think we have now got this message across, partly thanks to the rather exaggerated reports of impending doom."
"The good thing about these kinds of hysterical reports is that even when they are completely exaggerated, they still have the effect of making people sit up and listen."
"All these horror stories of planes plummeting from the skies, electricity failures and the Labour Party being unable to count its members alarmed people so much - particularly the last of the three - that now everybody knows we have a problem on our hands."
"This was the most important priority, so in itself it is no bad thing."
"The Commission did what it could to help here, focusing particularly on small and medium-sized firms."
"From the outset, we involved the Member States and international authorities such as the Atomic Energy Commission in Vienna in our discussions."
"Of course, we had to try to ensure that the various measures were carried out by those in the best position to do so, so we did not try to do everything ourselves, but tried instead to provide the various responsible bodies with the highest possible levels of specialist knowledge, and in some cases also with funding."
"For example, we provided the atomic energy authority with funding to enable it to carry out operations in Eastern Europe."
"So we tried to get a whole series of organisations and responsible bodies involved, and in particular those directly affected in private industry."
"The result is reasonably good."
"It is true that the smaller firms, as usual, face bigger problems, since they do not have the manpower or often the money which they need - there is now software that can solve most of the problems, of course, but it is relatively expensive, so there is also the problem of affordability."
"We have been doing everything we have listed in the communication."
"We have had regular meetings with the Member States, and we have worked together, and are continuing to do so, with the relevant international organisations in the financial, telecommunications, energy and transport fields."
"These fields were not chosen at random, but because they vary in the way in which they use computers."
"For example, if you have computers that are designed and programmed to run according to a regular timetable, they are more likely to suffer from the problem than computers that have nothing to do with regular timetables and simply collect data."
"The data are not linked to particular time intervals and will therefore not be affected by the millennium bug."
"So this is something else that needs to be looked into."
"Nevertheless, we are working with all those concerned to try to establish exactly what they can do and what we have to do to ensure that the various infrastructure sectors carry on operating smoothly."
"If people wanted, the Commission could even do more, particularly in the way of providing financial support."
"But the sums that the individual private firms affected need to spend are so great that it is hard to imagine any public authorities being able to afford to pay them."
"Of course, we have done everything that needs to be done to guarantee immediate security, but many of those involved are also doing a great deal at their own expense to protect their own interests."
"I cannot imagine any airport in the world that works with computer systems and that has not found a solution to the problem by now, and it would be absolutely unthinkable if there were airlines that had not now taken the necessary precautions on board their aircraft."
"What else can we do to adapt the legal provisions if necessary?"
"This is an interesting question, because it is an area where we could already be taking action."
"We have looked into this too."
"Legal rules already exist to deal with problems such as this, because in legal terms it is nothing new."
"Anyone who makes a mistake when supplying a product or service must of course take responsibility if it is a culpable error or if there is no-fault liability."
"Firms which use a lot of suppliers working with these kinds of systems have in many cases already written to them to point out that if there is any disruption they will hold the suppliers responsible."
"In other words, they themselves have let their suppliers know that they will be held to be at the very least negligent if they do not tackle the problem."
"This is why we do not think it would be a good idea to propose new legal rules."
"Alan Donnelly mentioned the 'Good Samaritan Legislation', the new American law designed to promote the provision of information by limiting liability for declarations of millennium compliance."
"Of course, this does not encourage people to tackle the millennium bug, quite the reverse, unfortunately."
"So we think that the existing legal rules, together with the information that suppliers are being given, will be enough to deal with the problem in legal terms."
"Of course, this will not be the case everywhere."
"For example, someone asked whether Parliament will continue to operate after the year 2000."
"This is a question not of legal responsibility but of political expedience, and the Commission does not wish to comment on it at the moment."
"Someone else asked what we are doing about our own computer systems."
"It would hardly be good for the Commission if we spent five years telling everyone to do something about the problem but failed to do anything ourselves."
"Of course we have ensured that our own systems will operate."
"A project designed to ensure that they are millennium-compliant is nearing completion."
"Once we have done the tests, we will be able to inform you that the Commission at least will be operating after the year 2000, if that is any consolation to you!"
"Mr President, I asked if you would be willing to tell the House what preparations the European Parliament is making to deal with the millennium problem."
"We now know what the Commission is doing, but can you tell honourable Members what stage Parliament has reached?"
"I will convey your request to the President of Parliament and ask him to communicate with you in due course."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 11 a.m."
"Safety, hygiene and health protection at work"
"Mr President, I should like to start by discussing the annual reports of the two health and safety committees."
"Both the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work and the permanent body for safety and hygiene in coalmines and other extractive industries work on the tripartite principle, which I hope the Community will adopt to a greater extent in the future."
"Both committees suffer from a lack of resources."
"Even so, they have succeeded in doing an excellent job."
"However, we should be thinking of ways to make the work of the committees more effective, such as through reorganisation, and to put their expertise to better use."
"The most important aspect of the Community's activities in the area of health and safety at work is legislation and its application."
"Considerable progress has been made in this field."
"Whereas in 1996 the Member States had transposed 74 % of the directives on health and safety at work into their national legislation, that figure has now risen to 95 %."
"Acceptance of the directives themselves, however, still does not mean they are being interpreted and applied correctly or that they are producing concrete results at the workplace."
"Enforcement is, however, what all the EU health and safety activities hinge on. The report contains specific demands for a total ban on asbestos, an extension of the cancer directive, a call for directives on physical factors, scaffolding and minimum requirements in the transport sector, as well as a proposal to protect those who work outdoors."
"In its interim report, the Commission proposes four main priorities for the period 1998-2000: firstly, more effective legislation; secondly, preparation for enlargement; thirdly, stronger links with the issue of employability; and, fourthly, the risks arising from changes in working conditions."
"These are important priorities."
"The Commission's extended list of priorities will present a real challenge for action on health and safety at work."
"Occupational health and safety in the applicant countries is not nearly at the same level as in current Member States."
"They will need every possible kind of support to achieve the levels that exist in the Community."
"Maintaining older people's capacity for work is also one of the major challenges of the coming years, and I wanted to talk about the Finnish example here."
"In Finland, action to maintain the capacity to work is taken jointly by the employer, the employee and the cooperation organisations."
"Finland's good record in this area could be taken as a model of good practice for the other Member States."
"There is a fundamental link here with employability."
"Assessing the health and safety risks at the workplace is still too often limited to physical, chemical and biological risks."
"Nevertheless, muscular-skeletal diseases and psycho-social factors currently constitute the greatest threats to workers' health."
"Our committee has already mentioned stress, in particular, as being one of these."
"I would also draw attention to the issue of violence, which is a growing problem in the service sector."
"The Commission also states in its interim report that the increase in female employment brings with it certain special problems connected with health and safety at work."
"I think we need to obtain statistics in this area, broken down by gender."
"Certain jobs that women do carry their own health and safety risks, which result, for example, from lack of autonomy, monotonous and repetitive work, and other such factors."
"Finally, I would like to say a word about the amendments. I am prepared to approve all of them other than Amendment No 1."
"Amendment No 2 I approve as an addition to paragraph 15 in the report."
"I cannot approve Amendment No 1, as it would reduce paragraph 3 of the report to a mere complaint about the small number of women on the committees and would exclude the important proposal for improvement."
"To explain what I mean, the Committee on Women's Rights has pointed out, in the opinion it has drafted, that women comprise only 10 % of the employers and 20 % of the employees on the advisory committees, and it has urged that the proportion of women be increased."
"A more balanced representation of both genders is entirely feasible without impinging on the independence of the nomination system."
"In the Nordic countries there are excellent examples of this, and for that reason I recommend that Amendment No 1 be rejected."
"Mr President, with regard to the report on safety, hygiene and health protection at work I should like to repeat, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament and as the draftsman of my committee's opinion, that the carcinogens directive is extremely important and that we are particularly keen that the Council and the Commission should act upon this piece of legislation."
"Asbestos at the workplace is again included in the amendment I have proposed, and I would like to ask the previous speaker for clarification here: I did not gather whether she accepts my proposal or not."
"The asbestos issue is not just about cleaning up buildings, which is what is happening at present, it is also about banning the use of asbestos at work, in the home and in buildings in general."
"Worker protection is another important issue in the context of the enlargement to the east."
"I very much welcome the fact that Mrs Bjerregaard has already been in contact with many people and has started talks about environmental measures in relation to the forthcoming enlargement, and I would like to see this aspect given greater consideration in worker protection and a higher profile in the enlargement process."
"My next point is that it is true - and I have to agree with the previous speaker here - that safety, hygiene and health protection needs to be increasingly extended to include mental as well as physical aspects, focusing much more on issues such as violence and the psychological effects of working conditions."
"One type of workplace that is becoming increasingly common in the European Union is call-centres, which are often more like battery henhouses than human workplaces, in that the employees earn very little and work under great physical and psychological stress."
"These call-centres are cheap to operate and they are becoming increasingly prevalent, so this is certainly an area where the directives need to be changed and improved."
"Mr President, Mrs Ojala has been very effective in the committee in driving through a very important report."
"I pay tribute to her patience and understanding on this issue."
"There are so many people dying each year or becoming sick and injured that we need to do everything we can to ensure that the activities of the European Union are focused in such a way that reduction is given priority."
"Across Europe there are many bodies which play a role in protecting citizens' lives."
"Trends and patterns of work tell us that the terrain of that work is changing and we need to adapt new strategies, new techniques and new practices to take account of and anticipate the effects of this change."
"I can therefore support both the approach and the substance of Mrs Ojala's report because it moves in that direction."
"We should welcome this."
"One issue I particularly commend is the recognition of the type of work that agencies such as the Bilbao Health and Safety Agency perform."
"It should please us all that SMEs, which have been the scene of some of the worst accidents, are receiving special attention."
"Although Safe Action in Europe is no longer with us in body it is still with us in spirit."
"The Bilbao agency has succeeded in encouraging the process of spreading best practice effectively."
"This year, when health and safety will be defined by working times, scaffolding, chemical agents, carcinogens and, in particular, asbestos - and I am glad the Green Group raised this latter issue - Parliament should feel very proud of the role it has played in promoting the change which is going to be necessary to bring about a ban on asbestos."
"The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has played a key role in making sure that the scientific evidence is there to promote that ban and we can expect to celebrate before the European elections a dramatic reduction in the deaths caused by this."
"However, most of all we should celebrate Parliament's vigilance."
"It is only by this vigilance that we are able to promote the best strategies which will effect the best practices."
"To this end, I regard this report as a major part of the machinery of good practice and effective regulation in this field."
"The rapporteur is to be congratulated for bringing it together."
"Mr President, I too am grateful to the rapporteur for her report."
"It is a good report which has many very valuable things in it and reminds us of the importance of safety and health at work."
"This is an aspect of social policy which has actually generated the most legislation."
"It is also a part of the internal market."
"That is sometimes overlooked."
"If there are major differences in safety and health legislation, that leads directly to all manner of distortions of competition."
"So that is one of the reasons why we have such a broad range of legislation covering the field."
"There has of late been a problem, I feel, in that the Commission has not done enough to ensure that the legislation is in fact complied with."
"It is only really in the last year and a half that the matter has been addressed with any vigour."
"That, I think, is one of the essential things which need to be done."
"And I believe we can distinguish between two stages: firstly whether the directives are actually transposed and, secondly, whether they are in fact implemented, in other words whether there is adequate scrutiny."
"That too is an extremely important aspect."
"These comments are all directed, really, at the Commission."
"My second point concerns Eastern Europe."
"I see we have Mr van den Broek here with us."
"It is perhaps worth making the point once again that it is important to appreciate that this directive and everything that goes with it is part of the acquis communautaire ."
"I know from my own experience that there is sometimes the feeling in Eastern Europe that this is not the case, because people say yes, we want those other things, but these are all social directives and what have you, and all that is a bit difficult."
"Of course, we cannot accept that."
"It is a formal part of the acquis , but in order to enforce that in Eastern Europe too, it is indeed very important for us to begin programmes now which aim to bring both the technology and the legislation up to the mark on this point."
"I think that this is extremely important."
"The third point is the question of the committee itself."
"In one of her amendments, Mrs Ojala has made a direct attack on the independence of the social partners."
"The social partners play an important role in this committee, and she is seeking to restrict the social partners' right to appoint their representatives."
"That is not acceptable, in my view, and we have tabled an amendment accordingly."
"I think anyone who believes that the social partners should decide for themselves whom they wish to appoint will vote in favour of it, and anyone who has a sort of paternalistic view of the social partners will of course vote against; they will do so in the context of the politically correct thinking observed on the other side of the House, and they will in fact be saying 'we are going to decide exactly whom the social partners can appoint'."
"But that, I think, will spell the end of the road for the committee, because then the social partners will no longer be able to speak their own mind."
"They will be forced to say what others think."
"Those are the points I wished to make - my compliments to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, like other speakers, I think that Mrs Ojala has produced an excellent report here, and there are just one or two points which I should like to explore further."
"First of all, I wish to underline the points she made about asbestos, an issue which certainly merits closer consideration at European level."
"I would also like to see attention being given to an area in which European legislation is still nowhere near as good as it might be, namely the need for proper consideration of organic mental syndrome."
"OMS attacks the nervous system and can cause severe forms of brain damage."
"The disease is caused by occupational exposure to chemical solvents such as toluene and xylene, in painters and decorators for example."
"Last year, Parliament approved the amended directive on the protection of workers against exposure to chemical substances at work, and this contains a number of provisions which are very important for the prevention of OMS."
"The amended directive introduces a statutory obligation to use less harmful substances in the work process in place of certain harmful chemical substances, including solvents."
"I believe that the substitution of low-solvent products for high-solvent products is a powerful way of helping industry to be innovative."
"However, reduced competitiveness is often cited as a reason not to use products which have a lower solvent content but a higher price."
"Alternatives which are technically perfectly good and less harmful have been available for a long time - as I have pointed out on several occasions - and have already been made mandatory in the USA and the Scandinavian countries."
"Ideally, the Member States should transpose the changes to the directive into their national legislation as fast as possible."
"My country decided last year already to introduce mandatory substitution for a large number of chemical agents as of the year 2000."
"I would urge the Commission to ensure that other countries too make progress on this front."
"Another answer might be to promote the use of reactive solvents, in which a chemical reaction causes the coating to become a part of the binding agent, so that it is not inhaled."
"I would point here to successful experiments on solvents obtained from the marigold, notably an experiment funded by the European Union which might thus be taken a little further."
"Lastly, I should be grateful for some answers from the Commissioner to questions which I put some time ago at a special hearing in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I should like to know what further research the Commission is doing into substances suspected of causing OMS."
"I am also interested to know if the Commission is still prepared to tighten up the 1990 recommendation on compensation for people exposed to chemical substances."
"The European Court of Justice has already ruled that Member States must take account of OMS and set up systems of compensation."
"Mr President, first of all I must congratulate Mrs Ojala on her excellent report."
"Although all political issues are equally important as a general rule, occupational health and safety can be regarded as particularly important because it involves social relations as well as being a technical issue."
"Mrs Ojala's report allows us to consider this issue as requested, we should remember, by Finnish members of our group."
"There is a very pertinent comment in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, drafted by Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, which underlines that in the EU almost 8 000 workers die each year in industrial accidents and 10 million fall victim to such accidents or occupational diseases."
"This situation must be tackled conscientiously and responsibly."
"On the occasion of the 21st annual activity report of the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, this report certainly hits home."
"We would have preferred the monitoring and assessment of this annual report of the Advisory Committee to have concentrated more on examining and updating Directive 92/57, although we agree that the mere transposition of directives is not enough and that these must also be effectively implemented and applied."
"We believe that it is important to ensure that all directives which are considered relevant are transposed into national legislation and that their effective application is monitored."
"With regard to Directive 92/57, we raised questions about its transposition and application which were unfortunately very opportune as they referred to serious accidents at civil shipyards in Portugal in October 1994 and March 1995, whereas the Portuguese Government did not transpose the directive until July 1995."
"However, transposing the directive is not enough, and we have stressed this, for example in the case of workers suffering from tendinitis at Ford Electrónica Portuguese in Setúbal, by means of questions to the Commission in November 1995 and January 1997."
"And we will continue to stress this point!"
"Yet this is not the only situation which needs to be tackled, as we are seeing a general trend which must be resisted."
"Monitoring in this area indicates that general conditions, the working environment and occupational health and safety are not developing positively."
"As pointed out very clearly by Mrs Ojala in paragraph 25 of her report, 'some types of atypical working conditions and subcontracting have led to an increase in workplace accidents'. This is why the report urges the Commission to stress to the Member States that the directives must be complied with and that compliance must be closely monitored."
"However, the general framework for the reorganisation of work also needs to be revised."
"We should remember that, when President-in-Office of the Council, the Luxembourg minister Mr Junker commented that the policies of weakening and creating uncertainty in contractual employment relations result in an increase in the number of accidents at work. He also said that uncertainty is the working condition which most seriously threatens the health and safety of workers."
"This is why problems must be tackled on the basis of industrial relations."
"Following on from the Green Paper on the reorganisation of work, the House now needs to deliver its opinion on a Commission communication."
"This is a major issue, but unfortunately the report on this, for which I am responsible, will not now come before this House as there is not enough time."
"I must therefore take the opportunity to stress that this report tackles questions which are unquestionably of prime importance, as they concern working conditions, working relations and the duration of work and therefore particularly affect health and safety at work."
"I would also make the point that, significantly, although there is time to discuss minute details on currency matters, there is not enough time for these vital and urgent issues to be debated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Ojala critically examines two types of document."
"The first type covers two activity reports: one from the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, and the other from the Safety and Health Commission for the Mining and Other Extractive Industries."
"And from the outset, my group should like to compliment Mrs Ojala on this excellent report."
"As regards the first two reports, we fully agree with the criticisms expressed by the rapporteur over a certain lack of transparency in the data from the Advisory Committee."
"We also share the rapporteur's concern for the lack of financial resources for concrete proposals aiming to improve the situation in the workplace and the exchange of information, and, in fact, these resources are currently decreasing. Such concern may have become evident through the Safety and Health Commission's report."
"The interim report is a more political report as it relates to the Community Programme for two periods: 1996-1998 and 1998-2000."
"We agree, too, with the points made regarding the Council's disappointing attitude that led to it rejecting the SAFE programme which aims to encourage specific projects in the field of health and safety. Lastly, we agree with the rapporteur on the positive developments in terms of legislation, particularly as regards transposing these laws into national law in the Member States."
"For the 1998-2000 period, we also share the concerns expressed by our rapporteur that, as we see it, relate to two areas. There must be a more careful analysis of the new world of work as in our societies we are seeing changes in working conditions, a growing service sector, an increase in the number of women in employment and the ageing of the workforce as well as new ways of organising work."
"We will not go into the details here, but added to this, new risks are also emerging. There are indeed physical, chemical and biological risks, but there are also risks linked to muscular-skeletal diseases and also to psychosocial factors."
"This aspect has already been mentioned so I will not go back over it."
"This report is in keeping with our concerns from three points of view. Firstly, it reflects our desire to establish vital social measures for all countries in the Union."
"It also highlights the fact that we have a duty to be politically accountable. This is why this report must be followed up and why efficient proposals must be provided to meet our common concerns."
"I should like to once again complement Mrs Ojala on her report and assure her that our group will vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Ojala, who has once again demonstrated that someone from the Left who shows a sense of commitment and responsibility can really help to improve the quality of the work done by the entire House."
"What is this issue all about?"
"It is about a revolution in the world of work, which is currently undergoing fundamental changes."
"The traditional factories and conveyor belts and the safety measures that went with them are all in decline."
"In the single market, we need to ensure that the new forms of work organisation do not lead to more uncertainty and stress, and that conditions of employment which are protected by social and labour legislation are not gradually replaced by conditions determined by commercial law. We must also ensure that the progress achieved in working conditions under the old structures, particularly at national level, is genuinely reflected in new and appropriate forms at European level."
"We have two types of mechanisms here: the balance of interests and communication on the one hand, and the Community programme on the other."
"I think it is quite clear that the social partners' right to make appointments is an important element of their independence, but it is also our job to ensure representativeness and efficiency."
"I therefore think that Mrs Ojala is right on this issue, rather than the PPE Group."
"Secondly, on the subject of the Community programme, some of the major points such as asbestos and mental strain have already been mentioned."
"Parliament has already done a considerable amount of work on these, but there is still more to be done."
"Generally speaking, the acquis communautaire in this field needs to be deepened and we need to ensure that we are properly prepared for the process of enlargement to the east and, in part, to the south, which will bring new generations of workers into the single market."
"It will be absolutely vital to ensure that every employee has fair, healthy and humane working conditions, because that is, after all, what this is all about."
"The humanisation of working life is the task that now faces us in the single market."
"Mr President, I must firstly also offer my compliments to Mrs Ojala."
"Secondly, I wish to comment on the question of structures."
"In Mrs Ojala's report, we find criticism of the fact that the Advisory Committee and the Safety and Health Commission have too few women members."
"On the other hand, I hear it said here that we ought not to concern ourselves with that, because it would look like paternalism vis-à-vis the social partners."
"I protest very vigorously against that attitude, because I cannot believe that the social partners would be unsympathetic to the idea that women, being involved in all areas of economic life, must consequently be involved in all areas of decision-making."
"Perhaps we should just give the social partners a little nudge, so that they give women with the necessary ability the chance to become members of these bodies."
"The criticism I read in this document of the bodies set up by the Commission is fairly fierce."
"The accusation is made of a lack of transparency on all sides over the substance and results of the work of the Advisory Committee and of all the new working parties which have been set up, eight of them in 1996."
"And may I draw the attention not only of Parliament but of the Commission and the bodies it has set up to the criticism made by the Committee on Women's Rights, namely that the reports pay too little attention to typical gender effects."
"Gender issues, and I quote 'must not be restricted to pregnancy and breast feeding, but should be related to all health and safety issues and their impact on women'."
"I would argue that for men too there may be typical work-related problems and conditions, and we would like to see more attention paid to those."
"There is more than just reproductive health at issue here."
"Various honourable Members have mentioned the mental stress factors which increasingly affect workers."
"Take yesterday's bus strike in this city, when bus drivers protested at the danger they run at work, where they are regularly the victims of violent attack."
"Take the conditions which make life very difficult for teachers in some Member States."
"Take the fact that after a few years, nearly all nurses start to have back problems, and so on."
"There is a second point I should like to expand on - previous speakers have done so too - namely the removal of asbestos."
"The Commission of course earned itself brownie points by spending a great deal of money on stripping the asbestos from the Berlaymont building."
"But the Commission probably never knew about the irresponsible way in which this was done by the workers in charge of removing the asbestos, about the way in which the asbestos waste from the building was driven away through the streets of Brussels."
"You should make sure that you are better informed, instead of sitting shuffling papers and smugly concluding that on paper everything looks just fine."
"It is true that the public authorities are increasingly aware of the problem of asbestos, but in the same town where a small museum is obliged to remove asbestos sheets from its ceiling, asbestos is still being produced, and the Commission really must do something about that."
"Mr President, the June Movement can support Mrs Ojala's report, because it is full of good intentions for our working environment and safety and health at work."
"But it does not tackle the key issue, namely those cases in which total EU harmonisation will come into conflict with the Member States' wishes to have better rules than those adopted in the Community."
"When the EU adopts provisions on the environment and the working environment as such, they apply as minimum provisions under which we all have the right to go further."
"We always support those in the June Movement."
"However, the problems arise when rules are adopted instead under provisions relating to the internal market, because then a majority decision taken in a secret committee or a closed Council of Ministers meeting can put the Folketing in the dunce's corner and abolish a law, even when it has been adopted unanimously in the Folketing."
"Take the cancer list, for example."
"Now Danish workers have to handle substances which both the World Health Organisation and the Danish authorities regard as carcinogenic, because the Commission will not present a proposal and because 62 out of 87 votes in the EU cannot be found to prohibit them."
"For creosote, Denmark has invoked the environmental guarantee and banned the substance because it can cause cancer, but in the EU it is now forbidden to forbid the substance, and the Commission has not yet approved the Danish use of the environmental guarantee."
"When the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force, no doubt we can expect a letter from the Commission requiring us to outlaw the Danish ban on creosote, because the Amsterdam Treaty does not permit countries to go further than the majority where measures relating to human health are concerned."
"Free movement for carcinogens takes precedence over public health!"
"Let me call on the Commissioner - in conclusion to this debate - to announce instead that it is intended to propose a ban on creosote throughout the EU."
"Mr President, the contemporary world of work requires specific controls to ensure that safety and health protection standards are adequate to meet the challenges of a society which has long since passed the so-called post-industrial stage."
"When we refer to safety at work, we automatically think of the structures already in place."
"My first comment relates to asbestos, its use and its applications: some are known, others are as yet unknown or not covered by a rather toothless Community directive."
"This strikes one immediately and therefore merits particular attention."
"Secondly, because of its need to adapt to the demands of a rapidly developing society, the world of work is beset by difficulties which have caused new psychoses, as well as genuine new occupational diseases that are still under investigation but very much need to be regulated."
"I am thinking here of the steady increase in cases of work-related stress, fatigue resulting from sedentary or repetitive activities, but also those with indirect causes such as sexually motivated violence and harassment."
"There is undoubtedly a need for a European agency, and we therefore hope that the Bilbao agency, which already exists, will become truly operational."
"But above all, the second phase of the SAFE programme needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency."
"The present rate of transposition of the directives into national legislation is looking very positive, in that it rose from 70 % in 1996 to 96 % last year."
"Of course, much still remains to be done, but we hope, or rather we believe - with our congratulations to the rapporteur - that we are working along the right lines."
"Mr President, I was immensely pleased when I saw that my good friend, Jens-Peter Bonde from the June Movement, was finally going to take part in this debate."
"I thought that we would be hearing something constructive and positive."
"But it turned out to be one of the usual propaganda speeches, focusing on what are transient issues."
"This report is a good and important initiative."
"It is important that the EU and the European Parliament pursue an active and progressive policy in this area."
"The EU must be a lever for better safety and health in the Community's workplaces."
"Industrial injuries and accidents cost billions of euros every year, but more than anything they represent personal tragedies and costs."
"Often it is too late when the damage has occurred."
"That is why it is so important to allocate sufficient resources for research and prevention."
"It is not just a good investment from the economic point of view; it is an investment whose results cannot be assessed in terms of money."
"I am glad that Parliament is calling on the Commission in this report to do something serious about the asbestos problem."
"It is time that asbestos was completely banned."
"Many workers have been exposed to this dangerous substance over the years, with catastrophic consequences."
"The after-effects are something people have to live with for the rest of their lives, and often they develop cancer - a disease which we all know can be fatal and painful."
"So we must demand a total ban."
"Finally, let me stress how important it is that the EU should be constantly at the cutting edge of developments."
"We must not just sit on our hands and wait for more accidents to happen."
"We must take an active stance and put pressure on the Member States to act before the damage occurs."
"We must focus on new forms of industrial injury, which can involve skeleto-muscular damage."
"For example, many people who work in offices contract repetitive strain injury, because they use a computer all day long."
"Also, the psychological working environment is a problem which for too long has not been taken seriously."
"In addition, we must of course campaign to bring about a reduction in limit values which apply to dangerous substances."
"The EU's citizens are entitled to expect and demand action from the European Parliament in constantly monitoring and developing a safe and healthy labour market policy."
"Mr President, may I begin by presenting the apologies of Commissioner Flynn, who is unfortunately unable to be here for today's debate, but to whom occupational safety and health is a subject of the utmost importance."
"With the help of his excellent officials, I shall stand in for him as best I can."
"May I express, in particular, my appreciation of the work done by the committee as a whole, and even more particularly of the excellent work done by the committee's rapporteur, Mrs Ojala."
"Her report contains much that the Commission is anxious to consider and act on."
"We agree on the fundamental importance of promoting safety and health at work in the countries of the Union."
"Much has already been achieved at Union level, and we must continue to build on this in the future."
"The Commission's priorities for future action are grouped under four main headings."
"The first priority is to make EU safety and health legislation more effective."
"The Member States have already made considerable efforts in that direction, and 95 % of Community instruments have now been fully transposed."
"We now have to concentrate on actual implementation of the national legislation and ensuring that it is effective."
"We must also constantly review existing directives and update and streamline them where necessary."
"The Commission takes note of your constructive suggestions on how we can best ensure that the legislation is made as efficient as possible."
"The ultimate objective must be to prevent and minimise the number of accidents at work."
"The Commission will wholeheartedly support Member States' initiatives to create the necessary culture of safety amongst employers and the workforce."
"The Bilbao Agency and the Foundation in Dublin play a key role in this policy as providers of information."
"Better information to small and medium-sized enterprises is of course crucially important."
"A second priority is the work of preparing for enlargement of the European Union."
"In the area of occupational safety and health too, the applicant countries will have to make significant efforts if they are to reach the level of safeguards required in the Union."
"The Commission monitors the degree to which the applicant countries satisfy the criteria of the acquis communautaire ."
"From the results of that, we can determine the kind of help we need to provide."
"There is a need for training, information and technical know-how, as you say in your motion for a resolution, and it serves no one's interest to have poor working conditions used as a means of competition in the internal market."
"I say that also in response to something which was said by Mr Pronk."
"The third priority is to strengthen the link with employability."
"More sustainable jobs and the promotion of employability are two of the principal elements of the European employment strategy."
"Measures to improve health and safety at work can make a significant contribution to these activities."
"We know that accident prevention is crucially important to individual workers and their families, but we often underestimate its economic benefits."
"Fewer accidents mean more work, better competitiveness and lower costs to social security."
"That is perhaps not sufficiently understood by the policy-makers and is not taken into account sufficiently in political decision-making."
"The fourth priority is the consideration which needs to be given to new risks."
"The labour market, as various honourable Members have pointed out today, is developing and changing fast."
"The transformation of the economy into a service-based economy, the steadily increasing number of women who work, the ageing of the workforce, the large-scale use of new technologies and new forms of organising work all have implications for safety."
"The European Commission will place greater emphasis on identifying the consequences of these changes and will ensure that these matters are addressed in future health and safety policy."
"In this context, your analysis is also extremely relevant."
"You rightly stress in your report that the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will greatly strengthen the role of the European Parliament and the social partners."
"The Commission is already busy drafting the necessary measures."
"The Commission believes that the correct forum for conducting a dialogue on health and safety at work is the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work."
"It plans to strengthen this committee by merging it with the Safety and Health Commission for the Mining and Other Extractive Industries."
"A number of questions have been asked, and in response to these I would also say that Parliament's resolution stresses once again the importance of research in this field."
"The Commission cannot but agree entirely, and I would add that due attention is given to this in the fifth framework programme of research and development and that under this programme of research, support must in fact follow for community activities in this field."
"Mrs Boogerd mentioned new diseases, including organic mental syndrome resulting from the use of certain chemicals."
"This field too is receiving attention under the fifth framework programme, which has as one of its themes the prevention or combating of the effects of stress."
"As regards the question about possible compensation, I think it will be better to discuss that once the research I mentioned just now has provided us with a better understanding of the issues."
"Lastly, the ban on asbestos has been mentioned several times and by several different speakers."
"It is true that some types of asbestos have not yet been banned."
"That too is something we are still researching in Directorate-General III, for which Commissioner Bangemann is responsible. Once we know more by way of results from the study in question, we shall brief you in greater detail."
"So that too is being looked into by the Commission."
"I will end with that, and I thank the House once again for your most useful suggestions and contributions."
"These will point us in the right direction and be of great benefit to worker safety and to the economic prosperity of the European Union."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, the registers of those who were present yesterday have been distributed twice today."
"On both registers I am recorded as being absent, whereas I signed the register and I spoke on the Öcalan question."
"Perhaps because I spoke in favour of Mr Öcalan and in favour of the Kurds, an anti-terrorist sanction has been applied against me and both registers have recorded me as being absent."
"Could this please be corrected?"
"For some reason we have had problems with the attendance register but we know you were present and your attendance will be recorded."
"Mr President, I find myself in the same position as Mr Ephremidis."
"I should like to make it clear that I was also present and that I did sign."
"We will ensure that your attendance is recorded."
"I apologise for that."
"Mr President, I have been trying to get the floor yesterday and this morning, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to say something now."
"Yesterday Mrs Stenzel talked about the avalanche disaster in the Tyrol, and I would like to thank her for her words, which we wholeheartedly endorse."
"Unfortunately, she specifically said that she was speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and her own delegation, thus leaving out a third of the Austrian Members."
"This was a pity, because in view of the terrible scale of the disaster, we would have been happy for her to speak on our behalf too."
"This is no time for internal political grudges."
"On behalf of the non-attached Members, therefore, I should also like to convey my deepest sympathies to the families of the victims."
"Thank you."
"The whole House expressed its condolences to the victims yesterday afternoon."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, I think it is the wrong way of going about things to use this report as a political response in the Öcalan affair."
"My group believes that if there is one line of communication which must remain open between the European Union and Turkey, it is that of access for young Turkish people to the European Union."
"We saw just last week in Turkey that on precisely this issue, there is very great concern amongst the most progressive and open-minded groups in Turkey that it should not be used as an arena in which to fight a war with Turkey which we have not been brave enough to wage by political means in the EU."
"Parliament would be sending out the wrong signal if we did that."
"Parliament rejected the request for referral back"
"(In successive votes Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)"
"The war against the Kurds in the south-east of Turkey has recently intensified."
"According to the representatives of human rights organisations, the situation of the Kurds has deteriorated considerably since the capture of Abdullah Öcalan."
"The European Union, individual Member States, other democratic countries and the international organisations have all allowed Turkey to participate in various forms of cooperation, often with the aim of promoting human rights and democracy."
"Some of the cooperation links have been accompanied by more or less forthright demands that Turkey should respect human rights, a requirement which, sadly, it has not fulfilled."
"It is vital to maintain and continue the dialogue with Turkey."
"To sever all links with undemocratic countries is not generally regarded as a constructive solution."
"The youth exchange programme gives young people a chance to study the workings of democracy, thereby instilling in them a desire for change."
"However, it is vitally important that the selection criteria should make it possible for all young people, regardless of ethnic origin, for example, to participate in the programme."
"Another criterion should be that the young people who take part do not find themselves subjected to repressive measures on their return home."
"As things stand at present, we think it would be inappropriate for the European Parliament to approve the proposed cooperation project."
"Parliament should withhold its approval until there is clear evidence that human rights are being respected."
"We abstained from voting today on the participation of Turkey in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"As long as Turkey fails to uphold human rights and to guarantee acceptable conditions for minorities in the country, we have difficulty in supporting its participation in these programmes."
"Our voting tactic today is entirely in line with our stance on other questions regarding Turkey, for example the Customs Union and the Öcalan affair."
"In relation to the report from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, the European Parliament is today suggesting that we include Turkey among the beneficiaries of the Socrates and Youth for Europe III programmes."
"Even though the European Union has quite rightly set out clear and precise conditions for the accession of the CEECs, this House believes that there is nothing unusual in involving Turkey, a country that can hardly be said to fulfil these criteria, in such Community programmes. Given the current state of affairs, guaranteeing financing for such programmes is already a rather delicate task."
"The international community currently suspects Turkey of having prepared a political trial for Mr Abdullah Öcalan where the sentence has already been determined."
"The European Council has been forced to specify that it hopes that he will receive 'fair and correct treatment and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court with access to legal counsel of his (Mr Öcalan's) choice' with the condition that, if this is the case, it 'cannot but affect EU-Turkey relations positively'."
"In this way, the Council has displayed its concern as to whether or not these conditions will be met."
"Once again, on this subject as on many others, the European Parliament is wearing rose-coloured spectacles, wishing to see its counterparts not as they are but as it wishes them to be."
"We cannot have double standards when differences between fact and fiction reach such a high level."
"It is perfectly acceptable for the CEECs to participate in these programmes as soon as they meet the appropriate criteria and if they are preparing to eventually become part of the European Union."
"However, Turkey has a great deal of ground to cover even to meet these criteria, if indeed it hopes to go further and become part of the Union."
"In effect, Turkey, which only has a tiny section of its territory on the European continent is not a European nation, neither through its history nor its civilisation."
"It would be more constructive and more logical to make this clear once and for all and to develop partnership agreements and close relations with this large country that are founded on something other than promises of possible membership that are always being postponed."
"That is why we voted against this report."
"This second reading of the report by Mrs Heinisch under the codecision procedure has been postponed several times due to the controversial nature of the subject."
"What is at stake here is whether to allow Turkey to become involved in Community programmes on education and youth."
"These programmes, the Socrates and Youth for Europe III programmes, do of course expire at the end of 1999, so it is therefore not at all certain that young Turks would in fact participate."
"However, voting in favour of this step does at least mean acting on principle and improving relations in sectors that are essential for Turkey's future, that is, education and youth."
"What is more, this House already stated that it was in favour of this in a resolution in September 1998, while the Luxembourg European Council of December 1997 confirmed that Turkey was eligible to become a member of the European Union."
"Voting in favour of this step also means helping young Turks to open their minds through contact with their European counterparts."
"It means encouraging them to become more tolerant and, as a result, we can hope that the Turkish population in general will become aware of the fact that democratisation is vital and necessary."
"Voting in favour of this step is a challenge for the future and a challenge for the respect for human rights."
"For these challenges to be met, there is a need for education and specific training that can be obtained by participating in these programmes and in exchanges."
"Since 1994, the European Parliament has been fighting to obtain sensible and consistent funding for the Socrates programme."
"The last compromise voted through in 1998 left us feeling rather disappointed by the European Commission's overcautiousness."
"Today, however, I see that our efforts have been rewarded as the overall budget for 2000-2006 has increased."
"As a result, I approve the Pack report."
"The 119 million students and 4 million teachers in the European Union hope to see this programme continue, a programme that has allowed half a million students to study in another country. It has given 60 000 teachers the chance to teach abroad and has allowed 110 000 young people to take part in educational exchanges."
"Such cooperation must be encouraged and this increased mobility and the general European dimension must be developed at all stages of education."
"In fact, 87 % of participants believe that their involvement in Socrates was positive, particularly as regards European integration and in terms of increasing awareness of our immediate neighbours."
"The new philosophy behind Socrates II concentrates more on the needs that have not been met over the past five years, such as enlarging the programme to include young adults with no qualifications and to include the applicant countries."
"In view of this, it would be impossible to maintain this programme with an ever-decreasing level of resources, something that has afflicted the Socrates programme from the outset."
"Today's increase in the budget is therefore extremely significant and logical."
"We do not think it falls within Parliament's remit to submit a proposal in this area."
"In our view, the European rules have certain advantages: that patents are only granted for inventions which are new in relation to what was known before the application was filed."
"That is a clear and simple rule."
"A grace period would presumably lead to more wrangles over who owns the rights to an invention which has already been made public."
"If the rules are to be changed, there should first be a comprehensive study of the legality and implications of such a change."
"However, it is not Parliament that should be carrying out this task."
"The own-initiative report by the Legal Affairs Committee on the introduction of a grace period covers an immensely important aspect of patent legislation."
"Clearly, it is a basic principle of any patent law that patents must not be granted on inventions which are already publicly known."
"But the grace period, which is a feature of American and Japanese patent law for example, gives an advantage to these countries in relation to the EU in an area which has great importance for the development of firms and the creation of new jobs."
"It is therefore absolutely essential for this imbalance to be removed by the introduction of a limited grace period in the EU as well, during which patents can be granted on inventions which are publicly known."
"Mr President, I should like to explain why I voted the way I did, because I have been accused of voting in favour of wine and ignoring the beer produced in my constituency."
"I deliberately voted in favour of wine, because I happen to believe that wine is one of the most fundamental elements of our civilisation."
"We can trace it back to the time of Christ, who performed his first miracle when he turned water into wine."
"If he was alive today he might have turned wine into water instead, but he turned water into wine. This is why we must support wine as part of our European tradition, not to mention the fact that European wine is facing a major onslaught, so we need to increase our defences."
"I voted against this report as I want the Treaty to be respected."
"In other words, I want everything related to wines and spirits to be regulated in the context of the rules concerning the common organisation of the market in wines and spirits."
"Parliament has voted through a text containing provisions that are totally contradictory."
"If this vote had been a final one, which fortunately is not the case, a directive such as this would be completely unenforceable."
"Given these conditions, the report should have been referred back to committee."
"Unfortunately, the rapporteur himself has wreaked havoc by handing out a voting list that contradicts the official list from the group I belong to and to which he also belongs."
"This is further proof of his refusal to play fair, something that has been clear all the way through the debate and the vote in committee."
"The Commission is on the same side as the 206 Members who voted against the report, and that reassures me."
"For the sake of people's health, tobacco should be taxed heavily, since high prices serve to dampen demand."
"Through a combination of high prices, age restrictions, strict control of sales outlets and public health information, we stand a good chance of restricting the use of tobacco products."
"In some cases, having a higher total tax burden on tobacco products than other countries can lead to an increase in illegal imports and the existence of a black market."
"Sweden was afflicted in this way and, as a result, was obliged to lower the tax on cigarettes temporarily to discourage illegal trade and put an end to black market activities."
"We will vote against the Langen report."
"We will vote against it not because it suggests unacceptable amendments to the Commission's text, but because members of the National Front have always been opposed to tax harmonisation and have defended one of the principal aspects of sovereignty: a state's ability to levy taxes."
"We will vote against this report for another reason: the widespread hypocrisy of all public authorities when it comes to tobacco."
"Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you."
"This even appears on every cigarette packet in words that people stopped reading long ago."
"Decision-makers periodically pride themselves on how the fight against smoking epitomises the concern they feel for public health."
"But in my country, the government is, at the same time, in favour of producing cigarettes, and for every packet sold pockets 75 % tax."
"We are right to ask whether the concern shown for public health is not merely a screen to hide the true tax objective of maintaining significant budgetary revenue."
"In France, and undoubtedly in other countries of the Union, smokers are being milked in the same way as motorists are."
"What is more, there are economic realities which we must not lose sight of."
"We must ensure that the tobacco industry in the European Union continues to exist, particularly as we are aware that our national producers only cover 20 % of manufacturing needs."
"We must ensure that there is support for such activity as it plays an important role in preserving the fabric of rural society in a number of regions, such as in Alsace."
"We must encourage the production of quality tobacco with lower tar levels."
"This is why, on the whole, we support reform of the COM in tobacco, and supporting it just this once will not do any harm."
"And we can but regret the fact that nothing has been done to reduce the EU's external dependence in this field."
"We do not want this to be mistaken for protectionism, but we cannot recklessly give way on a fundamental issue just because we support Nelson Mandela and South Africa's struggle to consolidate its anti-racist democracy, which, as far as we are concerned, has always been the goal, even though some of its most vocal defenders today were previously on the other side, attacking Mandela and the ANC."
"Protection for the port and sherry denominations of origin was hard won from the European Union and, from the year 2000, from the World Trade Organisation."
"We therefore cannot allow this guarantee to be abandoned, particularly when no assurance is given in the draft agreement concluded by Commissioner Deus Pinheiro that South Africa will stop using the port and sherry denominations after the lengthy transition periods have expired, during which South Africa would be able to export, for example, to important markets like the USA."
"This issue is therefore not restricted to bilateral EU-South Africa relations, as it risks setting a precedent which could be used against port and sherry by other wine-producing countries such as the USA (California), Australia, Chile and so on."
"As we represent voters and specific groups of people, unlike those who irresponsibly signed the draft agreement in Davos, we voted against the resolution asking the Council to urgently approve the EU-South Africa agreement amended as indicated."
"It is extremely disappointing to learn of the latest difficulty that has arisen in the negotiations between the European Union and South Africa."
"The talks with South Africa have been going on for over three years now and I would call to mind the commitment we have entered into to conclude the EU/South Africa agreement by March at the latest."
"The final package negotiated by Commissioner Pinheiro and endorsed by the full Commission is the basis of a solid partnership for trade, development and technical cooperation."
"In this context I would urge the governments of France, Italy, Spain and Portugal to consider carefully the implications of delaying an agreement."
"Let us not forget that this agreement is not merely about trade and commerce."
"It bears a highly political significance."
"South Africa is a country struggling to build a new democratic identity and reconcile itself with its past."
"It is a country where there are both political and social problems."
"This agreement is vital to encourage the processes that have got under way."
"To hold it up now would be a serious blow to our South African partners."
"I appeal to the governments concerned to reassess their position and to remove any obstacles to agreement which reflect a short-term view of the situation."
"I call on them to take the long-term view - to accede to the Commission's proposals which also reflect the wishes of this house and indeed of the Vienna European Council."
"Every effort must be made to put in place the Compromise reached at Davos which will allow for a copper-fastening of EU-South African relations."
"This is as I have said a vital agreement for the new South African democracy, but it is also the basis of a partnership of equals, one which will enhance both sides economically as well as strategically."
"The agreement on trade and cooperation with South Africa deserves our full support as it aims to develop relations between the European Union and the major economic and social area of South Africa, an area which represents one of the great hopes for the future of humanity."
"However, this agreement only makes sense if it is in the interests of all parties."
"Yet some interests of the parties have not been protected."
"This is particularly the case with port wine, where it must be made absolutely clear that South Africa may not produce or market any wine with this name after the end of the transition period."
"This is an issue which must be enshrined in the text of the agreement or in an annexed declaration."
"The aid of EUR 15 million granted by the European Union only makes sense if it is devoted to converting these wines into table wines or to abandoning this activity, otherwise there is no point in granting a tariff concession for a quota of 32 million litres of table wine."
"For these reasons, we believe that the Council has acted wisely in postponing a decision until all the issues have been clarified."
"We therefore also voted against the resolution which the House has approved today."
"It is with a certain satisfaction that I welcome the work by our colleague Mathieu Grosch, as he has accurately addressed the social issues in the transport industry, and particularly the crucial matter of working time."
"I share the rapporteur's approach in linking working time to safety."
"But I would also like to add here the quality of life of employees."
"However, I note that the text, as a matter of principle, states that a reduction in working time cannot be accompanied by a drop in basic wages."
"This was a necessary step."
"Nonetheless, it may be dangerous to link a reduction in working time to the concept of flexibility, as we are aware that, as a general rule, employees in the transport sector already have to be extremely flexible. Such flexibility brings with it a strong possibility of a direct or indirect lack of safety when one looks at the extent of current working hours."
"In addition, I should also like to congratulate the Commission, and Mr Neil Kinnock in particular, who became aware of these risks very early on. He was also aware of the impact on society of social dumping by certain companies and its repercussions in terms of intra-Community competition."
"Lastly, when faced with the growing internationalisation of transport, it is increasingly necessary to defend our legislation in international bodies and to obtain basic rules, particularly for sea and air transport."
"I now hope that this important step towards harmonising social legislation for the transport sector will serve as a lesson for other sectors to follow."
"I continue to believe that a strong European Union cannot be built without bringing national social standards closer into line."
"It is undeniable that this report sets out to make a constructive contribution."
"There are many points which we naturally agree with, for example those relating to working hours in the transport industry and to the disabled."
"However, we would question whether the European Union is the appropriate authority to take decisions on many of the issues involved."
"It is certainly acceptable for the EU to coordinate decision-making on certain issues, but we believe it would be misguided to make the EU responsible for taking supranational decisions on all social legislation."
"This report is absurd, officious and unduly detailed."
"Working hours and social legislation in the transport industry should be dealt with through agreements between the partners in the labour market and, if that is not possible, through legislation at national level."
"There is no reason why driving times and schedules, rest periods and other specific issues should be regulated through EU directives."
"Basically, we think this is a good report."
"It tackles the problems that employees whose work involves crossing borders can encounter with social legislation which, in Sweden, forms part of labour law."
"We appreciate that there is a need for the proposed legislation, but we do not think that the Commission should be the body to formulate and put forward the legislative proposal."
"I have voted in favour of Amendments Nos 6 and 20, calling on the Commission to propose that the 12-mile limit should be extended to 24 miles in the proposals which it is required to submit by 31 December 2001 at the latest."
"This is a question of decentralisation and allowing coastal states to manage coastal fishing at national level."
"There is no common fisheries policy in the EU because the regions are always overlooked."
"There is a growing need to have a better understanding of the needs and requirements of these small but very important areas where the fishing industry, both at sea and on land, is vital to the local community and economy."
"We require a fisheries policy that has the ability to reflect the needs of the industry."
"The present policy, especially given the Hague Preference, works totally against Northern Ireland and should be altered to allow fair play for everyone involved in fisheries."
"We also need an increase in the present limits on our coasts."
"I urge the Parliament to vote for a twenty-four mile limit to protect our small fishing fleets."
"There are some important elements in this report which must be underlined."
"Firstly there is the maintenance of the principle of relative stability."
"There are also, in particular, elements which were included in the report as a result of our amendments and which confirm the House's desire not only to keep access to the 12-mile reserved zone within the exclusive national sovereignty of the coastal countries but also to extend this zone to 24 miles."
"These elements are important and decisive for the implementation of a regionalisation policy which, as we understand it, means applying the principle of subsidiarity to the common fisheries policy. This can be achieved by increasing decentralisation, which will allow the Member States to adapt general guidelines on stock preservation and monitoring of the common fisheries policy and to determine, together with the sector and the European Community, which specific measures at regional and/or national level are suitable for converting into more general objectives."
"However, this is not how the report sees regionalisation."
"In the report, regionalisation seems to be a very vague and inadequately defined concept which consists more of dividing seas and parts of oceans into regions and sub-regions. These would then be subject to devolved management assumed by various groups of countries in accordance with the geographic location of these divisions."
"Under this management, guidelines would be regarded as definitive and not subject to joint discussion, and they would cover nearly all the aspects currently falling under the common fisheries policy."
"The imbalances and discrimination which could result from this are clear."
"We therefore support the proposals mentioned relating to access to resources, because we tabled them, but we reject the view of regionalisation which the report contains."
"Our group voted against adopting the report by our colleague Mr Gallagher, even though the amendments in favour of the decentralisation of the CFP had been adopted. This was to the detriment of the regionalisation process that the rapporteur had initially proposed."
"In my speech yesterday evening in this House, I specified that I rejected all the amendments that aimed to substantially modify the CFP."
"Therefore, I rejected Amendments Nos 6 and 7, tabled on behalf of the PPE Group by Mr Provan, which aim to extend the limit from 12 miles to 24 miles."
"Such an increase in national waters reserved for fishing will pose major problems for fishermen in Brittany and Normandy who will no longer have access to traditional fishing areas, particularly those close to the United Kingdom."
"I am surprised that these measures were adopted in this vote, especially by French Members, as they go against the interests of our fishermen."
"That is our main reason for deciding to vote against the legislative resolution resulting from this own-initiative report by the European Parliament."
"The CFP is due for reform in 2002 and I hope, in the interests of French fishermen, that this resolution will not alter the views of the Commission and the Council."
"The current status quo of a 12-mile limit for the area is the best possible compromise for the whole of the French fishing sector."
"A few months ago, I was rapporteur for a text on the competitiveness of European industry. As a result, I have followed the work of our colleague Mr de Lassus on competitiveness and the regions very carefully."
"I must say that the text confirms the analysis I had myself made of the key measures that need to be taken in order to increase our competitiveness."
"However, the current proposals fall short of what is really needed, especially as the European Union is debating the future of the Structural Funds within the framework of Agenda 2000."
"Indeed, for a few years now, we have once again been observing a tendency for regional disparities to increase, particularly in the field we are considering today."
"Moreover, to try to redress the balance between the regions, following the example of the rapporteur, I also believe that we must extend the link between the research programme and the Structural Funds."
"However, we must be realistic, and for our determination to have an effect, we must also continue to examine how we can improve the lines of communication between these 'less-favoured' regions."
"I cannot conceive that innovative businesses will settle in regions that often have few transport services and that, in fact, find it difficult to break this vicious circle."
"Lastly, we must not conceal another constraint linked to the Member States. We must remember that European regional planning is still heavily dependent on national planning policies where control has been devolved to the various governments."
"Such synergy between local authorities, the Member States and the European Union is, of course, complex but it is also vital. And we must also promote the development of cross-border systems of decision-making."
"I am pleased to welcome the report by our colleague Alan Donnelly."
"On the whole, I share the rapporteur's concerns regarding the transport, banking and nuclear fields."
"In this respect, I support the idea put forward in the text to help Russia to get over this hurdle."
"The dangers may become real, even without giving way to gloom-mongering."
"Therefore, it is our duty to prevent such risks in this field and also in other sectors of the economy."
"However, I do wonder about the responsibilities of the main actors in the information technology industry in the face of this deadline, a deadline we have been aware of for many years."
"I am astonished, to say the least, that they feel that once a product has been put on the market, they can wash their hands of it."
"This is how they behave over problems linked to changing over to the year 2000, but it is also a valid observation for other products that need regular updating to correct some hidden defects, and for which the luckless buyer must foot the bill."
"Therefore, I will vote for the resolution by Mr McCartin so that the Commission can negotiate with this industry to allow individuals and small businesses to rectify this 'error'. It is to be hoped that they will do so without, yet again, having to pay for a problem that has been evident for a long time yet for which they are not responsible."
"Lastly, I believe that now is the time for us to extend the debate so that we can take steps that will allow us to protect the consumer's basic rights as regards businesses that supply hardware and software."
"The public are today dependent on a range of computerised services, such as pensions, family allowances, sickness benefits, insurance, energy supply and transport."
"Many of these vital services could be affected by the 'year 2000' problem."
"The responsibility for solving the year 2000 problem rests of course in the first instance with the suppliers and users of the computer programmes, but because the problem is so extensive, the public authorities must also provide support."
"I therefore endorse the Commission's many initiatives in the year 2000 area, including the launching of cooperation across national borders and discussions of the problem in the Council and with all the relevant contacts in industry and the Member States."
"The Commission's reports on what progress has been made in solving the problem will be of great importance in coordinating efforts."
"It is of course absolutely essential that particular attention should be paid to especially sensitive sectors, including for example the cross-frontier problems which may arise at the Eastern European nuclear power stations, and for the necessary measures to be taken."
"Mr President, I am voting in favour of this report today."
"Although it may at first appear to be a minor technical matter, the millennium bug has in fact the potential to bring the everyday life of millions of people to a grinding halt - if not worse."
"It is easy to forget how much nowadays we rely on microchips to run everything from dishwashers to dialysis machines."
"Vital services could be interrupted, transport could come to a stop and businesses could be forced to close."
"Yet with proper preparation, we can ensure that our hangovers on 1 January 2000 will just be from bubbly and not from bugs."
"Britain under the Labour Government is leading the battle to beat the millennium bug in Europe with its ground-breaking Action 2000 campaign."
"Under its auspices, British utility companies (including water, gas, electricity and telephone companies) have already reported that they expect to offer 'business as usual' over the millennium."
"Other vital public services, such as the NHS, emergency services, DSS, Post Office and railways, are not far behind."
"Britain cannot afford to rely solely on its own efforts, however."
"In an increasingly globalised world, the preparedness of other countries (or lack of it) will affect Britain too."
"I wish to ensure that my constituents are free to enjoy the millennium without fearing the morning after."
"I therefore support EU efforts to ensure that Europe - and the world as a whole - are ready to swat the millennium bug."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"As we have concluded our business, I declare Parliament's session adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 25 February 1999."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today's agenda opens with a series of debates on one of the most important issues for European and world politics today: equal rights for women."
"That struggle has had various successes but it is still not over; indeed, it would seem that it still has a long way to go. Its aim is to ensure that women have exactly the same rights as men in the employment, social and political fields."
"I therefore believe that I am speaking for the House when I say that by including these points in our agenda, we are demonstrating Parliament's political will to continue this struggle."
"It also demonstrates our desire to make progress not only in terms of legislation but also in the various other areas alongside it."
"Parliament's Bureau is soon to consider a report by Mrs Hoff, who was asked to consider how we could make progress within Parliament's own administration to ensure that more women hold senior posts."
"There is a great deal of work to be done."
"Efforts have been made, but there is no doubt that we need to continue in the same direction."
"Another important aspect is the fact that we are in the run-up to elections, and it is therefore an excellent opportunity for all the political parties in Europe to ensure that more women hold seats in this House."
"It would be a great pity if this opportunity were lost."
"Applause"
"The will of this House is therefore very clear and I would like to end this introduction by expressing, on behalf of the entire House, our thanks to the Committee on Women's Rights and all its members for all the work they have done to help gradually turn this ideal into a reality."
"Our fellow Members here in the House are among the most active supporters of this cause and it would be remiss on our part not to thank them for all their efforts and for the work they have carried out during this legislature."
"I would therefore ask you to give a round of applause to thank all our female colleagues in the House and particularly the members of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Applause"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 25 February have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Wijsenbeek has the floor."
"Mr President, what you have just said is all very well, but we should respect our own Rules of Procedure, especially on a day like today."
"I must point out that Rule 6(6) states that the report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled. I see this has not been done in the case of the report by Mr Wibe, which is placed as the last item on today's agenda following a whole range of reports by the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Rule 6(6) has therefore not been respected by the Conference of Presidents whose members, as usual, never read our Rules of Procedure."
"I thought that you were going to give priority today to the reports concerning women, Mr Wijsenbeek, but in any event, when we come to the order of business, I shall put your request to the vote to determine whether the Wibe report will be taken first."
"- (FI) Mr President, I am pleased that you remembered to mention International Women's Day in your opening speech."
"I also wish to raise the subject on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"As many of us know, the most important topic of discussion on this International Women's Day seems to have become that of violence against women, children and young people, which is really a very serious worldwide violation of women's human rights."
"This evening here in Parliament we shall be discussing with the Commission how the European Union can take determined action against violence towards women."
"It is most distressing that half of all women who are killed in Europe do not die as a result of violent crime by someone unknown to them, but are murdered by their own spouse or partner."
"Violence against women has been a sort of taboo up to now, and it is gratifying that we can embark on a programme of practical measures in this area together in our capacity as the European Parliament."
"It is worth pointing out too that the European Parliament has been responsible for the action the European Union has taken to begin to combat violence against women."
"I would add that the Treaty of Amsterdam places entirely new obligations upon us and provides opportunities to promote sex equality at many levels."
"This means that we have to work more single-mindedly than ever to promote equality."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam places us under an obligation to make equality between men and women an essential element in all Community action."
"Nothing of the sort has happened as yet."
"We know how difficult this work is."
"But we are acquiring new tools for the task, and we must carry out this work together."
"Thank you, Mrs Hautala."
"I would ask that we do not embark on a debate on this question."
"Mr Santini has the floor."
"Mr President, like many others, I am keen to take up the invitation to highlight all initiatives aimed at avoiding injustice against women."
"I would however like to add one further element to such considerations: it is not only women who are subject to injustice and violence, but sometimes entire communities."
"This is the case of the Valle di Fiemme communities in Trentino, the German-speaking, Polish and Belgian communities who were the victims of the plane crash on 3 February 1998, which last week became sadly and gruesomely topical when the trial in the United States came to an end."
"As we all know, the pilot who - in a hazardous manoeuvre, to put it mildly - severed the ski gondola cable, sending 20 European people to their deaths, was inconceivably absolved of any guilt."
"I appeal to you, Mr President, somehow to convey to the US Government our sense of anger and dismay, not of course to demand justice or vengeance, but simply to express our bitter incredulity over this outright injustice."
"I would also ask you to be so kind as to reply to the letter which I sent you on the very day of the tragedy, 3 February, proposing that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy should draw up an own-initiative report on the presence of NATO air bases on European territory, and on the pros and cons of allowing these armed personnel excessive freedom to make training flights."
"I sent the same letter to the Commission President, Mr Santer, but he did not reply either."
"I now ask that justice be done for the families ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr Santini, this is not the right time for you to be making this speech."
"It is, of course, an important issue and you have written to me about it."
"On behalf of this House, I will support the Italian Government, which is currently dealing with the issue and which is responsible for any action taken."
"Mr President, yes it was, because I wanted to express, on behalf of my group, not just our shock but our disgust at the result of the military tribunal in the United States which acquitted the pilot who was responsible for the dreadful accident in which 22 Europeans died."
"I want to give notice to this House that we shall be seeking to table an urgency on this very issue."
"I hope the rest of the House will join us in putting it on the agenda for this week."
"Mr President, I thank you for your very kind remarks about Women's Day, and a very happy day to all the brothers and sisters in the House and indeed in the gallery."
"Your remarks were particularly welcome in view of the proposal to do away with the Committee on Women's Rights."
"I hope this kind of support will maintain this very important committee."
"I have another question."
"On 18 February another woman in the Community won her case in the European Court of Human Rights - Denise Mathews v. the UK Government."
"I would like to request that you inform the House, if possible this week, whether any efforts have already started on the part of both Parliament and the Commission to enable the citizens of Gibraltar to vote in the coming European elections."
"I cannot answer you because it is up to the groups and Members to take the initiative."
"Like you, I have read in the press that the United Kingdom Government is going to deal with the question."
"If any group or Member wants to take initiatives they will do so in accordance with the appropriate rules."
"Mr President, on Friday of the last part-session I drew attention to the scandalous situation of the part-time interpreters who work for Parliament and have not received proper remuneration."
"They want to see some money."
"The situation has not been very clear since October when I wrote to Commissioner Liikanen to ask him to investigate it."
"It now appears that Commissioner Santer should deal with this matter."
"I understand they are threatening industrial action, which could possibly affect the drawing up of the new Structural Fund regulations."
"I should like to ask the Bureau to speedily resolve this problem, which is causing considerable difficulties for many people without whose good work we could not do our own work."
"Mr McMahon, the Secretary-General is taking the necessary steps to resolve the matter as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, a few months ago I asked you when we were going to move into the new Parliament building, IPE IV."
"At the time, you said you did not know."
"We are now three months away from the end of our term of office, and I should like to ask you once again when the new premises will be completed."
"Will it be before the end of the present term of office or will we have to wait for the next term?"
"I can only give you the same reply, Mr Striby: when it is ready."
"That is not in our hands, but in those of the contractor, who was not chosen by us."
"He was chosen by SERS, a publicly owned company incorporating various public enterprises in the Strasbourg region."
"You might do better to put your question to the contractor and ask if it is going to keep to its schedule."
"If that were the case, the building would be completed towards the end of this parliamentary term, but it was meant to be finished last year as well, and that did not happen."
"So I can only tell you that we shall have the building when it is ready."
"I cannot add anything more, since this company regularly fails to keep to its own schedules. It is unfortunate, but that is how things are."
"I would like to make one further point."
"I happen to know that France has done everything necessary."
"It would appear that the ball is in the European Parliament's court."
"If you are denying this, I am happy to take note of it."
"The French Government has used all possible means to try to make progress on a question which is not its direct responsibility, but that of a company, as I would repeat."
"Clearly, when it does not have the means to do so, it cannot force the company's hand and make it fulfil its obligations."
"The French Government is trying to move things forward as far as possible, and thanks to its intervention, we have made up some of the delay, which would otherwise be even worse."
"I can tell you nothing more."
"Put your question to SERS, which can tell you what it is doing in order to meet its commitments."
"In any event, we are unable to do anything."
"Mr President, after hearing your fine words on the follow-up to Mrs Hoff's report on equal opportunities for women and men at the Secretariat of the European Parliament, I should like to point out that during the COPEC meeting we had with various officials this morning at the Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg, we took the view that the European Parliament should set an example by adopting a programme of positive action with fixed time-limits and statistical objectives in order to put an end to the under-representation of women, particularly in A-grade posts in the European Parliament where they only account for 20 %."
"You will therefore have the opportunity to practise what you preach by taking an ad hoc decision in the Bureau, the majority of whose members are men."
"I am sure that all the members of the Bureau will have taken note of your comments."
"Mr President, according to an article published by the Finnish joint news agency on 26 February, we said we did not believe that enlargement of the European Union was being delayed, even though the negotiations on Agenda 2000 were dragging on."
"Furthermore, we are supposed to have said that the negotiations on Agenda 2000 might continue during the Finnish Presidency and even up to and including the Portuguese Presidency without creating any problems for the enlargement process."
"Mr President, I should like to put it to you first of all, was the report in the Finnish press correct in saying that we do not think it would create problems for enlargement?"
"Secondly, what was such a view based on?"
"And, thirdly, is this consistent with your duties in accordance with Article 19 of the Rules of Procedure?"
"At the moment, I cannot respond to any articles in the press since I do not know whether or not they accurately reflect my position."
"When asked in the past if I believed that Agenda 2000 could be concluded, I have always given the same reply. Parliament is doing everything it ought to ensure that, as far as we are concerned, it can be concluded by May."
"As far as the Council is concerned, it will be up to the Council itself to decide if it will be able to conclude the negotiations in March."
"Enlargement may perhaps take place in 2003."
"But as I do not have the exact details of the article, I cannot tell you whether or not it is correct."
"If you send me a translation of the article, I will gladly tell you if it is a true reflection of my views."
"Mr President, I thought I heard Mrs Banotti requesting that the citizens of Gibraltar should have the right to vote in the European elections."
"I may have missed the first part of her speech, so I would like to know if she initially also asked for the citizens of Gibraltar to have the right to vote in British elections, since exercising European citizenship goes hand in hand with exercising national citizenship."
"Thank you, Mrs García Arias."
"I believe you heard correctly, but that is a quite legitimate contribution to the debate."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed."
"Mr Wijsenbeek made a comment earlier about the Wibe report."
"Rule 6(6) of the Rules of Procedure is left over from a time when the reports on these requests were put to the vote at the end of the first item on the agenda."
"This was subsequently changed and they are now voted on later instead."
"I therefore believe that the spirit of the rule is basically that the debate on the report should be held on the first day of the sitting following the tabling of the report and that this does not mean that we have to change today's agenda."
"Mr Fayot has the floor."
"Mr President, I have listened to your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure."
"I am sorry to have to contradict you, but in my opinion the provisions of the Rules are perfectly clear."
"They state that the report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda, and I think that as the French version uses the term 'd'office ', meaning 'without consultation', there is no need to take a vote, and that this term simply means the report should be placed at the head of the agenda."
"I am sorry that I have to contradict both the Conference of Presidents and the President."
"I think that if we are to follow our Rules of Procedure, we must therefore place the report at the head of the agenda. There is no need to take a vote."
"Very well, we have heard the opinion of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, and I do not claim to be infallible."
"We shall therefore place the report at the head of the agenda and the other reports will follow immediately afterwards."
"Tuesday:"
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has asked for the Commission statement on the trade dispute over bananas between the European Union and the United States to be brought forward from Friday to Tuesday and taken after the report by Mrs Haug on the Union's own resources."
"Mrs Green has the floor."
"Mr President, I wish to say, on behalf of my group, that it is important that this issue, which has become a major trade dispute between the United States and the European Union, should not be dealt with on Friday."
"Important as the Friday sitting is, and we all accept that, it is more important for us to be able to debate and vote on this issue when there is a very substantial number of Members in this House."
"In the last few days it has become a very critical issue - bearing in mind the fact that the United States is imposing sanctions at this very moment in advance of the WTO ruling - and my group feels very strongly that we should bring it forward to tomorrow so that we can hear the result of the discussions in the WTO today and the relevant Commissioner can be available tomorrow to deal with it."
"Mr President, I am opposed to this."
"Why?"
"Because we chose to deal with the matter on Friday."
"This means that whenever there is a debate which is a tiny bit important, it gets taken off the agenda."
"That is no kind of a solution."
"That is the first thing."
"The second thing is that we have already had problems enough with the large number of reports which now have to be dealt with on Tuesday."
"If we add bananas as well, our agenda for Tuesday will be even more crowded."
"We would be prepared to consider Thursday."
"But we cannot endorse the principle as such that an important issue should be taken off the agenda for Friday."
"Having now heard one speaker in favour and one against, I put to the vote the change proposed by the Socialist Group."
"Parliament approved the request"
"Wednesday: no changes"
"Thursday:"
"Mr President, I find it literally scandalous that a report on the enhanced partnership between the European Union and India has been placed on Friday's agenda."
"We manage to find a space on the Wednesday or Thursday agenda for China, the great Communist empire, but we can find only five minutes at the end of a part-session for the largest democracy in the world."
"It is absolutely scandalous!"
"A vast amount of progress is being made in India."
"There is the potential for a strategic partnership for the European Union with a country that has a population of one billion, and we treat it as if it were a small remote island in the middle of the Pacific."
"I therefore urge the House to see to it that this matter can at least be discussed on Thursday."
"Is there a speaker for or against?"
"Mr President, I am not exactly speaking against it but I am concerned that if we take it on Thursday it will, in any case, be voted on Friday."
"If that is the case I wonder whether it might not be better simply to take it to the next session when we can discuss it at a more appropriate time."
"I have to be against, then."
"We have a major problem of principle here in this House."
"Various honourable Members have sought to uphold Friday as a full day of the part-session, and we have done that in circumstances which were often difficult."
"A second point of principle is that either we take Fridays seriously in Parliament or we do not."
"I have some sympathy for Mrs Green's arguments on the matter of voting, but it is an extremely important question of principle here in Parliament if we decide to stop debating important subjects on a Friday."
"Mr President, as Mr Martens well knows, we also have an agreement that if there is an issue on the Friday morning that groups feel is inappropriately placed, then we would agree to try and find a better place for it or defer it."
"That has been our position for some time now in the Conference of Presidents and I think if there is clear disagreement by some of the groups that this should be on Friday morning then we should stick with that agreement."
"I do not think that is quite what the agreement is."
"The agreement is that if there are reports which are controversial, they should not be placed on Friday's agenda."
"In any event, however, I now put to the vote the request by the ARE Group."
"Parliament rejected the request"
"There are no changes to the agenda for the sittings on 22 and 23 March 1999."
"Request for a waiver of immunity"
"The next item is the report (A4-0076/99) by Mr Wibe, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the request for the waiver of Mr Rosado Fernandes's immunity."
"Mr President, let me first of all say that I had no objection to postponing my business in order to allow the important debate on violence against women to take place."
"Instead, I shall be brief."
"The matter under discussion concerns a request from the Prosecutor-General of the Portuguese Republic for a waiver of immunity in respect of one of our colleagues, Mr Rosado Fernandes, for his disparaging remarks about Portuguese agricultural policy, as well as certain references he made to the Minister of Agriculture at the time."
"The matter turns on whether the remarks can be construed as disparaging."
"In judging a case such as this, knowledge of the legal principles that govern parliamentary immunity is of paramount importance."
"In this Parliament, as in most democratic countries, parliamentary immunity is most assuredly not a personal privilege bestowed on individual Members."
"Rather, it is a form of protection for Parliament as a democratic institution."
"It provides protection for Members, thus enabling them to carry out the political duties they were elected to perform."
"It follows that the key principle underlying our rules on immunity is that the latter should only be waived where the charge has nothing to do with one's work as an MEP."
"If the charge has a direct, or even an indirect connection with one's parliamentary work, immunity should not be waived."
"Other circumstances where it cannot be waived include clear cases of victimisation where the aim has been to discredit a Member politically, or where a trivial occurrence might have serious political implications."
"In such cases, it is reasonable to maintain that immunity should not be waived."
"In the present case, it should first of all be noted that the Member of Parliament in question, Mr Rosado Fernandes, has a deep and lively interest in agricultural policy issues - in actual fact it is his speciality."
"He is also a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It should also be noted that the remarks with which he now stands charged were made in a definite political context."
"They refer to the agricultural policy of his own country."
"It should finally be noted that the tone adopted by Mr Rosado Fernandes did not greatly depart from what would be regarded as the norm in a heated political debate."
"To sum up, it is therefore reasonable to say that the remarks made by Mr Rosado Fernandes cannot be divorced from his work in Parliament."
"For that reason, I do not think the request for a waiver of immunity should be granted."
"I therefore propose that we do not grant the request for a waiver."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Violence against women - Daphne programme"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Commission statement on violence against women; -the oral question (B4-0145/99) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, to the Commission, on the programme of Community action (Daphne Programme) (2000-2004) on measures aimed at preventing violence against children, young persons and women.I give the floor to Mrs Gradin, for the Commission."
"I shall start with the declaration."
"It is the last International Women's Day of this century."
"A declaration on the situation of women, and especially on violence against women, is thus appropriate."
"The Member States of the European Union are democratic societies where women and men have equal rights."
"Women form slightly more than half of the population in every country."
"However, this is not reflected either in decision-making bodies or in administration or business life."
"All of our countries have subscribed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"We all know that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights."
"What then is the situation in our countries?"
"Women have the right to live in safety, but a great number are not even safe in their own homes."
"Women have the right to be treated with dignity, but thousands and thousands of women are sold like cattle and regarded as only having the value their pimps and traffickers can get from exploiting them."
"Women have full human rights but oppression and violence keep them in subordinate positions in all our countries."
"Today the issue of violence against women is internationally recognised as a substantial problem."
"With the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, women's rights were finally accepted as human rights."
"Gender-based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person."
"Such behaviour has to be eliminated."
"The issue of violence against women was on the agenda of the United Nations Women's Conference in Beijing in 1995."
"The Platform underlined that violence against women is an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of equality, development and peace."
"For years it was often said that women had themselves to blame if they were beaten and raped."
"It was said that they should not wear short skirts."
"This argument is sometimes still used but in slightly different forms."
"I personally would not, by the way, use the argument that the wearing of jeans is a guarantee against rape."
"Today, the common view is that the woman and her testimony should be relied upon in court."
"Most Member States have changed their laws so as to make violence against women a criminal act."
"Also, rape within marriage is now a crime."
"Women often have the right to a special counsellor during court proceedings."
"Women's organisations play an essential role in the fight against violence."
"They reach out to those at risk and are active in raising awareness among the public."
"This is the very basis of the Daphne initiative."
"Since 1996 we have supported nongovernmental and voluntary organisations in their fight against violence towards women and children."
"The demand for support is far greater than the resources available."
"The new Daphne programme will also be open for NGOs from countries from Central and Eastern Europe."
"The Commission and the presidencies have also launched a campaign against violence towards women, in response to the demand by the European Parliament to make 1999 a year against violence against women."
"During this campaign a number of European actions are being organised."
"The next big European event will be the ministerial conference on violence against women, to be held in Cologne at the end of this month."
"The campaign against violence is not just a series of official European conferences: the Member States themselves are of course invited to initiate events involving both the public and NGOs."
"For many years the issue of violence against women was discussed as a women's problem."
"But it is not women who are the problem, it is the violent behaviour of men."
"Therefore we should not only focus on women."
"Women and children are the victims of this violence."
"The problem is men who argue using physical force and violence instead of words."
"This campaign should therefore also focus on men and what can be done to change the present situation."
"Projects by, for and about men will be supported in the Member States."
"Let me quote a Swedish doctor who wrote before the United Nations Women's Conference in Beijing: 'Sufficient numbers of men must discover and take an active stand against the violence which occurs around them."
"A greater number of men must make themselves heard at workplaces in the public debate and refuse to go along with this violence."
"Violence of this kind is despicable and inhuman and therefore also unmanly."
"Real men do not behave like that.'. Fathers must pass this message on to their sons, teachers to their pupils, military commanders to their men, and friends to one another."
"As part of our European campaign I invite all men today to support the campaign by wearing a white ribbon."
"This ribbon is a sign that you are real men, who say 'no' to violence against women."
"Applause"
"The achievements under the Daphne programme have been impressive."
"Violence against women, adolescents and children has been placed high on the political agenda."
"A total of 95 projects have been supported since 1997."
"These projects have led to the establishment of useful networks and cross-border cooperation between non-governmental organisations."
"An observatory on violence against women has been established and research projects are under way."
"An important part of the Daphne programme is the campaign against violence against women."
"This campaign is based on an initiative from the European Parliament."
"A preparatory meeting was held in June last year under the British presidency."
"In December the Austrian presidency hosted a conference in Vienna."
"It focused on the role of the police in combating violence against women and violence against migrant women."
"At the end of March the German presidency will host a ministerial conference in Cologne."
"There are also plans for a concluding conference towards the end of the Finnish presidency."
"Between these conferences several actions are being organised on both a European and a national level."
"Examples are the production of television spots, information packages and a website on the Internet."
"We are also conducting a statistical report on violence as well as Eurobarometer."
"Projects will also be supported in the Member States."
"One of the main targets will be projects focusing on men and how to prevent violent behaviour from men towards women."
"On 20 May 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for the new Daphne programme."
"This programme will run from 2002 to 2004 with a total budget of ECU 25m."
"Since then I have been anxious to have the proposal adopted as soon as possible."
"We need to have the programme in place at the latest by 1 January 2000."
"During the Austrian presidency progress was meagre."
"By the end of 1998 the discussion focused on the legal base of the proposal."
"A number of Member States made it clear that they were opposed to Article 235 as the legal base for the programme."
"On the other hand, many Member States saw Article 129 as an appropriate alternative to the legal base."
"The discussions in the Council in January and February showed clearly that there was a considerable risk of blockage if Article 235 was maintained."
"The Commission was therefore forced to accept the proposed new legal base."
"Nobody should be in any doubt that we would have preferred to keep Article 235 but we had to face the fact that there is no value in an unadopted Daphne programme."
"I assume that Article 129 will not limit the scope of the programme."
"The context in which we work to combat violence and in which women and children suffer is, indeed, the context of human rights."
"However, the impact of violence on women, young persons and children amounts to injury or the risk of injury to their physical, mental and psychological health."
"It should be noted that according to the World Health Organisation's definition, health is 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'."
"Furthermore, the Daphne programme is victim-based."
"Its aim is to prevent all forms of violence and to protect all victims and potential victims of violence, irrespective of whether the violence takes the form of trafficking, sexual abuse, the abandonment of children or any other form."
"I regret the inconvenience that this amendment has caused the European Parliament."
"However, in our view it was necessary to act swiftly in order for Parliament to take account of the amended proposal at its committee meeting on 16 and 17 February this year."
"When the new Daphne programme is adopted it will provide a new impetus in the fight against violence."
"Under the programme we will continue to provide support for NGO cooperation within the European Union but we will also be able to include cooperation with NGOs in the candidate countries."
"I recently participated in a conference in Budapest with NGOs active in the fight against sexual exploitation of children."
"The extent of the problem is immense."
"The need for support and cooperation with the NGO community in these countries is evident."
"If we are to succeed in the fight against violence we need concrete action involving all parts of our society."
"To fight against violence towards women is the responsibility of us all."
"We welcome the fact that the European Parliament will consider the amended proposal in its appropriate committee in March with a view to submitting it to the April plenary session for first reading."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Hardly anyone can be left in any doubt that the Committee on Women's Rights and the European Parliament have been responsible for the European Union's decision to tackle the problem of violence against women, children and young people."
"We want these campaigns to be carried out as this is a very serious social problem."
"In previous years the European Parliament adopted specific budgetary policies to counter the problem of violence against women, children and young persons, and there has been overwhelming interest in setting up projects of this kind, so that in 1997, for example, funding could be provided for only just over 10 % of all the projects proposed."
"The European Parliament has also approved two very important reports dealing with violence against women."
"A report compiled under the leadership of Marianne Eriksson raises the issue of so-called zero tolerance in matters of violence."
"An important report was also put together under the leadership of Susan Waddington extending the debate to cover the issue of the trade in women."
"It is an astonishing fact that there are two million women and young girls in the world being sold every year to be sexually exploited, which means that the issue is not actually merely an EU problem, but a global one, and one in which we must be able to intervene."
"Our committee is very worried that if the Commission now gives in to those Member States which do not agree that the Daphne programme should be made law under Article 235, the scope of the programme will not be adequate to the scale of the problem."
"We would like it to deal with all the possible legal aspects connected with violence against women, including the trade in women."
"If the legal basis is the promotion of public health, we want guarantees that the Commission will actually be able to create a programme, in conjunction with the Member States, in which violence against women is not merely reduced to a health problem."
"All credit goes to Mrs Gradin for her attempts to meet our demands that the notion of public health must be understood in as broad a context as possible here."
"But we actually want guarantees that legal instruments might also be on the agenda."
"Let me tell you about the situation in Finland."
"A law came into force at the beginning of this year in Finland under which the police or a court can impose a restraining order on a person who has behaved violently. In other words, a person may be prevented from coming near their victim when there is reason to fear that violent acts will be carried out again."
"In the Member States there are certainly other excellent examples of how this matter can be approached using legal means."
"As for the global nature of this problem, I have received, in my capacity as chairman of the committee, a letter from an Iranian organisation pointing out that women in Iran are still being stoned."
"We should also remember that we are sure to become involved in these global aspects of the issue with this programme."
"Commissioner, I was not altogether convinced, having heard your reply, that this change to the legal basis will now guarantee us a good programme within the Daphne context."
"Perhaps we can try together to convince those reluctant Member States I mentioned that they should agree to consider Article 235 as a legal basis."
"I understand that in fact you were of the same opinion as us originally, but that now you base your opinion on the overall importance, in general terms, of accomplishing this programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome you all to International Women's Day."
"I have just come from a worldwide video conference, organised by Unifem, the UN women's organisation, which calls for a worldwide campaign for a world free of violence against women."
"We in the European Parliament are preparing to make an important contribution to this campaign."
"We are taking part in worldwide actions and I think it is most important for the women in our Member States to realise that they are not alone, that we are fighting alongside them."
"We in the European Union have been fighting for a long time for a European year against violence against women."
"A year ago 350 Members supported the written declaration calling for this and for a campaign to that end."
"Now we have reached the point where we can start the campaign and have a draft programme on the table."
"But legal problems are arising now: reasons - which in my view are pretexts - are being put forward by the most varied groups of people, which will prevent the Daphne programme from being adopted at an early date."
"We Social Democrats want rapid action. We want the programme to be adopted quickly, obviously with the participation of the European Parliament, which also has a greater say thanks mainly to the use of Article 129 as the legal basis."
"But I can see that it will be very difficult to get the programme ready on time so that it really can enter into force by 1 January 2000."
"What we definitely want to ensure - and we will fight for this - is that large sections of the previous draft programme are not cut, such as those on trafficking in women and domestic violence - I find it difficult to call it häusliche Gewalt , violence in the home, as it is called in German, for no home is violent as such, it is always the people, and usually the men who are violent in the home - and that we get the programme wrapped up in good time."
"You all know we will be having new elections, Parliament has to be formed first, and the Council presidencies have to take that into consideration."
"The German President-in-Office of the Council, Christine Bergmann, said in the Committee on Women's Rights that she wants to see the Daphne programme signed and sealed as soon as possible."
"The Justice Ministers want the programme too, but nevertheless formal difficulties have cropped up again."
"This is probably largely because we do not have a formal Council of Ministers for women's affairs that could adopt the programme, and this is another very crucial demand made by my group."
"If we discuss the matter at all, we would say that Article 129 must definitely lead to a multidisciplinary approach."
"We also want to take account even at this stage of the provisions that will come with the Amsterdam Treaty, which will presumably enter into force by the year 2000, and we want a comprehensive definition of what the concept of health actually covers. This means that we must also look at the social background to violence and in particular we must adhere to the approach that non-governmental organisations, Member State authorities and the judiciary and police can all work together here."
"That is vital if we are to pass on the message to our citizens that Europe and the European Parliament are fighting to prevent all forms of violence against women."
"Applause"
"Mr President, today is a day of celebration for many of us, a day of solidarity, a tribute and a mark of our respect for all the women and children who still do not have rights and who are subjected to abuse and violence."
"The fight for equal opportunities and the struggle against violence affect us all and their success benefits the whole of society."
"I would have liked to have been here presenting the report by the Committee on Women's Rights on the Daphne Programme, for which I am the rapporteur. However, as you all know, this was not possible as the legal basis was changed at the last minute, when a great deal of work had already been done on the report."
"It is not bad news although certain aspects do concern us."
"Our main priority is to ensure that the Daphne Programme moves forward."
"As you will remember, it was this House's initiative to create a special budget line to fund measures for combating violence against women and children, and in the three years since its creation, it has seen magnificent results."
"There is a high degree of collaboration between NGOs, civil society and public bodies which has led to many new ideas and projects. Together they are searching for better solutions, and it is our responsibility - and that of all the Community institutions - to implement this programme before the end of the year."
"For the first time, the European Union is facing the challenge of a five-year programme to combat violence."
"Five years is a long time for those who are suffering."
"It is therefore also our duty to prepare a good text setting out an appropriate strategy for the medium term that effectively helps to prevent and mitigate the effects of violence on women, children and young people."
"As a result, Commissioner, we are extremely concerned about the definition of the concept of public health."
"This must be interpreted more widely to mean a state of physical, mental and social well-being and we hope that this will be the case."
"Trafficking in women, sexual abuse and the disappearance of children are all forms of violence."
"The European Union can provide an important added value in combating such violence."
"It would be unfortunate if these issues were left aside just because a legal concept was poorly interpreted."
"Today is the last 8 March of this millennium."
"On the first 8 March, women were almost invisible."
"Over the last 20 years many inequalities have been corrected but discrimination still exists."
"I do not want to end without highlighting the major challenge facing us if we are to make the principle of equality a reality."
"The ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam will certainly help us to do that as we will have firm legal bases that establish mainstreaming as a fundamental and horizontal objective."
"There is still too much direct and indirect discrimination that prevents women from playing a full role as citizens, that hinders their access to employment and that prevents them from being independent and having high self-esteem."
"The fourth action programme serves as a guideline in all the Member States but its aims must not end with the programme. Rather, we should pursue them and improve them in a fifth action programme."
"We must promote the reconciliation of professional and family lives and encourage women to get involved in politics. These are key elements for the participation of women in society and, of course, their integration into the labour market."
"The European Union has many resources it can draw on to provide assistance."
"I hope that Agenda 2000 and the new Fund regulations - which are vital documents - establish clear measures in favour of working women."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally endorse what Commissioner Gradin has said."
"She rightly points to the fact that women are still under-represented in decision-making forums, government and the world of business and industry."
"This is despite the fact that there are more women than men in the European Union."
"Parliament's President himself has just said that more work is needed here."
"She rightly observes that women's rights are human rights."
"Women are entitled to be safe and to be treated with human dignity."
"To a lot of men, including men in this Chamber, violence against women is a marginal and rare phenomenon, at least in the European Union."
"But the figures tell us that one woman in five has at some point been the victim of violence."
"Violence against women and children too occurs in all societies and at all levels of society, irrespective of culture or religion."
"She is also right to say that the battle against violence against women must not be waged solely by women and by non-governmental organisations seeking to help stop violence against women."
"First and foremost we have to tackle its root causes, and those are not short skirts or too little assertiveness on the part of women, but the millions of European men who use violence in some form or other every day."
"We must use 1999, the year of campaigning against violence towards women, to make men aware of their obligations."
"For all these reasons and given your most excellent statement, I find it a pity that the new legal base for the Daphne programme is so restrictive, even though you are asking for it to be interpreted broadly."
"Lastly, the Daphne programme also covers violence against children and young people."
"I have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of my group to ensure that this is made clear in the resolution, in the title and in a number of paragraphs as well."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be the first man to speak in this debate on International Women's Day."
"I want in particular to assure my colleagues here that the vast majority of men would support them fully in ensuring that they have full equality of rights, parity of esteem and protection against any violence whatsoever."
"I am proud to wear the white ribbon to show that I make that stand myself personally."
"I know I speak for the majority of my colleagues here as well."
"It is important that the statements made in this House are not just made in a vacuum and that we send a message out to the wider world that we in the European Parliament are willing to be visionary and to bring the world into the 21st century by guaranteeing equality of rights for all; and, in particular, by putting in place special protection programmes for those who suffer violence."
"That is why the Daphne programme is so important to us, not only because - if I could use the phrase - it was our own child, but also because we see the importance of its effect on a global scale."
"We have already experienced some of the benefits from the Daphne programme."
"It is unfortunate that legal difficulties - which this Parliament has encountered many times through the use of Article 235 - have delayed the implementation of the new programme."
"However, I am confident that, utilising the new legal base, we can begin once again to put this issue on the map."
"It is also important that when we decide to bring in new programmes, we ensure that the voluntary sector and the non-governmental organisations who are working at the coalface, who are there with women's and children's refuges to help them, are brought in at the very earliest stage to advise us of what is the most effective way of utilising funding."
"But it is equally important to bring the governments of the Member States along with us, because, as has been seen from the use of Article 235, certain governments felt this was an imposition on them, and that it interfered with their democratic rights under the rules of subsidiarity within the Treaties."
"Therefore, we must ensure that governments are seen to be playing an active role in that regard."
"The new equal opportunities created for us in the Treaty of Amsterdam must be grasped fully."
"But henceforth let the message from here be: men and women oppose violence against women, against children, against all."
"Mr President, there has been some talk about the legal basis."
"If the Commissioner does not have a problem with the legal base, then as regards the Daphne programme, nor do I. It is just that my own personal dream of including preventive medicine and the trade in women has still not been fulfilled."
"I hope that in spite of everything, we may yet be able to reach agreement on all areas."
"However, I can see that it is going to be an uphill struggle, although perhaps we should not paint too gloomy a picture."
"Now that I have the floor, I should in any case like to thank the voluntary organisations for their work, not just within the European Union, but all over the world."
"Even though we politicians may be amazingly competent, we cannot deny that there is a need for teamwork between us who are elected by the people and those who toil at grass-roots level."
"It is that teamwork which will enable us to make progress."
"I should also like to mention that I am wearing jeans in honour of the day."
"I must say that I was extremely surprised by the Italian court ruling."
"It made me think that if only it were a simple matter for myself and our children to wear jeans, we would have an infinitely better working arrangement with the jeans manufacturers who are currently having such problems."
"Unfortunately, however, wearing jeans is not a simple matter."
"I have been wearing jeans now for several days in celebration of International Women's Day, which was first proclaimed by women Socialists at the beginning of the century, and by the United Nations in 1975, since we are hardly ever able to celebrate it on 8 March."
"I hope that some time in the next century it may be possible to designate 8 March a holiday in honour of us women, so that we can celebrate that one day in a fitting manner."
"I am delighted about the 'White Ribbon' campaign, organised by 'real' men in Canada to demonstrate, by wearing this token, that they actively oppose violence by other men against women."
"I think it is a very commendable campaign, and I sincerely hope that all those men who are wearing a ribbon today in the House continue to sport it for the rest of their lives, instead of discarding it once this day comes to an end."
"Violence by men against women is, as was mentioned earlier, a worldwide problem of enormous proportions and with devastating implications for those concerned."
"It is not good enough for one man to say 'but I for one am not usually violent'. Obviously, there are other men who are."
"This is something we are frighteningly aware of today."
"I should also like to thank the Swedish Government, which last year brought in legislation to protect women that viewed their problems from a different perspective."
"For example, the customers of prostitutes are to be criminalised, an approach which this House found highly amusing some 18 months ago, but which is now the subject of legislation in one Member State at least."
"Finally, I should like to extend my thanks to Leyla Zana, one of several women who are still the victims of political violence."
"Although the President should never make comments, Mrs Eriksson, I would inform you that in several of our countries there are many initiatives along the same lines as the one launched in Canada, even though they have not yet been as widely publicised."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again for the umpteenth time we find that in some Member States it takes clever legal manoeuvring to combat violence against women and children in an effective manner, and that some Member States resist that."
"We hope the Commissioner is right, or wins through, and that even with an inadequate legal base she will manage to implement a programme which is effective in combating crimes such as trafficking in human beings."
"Measures to combat violence against women and children are a priority worldwide."
"They really mean the start of peace - the start of moves towards a peaceful society and a humane society from which many women and children are still excluded."
"Many men suffer violence too, but as we take up and intensify the campaign against violence against women and children today, I think we can be pleased with what Commissioner Gradin has said, although of course the Chamber does not altogether reflect that."
"The men have drifted away in droves, despite being sympathetic on this issue."
"Happily we have already heard one male speaker, and undoubtedly there are many others who will feel sympathetic."
"But it took some time before women too realised that we must not simply act to defend the victims better, but that violence is a problem of men which must therefore be tackled by men."
"That being so, I readily endorse what has been said here on the subject."
"I shall respectfully submit a written declaration to you, Mr President, I hope on behalf of a large number of honourable Members, asking you as the President of Parliament to take steps to set up a commission on children's rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to point out how ridiculous it is to hand out little white ribbons at the entrance of Parliament, as if it were heroic to wear it as a sign of courage and originality."
"For goodness sake, what type of conformism is society being taken over by?"
"Would anyone here dare to say that if he does not wear this white ribbon, it is because he is in favour of violence against women?"
"There were other periods in history when it was more difficult to wear the white rosette, as did young knights who fought to defend the most martyred queen in our history, Marie-Antoinette."
"In France, where I come from, talking about violence against women would involve mentioning all those women who were guillotined during the French Revolution, the Carmelite nuns of Orange and all the acts of persecution."
"It would mean having to mention the 3 000 French women who were deported to Algeria in 1962 amidst total indifference."
"The European institutions did not want to hear a word about it."
"These women were deported to houses of pleasure of the Fellaga army rabble in Algeria."
"Jasmina and a friend of hers were saying to me only yesterday in my office that yes, they are frightened every day, frightened of being threatened with their lives or being raped."
"That is the reason there is violence against women."
"Why not say so then?"
"In some areas in my country, there are more cases of rape each day than there are burnt-out cars."
"This year, 700 cars have been burnt out in Strasbourg."
"Yet, how many more rapes were there?"
"Nothing is said about this because it is a millstone around our necks. It certainly must not be discussed."
"However, why not talk about the presence of displaced persons on our territory who have the same morals as those who are fighting over in Algeria, and who are raping women and slitting people's throats?"
"Talking about violence against women would mean having to talk about the infamous group, 'Nique ta mère' , which has been glorified as a so-called anti-racist group."
"It is despicable that it dares to have a name like that, and yet the records are selling thanks to capitalists promoting them, as is seen in FNAC and elsewhere."
"Talking about violence against women would of course mean having to talk about abortion, which is the worst kind of violence, and which has become commonplace nowadays; it would also sadly mean having to talk about self-destruction, a type of violence sometimes forced on women by the propaganda with which we are all familiar."
"Finally, talking about violence against women would mean having to admit that the death penalty, which is necessary for the most abominable assassins, must be reintroduced for those capable of such forms of torture."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly congratulating Commissioner Gradin on her speech on the issue of violence against women."
"This is a very significant day."
"It illustrates a real determination for a Europe-wide campaign against violence to women."
"All the work we have undertaken in the Committee on Women's Rights and in this Parliament in the last few years illustrates the influence of Parliament and the Committee on Women's Rights in taking a determined stand against violence to women."
"We expect to see action across every Member State."
"We know the difficulties we have already experienced in getting this far."
"There have been objections from many quarters."
"Yet we have reached the point, that we know there are going to be new actions, new research, new initiatives, new projects, all of which will contribute towards raising awareness of the issue of violence towards women and combating it."
"I am sure all of us recognise that we have a responsibility to work in our own Member States, in our own networks, to combat violence."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party have accepted that and we are beginning our own campaign this week."
"We intend to consult with practitioners in all the regions of the UK and to prepare a platform for action."
"We also want to develop partnerships between our own non-governmental organisations and those in other Member States so that we can share good ideas and good practice."
"We want to extend that globally to work with countries like South Africa."
"I have just returned from that country and the issue of violence against women is very high on the agenda."
"There is a great need for all of us to work together globally."
"Like Commissioner Gradin we also want men to stand beside us."
"It is men in this Parliament and men in the various committees that have been dealing with this issue who, for budgetary and legal reasons, have often resisted the work we have been doing."
"It is men who are the perpetrators of violence against women and men have to take this seriously."
"I think the white ribbon campaign is excellent and I want to see British men, and men in all communities and all towns wearing that white ribbon and supporting women across the European Union."
"One in four women experiences violence and virtually every woman is vulnerable to violence."
"Every woman supports this campaign."
"The European Union is known for combating oppression and opposing violence."
"Let us make sure we oppose it in our own cities, towns and homes."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mme Gradin."
"When she was appointed in 1995 she made this topic one of her priorities and despite a great deal of discouragement she has actually won through and we are now having a major debate in this Parliament about a subject that was often sniggered about but rarely taken seriously until she decided to do so."
"I would also like to congratulate the staff who are running the Daphne Programme."
"They are always available and always very supportive."
"Mr Simpson is perhaps the person we know best."
"He has made a real campaign out of this and a real mission for himself."
"These programmes - Daphne, STOP and Grotius - came into existence following the tragedy of the Dutroux murders in Belgium."
"It was a tragedy but also proved to be a catalyst when finally the political classes woke up to the fact that there was a really serious problem."
"If I concentrate my remarks on children in this debate it is not because I am not totally at one with my colleagues who have spoken about the need to confront very seriously the major problem we have in all our societies with violence against women; but increasingly, in the last three or four years the issue of children's rights and the protection of those rights have begun slowly but finally to take their place amongst the political priorities in many of our countries."
"All too often the real movers and shakers in this area are the NGOs who are, invariably, inadequately funded and constantly knocking on the door to try and bring these issue to the public."
"For that reason we need a dedicated unit within the Commission to draw together the many programmes."
"They are quite small, there is not a lot of money in them, but they are in danger of fragmentation if things continue like this."
"I would stress that all of us in our own countries, as Mrs Waddington has said, have to get the men to recognise that children are not just the responsibility of their mothers."
"Mr President, I obviously agree with Mrs Hautala's resolution and of course, with women's struggle to secure their right to human dignity and integrity."
"However, I should like to make one remark in connection with this."
"Like Mrs Banotti, I note that the Committee on Women's Rights has to some extent taken possession of the Daphne programme, which is the result of the initiative taken by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and which to begin with was mainly directed towards the campaign against paedophilia."
"Like Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, I should not like current events to result in this programme being redirected slightly, guaranteeing protection for women only and neglecting its other mission when every day children are the victims of unthinkable acts of cruelty."
"I therefore urge the Commission to continue to earmark a substantial proportion of the funds for important measures undertaken by organisations whose task is to search for children who have disappeared and support families who are victims of this type of tragedy."
"Finally, I would say to the House that rather than tearing each other apart for the sake of a small amount of funds, I wish that all the different parties could join together - not only today but also when we discuss the budget - in calling for a significant and substantial increase in funds for a purpose which is quite obviously first and foremost a humanitarian one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are celebrating International Women's Day with great enthusiasm, emotion and hope."
"I should like to add 'with admiration and dignity', as women represent 50 % of the world's population and are responsible for the remaining 50 %."
"In modern societies, a woman is called upon to perform many roles, as mother, wife, simple companion, scientist, worker, politician, and as a woman in the arts."
"Today a woman can claim these roles as her own and on an equal footing with men, with whom she can also share them."
"I believe that the European Union has made a significant contribution to bringing this about. The European Parliament especially has taken decisions to strengthen equal rights and equal opportunities legislation on behalf of the women who live in our Member States."
"Yet it is a sad fact that, even today in our modern and civilised societies, we see that prejudice still exists in relation to the position of women."
"The practical implementation and observance of the regulations we institute cannot always be taken for granted and is often difficult to establish, as discrimination is something which does not always happen directly."
"Let us not forget that there are countries where women and children still lack the most basic rights and where women do not know what is going to happen to them or how important their children are."
"I should like to remind you that, above all, women continue to be responsible for passing on our culture, our identity and our values from generation to generation."
"That is why modern society needs them more than ever, especially as a vehicle for culture and peace."
"If we want the legal protection of women's rights to have any substance and if we want the opportunities and rights of women to be put into effect, we must ensure that they receive the support they need to enable them to fulfil their roles. Today more than ever, we must place greater emphasis on education, training and health and on allowing women to grow up with dignity."
"Women must be able to take advantage of their rights and to take on their responsibilities. They must be able to pass on the precious values our society needs today and to cross the threshold of the new millennium with faith in justice and in the freedom of mankind."
"Mr President, Mr Antony has already left but his speech reminded me of the intrinsic institutionalised violence against women, the disabled, and ethnic and religious minorities that we unfortunately experienced during the era of European fascism."
"Commissioner, you are well aware that violence against women is not a public health problem, although as in the publicity against tobacco, we can say that violence and violent men seriously damage the lives and health of women and children."
"Violent people are not sick people."
"We must make it quite clear that they are criminals."
"Nevertheless, we are now faced with a challenge that has been laid down by the European Commission: we must readapt the objectives of the Daphne programme to fit a different legal basis, namely the protection of public health."
"Commissioner, I know just how much your personal commitment and efforts have allowed us to truly begin to cooperate in the fight against violence within the European Union."
"But I would like to ask you what effects you think the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam might have in the coming months in terms of our approach to combating violence."
"Will it mean that at a later date we will be able to modify the Daphne programme again or extend its scope?"
"I am worried about this because as you said, despite the broad interpretation of the concept of health, the fact is that all references to cooperation or programmes concerning the trafficking in women have been removed from the programme, yet we know that this is a Community programme."
"I disagree with Mr Crowley's defence of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Community provides an added value in combating trafficking in women and children, the abuse of children and paedophilia, and this is important when the European Union has to act not only in the context of cooperation under the third pillar, but also in collaboration with NGOs."
"In conclusion, Commissioner, I would like you to give us some reassurance about the broad interpretation of the concept of health and to tell us what effect the Treaty of Amsterdam might have, since I wonder whether it might not be better to wait until it enters into force."
"Mr President, how pleased I am to have heard some male voices in this debate, and likewise that this part of our discussion is being chaired by such an attentive male President: thank you!"
"It is vital that Europe should feel duty-bound to take action concerning both general and sexual violence against women."
"All of us - all of our governments, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council - have been striving over this past year to achieve a single currency and a single bank, to ensure that the euro is capable of holding its own against the excessively powerful dollar."
"We all strive to give financial matters pride of place; but we must try equally hard to ensure that the campaign against violence, particularly violence against women, becomes a cornerstone of European culture."
"Mention has been made of Daphne and of pursuing new aims: I agree with what has been said here, but I would call for new and steadily increasing funds for the programmes and projects under Daphne relating to children and women."
"I must thank the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, for having mentioned in her speech the question of so-called anti-rape jeans."
"A tragi-comical judgment handed down a month or so ago, in Italy, caused astonishment around the world."
"Today, provocatively, I am wearing jeans and displaying them for all to see, not to attract attention but because the Italian Supreme Court and Court of Appeal have declared that a woman wearing jeans cannot be raped."
"Jeans are a guarantee against rape."
"We do not wish to judge the Court of Appeal, but to highlight a lack of culture."
"The Europe which we create must be one of culture!"
"Let me quote an item from yesterday's Italian press, originally published in an Austrian newspaper: the miniskirt is dangerously provocative."
"In Austria, a woman in a miniskirt has been dismissed because of her attire."
"However, the problem is that everyone rushed to the defence not of the woman, but of the man who dismissed her, because apparently it was he who had been provoked and suffered sexual harassment."
"Mrs Gradin said that women must be protected; but we must also look after men wherever they need looking after, as men and as human beings."
"Mr President, I shall speak later on the Hautala proposal, and I shall refrain from commenting now on 8 March."
"Instead I would turn to the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, and begin by taking this opportunity to thank her for her hard work."
"I believe that Mrs Gradin's dedication to this topic - her strength, intelligence, good will and generosity - will go down in the annals of the European Union."
"She is without doubt responsible for the fact that, in recent years, there has been a series of actions aiming to overcome violence against women."
"On this point, I would ask that we take a positive view of the transition to Article 129, in that it confers much greater powers on Parliament."
"This House should theoretically be pleased, because progress might perhaps be more rapid at the end of the day."
"It remains to be seen, however, whether the programme will stay as before."
"I am all in favour of looking after men; indeed, I am convinced that only if we do so will they at last stop thinking that women can be bought, robbed and seized rather than being won over."
"I also agree to looking after women who have been the victims of violence and have suffered physical as well as psychological damage."
"But we are also committed to other actions under Daphne, and all I wish to know is whether the move from Article 235 to 129 will alter the content of this programme."
"That is precisely what we would not want."
"Mr President, I too am most grateful to the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin."
"Without wishing to repeat what colleagues have said, if the European tide has been turned in this area, then we owe it largely to her."
"I would echo what Mrs Marinucci said concerning the scope of the programme under Article 129."
"Let me give an example: in Italy, as elsewhere, women's organisations have for years supported, protected and housed women who have suffered violence, helping to reintegrate them socially."
"They have done so partly through refuges, where women can take shelter, along with their children, and can receive psychological and legal support as well as help in returning to work."
"In my view, if Article 129 really were restricted to health matters alone, it would greatly curtail the activities which are already under way and need to be extended."
"I therefore believe that, although we in Parliament certainly do have an important role under Article 129, since we can step in and bring matters to a rapid conclusion, we share Mrs Gradin's desire to see this programme up and running by early 2000."
"It really would be a shame and a retrograde step, in my opinion, if all the actions originally scheduled for Daphne could not be included in their entirety."
"Mr President, I wish to thank everybody for a very interesting debate, and the Committee on Women's Rights for the support it has given to this campaign concerning violence against women, and also for the support for the Daphne programme."
"Many of you have been concerned that we have had to change the legal base for Daphne."
"It must be said that we had a long debate in the Commission before we presented this programme to the Council and Parliament and we came to the conclusion that Article 235 would have been the best base."
"That is why we proposed it to both institutions."
"During the debate at least five countries - Germany, Britain, France, Denmark and Belgium - were very categorical that they could not accept Article 235."
"They wanted Article 129."
"In my view, it is better to get Daphne decided, and then after a year we can see whether the programme can be improved."
"Perhaps the programme is narrower than we had originally planned but let us get it started now, and then we can review the situation later."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"Women's health"
"The next item is the second report (A4-0029/99) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the Commission's report to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the state of women's health in the European Community (COM(97)0224 - C4-0333/97)."
"Mr President, I would like to say, concerning the previous speech, that Mrs Gradin has our full support to get the Daphne programme under way, and we will certainly be in a position to cooperate fully on this issue in the future."
"But now I would like to focus on another matter."
"The European Commission commissioned a report from the University of Limerick on the subject of women's health in the European Union."
"However, Parliament was rather perplexed as the Commission did not really make any decisions on the basis of the report, but sent it directly to us and the Council."
"Our task, as Parliament, then, is to lay down guidelines on how the issue of the state of women's health should be understood."
"It is certainly quite obvious that public health has improved in many respects and thus women are also healthier and live longer."
"However, we should realise there are new kinds of health threats which target women, such as the fact that more and more women have to be solely responsible for looking after their families, as single mothers."
"As is well known, they have many financial problems in such roles, and it is clear that the capacity and resources available for all the different kinds of health care are perhaps not perfect either."
"There are also new kinds of health problems which women seem to suffer from in particular, and which were not really so very widespread in earlier times."
"Take, for example, eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, though it has to be said that, surprisingly, young men too have started to suffer from these."
"The nature of such problems is certainly so difficult to understand as to be inexplicable, but we should recognise these phenomena and think about where their actual origins lie."
"Why does society put so much pressure specifically on young women, pressure that makes them react in this way?"
"It is a very interesting time to raise the matter of women's health, as the European Union is committed under the Treaty of Amsterdam to including at least two matters connected with this as part of all its activities."
"The first issue to form part of all Union policy is equality between women and men, and the second is public health."
"In my report I state that we have before us a double challenge, and that we have to apply the principle of transparency."
"Thus we really must examine the Union's future public health policy particularly, in this case, from the point of view of women."
"My first contention is that women are very poorly represented in decision making in the healthcare sector."
"They are of course very fully represented in the workforce, for example as nurses."
"But they are clearly under-represented on the managerial ladder and on decision-making boards in the healthcare sector."
"I know of research that shows that when women are also included in the management team the whole perspective changes."
"More attention starts to be paid to preventing, rather than merely curing, illness."
"This is a very interesting example, and one that shows that women also have their own way of working when they are allowed to take decisions."
"Then there are illnesses that only affect women, especially in health problems relating to childbearing."
"It is vital that we ensure that at every stage of a woman's life there are good, high-quality basic healthcare services available to her, whether they relate to maternity problems, maternity welfare or other gynaecological issues."
"Then there are complaints that affect women in a different way from men: heart and vascular disease, and alcoholism."
"Depression also seems to be commoner among women."
"This all has to be discussed without forgetting that as the population ages, there will be even more of us older women in society and that will place enormous demands on the healthcare system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Women's Rights on the report it has tabled and to say that, in general, I support it."
"However, I would like to highlight the fact that we do not aim to attach more importance to women's health than to men's health but to look at them in an equal light."
"Nonetheless, we need to emphasise that some of the health problems experienced by women are different and therefore require specific action."
"I am not going to describe again the state of women's health in the European Union as we already have a very clear picture. Moreover, the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala - whom I would like to congratulate on her report - has already done this exhaustively and the details are included in all the documents."
"I am therefore only going to concentrate on those points that the Committee on the Environment wishes to stress."
"We essentially want to focus on primary prevention when harmonising measures on women's health to be implemented in all the Member States. Some of these measures are already being implemented in certain countries and, in our view, we need to step up activities in specific areas."
"The first of these relates to smoking and alcohol consumption among women. It is particularly important to combat this among adolescents as more and more young women are beginning to smoke and consume alcohol at an earlier age, which is why preventive measures are important."
"It is also essential to highlight the importance of a balanced diet."
"Anorexia, bulimia and coronary diseases are becoming more prevalent and, in the case of anorexia and bulimia, increasingly common among young women."
"We must also work to prevent the spread of AIDS by providing young people with more information."
"Preventive measures like these should devote more attention to young people."
"We need to introduce and implement more programmes to detect both cervical and breast cancer in the EU and provide systematic screening for all women, particularly those in high-risk categories. Early detection of diabetes is becoming increasingly important as are the issues of hormone replacement therapy, osteoporosis and so on."
"In addition, we need to ensure that any health statistics published are broken down according to sex. There are substantial differences that must be taken into consideration when decisions are made if these statistics are not broken down, as is the case at the moment."
"Mr President, this is the second time in the past few months that we have held a debate on a report on women's health in the European Community and I do not want to repeat what we said earlier."
"Mrs Hautala has made enormous efforts to improve the report and, in particular, to reach an agreement within the Committee on Women's Rights that will allow us to finally approve it, and I congratulate her on this."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy also studied the report drawn up by the Commission, which shows statistically that there are clear differences between the disease processes in men and women and that particular solutions therefore need to be found to problems or diseases which are specific to women. It also highlights the fact that for women, universal public health cover is essential as they still have lower living standards and earn lower wages than men."
"In any event, the Committee on Research believes that we need better statistics on the public health situation which should be broken down according to gender, age group, income level and place of residence."
"We also believe that more scientific research is needed into the causes and appropriate treatment of diseases such as anorexia and bulimia which, unfortunately, are currently having devastating effects on the health of adolescents."
"It is also important to give greater consideration to occupational illnesses that are more common among working women, and this is particularly important today, 8 March."
"We must point out that since it is more difficult to organise women in society, we know less about the incidence of occupational illnesses among women."
"Mr President, people are still reluctant to recognise that there is anything specific about women's health, even though ample evidence exists."
"How could one fail to realise that women's health is quite different from men's in certain respects?"
"Men do not have problems linked to reproductive health, and have fewer ailments caused by nutrition and lifestyle."
"Men lead completely different lives from women and age less."
"If it is true - and it is - that ageing is currently one of the major problems confronting all our health systems, there are generally more elderly women among the population, and they are sometimes poorer than their male counterparts."
"Women's health is different, as was recognised in the Beijing platform: indeed, its key paragraph recognised the right of women to the safeguarding of their health, above all their reproductive health."
"It is a good thing that the Commission has presented a report specifically on women's health, but conclusions must be drawn from it, and I am grateful to our chairman, Mrs Hautala, for having rescued this report against all odds."
"She has made it down-to-earth, coherent and constructive, and is now rightly calling on the Commission to go one step further by presenting a specific programme."
"We wish women's health to be taken into account in the health programmes and mainstreaming to be built into these, guaranteeing the high level of protection which is recognised - first in the Maastricht Treaty and then in the Amsterdam Treaty - as an obligation of the Union."
"We wish for even more than that: a specific programme!"
"Surely the need for this is obvious, especially in respect of information?"
"Women do not take care of themselves; they are used to looking after the health of their families but neglect themselves and, often, neglect preventive care because they are too busy looking after their nearest and dearest."
"Once they realise they are ill, it is already too late."
"Campaigns must be mounted to educate and inform women, to convince them to look after themselves."
"Information campaigns must be directed at family doctors and general practitioners so that, when they enter a home to look after a sick child, they speak to the mother and ask her whether she is using contraceptives, whether she is looking after herself and whether contraception could help her avoid the need for an abortion."
"Family doctors and GPs should take every opportunity to make women think about themselves and answer questions on their health."
"Often they do not do so, which is why a specific programme is needed to provide information for women and for health personnel dealing with women."
"This topic must not be deferred any longer."
"Today is International Women's Day, and not the Festival of Women, as its detractors call it."
"It is the day that Clara Zetkin called for in 1912 to advance the condition of women."
"We want women to occupy positions of power, but above all else we want them to be healthy, so that they can do so as well as possible."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the past few years have seen enormous progress in our knowledge of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses that put women's health at risk, there is still a great deal to be done in this area."
"I thank Mrs Hautala very warmly for her report."
"I think we have managed this time broadly to reconcile our positions on the important aspects with those of the other groups."
"The report concentrates on the essential aspect, namely women's health, and also considers the distribution of powers in the European Union."
"The provisions on the controversial question of abortion and on toxic shock syndrome are worded in such a way that most Members can support them."
"Yet I still believe that it is difficult for the European Union to give an answer to the question of abortion."
"However, during the discussion on pregnancy, we gave priority to the possible health risk to the woman, including the psychological health risk, and even the risk to her life, in addition to the child's right to life and protection."
"I welcome the fact that the report also takes up issues such as society-related health issues, which also show that lifestyle, socio-economic circumstances and a healthy life are determining health factors."
"I think it is only right that the report calls on the Commission to take into account and refer specifically to the topic of women's health in its new action programme on health."
"If we want to improve the health of women, it is important to take targeted measures on information, prevention and health promotion."
"Women must become better informed and more involved in the planning and implementation of preventive programmes."
"Since women live longer than men and have a lower mortality rate at all ages and for all causes of death, there is a general impression that they are healthier than men."
"But the price of a higher life expectancy is the risk of becoming chronically ill and infirm."
"If we use indicators to assess the state of health that also look at illness and impairment, and not just mortality, we find that in all age groups the state of women's health is worse than that of men."
"This applies particularly to older women."
"So we must aim to give women a greater chance of living their later years in good health, with greater independence and less impairment."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the position of women in health care was one of the 12 strategic objectives at the conference in Beijing."
"The Amsterdam Treaty which will shortly be coming into force increases the Union's powers in the areas of both health and equal opportunities."
"There is no longer any excuse to do nothing about a policy for women's health."
"More to the point, we need a policy for women's health."
"Certain diseases are specific to women, are more frequent in women or affect women differently from men, and in defining this policy the following points are of prime concern."
"A gender-specific approach to health care can reduce its cost."
"Better prevention, for example through realistic health targets for conditions affecting women primarily in later life, such as osteoporosis, certain cancers and cardiovascular disease, can improve the quality of women's lives."
"Equal and adequate access to health care remains a problem for some women outside the Union, but in the Member States as well."
"In line with its traditions, my group is sceptical about Europe interfering too much in policy areas which ought really to be regulated at national level."
"In other words, we do not want to undermine the subsidiarity principle."
"We certainly recognise the importance of a specific policy on health at European level, but we think this is only feasible if its aims are to prevent, encourage and coordinate."
"So we shall vote against paragraphs 10, 11 and 16, and part of paragraph 24."
"We would also warn of the excessive cost to the budget of all the calls for studies and research contained in the resolution."
"Speaking personally, I should like to compliment the rapporteur on the way in which she revised the report after broad consultation with the groups."
"Mrs van Dijk's report was not acceptable to us and we could not approve it."
"This report is much better, and at least makes clear what Parliament's priorities are with regard to women's health."
"Madam President, today is known internationally as a day for taking action in support of women, and we need to reflect a little on the continuing, unimaginable struggles of the women's movement, which continue to bring about many changes not only for women but for society as a whole."
"Today we must honour the force of these struggles, and stress the need for them to continue, as crucial problems remain unsolved and other, new, problems appear which threaten their rights and achievements."
"Women continue to be one of the most vulnerable sections of the population, as their rights, including their right to health, are violated."
"These rights are often infringed by the current socio-economic system, and we must acknowledge this if we want 8 March to be more than just an opportunity for anniversary celebrations."
"Throughout the length and breadth of the planet cultural and political underdevelopment, hunger, wars and skirmishes, conservative and backward-looking societies, economic regulations, have all dealt a cruel blow to women, to their role in the economy, in society and in the family."
"The Hautala report puts forward interesting proposals regarding the serious health problems faced by women, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her work."
"However, I wonder whether promoting issues relating to women's health problems, and affording women protection under the law against discrimination of any kind, can be understood and strengthened within a socio-economic system which commercialises everything and subjects public health to the harsh financial policy of EMU."
"I wonder whether a policy which affords women substantial protection can be implemented, regardless of the reorientation and the grass-roots reorganisation of the development model of our society."
"In the face of exploitative and oppressive plans and practices, in the face of discrimination tactics, women are called upon to push forward and assert their claims together with men, in the context of a broad popular battle front ranged in each country."
"Today's date, 8 March, and the tradition of militancy which accompanies it will show the way."
"Let us follow it unflinchingly."
"Madam President, in view of the short time I have to speak, I will be concentrating on the paragraph in my colleague's report which is devoted to reproductive health."
"This term is a little complex, and I suppose we must take it to mean all health issues linked to a woman's ability to give birth."
"I fully agree with your demand in paragraph 8 that 'high quality reproductive health services' must be available to women, and with your demand in paragraph 12 that 'attention is drawn to the advantages and disadvantages of hormonal treatments for menstrual and menopausal problems, and that alternatives to these are researched'."
"Having said that, I should like you to go into more detail about the advantages and disadvantages of hormonal contraception."
"However, I will not be able to agree to your recommendation in paragraph 10 where you call for 'the promotion of unrestricted availability of contraceptives'."
"Should we take this to mean that contraceptives are to be made available without any medical follow-up, which is essential wherever hormonal contraceptives are being taken since they affect the endocrine system and natural hormonal regulation?"
"I am therefore unable to agree with you on this point."
"I think unrestricted availability of contraceptives without any medical follow-up does not show due respect for women's health."
"In anticipation of the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing, I have obtained within the framework of STOA a study on the impact on health of the different contraceptive practices in Europe and the reliability in scientific terms of what is called natural family planning."
"Unfortunately, the study was ended prematurely."
"It would be worth resuming the work carried out on it because in accordance with the resolutions voted by Parliament on 11 March 1994 and 28 October 1994, I think we need to respect a genuine freedom of choice for women."
"They need to be aware of the risks involved in the different methods of contraception so that they can choose alternative methods without risk to their health."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the committee for its constructive report on women's health."
"Mrs Hautala, the rapporteur, has produced an excellent piece of work."
"The Commission decided that its first specific report would be devoted to women's health and medical problems."
"The report deals with the major trends in women's health."
"It also includes an overview of women's illnesses and the factors that crucially affect women's health."
"Furthermore, the report discusses particular problems such as eating disorders, HIV/AIDS, family planning, abortion, the menopause and violence against women."
"As has been pointed out, to a certain extent women experience different health problems from men."
"We must therefore ensure that these differences are taken account of in health services and medical care."
"Adequate resources should also be made available."
"I also agree with Mrs Hautala that we need better data gathering on women's health."
"It is important that medical research takes into consideration the differences between women and men."
"We know, for example, that most experiments on animals are performed on males."
"As a result, women may experience undesirable and harmful effects when they use medicines that have only been tested on male animals."
"The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives with the aim of promoting women's health."
"A study has been carried out on osteoporosis in older women, and the report will be ready shortly."
"The EU is also giving its support to projects that include studies of life expectancy and general health development, as well as of statistics relating to morbidity and mortality."
"In these studies, we have stressed the importance of gender differences."
"Support will also be given to studies on cancer, age-related diseases and women's health problems."
"Since 1996, the Commission has been running a special programme aimed at preventing AIDS and other infectious diseases."
"The programme includes several projects relating exclusively to women."
"Last year, for example, we set up a network to combat the spread of AIDS among women in the Mediterranean countries."
"The Commission recently submitted a report on the implementation of the 1995 directive relating to health and safety measures at work for pregnant women and women with new-born infants or mothers who are breastfeeding, known as the pregnant workers directive."
"The conclusions of the Commission regarding implementation of the directive are generally satisfactory, although unfortunately some Member States have not yet implemented it in full."
"The Commission has therefore started proceedings against those countries for non-compliance."
"This concerns, amongst other things, sick leave, a statutory two-week paid holiday, maternity leave and a ban on allowing pregnant women to carry out work that is potentially harmful to health."
"Another important instrument is the 1996 directive on parental leave."
"As you know, it entitles all employees, regardless of sex, to at least three months' unpaid leave to look after their own children of eight years or less."
"As part of the programme on equality of opportunity for women and men, the Commission has compiled a report on the representation of women in health services and medical care."
"The report covers state and semi-private health care institutions in all the EU countries."
"A qualitative study of women in decision-making positions has been carried out in France, Italy and Sweden."
"The results showed that involving women in health care decision making has a positive effect."
"Women bring new needs, ideas and values to the work."
"Furthermore, they often represent a different style of leadership and an alternative approach to decision making."
"The aim of the Commission's 'mainstreaming' strategy is to incorporate equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities."
"The Union's health policy is no exception, although consideration should be given to the differences that exist between the sexes."
"Parliament and the Committee on Women's Rights have, through this report, made a valuable contribution to the work in hand."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Mainstreaming"
"The next item is the report (A4-0072/99) by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the follow-up to the communication on incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies (COM(98)0122 - C4-0234/98)."
"Madam President, what Commissioner Gradin has just said in her concluding remarks about incorporating equality of opportunity into all Community policies, and that health should be no exception, is indeed gratifying."
"However, after studying the Commission's progress report on the incorporation of equality of opportunity for women and men into Community policies, I should say with a touch of irony that I hope in fact it is an exception - a positive exception."
"Besides the Commission's report, I have also examined other documents from the Council of Ministers and the United Nations, amongst others."
"However, I decided to compare the report with the Beijing Declaration."
"It is true that we have not signed this declaration. Nevertheless, since 1995 we have been stressing the importance of 'gender mainstreaming' in policy making and other areas of work."
"I think that Chapter V, in particular, has most relevance for the European Union."
"In comparing the Commission's report with the Beijing Declaration, I see that there has been no fundamental change: there is still a lack of clearly defined objectives and accountability mechanisms, and changes in the internal dynamics - including the introduction of different values, behaviour, rules and procedures - have not been implemented."
"The European Union is not pursuing an active and visible policy on equality of opportunity accompanied by such things as follow-up and evaluation procedures to assess its performance and policies."
"The Commission rightly notes that there has been progress, but obstacles and shortcomings still exist."
"The measures taken up to now have not had an effect in all areas or on the direction in which Community policy is going."
"In the Commission's view, the most serious obstacles are a lack of awareness of gender equality issues at the decision-making level, a lack of human and budgetary resources, and a lack of gender experts."
"However, your rapporteur believes that the first of these is the key point, namely a lack of awareness of the need for gender equality at the decision-making level."
"Unfortunately, this lack of awareness does not only apply to the Commission, it also permeates large sections of society and, I would also contend, Parliament itself in large measure."
"We know that for only 28 % of the Members of Parliament to be women is hardly representative of the European population a whole, but that is how things stand in this particular decision-making body."
"Naturally, something has to be done."
"In our view, the committee, through my report, lays down some constructive proposals."
"In order to make everyone happy, let me assure you that these proposals do not increase costs by one single euro."
"The Commission can and should show the way by deciding on the objectives and accountability mechanisms, cooperating with new policy players, strengthening the methodological framework, overhauling its own structures and introducing gender equality at the decision-making level. Of course, the same also applies to Parliament."
"It is still the case that women in the workplace are held in lower esteem than men."
"This state of affairs has not changed in more than 100 years, but hopefully at some stage - and perhaps soon - change will come."
"Consequently, this is one of the issues on which the committee hopes to be able to cooperate with the Commission - as an ongoing and balanced committee."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as today is 8 March I too would like to say a few words. For me today is a day of remembrance, not a day of celebration."
"It is a day of remembrance for those women who led the struggle for equal rights and equal opportunities."
"8 March is a symbolic day for this unending struggle. It is a day on which to render an account of women's achievements, a day of raising awareness and debate."
"I should like to take this opportunity to stress once again that we are fully behind all those women who, at great danger to themselves, are fighting against totalitarianism and against any plan to create a society in which women are marginalised."
"They are fighting against violence and racism, they are fighting for democracy and human rights, they are fighting for their survival in many parts of the world where poverty is still rife or where wars are being waged."
"I should like to thank Mrs Eriksson for her excellent report and for what she has told us."
"It is significant that, in its progress report, the Commission resumes its stance and expresses its desire to promote a policy of equal rights in relation to other policies."
"This progress report makes it clear that incorporating an equal rights policy is a long-term measure."
"As the Commission correctly points out, there are obstacles to implementing this policy."
"Nevertheless, I fervently believe that the Commission must create or strengthen special mechanisms to incorporate equal opportunities, for example in the new technologies and information technology, and in research where access for women is especially limited."
"The gender issue must also be incorporated into all legislation and into all action programmes and action plans."
"The Commission must continue to urge Member States to take initiatives to promote and implement mainstreaming and we too must push our governments in this direction."
"We must stress once again the need for gender relevant statistical data for the purpose of assessment and programme planning, in relation to which the Commission's progress report exhibits certain weaknesses."
"The message of this progress report and also of this House must be twofold."
"Firstly, there must be systematic implementation of the analysis relating to the gender issue and its impact on all the policies and actions of the European Union. We must also press on with and strengthen the special positive action measures to promote equal opportunities."
"In closing, Madam President, I should like to say that, of course, for all this to happen, we need the necessary resources and the right people, as an analysis of the gender issue can only be undertaken by people with the appropriate training."
"It requires knowledge and information."
"I should also like to stress that a fifth action programme is necessary and I hope to hear the Commissioner announce one."
"Madam President, it most certainly augurs well for us that today, on the occasion of International Women's Day, we have the opportunity to review this much talked-about mainstreaming, this great concept which consists in incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities."
"Two years after the communication on mainstreaming was adopted by the Commission, it seems clear that progress has been rather modest, and that we still have a long way to go both internally and externally."
"In fact, in spite of the good intentions of which we are assured, the results seem to indicate some disparities, and numerous barriers and shortcomings still exist as regards the balanced participation of women and men in both the decision-making process and the implementation of Community policies."
"This is why I consider it necessary for the Commission to now reassert its firm commitment to the promotion of an active and visible policy on equal opportunities."
"The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and the stronger legal basis for equal opportunities for women and men must be turned to good account in order to envisage positive action and take 'all-out' measures, if I may use the military language used by General de Gaulle, in order to achieve equal treatment and equal opportunities for women and men, which we have still have not achieved in many areas."
"However, it is my duty to point out here that mainstreaming does not render unnecessary the specific equality policies that have so far been developed by means of directives and Community action programmes."
"May I also take this opportunity to remind you once again that we are hoping the Commission will finally propose an amendment to the watered-down 1986 directive on equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, including assisting spouses."
"Apart from two round-table discussions, no action has yet been taken in response to the report I produced in 1996, in which Parliament unanimously proposed a framework status for assisting spouses in Europe; there are millions of these invisible workers in our societies, and the overwhelming majority are women."
"This status - the framework of which needs to be outlined in the 1986 directive that is to be amended - will need to provide for compulsory registration of assisting spouses, independent social security entitlement and, in particular, compulsory pension insurance."
"It will need to put an end to all forms of discrimination which assisting spouses are subject to, for example in companies and professional organisations, especially in the event of divorce, and so on."
"Rest assured, Commissioner, that the Committee on Women's Rights will - within the scope of its political responsibilities, which will need to be redefined and strengthened following the elections on 13 June this year - keep an watchful eye over the action taken by the Commission in response to this debate and our report."
"Madam President, I also hope that Parliament itself and its political groups will not ignore the conclusions reached in paragraphs 19 to 22, particularly with regard to strengthening the political responsibilities of the Committee on Women's Rights, and not abolishing it, as advocated by some of our colleagues."
"Madam President, I made my maiden speech in 1984 on emancipation and here I am now giving my 'old maid's speech'."
"I have three points to make."
"Firstly, after seven directives on emancipation, I think the cornerstone of European legislation has to be the burden of proof directive."
"A fair distribution of the burden of proof between employer and employee makes it possible for women to enforce the rights which these seven emancipation directives give them."
"For the rest, I think we should hold back and leave any law making to the social partners."
"Secondly, we have to straighten out the things that are crooked."
"In other words, positive action is still needed until the barriers left over from the past have been removed - until the crooked is made straight."
"Thirdly, we must strive manfully - or perhaps womanfully - to see that new obstacles do not arise."
"The biggest challenge of the 21st century for emancipation is mainstreaming, the integration of equal opportunities into all areas of European policy."
"The Amsterdam Treaty provides a good legal basis for this."
"It is a splendid concept, but a dangerous one too: splendid because it is more effective, if properly applied, than constantly introducing new pieces of legislation; and dangerous because it can serve as a lightning conductor, a sop, a paper tiger."
"So extreme vigilance, healthy suspicion and the measures suggested in Mrs Eriksson's excellent report are called for."
"She rightly asks for a breakdown by gender and statistics, as Mrs Hautala does too, whose report is better than that by Mrs van Dijk, though that is not to say it is a good one."
"We want more women involved in decision making."
"Commissioner Flynn, incidentally, has no women at all in his private office."
"The Commission and Parliament have five women officials in lower-ranked policy-making positions."
"Mainstreaming means building without obstacles, not first erecting obstacles and then solemnly dismantling them."
"Mainstreaming also means emancipation impact assessment."
"As suggested in paragraph 21 by our Liberal colleague Mr Cars - a man at that - we need an interinstitutional working party for Parliament and the Commission and a monitoring board within the European Parliament."
"Can we wind up the Committee on Women's Rights?"
"No, we still need it as a watchdog, to see that mainstreaming actually happens."
"And I think it means one must be able to sit on the Committee on Women's Rights in addition to being a full member of another committee."
"We cannot have one cancelling out the other, or we shall have an underuse of resources, we shall have fanaticism operating in isolation."
"Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this report incorporating equal opportunities for women and men in all Community policies and activities."
"I want to refer specifically to the need for such integrated policy for women in rural society, for until now suitable employment opportunities have been limited, with women having to migrate to urban growth centres to find employment."
"This is an unsatisfactory situation and has contributed significantly to the depopulation of rural areas."
"It is a serious social and economic problem which everyone, including this Parliament and national governments, now recognises - late in the day, perhaps - and that we are now endeavouring to correct through rural development policy."
"Committed as I am to rural policies, I now believe they will not achieve their full potential in the absence of integrated national and regional policy."
"Unless we create sustainable employment at regional level and, in the context of this report, employment suitable for women, then the economic and social viability of rural communities will be put at further risk."
"If rural society is not economically and socially attractive to women it will be impossible to retain living and vibrant rural communities."
"While such policies are relevant to all rural women, I want to specifically refer to the often forgotten role of women in agriculture."
"I am sure Parliament will agree that in the context of the present discussions on Agenda 2000 the viability of many family farms will be put at risk."
"If we are serious about retaining the European farm model referred to in the Santer proposals then we must provide suitable off-farm employment for both women and men."
"I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the significant contribution of women to the work of voluntary community organisations."
"Their role, however, must not be confined to voluntary community work."
"They are entitled to participate, if they so desire, in the work of nation-building and to meaningful and rewarding employment opportunities."
"Madam President, as the coordinator for the Green Group on the Committee on Women's Rights, I should like to stress the importance of having men support women in achieving equality in the European Union."
"I, along with my colleague Mr Mann and one or two other men, are active on the Committee on Women's Rights in support of those objectives."
"I only wish we had the wholehearted support of many of the other men in this Parliament including those who tried to abolish the Committee on Women's Rights earlier in the year."
"I am glad we have resisted that so far and we must resist it in the future."
"I congratulate Mrs Eriksson on her report."
"It shows clearly that equal opportunities and mainstreaming are good objectives."
"However, we have moved very little towards them."
"Until the men in the European Union take them seriously we will not achieve them."
"And that begins at the very top, in the leadership of the Council of Ministers: all those male leaders who are not taking it seriously."
"I include my own government in this."
"Its record is rather poor."
"Tony Blair forgot to appoint a Minister for Women, then called Harriet Harman back in and gave her the job of Secretary of State for Social Security as well and finally sacked her because she had to carry out unpopular decisions."
"He has now given the job to the Leader of the House of Lords and women's issues have tended to sink without trace."
"By effectively deselecting three of our women colleagues - Sue Waddington, the Labour Spokesman on Women's Rights, Christine Oddy and Veronica Hardstaff - the Labour Party has made a poor contribution to getting women re-elected to the European Parliament."
"We should look at the record in the Member States if we want to achieve our equality objectives."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am happy to add my own thanks to the Commission."
"Seven directives, that is no mean achievement."
"Women in Europe can see that the Commission is sympathetic to women's concerns."
"But much still needs to be done on jobs and equal pay, for example."
"I would say that men are still lagging behind when it comes to care, both in and outside the family."
"What worries us most at the moment is the continuing inequality of power."
"This is an injustice which we must battle against."
"The Nordic countries have quite a good record, with 37.6 %, and the European Parliament too, with 28 %, compared with the 13.1 % of women involved in the highest levels of decision making worldwide."
"But it is a long way from the democratic parity we dream about."
"It is after all a democratic right that the bodies taking decisions which affect society should reflect the make-up of that society."
"In any event, the Commission should continue to press the Member States to take steps to ensure that this is indeed the case."
"Women will then recognise their role, will feel more involved, will see their problems acknowledged as political problems and will also feel more attracted to the political arena."
"That reciprocal effect is by no means commonplace at present."
"Many good things have of course already been said about mainstreaming."
"I echo them."
"We need equal opportunities at all levels, in all undertakings, and we need to study gender effects in all areas, devising instruments to monitor whether or not progress is in fact being made."
"But this must not form an excuse for abruptly halting a number of positive actions in favour of women which are still desperately needed."
"That is not only the case in Europe;"
"I can think of certain cases in the developing world where actions in favour of women are simply being stopped because all attention has now switched to mainstreaming."
"Slogans are no use to us."
"We want women to be given the real leg-up they sometimes need in order to make full use of this splendid mainstreaming."
"I hope the Committee on Women's Rights will remain vigilant, because we need that committee."
"And that is one of these positive actions."
"Madam President, I support everything that Mrs Lulling has said on the need to provide a status for assisting spouses, a position held by so many women in the various countries of the European Union."
"I hope that the term 'non-working female population', which I find shocking in connection with the subject of equality between men and women, will be eliminated both from Commission texts and various other European documents."
"There are probably tens of millions of these women in Europe and they should not be described in this way simply because they are engaged in unwaged work."
"I would like Mrs Keppelhoff's report - an assessment of the economic value of women's unwaged work which dates back ten years or so - to be taken up again."
"We should broaden our economic concepts so that the contribution made by this unwaged work to a nation's wealth is taken into account in the GDP."
"This would seem important with regard to the subject which we are dealing with here."
"Moreover, the complete marginalisation of the various aspects of pregnancy and motherhood also seems a great injustice with regard to the matter we are dealing with at present."
"I think there are some avenues here which we need to explore at all costs, in order to achieve greater justice between men and women in the different countries of the European Union."
"Madam President, equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women are recognised as an indisputable basic principle of democracy and human rights."
"This recognition is reflected in the Amsterdam Treaty, in which equality between men and women is set out as a goal of the Union, and in the fact that the principle of equal opportunities is enshrined as the fourth pillar of EU employment policy."
"But the Commission's first progress report shows up the very wide gulf between demands and reality."
"For instance it states that the measures taken to date have had no tangible influence on the various policies. That should give us food for thought."
"Of particular importance is the awareness raising, awareness changing and sensitisation of all the various decision-makers in all the various areas of society."
"But specifically as a woman I would not want to see the baby thrown out with the bathwater."
"Will a call such as that for a balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process really achieve any added value for women?"
"Are we talking about quantitative or qualitative equal treatment?"
"If I manage to succeed in my job, it is not because I am a woman but because of the good work I have done."
"I know that many women agree with the view I take of the policy of positive discrimination."
"Madam President, several colleagues as well as the rapporteur, Mrs Eriksson - whom I wish to compliment - have said how much has already been done in Europe to implement an equal opportunities policy."
"I would point out that the European Union actually introduced the principle of mainstreaming into its actions and documents prior to the Beijing Conference."
"As we all remember, this was first done in the regulation on the Structural Funds in 1993."
"Therefore, from the point of view of intentions, but also of directives implemented, we can say that much has been done, helping to change our conduct, actions and culture."
"It does not, however, mean that no problems exist."
"The first evaluation report, which was the subject of Mrs Kokkola's report, made it very clear that the statements and documents were by no means being implemented in practice by the Commission and the Member States."
"As regards the Structural Funds, for example, even though the policy of mainstreaming was introduced as long ago as 1993, the latest progress report reveals that only 1.6 % of their resources have been used for this policy."
"We are a long way from the practical implementation of equal opportunities in all policy fields!"
"That is why we, as a Parliament, urge that mainstreaming should not merely be reasserted as a principle in the renewed Structural Funds, but that the Member States and the Commission itself should be subject to some form of sanctions if this principle is not translated into tangible measures."
"With regard to the European Social Fund, we call for 15 % of project funding to be targeted at women, since much still remains to be done in terms of their employment and pay."
"In our view, the action plans submitted by the governments following the Luxembourg summit are very disappointing."
"There are still too few countries where equal opportunities are deemed to be an across-the-board principle to be applied in all policy areas."
"The real problem, however - and I can say this because I come from a southern country, Italy - concerns the presence of women in decision-making positions."
"In Italy few women are to be found, whereas in northern European countries there are more."
"Where women are present, the political agenda of governments and institutions really does change, and the policies introduced really do change as well."
"Madam President, as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified in all Member States, it will produce new benchmarks."
"But we will have to wait a few more months before the principle of equal opportunities for women and men is also strengthened."
"It is stipulated as a principle and a goal of the Community in Articles 2 and 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Today, on International Women's Day, I recall other articles, such as those on equal treatment in the workplace and on the labour market, on equal pay for equal work and on combating discrimination on the basis of sex."
"The European Commission has established that there are considerable shortcomings as regards incorporating equal opportunities into the Community programmes."
"The main reason, according to Mrs Eriksson, the rapporteur, is the lack of awareness of the decision-makers, and this is a view that the Group of the European People's Party naturally shares."
"Effective individual measures cannot replace an integrated general concept."
"However much cooperation there is with the NGOs, with the committees of other bodies, there are no adequate organisations to promote awareness-raising among the political players."
"When they do exist, it will become possible to check the incorporation of equal opportunities in draft legislation, ensure a balanced gender participation in decision-making jobs and finally prepare statistical material that can be broken down into gender-relevant data."
"We need a benchmarking procedure to make it easier to evaluate programmes and projects and we must continue vigorously taking positive measures in favour of women."
"However, the working party between Parliament and the Commission that is called for in paragraph 21 already exists!"
"Its members include two representatives of the Committee on Women's Rights and two representatives of the Committee on Employment; I am one of them and we hold regular meetings with the representatives of the European women's lobby on the one hand and the responsible Commissioners and heads of cabinet led by Jacques Santer on the other."
"We have always reported on their outcome in the committees."
"We will have to do so in more detail and certainly also in writing."
"I believe that is one message that comes across from today's International Women's Day."
"Madam President, I think that, as has already been mentioned here tonight, the key is to have women in decision-making roles and in positions of power."
"That is the only way we are going to get any change."
"You only have to look at the European institutions themselves."
"Look at the number of women Commissioners."
"I know that my own country has yet to appoint a woman Commissioner, and I hope that when it appoints a new Commissioner, the government will take this into account and appoint a woman Commissioner."
"The Irish Government has never yet appointed a woman to the Court of Auditors."
"In most of the key areas and senior positions of power, women are not visible."
"That is the reality."
"You only have to look at a photograph of the Heads of States of the European Union and compare the number of men and of women - it is just not acceptable."
"The only way we are going to get some sort of equality for women is when women actually occupy the key decision-making roles."
"As someone said a few years ago in my own country: when there are as many incompetent women in roles of power as there are men, then we will have true equality."
"Women have to be two or three times better than men if they are to get anywhere, to actually achieve anything."
"This is the problem - the women who are here at the moment in this Parliament - the women who have actually achieved - who have got somewhere - are much better than the vast majority of men."
"That is because they have to be so much better to actually get there, and we really have to address this point."
"What we also have to do is make it possible for them to get to that position."
"You cannot compare the position of men and women in society because first of all women have families, they have commitments; and it is only in countries where proper structures have been put in place that women can participate on an almost equal footing."
"That has not happened throughout the European Union, and we have to do something about it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, once again we are nearly only women debating this report."
"But I must inject a strong note of protest into our joy at discussing many aspects of equality between men and women. If we look at the draft agenda for this part-session, we find no mention of the existence of our debate about women."
"The three reports on women are mentioned once right at the end."
"If that is what the press and audiovisual services understand by mainstreaming then I must say I have good reason to fear that in the end all that will be left is the mainstream."
"The credibility of our Parliament depends on it."
"Last Friday I held talks with colleagues from this House."
"Women represent 54 % of the staff working in this House."
"At first glance this figure seems fine, but if we take a closer look we see that women account for 80 % of category C staff employed in the lower echelons, 40 % of category B staff but only 20 % of category A, where staff hold senior positions, and 0 % of directors-general!"
"Women MEPs are fairly well represented in Parliament, making up 28 % - I thank Mrs Eriksson, who established this - but it is not enough."
"On 13 June Parliament will be re-elected and then we women must be more strongly represented."
"We must move closer towards parity."
"I am pleased that in my party in Germany, the Social Democratic Party, 44 % of nominations have been for women."
"So we are approaching parity here too."
"But we simply must ensure that equal opportunities are enshrined in all policy areas, which means that we cannot just look at the gender mainstreaming aspect but need to accompany it with the dual approach, with special measures for women."
"We need the fifth action programme and regular checks of the results, especially by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, otherwise the whole issue will disappear from the agenda and women will no longer play any part in European politics."
"Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, Commissioner."
"I am very proud to be able to add in a small way today to what our colleagues have said, particularly in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"We may be surprised that in our society which is based on human rights, we still need to emphasise the need to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women into all Community policies and activities."
"I think Mrs Eriksson's report is excellent, but she raises a number of points on several issues. I hope her questions will be answered."
"I should like to mention a further point which I am concerned about."
"You will no doubt remember that of the priorities singled out by the hearing in Luxembourg on employment, the fourth and final priority concerned the problem of equality between men and women."
"It is not a coincidence that this priority has indeed been put in fourth place in the subsequent National Action Plans, whereas if it had been incorporated into all the other policies, it would have had to be in first place."
"Madam President, the EU's policy on equality has been very progressive, but equality has yet to penetrate the thick walls of the European Commission."
"You would have to look a long way to find more traditional gender role patterns than those found in the Commission."
"The higher you go in the hierarchy, the greater is the male dominance."
"Women make up 80 % of the people who carry out secretarial and office work, while men occupy 87 % of the managerial positions."
"The Commission maintains that it sets targets and draws up action plans to bring more women into managerial posts."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission, and especially Mrs Gradin, whether it would not be a good idea to introduce positive discrimination for women in managerial posts within the Commission?"
"Positive discrimination should not be used aimlessly and without thinking."
"There should always be individual assessment of individual candidates."
"But if a man and a woman are equally qualified, the woman could be chosen."
"Positive discrimination should not be a permanent solution, but as the situation stands in the Commission at the moment, it is necessary to resort to drastic measures."
"Madam President, I welcome Mrs Eriksson's report on mainstreaming."
"It sets out some valuable points of view on the Commission's progress report on the incorporation of equality of opportunity between women and men into all EU policies."
"We hope that in a few months' time the Amsterdam Treaty will be ratified by all 15 Member States, thereby making equality of opportunity between women and men an overarching goal in our Treaty."
"Mainstreaming is an important policy instrument."
"The point was made most emphatically by the United Nations at the Fourth Women's Conference, where the EU was one of the driving forces behind the principle."
"Even more importantly, some progress has been made."
"In my view, one of the most significant achievements is that gender equality has been written into some of the common strategies for employment."
"It has also been mentioned during our discussion that gender equality should be taken into account in the allocation of Structural Fund resources."
"The Commission has now appointed officials within its directorates-general whose remit is to ensure that equality of opportunity is respected in their day-to-day operations."
"I can assure Mr Blak that the Commission practises positive action."
"When two people with the same qualifications apply for a job, it is given to the member of the under-represented sex."
"In my view, it is not just in terms of employment and structural policies that gender equality is an important factor; it must also be incorporated into all the policies that affect the daily lives of women and men."
"At the moment we are trying to pursue major initiatives in the health sector, but the same principle also applies in education, science and technology."
"A notable example in this respect is of course the communication recently forwarded to Parliament on women in research."
"We have already discussed my own particular areas of responsibility, namely the STOP and Daphne programmes, as well as violence against women and children."
"Mrs Eriksson, the rapporteur, also raises the issue of gender equality at the decision-making level."
"We know from our research that only when one third of decision-makers are women will they have any real influence on decisions."
"In its communication on women in science and technology, the Commission has established that the under-represented sex should account for at least 40 % of those working in these fields. The same figure also applies to the proposals concerning advisory committees, evaluation groups and, more importantly, decision-making bodies in the fields of research and technology."
"Finally, like the committee, I too am keen to see separate sets of statistics for women and men."
"It is particularly important for us to have clear data, so that we can formulate policies that take account of the needs of both women and men."
"We are also working on establishing criteria for measuring gender equality and its practical effects."
"At the same time I agree with all of you, and Mrs Eriksson too, that a great deal remains to be done in order to ensure that there really is gender equality."
"There is no shortage of work in this area for this House, the Commission or the Council of Ministers."
"Earlier, someone alleged that my colleague Mr Flynn did not have any women in his office - he has one."
"And I can assure you that in my office I have four women and three men."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin - and for setting such a good example."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Equal treatment for men and women"
"Mr President, Commissioner, following the Kalanke ruling - concerning the gentleman from Bremen whom the European Court of Justice ruled on 17 October 1995 to have fallen victim to discrimination because his female colleague had been promoted rather than himself, based on the state law on equality in the Land Bremen - the Commission submitted on 17 March 1996 a proposal to amend the 1976 directive."
"In so doing, it most certainly believed it had done the right thing."
"I was then appointed rapporteur on 2 July 1996. I considered that this proposal - which was admittedly well-intentioned - still jeopardised the positive action which we, at least in the Committee on Women's Rights, still consider to be necessary in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for women and men, should we want to see this equality before the year 3000."
"In agreement with Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, I decided to await the Court's ruling on another case, that of the Marschall case: again a man, this time from North Rhine-Westphalia, who claimed to have fallen victim to discrimination because his female colleague had been chosen for promotion over him."
"In this case, the Court of Justice did not find in favour of Mr Marschall in its ruling of 11 November 1997."
"Why not?"
"Did it want to correct what many experts we consulted had referred to as the serious mistake committed in the Kalanke case?"
"Does the Amsterdam Treaty, which will soon be ratified, have anything to do with it?"
"In fact, the Treaty makes equal opportunity policies a Community task, and expressly stipulates in Article 119 that measures providing for specific advantages with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women are compatible with the principle of equality, and do not therefore constitute discrimination."
"In other words, positive discrimination does not discriminate."
"Following the Marschall ruling, we considered in consultation with another expert hearing whether the positive action can be preserved without amending the 1976 directive."
"Since we know that on the open sea and before judges we are all in God's hands, we took the view on the one hand that in a future case we would not be able to trust the Court because it might completely change direction on this."
"On the other hand, we considered that the proposed amendment still jeopardises positive action."
"Why?"
"Certainly, both judgments can be interpreted as meaning that only rigid, inflexible and automatic positive discrimination granting the absolute and unconditional right to appoint or promote women - or men - where they are under-represented would be incompatible with Community law, but even a quota system which does not preclude the assessment of the particular circumstances of an individual case would be compatible with the directive."
"This means that, in practice, a woman can be given priority for promotion in the event of equal suitability, competence and professional performance, unless reasons specific to an individual candidate tilt the balance in his favour."
"Precisely because the Commission proposed a text to us which stipulates that measures giving preference to a member of the under-represented sex are possible, 'provided that such measures do not preclude the assessment of the particular circumstances of an individual case', we consider that with such a formulation comes the danger that the aim of positive action will be circumvented where reasons specific to an individual candidate are put forward which risk not being interpreted objectively, thus watering down the positive action which, for that matter, increasingly concerns under-represented men."
"In my country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the number of women primary school teachers and magistrates has already been increased too much, in my humble opinion."
"Giving the current situation regarding the Amsterdam Treaty, we take the view that the amendment of the directive proposed in 1996 is inappropriate."
"We call on the Commission to withdraw it, but we also urge it to submit a new proposal based on the Amsterdam Treaty."
"At the same time, we stress the fact that it is no longer necessary to regard positive action as a derogation - which is permitted and can therefore be revoked at any time - from the principle of equal treatment, in order to recognise an individual right only and not a right which has a place in a society seeking to achieve such equality through democratic means."
"We no longer dare to question the right to equal treatment and opportunities between men and women as a fundamental right of a democratic society, which demands equal treatment and opportunities that are achieved through a series of active measures, including positive action."
"The proposal for a directive which we are hoping for should contain mandatory legal instructions with a view to taking positive action wherever necessary in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for men and women and to remedy the under-representation of women in decision making."
"Our message is clear, Commissioner: withdraw the proposal to amend the existing directive and draft a new one, taking account of the conclusions of my report which we will be voting on before the draft legislative resolution."
"Moreover, before voting on this legislative resolution, we want to see here and now, hic et nunc , the Commission's clear and firm commitment to agree to both these paragraphs in the draft legislative resolution."
"Mr President, I welcome this general debate on equal opportunities on International Women's Day."
"Women have come a long way this century."
"In the 19th century in English law women had no capacity to enter into contracts and were classified along with minors and lunatics."
"It was only this century that they were granted equality in divorce law."
"In my profession women were forbidden to become solicitors until 1919, and I recently celebrated 75 years of the first woman solicitor in England."
"But there is no room for complacency: women still have not achieved equal pay in reality or equal status in very hierarchical job structures."
"Mrs Lulling's report looks at the Commission's proposal on positive discrimination following the decision in the European Court of Justice, namely the Kalanke decision, which decreed that positive discrimination was not normally lawful."
"Subsequent to the Commission proposal, the Marschall decision was given by the European Court of Justice which qualified the Kalanke decision and said that in certain circumstances positive discrimination could be lawful."
"In addition, we need to note the Amsterdam Treaty, which will strengthen equal opportunity rights for women when it has completed its ratification process and comes into effect."
"Consequently, I agree with Mrs Lulling's conclusion that the Commission's proposal is not timely and needs to be withdrawn and a new, better proposal needs to be reintroduced when the Amsterdam Treaty comes into effect."
"Mr President, let me once again ask you too to persuade the audiovisual services to ensure that the debate on International Women's Day is at least put on record here tomorrow, even if it is not published in advance."
"I would say to the Commission: you really will be offering flowers to the women workers of the European Union if you withdraw the proposed amendment to the equal treatment directive."
"Women have waged a hard struggle here in the European Parliament, but also in my country, Germany, especially the Social Democrats, to achieve progress in equal treatment legislation."
"In Bremen and in North Rhine-Westphalia we had a very progressive ruling, which then suffered a bitter defeat with the European Court of Justice ruling in the Kalanke case."
"We had an equal treatment law that emphasised that given applicants with the same qualifications, preference should be given to the under-represented sex, something we have finally also achieved in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"A man felt this law discriminated against him."
"So he took legal action and won his case at the European Court of Justice."
"Fortunately the Marschall ruling mitigated this a little, by specifically stressing the hardship clause in North Rhine-Westphalian law, which allows positive measures to be taken."
"The Kalanke ruling had disastrous outside effects."
"The fact that the Commission proposed an amended directive following that ruling reflects the same trend."
"I was approached by the Korean president of a women's organisation who had examined the effects of the proposed directive in Korea."
"The Kalanke ruling was also discussed at many international meetings."
"But worst and most frightful of all was the discussion in our Member States, among the regulars in the pubs and bars, where the men all started to feel discriminated against and thought they could invoke the law."
"We must ensure that this proposal for an amended directive is withdrawn."
"I cordially request you to announce this today."
"Mr President, the struggle for equality between men and women has seen some significant successes but has also suffered some bitter setbacks."
"The 1995 Kalanke ruling, which found in favour of a man who believed he had been discriminated against because an equally qualified female colleague was given preference over him, belongs in the second category."
"The ruling stated that, given identical qualifications, it was an infringement of Community law for female candidates automatically to be given preference."
"The Commission amended its directive and argued that a rigid quota system that did not take account of individual circumstances was unlawful, while positive action - for instance flexible quotas - was lawful."
"Our Committee on Women's Rights regarded the proposal as a whole as not very useful and warned against any watering down of the directive."
"While the Kalanke ruling was a setback, the European Court of Justice's decision in the 1997 Marschall judgment was encouraging."
"Laws that give priority to women but also allow individual cases to be assessed and do not exclude men from the outset are absolutely consistent with Community law."
"Accordingly, positive action measures must be taken to remove the still considerable inequalities on the labour market and in regard to promotion."
"At the time the Commission was waiting for the Court of Justice's judgment and for the negotiations in the run-up to the Amsterdam Treaty."
"So it would be consistent for you, Commissioner, to take a similar approach today."
"Articles 2 and 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty stipulate that equality between men and women is a task and an aim."
"All active policies will pursue that aim in future."
"So I would ask you to accept the plea by Astrid Lulling, our as ever pugnacious rapporteur, which the European People's Party will of course approve again."
"Withdraw your proposal to amend the directive; it dates from the time after the Kalanke and before the Marschall ruling, so it is certainly old enough!."
"A new proposal must respect the evaluation of equal opportunities as a Community task, as it must the specific advantages allowed in Article 119 for the under-represented sex in the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mrs Lulling's report recommends that Parliament should reject the Commission's proposed amendment to the directive implementing the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the field of access to jobs, vocational training and promotion and working conditions."
"It argues for it to be rejected since both the hearing which took place and the text of the Treaty on European Union show that the Commission proposal is already outdated. This further drives home the fact that if this directive, which is getting on for a quarter of a century old, is to continue to be justified it will have to be updated so that it can make an effective contribution towards positive measures to combat social discrimination on the grounds of sex."
"The rapporteur believes that it is not enough to combat discrimination by means of civil law and insists that the right to equal opportunities must be guaranteed by having social structures designed to achieve that equality in society. We cannot make do with formal and, to some extent, inconsequential statements."
"Equal opportunities have, after all, a lot to do with access to the labour market and, regardless of whether or not we agree with the position taken by the rapporteur and the Committee on Women's Rights which has been put before Parliament, it seems highly appropriate to recall - yet again and at the risk of repeating what has already been said about the subject - what day it is today."
"For our part, 8 March is extremely significant and this report makes it all the more appropriate to mention it."
"8 March was not plucked out of the air but was selected as Women's Day because, in 1857, the seamstresses of New York held a major demonstration to protest against the exaggerated excess (pardon the tautology) of their working hours."
"Nearly half a century later it should be pointed out that one of the main demands is a reduction in working hours in keeping with modern living and working conditions while, on the other hand, employment is becoming more precarious. As a result of what is known as atypical work, the working day has virtually become limitless especially for women, who are taking on all kinds of tasks."
"Home-working, piecework and contracting out are all, in some way, turning today's textile workers into latter day New York seamstresses. They are now experiencing at very close hand the worsening discrimination in the labour market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present report on implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women provides a good opportunity for asking some crucial questions about women's policy."
"We have two rulings by the European Court of Justice before us, in addition to the proposal to amend the Council's directive."
"The Committee on Women's Rights finds that the proposed amendment would water down the directive."
"Just as it cannot be right to rectify one injustice by committing another, so it cannot be right to rectify the discrimination against women by discriminating against men."
"The very concept of positive discrimination should make us think again."
"Positive and discrimination: how can you combine the two?"
"For the word positive must mean removing practical occupational hindrances, obstacles or disadvantages affecting women, such as the shortage of child care facilities or the non-payment of pensions for the years spent in child care."
"The strategy of women's policy should not simply be to achieve a numerically fair distribution."
"Reverse discrimination in the form of a mechanical preference in fact conflicts with another basic value, namely the equal treatment of every individual."
"Mr President, on this International Women's Day, I would ask Mrs Gradin, who has already been so helpful on women's issues, to give Europe's women a special little present by withdrawing this proposal for a Commission directive, as other Members too have urged her to do."
"I fully appreciate that the Commission was trying with this proposal to resolve the uncertainty which has existed since the Kalanke judgment and which in my view the Marschall judgment did nothing to dispel."
"We are quite convinced that the proposal now before us will just make things more chaotic still."
"The fact is that the individual power of assessment in recruitment and promotion envisaged in the text will in our view trigger huge numbers of lawsuits in which men invoke individual exemptions to the positive actions rule."
"We are convinced that escalating numbers of lawsuits like this will weaken the action taken by Member States which have strong legislation on positive action and which apply quotas - not positive discrimination but positive action - in favour of equally well qualified women. This legislation may be undermined."
"We have a basic problem in Europe, namely that European law has always regarded positive action as the absolute exception to the individual's right to equal treatment."
"All of us in this Chamber know that the position of men and women is very different in employment, in education, in the family, in society, not because one sex is worth less than the other, but because society remains fundamentally male-oriented and thus inherently discriminates against women."
"My conclusion from that is that equal treatment alone cannot get rid of inequality."
"On the contrary, equal treatment reinforces inequality."
"So our view is that this Commission proposal does not provide the answer."
"As other speakers have already said, the Amsterdam Treaty will help the Union a great deal, because it commits the Union to taking active measures against discrimination and at the same time to taking active measures to promote equality."
"So that means not just the mainstreaming we were looking at just now in Marianne Eriksson's report, but positive action too."
"So once again I join other Members in asking the Commission to withdraw this proposal and come up with a new and stronger one."
"This really would be the best present the Commissioner could give Europe's women on this International Women's Day, but you could do something else as well."
"I had a phone call from Bosnia-Herzegovina recently."
"Elections are due there very soon."
"There used to be quotas for women on the list in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although it was not a statutory requirement."
"It now looks as if these quotas may be scrapped, and Bosnia's women are looking expectantly to Europe for help."
"It really would be terrible to see a retrograde step being taken here."
"Mr President, as far as women's rights are concerned, we obviously keep taking one step forward and two steps back."
"In regard to equal opportunities for women the Amsterdam Treaty may be one step forward, but the European Court of Justice ruling in the Kalanke case and the Commission proposal to amend Directive 76/207/EEC represent two steps back."
"Women today are better educated and more mobile than ever and the number of women in employment is rising."
"But there is a definite shortage of women in the higher echelons of politics, industry and science."
"That is not because women are less qualified or less intelligent but because of the glass ceiling, an unseen barrier set up consciously or unconsciously by a traditionally male-dominated ruling class."
"So why the Commission has replaced the term 'women's opportunities' with the term 'under-represented sex' is beyond me."
"We should not adopt a directive that falls short of the Amsterdam Treaty and thereby undermines women's opportunities to occupy a position in society consistent with their qualifications, especially now that the European Parliament and the Vienna Council have taken up the equal opportunities cause."
"The Amsterdam Treaty represents progress along the road to equal opportunities."
"It must be implemented and not watered down."
"So the Lulling report and the request to the Commission to withdraw its amended proposal for a directive make sense."
"Mr President, in an ideal world positive discrimination should not be necessary but, unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world."
"While some people may say that it is not the right approach, it is the only way we are going to get any sort of progress for women."
"As you can see, even in the electoral process in Member States positive discrimination is the only way to get women elected to national parliaments and to the European Parliament."
"It means that men and the policy-makers are going to have to look at the way society is structured."
"As society stands in the vast majority of Member States, it does not favour the participation of women in the workforce."
"It is important for women who have not been in the workforce before to get access to it."
"Even the way the programmes have been set up in Member States does not take account of the fact that these women were in the unofficial workforce and were contributing to society in their role as carers etc. They are now being prevented from joining the workforce because they do not have a track record."
"Even in training programmes this is not taken into account."
"The only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place measures which some people may feel discriminate against men."
"Unfortunately, society has discriminated against women for centuries and the only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place some sort of structure that ensures that women actually get into decision-making and into the workforce."
"When we eventually have true equality there will be no need for positive discrimination."
"The report by Mrs Lulling already has a long history."
"After the Kalenke judgment in 1995, the Commission proposed to amend Directive 207/EEC of 1976."
"This proposal was submitted to the Council at the end of March 1996."
"Since then the Committee on Women's Rights has worked long and hard on that proposal."
"In Mrs Lulling's report the Commission is now asked to withdraw its proposal."
"That is also what all of you have been talking about."
"As you know, my colleague Commissioner Flynn appeared before the Women's Rights Committee on 16 February and clearly stated his position."
"His intention is to propose to withdraw the proposal as requested by Parliament."
"On the same occasion Commissioner Flynn announced his intention concerning use of the new legislative powers given to the Community."
"The aim is to adopt measures in order to ensure full equality or treatment between women and men in the field of employment, and these two issues are linked."
"The ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will hopefully be complete within a few months."
"We will then have a Treaty which confers a new legal base, Article 141(3), for legislating equal treatment between women and men in the field of employment."
"I can confirm to you that we are looking very actively and positively at the question of legislating under Article 141."
"We are doing so with a very open mind."
"There are legal questions on several aspects of the Article, particularly as regards its scope."
"The Commission is therefore taking legal advice."
"In the light of this advice we will then decide the content of a proposal for a directive based on Article 141."
"I believe this statement should answer Parliament's question and indicate the Commission's willingness to make use of Article 141 in a general positive action."
"Finally, let me once again thank the Women's Rights Committee and Mrs Lulling for their work on this important issue."
"Closing of the session"
"I declare the 1998-1999 session of the European Parliament closed."
"The sitting was closed at 8.35 p.m."
"Opening of the session"
"I declare opened the 1999-2000 session of the European Parliament."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Madam President, let me say in regard to this item that we have not yet concluded our discussions in committee, and therefore cannot agree to the request for urgent procedure at this part-session."
"But I would suggest we deal with it at the second March part-session, by which time we will have concluded our discussions."
"Mr von Wogau, another solution would be - if you and the House were to agree to it - for us to vote in favour of urgency now, but to include this on the agenda for the sitting on 22 March."
"Would you be in agreement with that proposal?"
"Parliament agreed to urgent procedure for 22 March"
"Amendment of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0070/99) by Mr Corbett, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure."
"I would inform the House that Mr Crowley has endorsed the minority opinion which is set out in the explanatory statement."
"I give the floor to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy for a procedural motion."
"Madam President, under Rule 128 I must move the admissibility of the document to be debated."
"Either I can table it now or I can wait until you have formally opened the debate on this document, as you wish."
"We are at the beginning of the debate, so you have the floor, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"Madam President, the purpose of this inadmissibility motion is to raise procedural issues which emerged during the drafting of this text."
"I am disputing the debate on this text on two essential grounds."
"The first is that it is intended to make some of the proposed changes to the Rules of Procedure in implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"People may say that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been ratified, or just about."
"But one country, France, has not yet ratified it, and it would be discourteous to my country's parliament to make changes to our Rules of Procedure before the Treaty has been formally adopted."
"But above all, and this concerns all the Member States of the European Community, a treaty which is an essential instrument of Community law cannot enter into force until it has been formally ratified by agreement of the Heads of State and Government of all the Member States."
"However, clearly none of the Member States has yet exchanged instruments of ratification, to put it in diplomatic terms."
"The second reason is that while it is the responsibility of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to apply the Treaty of Amsterdam, or rather the draft Treaty, which should soon be ratified, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has gone way beyond that."
"The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, which is our fundamental document, must be subject to basic laws, in particular the Treaty."
"In my minority opinion which I submitted on this text I list the points where I think the report goes too far."
"I shall not go into them now, but those are my reasons for asking Parliament to make a decision on my motion of admissibility."
"Madam President, I would like to reply briefly to the two points raised by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"The first was on the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Changes to the Rules of Procedure obviously cannot enter into force until the Treaty has itself come into force."
"What we are doing here is preparing Parliament for that time."
"Clearly the provisions of the Rules of Procedure that are linked to the Treaty will not apply until the Treaty of Amsterdam is itself in force."
"It is also clear that Parliament needs to prepare for this as it is a complex matter."
"We cannot wait until the Treaty of Amsterdam is in force to work on the implementation of the Rules of Procedure, and that is why I think Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's objection is unacceptable."
"The second point was whether we have gone too far with these changes to the Rules."
"We have actually taken advantage of the work relating to the Treaty to adapt a number of our Rules to new circumstances."
"I believe a parliament's most fundamental right is to adapt its rules to the constant changes in parliamentary life."
"For this reason I cannot accept Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's second point either. In my capacity as chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure I therefore urge Parliament to reject Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's objections."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard Mr Fabre-Aubrespy present his motion, and Mr Fayot in his capacity as chairman of the committee."
"Does anyone wish to speak against?"
"Madam President, I am opposed to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's position for the following reason: although strictly speaking - as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is well aware - his first objection, which relates to the Treaty might perhaps appear acceptable in the context of this parliamentary procedure, his second objection concerns the essence of the matter."
"In such circumstances, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy should restrict himself to voting against certain amendments if he feels they should not be adopted in the context of this revision of the Rules of Procedure."
"To return to the first question, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is well acquainted with the nature of statutory law."
"It has the privilege and also the duty of regulating the internal running of an institution."
"The institution in question is therefore not merely advised but required to take appropriate measures in anticipation of the entry into force of the Treaty. It needs to draw up internal rules that will be compatible and consistent with the Treaty when it enters into force."
"It is this Treaty of course which establishes the guidelines for the development of these internal statutes. I therefore believe that his first objection is not acceptable either, Madam President."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of the motion by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy?"
"That is not the case."
"Parliament rejected the motion"
"Madam President, this report constitutes the most comprehensive revision of our Rules of Procedure since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in the early 1990s."
"It does not simply deal with the necessary transposition into Parliament's Rules of what is contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It takes the opportunity, as we did after the Maastricht Treaty, to review the whole of Parliament's working methods and its procedures."
"In short, we are preparing Parliament for a new era."
"Parliament has traditionally taken the treaties and tried to stretch them like a piece of elastic."
"We cannot contradict the treaties, we cannot do things that are forbidden by the treaties."
"But the treaties inevitably allow a margin of appreciation, a scope for interpretation."
"They leave space and gaps to fill in."
"Parliament has always tried to do that in order to make the Union more effective, more open, more transparent and more democratic."
"That is the philosophy that underlies this revision of the Rules of Procedure."
"Of course, if you stretch elastic too far it can snap and you can hurt your fingers."
"But I am convinced that the package that we put before you today has stretched the elastic to just the right degree and that what we have come up with is a package which we can commend to the House."
"After Amsterdam Parliament will be an equal part of a bicameral legislative authority with the Council, at least for the areas subject to codecision which will include most non-agricultural legislation."
"Much work has therefore gone, in this report, into improving and redefining our legislative procedures."
"This includes technical improvements to simplify the way that we vote in plenary."
"The codecision procedure has been rewritten in our Rules, partly to take account of what has been agreed in Amsterdam: the possibility of first reading agreements between the institutions, for instance; the elimination of the Council's right to adopt a text unilaterally at third reading if Parliament fails to reject it."
"These changes are incorporated into the Rules and we have done so in such a way as to encourage early dialogue between the Council and Parliament to try and reach agreement early in the procedure, wherever possible."
"We have also highlighted the cases where it is the final vote in Parliament which will henceforth determine the entry into force of European legislation."
"In another area we have looked at the new provisions giving Parliament the right to vote on the President of the Commission."
"This new legally binding vote is highlighted in the revision of the Rules by describing it as the election of the Commission."
"We want to underline the fact that the Commission, the Commission President and, later, the Commission as a whole are politically accountable to Parliament."
"The Commission is not an unaccountable bureaucracy as some eurosceptics would have us believe."
"The Commission is a political executive accountable to the directly elected Parliament."
"This, too, we have attempted to highlight in the revision of the Rules of Procedure."
"Parliament must look, too, at the developing Common Foreign and Security Policy and sharpen its procedures for monitoring, scrutinising and controlling that policy."
"The Rule changes do this."
"We have taken up a number of suggestions made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy in this regard."
"They include provisions for dealing with the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We provide for the High Representative to enter into a dialogue with Parliament, to come to Parliament to explain his or her statements, to go before the relevant parliamentary committee and for Parliament to monitor the procedure for appointing a High Representative."
"We have put new provisions in the procedures for dealing with what we could call 'atypical legislative procedures': Third Pillar procedures and Schengen procedures, legislation adopted at the request of the social partners under the Social Agreement, legislation proposed at the initiative of a Member State under Article 67 (1) of the Treaty, suspension of a Member State, and legislation adopted under enhanced cooperation."
"All these will now have a precise procedure allowing parliamentary involvement in what would otherwise not obviously be the case under the treaties."
"We have tried to reform Parliament's internal voting procedures so that less time will be spent - as we do so often, spending hours - voting in plenary."
"We have brought in a number of technical changes which would simplify the way that we vote in plenary, without diminishing the rights of Members or groups of Members to table amendments."
"We hope we have come up with a balanced package there."
"We have tried to rationalise our procedures in other ways."
"For legislative reports, for instance, there would no longer be explanatory statements."
"They would be replaced by short justifications for each of the amendments tabled to a Commission proposal, as we already do for the budgetary procedure."
"Similarly, opinions from other committees would be confined to tabling specific amendments."
"This would focus our work specifically on the legislative texts and the changes that we wish to make to them and away from long discursive texts where Parliament's opinion is not always clear."
"Topical and urgent debates would be rationalised as well, in that the subjects chosen would be agreed when the agenda is adopted on the Monday and not by an ad hoc procedure one day later."
"This will leave more time to prepare the debates properly and that, too, would be a small but significant step forward."
"New rules would ensure transparency of Parliament's proceedings at all levels and guarantee the public a right of access to EP documents."
"Here we are following up the recent report on openness and transparency by my colleague, Mrs Lööw."
"We also eliminate the possibility of late challenges to the legal base of proposals, when this challenge is only made at the last stage in plenary as a way of having the matter referred back to committee and to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"We have a rationalised procedure there, which preserves the right of the Legal Affairs Committee and of the committee responsible, leaves the final decision in plenary but avoids the possibility of filibustering."
"In terms of enhancing our scrutiny of the Commission, we also provide in our new Rules for the President of the Commission or another member to come and make a statement to Parliament immediately after Commission meetings, where we so request it, and to be subject to a half-hour period of questioning on the decisions taken at that meeting."
"That would again illustrate the accountability of the Commission to Parliament, but would give the Commission the possibility of informing Parliament directly, rather than the press, of the decisions it has taken as our executive."
"The initial announcement of the decisions taken would be here and the initial reaction would be by directly elected Members posing questions to the Commission."
"We would also try to liven up parliamentary debates."
"At the moment we have debates, as you know, by long lists of speakers."
"We have experimented with what we used to call the Delors procedure, where for an hour the President just gives the floor to individual Members who catch the President's eye."
"We codify both systems in the Rules of Procedure - neither of them is explicitly there at the moment - but we would allow for the possibility of combinations."
"The debate could start with the usual rounds of speakers from each political group, but an hour, half-an-hour or even just ten minutes could be left at the end for a few extra speakers to come in by catching the President's eye, so that Members who have sat here throughout the debate, patiently listening to the arguments, could come in and respond at the end; somebody who has already spoken might wish to come back and respond at the end."
"This would liven up our debates a little bit, make them appeal more to the public, without taking away the right of each group to have its appropriate share of speaking-time."
"We also provide for the Rules of Procedure to be rewritten, where necessary, in gender-neutral language."
"It was International Women's Day yesterday and I know that many of our female colleagues take offence at the fact that the Rules in some languages refer only to Members in the masculine form - as he and not as he or she - and the rule changes would also cater for that particular problem."
"There are also minor things taken up in these rule changes."
"I shall not go into all of them."
"A lot of minor details are tidied up and we seek to improve procedures wherever possible."
"Individually, many of these changes are minor but cumulatively they will improve Parliament's working methods and its procedures."
"They will also make Parliament more open and transparent."
"This package has been put together over almost a year - a year of hard work in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"I must pay tribute to my co-rapporteurs, to Mr Fayot in his capacity as chair of the committee, in which he has had a trying time but has handled it extremely well; to all the members of the committee and, indeed, other committees which have tabled opinions and proposals to us, and, last but not least, the secretariat of the committee, which put an enormous amount of work into this report."
"After a year's hard work, I am confident that we have put together a package which is fair, balanced and can command a virtual consensus across most of the political groups of this House."
"I have no hesitation in commending this package to the House."
"Thank you, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz."
"The vote will not take place tomorrow morning, but on Thursday morning, as I will have the chance to make clear shortly."
"Madam President, as the two rapporteurs who preceded me have already indicated, this revision of the Rules is first and foremost a way of regulating our work in the House, as are the Rules themselves. The result should reflect the interests of the House, the concerns of all the Members and also the concerns of those who work behind the scenes undertaking essential tasks, to whom we have already paid tribute."
"I should also like to congratulate the technical services, principally those attached to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. However, congratulations are also due to all of Parliament's services, and in particular to the officials of the Group of the European People's Party, who have given me tremendous support."
"Madam President, I referred to our Rules as a way of regulating our communal life, and the lodestar of parliamentary activity."
"Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the Rules of Procedure have a much more important role to play."
"They are a symbol, a banner, a programme and a point of reference."
"They are the internal constitution of this institution; they summarise and reflect how Parliament wishes to present itself and the role it sees for itself in the interinstitutional balance."
"They represent all that Parliament has stood for throughout its short but fruitful history, and anticipate the part it would like to play in the process of European integration."
"Consequently, any revision of the Rules of Procedure must inevitably take account of the Treaty, bearing in mind however that there is considerable scope for interpretation when applying the Treaty to existing situations, as there is with any legal instrument."
"The Rules must be practical and realistic, whilst retaining their emblematic value."
"They must enshrine respect for all, for groups - both large and small - and for individuals. They must also establish a definitive balance between the inertia carried over from when this House was merely a parliamentary assembly without power and its new role as a colegislator which is to all intents and purposes on an equal footing with the Council."
"All the amendments are important, Madam President."
"The most minor detail of parliamentary Rules of Procedure can have far-reaching political consequences, as we have seen recently."
"Nevertheless, the amendments can be grouped into three main categories, according to their nature."
"First, there are those of a directly political nature that have direct political consequences. Among these, I would highlight Amendment No 15 on the composition of the political groups."
"It will doubtless be criticised, but it is in line with the concept of European integration. If we are moving towards greater integration in Europe, it does not make sense to have a group composed exclusively of Members of one single nationality in a Parliament whose function is to represent all the people of Europe."
"Amendment No 16 on the election of the President of the European Commission has also received a great deal of criticism."
"I do feel that here, we have respected the spirit of the Treaties, as should be the case. We have taken advantage of the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure that Parliament's vote on the appointment of the President is an integral part of the process, and this is reflected in our Rules of Procedure."
"It is also worth mentioning the statements on the broad guidelines for economic policy laid down in Article 99 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as well as Rule 24 which fully exploits the opportunities provided by the text in question."
"I shall not go into details on the High Representative, as his or her function has already been extensively debated."
"Nevertheless, I should like to support my group's amendment which clarifies the situation and, I feel, does away with certain somewhat arbitrary features of the current Amendment No 129."
"As regards relations with other institutions, I would emphasise that relations with national parliaments will be strengthened, as will relations with the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee."
"I should also like to highlight Amendment No 28 on interinstitutional agreements which enhances the status of these fundamental acts which are so important to us. Above all, they are rendered more transparent, legally sound and directly accessible to all."
"I mentioned transparency, and the new Chapter XVIIa has been referred to in this connection."
"It clearly reflects the new guidelines laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"There are many other issues I could mention concerning the third pillar, human rights and compliance with the principles of the Treaty."
"Nevertheless, I should like to move on and deal with the second group of amendments, albeit briefly. These amendments have a direct bearing on the new legislative powers."
"I would stress that all these amendments have a dual purpose. They aim to promote interinstitutional relations, to foster the joint but unregulated efforts being made by the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and to streamline and update existing procedures."
"Turning for a moment to the issue of the legal basis, the Group of the European People's Party has tabled an amendment in this connection, together with the Liberal Group.In my view, the Committee on Legal Affairs' right to review has so far proved very useful and should be maintained."
"We must remember that any dispute concerning the legal basis can as a last resort lead to a case before the Court of Justice."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs' right to review must therefore be maintained, together with its special powers."
"Madam President, I referred earlier to inherited inertia, and this leads me to the third group of amendments, to which Mr Fabre-Aubrespy referred."
"Given that Parliament was previously a parliamentary assembly with no power, it retains a number of earlier procedures."
"Some of these have already been streamlined, whereas others are in need of further reform."
"The will is certainly there."
"There are certain outstanding reforms which do not go beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam but which are an inescapable consequence of the Treaty as they involve bringing Parliament's earlier historical functions into line with its recently acquired role of colegislator."
"An effort has therefore been made to make speaking time and resources more efficient, and to simplify and update procedures through the use of new technology."
"Finally, now that I am discussing resources, new technologies and speaking time, my own speaking time has elapsed."
"I firmly believe that although this is not a perfect document, and despite the fact that I personally do not support all the amendments, the package before us is a clear representation of what this institution stands for, its energy, its vitality and the role it seeks to play at the heart of European integration."
"We have included a number of reports in this debate, namely those by Mr Ford, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, Mr Vecchi, Mr Nordmann, Mr Voggenhuber, Mr Fayot, Mr Wijsenbeek and Mr Spiers."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs on their joint report amending the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament in the light of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It contains an enormous amount of work which will underpin Parliament's ability to use its powers to the full and, as Mr Corbett says, stretch them to the limit."
"Some people in this Parliament describe the Rules Committee as like watching paint dry in 11 languages."
"The fact that many people believe this is demonstrated by the speed at which the Chamber emptied when you said that we would be talking about rules."
"Nevertheless, I often think that the Rules Committee Members are the stagehands of this Parliament - the unsung heroes without whom the political stars of this institution would lose their lustre."
"Mr Corbett and his colleagues have very adequately outlined the thrust of their report."
"I want to concentrate on aspects of the nine other reports by the Rules Committee that have been taken simultaneously, particularly the series of amendments relating to issues concerning the declaration of Members' interests."
"With the passage of the Nordmann report and my own report on control and registration of lobbyists in 1996, this Parliament made an enormous step forward in transparency and openness."
"We now know that every Member has five shadows behind him."
"There are 3 000 lobbyists trying to shape the views of 600 Members."
"A dialogue with the representatives of employees and employers, consumer groups, producer groups, representatives of foreign governments and environmental and human rights organisations is both necessary and desirable."
"But dialogue should not turn into ownership."
"Members cannot be seen as products on the shelves of some kind of political supermarket available for purchase by those who have the money."
"In these reports a number of holes in the system are being filled in."
"Firstly, Amendment No 10 from my own report deals with the plight of former Members."
"We currently have an ambiguous situation in which some former Members are honorary Members, which has led to confusion in the past, with people considering them as senior Members of this institution rather than ex-Members of the institution."
"My amendment gives the Bureau the job of laying down the rights and privileges of former Members without distinction."
"Secondly, we have Amendment No 110 in the Wijsenbeek report which changes the rule on declaration of interests so that Members with a direct financial interest must orally declare such an interest before speaking in committee or plenary."
"Thirdly, Amendment No 112 in the Spiers report will make the chairs of intergroups responsible for making an annual declaration of any assistance in cash or kind received by such groups and making that available to the public."
"Fourthly, Amendment No 111 deals with two problems."
"Firstly, with the failure of a small number of Members - 9 for 1996 and 21 for 1997 - to complete their declaration of Members' interests."
"It would mean that, after a final warning given by the President, their names would be published in the Minutes of our proceedings and then, if they still failed to comply, they would be suspended from the House."
"The second part makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared."
"At the moment there seems to be a great deal of ambiguity on what constitutes the level at which declarations should start."
"Finally, Amendment No 2 from Mr Vecchi makes it clear that after elections or the appointment of new Members, credentials cannot be verified without a full declaration of interests, and that they will not be allowed to take an elected position in Parliament or to be represented on any delegation until they have completed their declaration of interests."
"In the current climate of public opinion we owe it to our electorate and ourselves, not only to operate in a fair and proper manner, but also to allow the people of Europe to see that we do so."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked to write a report on one very small, very specific point in the amendments put forward today."
"It involves the existing Rule 8 of our Rules of Procedure, more precisely two of its paragraphs - paragraph 3 and paragraph 5 - governing resignations by Members of this Parliament, which can sometimes pose a problem."
"There is some uncertainty surrounding the date of effect of a resignation as a result of a legally doubtful distinction which is drawn between, on the one hand, the formal conditions governing resignation - first a letter and then notification in an official record - and, on the other, the date of effect of that resignation as stipulated by the existing paragraph 5 of Rule 8."
"Notification of resignation in an official record was intended to be a condition which must be fulfilled before the resignation can take effect."
"It is a guarantee for the Member of Parliament and there is no question of changing it."
"But we considered whether we needed to retain the procedure of the resignation letter and the official record, and concluded that the Rules could be simplified by stipulating that notification of the resignation must be made in the form of an official record, as laid down in the existing paragraph 3 and dispensing with the letter of resignation, and that the vacancy will be established as from the date indicated by the resigning Member in that official record."
"So the ambiguity on this point will be removed if Parliament adopts Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 9, which I believe met with widespread agreement in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"I would now like to speak on the report as a whole to explain why, on behalf of my group, I am opposed to its adoption."
"Quite frankly, the report does not properly answer the question that was asked, and it imprudently raises questions that were not asked."
"With regard to the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I maintain that this implementation is premature, firstly - and here Professor Duhamel might remember that the parliament of the state he represents consists of two chambers - because in fact the ratification debate is currently still taking place in the French Parliament, and also because, with no date set for the Treaty to come into force, the provisions we are going to adopt will come into force in the next part-session, which will be before the Treaty has been ratified."
"But the text also goes beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This is the case, in particular, in Amendment No 28 enshrining the practice of interinstitutional agreements, which are legally doubtful."
"This also applies to Amendments Nos 67 and 68 on the common foreign and security policy."
"The report is also imprudent in introducing issues not included in the mandate given by the Conference of Presidents."
"This applies to Amendment No 90 which provides that mutually exclusive amendments are inadmissible; this is a very ambiguous provision."
"It also applies to Amendment No 96 which states that the composition of the committees shall, as far as possible, reflect the composition of the plenary."
"It also applies to Amendment No 14 on censure of parliamentary office-holders and to Amendment No 78."
"I refer Members interested in these issues to the minority opinion where I have set out my reservations."
"Madam President, in recent years, consolidated practice concerning the verification of credentials has established a number of procedures and precedents, which lend a broad interpretation to both the Act of 20 September 1976 and Rules 7 and 8 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"Confirmation of the validity of the mandate of elected Members has thereby become more rigorous, as have the conditions governing the termination of the mandate and the full extent of Members' powers."
"This is of course a complex field where a plethora of common rules - laid down by the Treaties and by Parliament's Rules of Procedure - and national rules coexist."
"There are moreover several large 'grey areas', where the borderline between national and Community competence is not always clear."
"Greater certainty concerning powers and competences will be achieved once the uniform electoral procedure and the single Members' Statute enter into force."
"Nevertheless, the Rules Committee appointed me to draw up a report - which has been incorporated into the report now under discussion, in Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 - on ways of exploiting fully the existing scope under the Treaties to maximise the European Parliament's competence to ensure that the composition of Parliament is and remains as desired by the electorate, and that the exercise of its mandate is not subject to undue impediment."
"The amendments propose, firstly, that procedures already followed during this legislature should be written into the Rules of Procedure, for example the obligation to sign declarations of non-incompatibility and financial interests."
"Secondly, we wish to enhance Parliament's powers to monitor withdrawals of candidates under national law."
"Finally, Parliament is empowered to require the Member States to cooperate fairly and squarely in forwarding all information liable to affect the exercise of the mandate, concerning national electoral legislation or the conferring of a national assignment on an MEP."
"Amendment No 4 is of particular importance: it enables Parliament to interact with national authorities in procedures which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office."
"The adoption of these amendments will constitute a further step towards an effective Community-wide Members' Statute, which is a vital precondition if our institutions are to function properly and the European Parliament's role is to be strengthened."
"Madam President, first I have to present my own modest part in this overall report."
"It involved the necessary clarification of the Rules on expressing minority opinions, and I am delighted that the work schedule has you chairing this sitting, because in a previous legislature we were co-authors of a minority opinion and we came up against difficulties in applying the Rules as they were then and as, on the whole, they remain."
"What was needed then, and is needed now, is to specify the conditions whereby a minority opinion can appear in the explanatory statement, and the general idea has been to use the technique and model set out in our Rules for the written explanation of vote, setting a precise ceiling on the number of words."
"It was also necessary to decide where the minority opinion should appear."
"The opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee."
"That is the time when ideas, thoughts and vague hopes are crystallised into a completely identifiable formal opinion."
"Of course, an arbitration authority is needed in case our work is inadequate and does not cover the range of situations which could arise, and we feel that the chairman of the committee should be able to settle any disputes which might still arise despite this improvement in the Rules."
"That is the intent of Amendment No 99, which clarifies paragraph 3 of Rule 146."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course you are right to note or criticise the fact that this report aims far beyond the amendments that would have necessarily resulted from the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore also exceeds its task."
"But that is not really my problem."
"What I criticise is the spirit underlying these amendments."
"I believe that we must ask ourselves whether such a comprehensive amendment of the Rules will really make Parliament more democratic."
"The acid test of the democratic culture of a parliament is minority rights."
"Have they been strengthened or weakened here?"
"I think it is not difficult to see that the countless amendments restrict the rights of the smaller groups, the minorities, that they do not strengthen the rights of the individual Member, that they give precedence to majority rights and to the bureaucratisation of Parliament."
"I think it is a pity that the majority of Members are using this opportunity to make Parliament less democratic rather than taking substantial steps to make it more democratic."
"Mr Corbett has described the Commission's position in relation mainly to future integration and is looking, in the final analysis, to a European government; but I think he must also realise that a European government of this kind would have a particular result for Parliament, as it would split it into an opposition and government parties."
"That is what makes it so precarious, for it would mean that minority rights were restricted rather than strengthened."
"There are many examples of this."
"Let me name three: the vote of no confidence against senior office holders of this House - no one group even has the right to express no confidence; the number of signatures in support of initiatives is increased from 29 to 32; it will become more difficult to table motions for resolutions."
"That is the reverse of making Parliament more democratic."
"It is an attempt by the majorities to win themselves advantages, and I regret this development because it does not benefit the European Parliament, and certainly not its democratic culture."
"Madam President, I wish to speak on Rule 168 (new), in other words Amendment No 109, which is the result of an own-initiative report."
"This is the last rule in our Rules of Procedure and it concerns the annexes."
"The annexes are not exactly rules, but they are still part of the Rules of Procedure, and with this new Rule 168 we aimed to clarify the structure of the annexes by arranging them under three headings:"
"implementing provisions for procedures under these Rules, adopted by simple majority in Parliament; -provisions adopted in implementation of specific terms of the Rules of Procedure, in particular, for example - as an illustration - Rule 9 on the code of conduct."
"The code of conduct is adopted by an absolute majority."
"Provision is also made in our Rules for permanent and temporary committees to be set up by the Conference of Presidents and under Rule 135; -interinstitutional agreements, and a whole series of procedures with a bearing on Parliament's operation.I think this subdivision will make the annexes clearer and easier to follow."
"Let me make one final point, Madam President."
"We are discussing eight reports by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, in association with the Corbett-Palacio-Gutiérrez report."
"This is like clearing out the Rules Committee's cupboards."
"I do not think it is a very useful practice, but I suppose it is better than nothing at all."
"Thank you, Mr Fayot."
"I note that by addressing the Chair as 'Madame la Présidente ', you are already applying the proposals made by Mr Corbett."
"Madam President, in French I would say 'Madame le Président ', because the position you hold represents a role."
"So we should see you not as an individual person, but in a particular role."
"Having said that, Madam President, I shall now return to my mother tongue, Dutch, because the Rules are written in each of our languages and I think we should respect that fact."
"Let me begin by saying that I do not intend to talk about my own report."
"Mr Ford has already covered it for me extremely well."
"To me it is obvious that if you are speaking on a subject in which you have a personal interest, you make that fact clear to the House."
"I will start by complimenting Mr Corbett on all the work he has put in on this extremely complicated subject."
"The same goes, in different measure, for the two co-rapporteurs, Mrs Palacio and Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, the latter supposedly expressing the opinion of the smaller groups."
"I cannot in all honesty say that it was unduly prominent."
"I think we can say that with this review, Parliament certainly has come a step closer towards becoming a true parliament but has not yet come of age, and that consequently this general revision has not quite achieved its goal."
"Why do I say that?"
"Because we still chop up our debates into little snippets, with all nationalities and parties and shades of political opinion speaking individually, rather than having a single spokesmen for all the groups who can make a real and fundamental contribution to the debate."
"Nor is there a true dialogue with the Council and the Commission in which Parliament says something, the Council or Commission responds and then we have the chance of a second round."
"One last comment addressed to Mr Voggenhuber."
"He is exaggerating, these are not Rules of Procedure for the big groups."
"All they do is consolidate the current position."
"Forgive me for exceeding my speaking time."
"It was due to inattentiveness on the Council's part."
"Mr President, I am going to speak about what was my bid for parliamentary immortality as the Spiers report but what is now merely Amendment No 112 of this much larger report."
"Some years ago the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities was asked to extend to intergroups the rules that require individual Members to declare any outside support received."
"This proved surprisingly tricky, partly because no definition of an intergroup could be agreed, and partly because some groups registered as intergroups with the group chairmen do not receive outside support whereas some other groupings of Members which are not considered to be intergroups receive such support."
"The amendment therefore speaks in terms of groupings of Members, both intergroups and other unofficial groupings."
"These will now have to declare any assistance they receive whether in cash or in kind, which would include secretarial assistance, support with research and so on."
"Such groupings in the European Parliament often perform a valuable role."
"There is not a major problem with intergroups in the European Parliament and the current Rules which require Members to declare any significant support they receive would embrace support received via an intergroup as well."
"However, there are concerns about intergroups and there is clearly a lack of transparency."
"These rule changes should make everything much more open."
"Finally, the quaestors are charged with drawing up detailed rules."
"These should include a requirement that groups receiving outside support must file their minutes and records of attendance with the European Parliament, and that these should be publicly available."
"That would enable everyone to see who might be influencing whom."
"Madam President, my task on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is an easy one."
"Our suggestions have been both accepted and now explained by the rapporteurs."
"It is our belief that it is a legitimate prerogative of this Parliament to debate, to suggest and to question actions taken by the Executive in foreign affairs, be that the Commission or the Council."
"The High Representative will be the key, and it seems to me a matter of great urgency that we hold a confirmation hearing jointly with the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees of the Member State parliaments to examine the mandate and the intentions of the successful candidate, whoever he or she may be, once the High Representative is appointed."
"It also seems to me - and we cover this in our draft opinion - that a similar procedure should be available to us on the appointment of special representatives, envoys and EU ambassadors."
"So, I can endorse these rule changes heartily."
"I should like to make a personal intervention to suggest to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities something it might like to consider in the next Parliament."
"I detect an insidious growth in the power of the Conference of Presidents over the internal organisation of this Parliament, a growth in power at the expense of the Bureau, of the Conference of Committee Presidents, of the Quaestors and, most importantly, of this plenary."
"I have had the opportunity of watching the Conference of Presidents in action."
"It is consistently overworked and often ill-briefed."
"To make the Conference of Presidents the ultimate arbiter of every decision in this Parliament is an abuse and a mistake."
"I am full of admiration for the leaders of the two big groups, but to adapt the terminology of the World Trade Organization, these are the two great elephants of Parliament."
"They cannot be experts on everything."
"They each lead complex coalitions."
"Their joint voting power in the Conference of Presidents leads to the governance of this House by a 'condominium of the confused'."
"It will be real test of the democratic vigour of this House if it can look its leadership in the eyes, and amend its Rules accordingly in the next mandate."
"Madam President, first let me express my appreciation to the rapporteurs and congratulate them on their comprehensive work."
"The revision of the Rules of Procedure focuses on the innovations arising from the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control proposed few amendments, since the Treaty of Amsterdam makes no substantive changes either to the process or the nature of the discharge procedure."
"It tabled only two amendments."
"The first concerns institutional responsibility for decisions overruling a withholding of approval by the Financial Controller, which in our view should revert to the President of Parliament."
"Secondly, we want to clarify that there is no interaction between the consequences of discharge and the procedure whereby Parliament may request the Commission to submit to it any appropriate legislative proposal pursuant to Article 138b of the EC Treaty, on the basis of an own-initiative report."
"Unfortunately, neither amendment has been adopted to date."
"Meanwhile things have progressed, however."
"The refusal to grant the Commission a discharge last December brought to light a whole range of inconsistencies between the provisions of the Treaty and Annex V of the Rules of Procedure. These inconsistencies must be remedied immediately to ensure the smooth running and completion of the discharge procedure."
"We can congratulate the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on its zeal and thoroughness in tackling this problem."
"We await Mr Fayot's report in the near future, confident that it will clarify this complex subject for us."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Petitions urgently requests the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to take account of the following points when adapting the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"With reference to Rule 157(1), second paragraph, of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the Committee on Petitions welcomes the guidelines for specialist committees of the European Parliament considering petitions, which have been drawn up by the Conference of Committee Chairmen."
"However, the committee stresses the need to build on the successful cooperation established between the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman and to anchor it sufficiently clearly in the Rules of Procedure."
"We therefore propose that Annex VI, XX (Powers and responsibilities of standing committees) should be clarified and that relations with the European Ombudsman should be included among the responsibilities of the Committee on Petitions."
"We further propose that clearer rules on submission of the annual reports and special reports on the activities of the European Ombudsman should be included in Chapter XX, Rule 161 (Activities of the Ombudsman)."
"It is important to insert in the Rules of Procedure more precise rules on the submission and consideration of the Ombudsman's annual reports and special reports by the European Parliament."
"If in future the Ombudsman were to submit more interim or special reports on very specialised topics, we would advocate that not all of them should necessarily be considered in plenary."
"Some of the matters covered by such reports could be dealt with more effectively if simpler and more rapid procedures were applied, which might be devised if this were felt appropriate."
"Corresponding provisions, modelled on Rule 44 or Rule 52, could be inserted in the Rules of Procedure."
"Finally, it would be appropriate for a procedure to be introduced in the Rules of Procedure for urgent consideration of the Ombudsman's reports by Parliament, especially with regard to their placing on the part-session agenda."
"I thank the rapporteurs and hope our amendments will be adopted."
"Madam President, while thanking the rapporteurs I also have one point of criticism."
"The committee proposes that the vote on approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole shall be taken by roll call."
"That is a grave mistake."
"Behind rules there are thoughts, ideas, concepts, aims, strategies."
"What were the Heads of State and Government thinking when they wrote into the Treaties that the vote on a motion of censure shall be by roll call?"
"The thought behind that is obvious."
"Roll-call votes split Parliament into national delegations and political groups."
"This puts Parliament under pressure and therefore makes it subject to control."
"That is the point of a roll-call vote."
"Now we are introducing it for approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole."
"And that means that we too are exposing ourselves to pressure and can therefore be controlled."
"That is the result!"
"Parliament would be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot."
"In fact the Commission would also be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot."
"This vote on approval would not give the impression of being a forced vote."
"That is why I regard this as a grave mistake."
"I cannot imagine that Members really want it."
"Hence my appeal to support the amendments calling for a vote by secret ballot."
"Madam President, the Group of the European People's Party supports the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"My group has nevertheless tabled a number of amendments - Amendment No 125 and the subsequent amendments - most of which are technical. We trust that these amendments will therefore gain the necessary support within the House."
"I should like to respond to the remarks made by Mr Rothley on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"As ever, his remarks were pertinent and largely justified."
"It can nevertheless also be argued that a vote as important as the one to approve the nomination of the President of the European Commission must display visible symbols of its significance, and voting by roll call has traditionally always served that purpose."
"Notwithstanding this, we shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group."
"On behalf of the European People's Party, I should like to highlight a number of points on which either the group cannot agree with the Committee on the Rules of Procedure or where it has tabled political rather than technical amendments to clarify the issue."
"Referring again to the three categories of amendments, and more specifically to the political ones, our group is opposed to the so-called 'internal censure motion' provided for in Amendment No 14."
"In our view, it achieves nothing and would result in more complications than advantages."
"Amendment No 124 by the Socialist Group concerning interparliamentary delegations raises serious legal problems."
"The delegations are, after all, bodies with power vested in them by the House, and it is inconceivable that their membership should fall into two categories - primary members from the Bureau, elected by the House, and secondary members, appointed by the Conference of Presidents."
"The Group of the European People's Party understands the logic behind this amendment, but feels that the democratic principles which must provide the foundations for the composition of each and every one of Parliament's bodies should also be respected as far as these interparliamentary delegations are concerned."
"As regards the appointment of the High Representative, we have tabled Amendment No 129, which provides further detail and is more in line with the Treaty than the amendment tabled by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"In terms of the legislative amendments, the Group of the European People's Party is totally opposed to the amendment to Rule 53 concerning the legal basis and is therefore also opposed to Amendment No 38."
"Turning to the third group of amendments on the indirect consequences of having gained the status of colegislators, and as regards time, improved management of resources, translations, the introduction of new technology and so on, the Group of the European People's Party tabled Amendment No 144 which clarifies the situation concerning explanatory statements and makes it more manageable."
"A large majority opposes the exclusion amendments to Rule 90 and the one-minute speeches in Rule 78."
"Finally, I should like to say a word about the implementation of this revision."
"As Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has rightly said, we must be aware that implementation must await the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Before Thursday, therefore, an oral amendment or technical amendment needs to be introduced to take account of this situation."
"On behalf of the European People's Party, I propose that all the amendments should come into effect at the first part-session following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just one minute and shall confine myself to one point concerning the powers of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, namely determining the legal basis."
"As you are aware, where there is uncertainty as to the correct legal basis, every committee of Parliament has so far had to seek the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Amendment No 38 is now proposing that, in the event of a dispute, this requirement to seek an opinion should be replaced by a requirement merely to inform the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"That is a very dangerous development in the wrong direction."
"If every committee can determine the legal basis individually, this will lead to still more conflicts of responsibility between the committees and it will be very hard to see any consistency in the basis or Treaty article which the European Parliament uses in its decision making."
"My group has therefore retabled Amendment No 138 to the effect that in the event of disagreement over the legal basis, the Legal Affairs Committee must be consulted, not informed."
"Arguments against this on grounds of the supposed unnecessary delay are overcome by an urgency procedure which is appended to the amendment."
"I would commend this amendment to the House."
"Madam President, many of the proposals contained in this comprehensive report constitute definite improvements or necessary adaptations to the new situation created by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"There are, however, some rather radical proposals of a political nature which would give the European Parliament more power than is actually provided for in the text of the Treaty."
"In that category belong, for example, Amendment No 60 on the agreement between the labour market partners, Amendment No 69 on the Council's foreign policy representative and Amendment No 16 relating to the President of the Commission."
"It is totally unacceptable to attempt to overstep the clear boundaries set in the Treaty."
"The report also contains other proposals that are equally unacceptable."
"This applies particularly to Amendment No 90, which states that groups may not table mutually exclusive amendments."
"I think there are many people in the House who regard censorship of this type as undesirable."
"We all know that different viewpoints can be accommodated within the various political groups."
"I therefore hope this proposal will not succeed for one reason or another."
"In my view, we should have used this opportunity to establish that the President of Parliament should be elected for five years, so that we can be spared the extraordinary procedure whereby the two large groups end up sharing the office between them."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their tremendous work in this area and, even if I do not agree with a lot of what they did and their final conclusions, I do appreciate their diligence and their efforts to try and find compromises where it was possible."
"As has already been highlighted by other speakers within this Parliament, there are a number of contradictions and elements within this combined report which will cause us difficulties in the future."
"I would specifically like to draw Members' attention to the question of whether we elect the President of the Commission or whether we approve the nomination of the President of the Commission."
"Likewise, this proposal that the Conference of Presidents acting by three-fifths majority, representing at least three groups, may propose to the plenary - acting by absolute majority - to terminate any elected office holder's position within this Parliament."
"I think it is ridiculous that somebody who is elected by the body of the Parliament - by the individual Members here within the Parliament - can have their office terminated by a decision of the Conference of Presidents."
"I have no difficulty if three-fifths or three-sixths or three-sevenths of the Parliament decide to terminate such offices, but if the Conference of Presidents does so it is absolutely crazy."
"Likewise, the role of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and the special officers should also be brought before this Parliament."
"We are imposing new restrictions which we do not have the power to do under the Treaty."
"I am delighted that my group's amendment with regard to the numbers required for the formulation of groups has been accepted and I also hope that Members will vote for the one-minute speech at the start of the first sitting of each part-session which gives us the opportunity to raise issues of importance in our own Member States."
"It is important for us to ensure that our new Rules of Procedure are unambiguous, direct, and able to deal with the actual powers that we have and not try to create new ones."
"Most importantly, it must be remembered that the dignity of the Members of this House and their rights as elected representatives of the people of Europe must be foremost in any formulation of our rules."
"Madam President, the rapporteurs have done a thorough and comprehensive job, in fact too comprehensive in my view because the proposed amendments go beyond the innovations contained in the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore also beyond the task assigned to the rapporteurs."
"Many of the amendments were eliminated in committee, but a few that worry me remain."
"I am particularly concerned about one point."
"It is particularly important that the European Parliament, which has rightly dedicated itself to the protection of minorities, does not lose sight of this aim in its dealings with the minorities in its own House."
"The proposals to amend the provisions on the formation of groups, and also the horizontal increase in the number of required signatures from 29 to 32, unjustifiably weaken the small groupings whose importance to the diversity of opinion inherent in a democracy has indeed recently become more than apparent."
"Madam President, at present the Commissioners are appointed by each individual Member State."
"Mrs Bjerregaard is Denmark's representative and a new majority in the Danish Parliament can send a new representative next time."
"So ultimately our voters are the ones who have the final say and indirectly appoint the Danish Member of the Commission."
"The Amsterdam Treaty gives Parliament the right to approve nominations by the Member States, and this is a power which is now to be written into the Rules of Procedure."
"But now Parliament is saying instead that it should elect or reject the Commission."
"The Commission is no longer to be a result of the decisions of the Member States alone, but in effect a common government of the EU."
"The Commission is to be elected by Parliament in almost the same way as a national parliament elects a government."
"That is a recipe for a federal state with a common parliament and a common government."
"Parliament expects to be able to reject the names which are put forward by the Member States when they are not in line with the views of the majority."
"In reality, Parliament wants to transfer the power to appoint the Commission from the national parliaments and governments to this supranational assembly."
"That is contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore illegal."
"Parliament cannot simply take power from the Member States on its own authority."
"The June Movement is therefore voting against the new Rules of Procedure, and we call upon the Member States to protest against Parliament's attempt to transform the national parliaments into a kind of junior branch of local government."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to say what many others have already said, namely that the three rapporteurs have done an excellent job."
"I agree with 99 % of what they have produced; however, there are two points on which our views diverge."
"The first concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only."
"I simply cannot find a logical reason for such a proposal."
"It is justified on the grounds that the larger countries should not be given an advantage, which is illogical and untenable in itself since the larger countries always have an advantage, for instance when it comes to having to collect 29 signatures in order to table an amendment."
"The only logical reason I have been able to find for such a change is political, in other words the rapporteurs would like to make it impossible to form national groups so as to tone down national differences in the House, thereby giving it a more European character."
"This is a commendable objective, but the Rules of Procedure are no place for political aims."
"The Rules of Procedure should be politically neutral."
"For that reason, I am going to vote against this amendment."
"The other amendment which in my view is unnecessary states that a political group cannot table amendments that are mutually exclusive."
"It is already difficult enough to table amendments in this House."
"Such a change would only add to the difficulties."
"I do not think we should set about making Parliament less democratic in this way."
"Furthermore, the gains in efficiency that would result from such a change are negligible."
"At most, only a tiny fraction of all the votes are mutually exclusive."
"Consequently, I am going to vote against these two proposals."
"Madam President, the valuable work done by our three rapporteurs confirms, yet again, the need for the exercise of MEPs' constitutional duties to be autonomously regulated."
"Consequently, this House is lending an initial interpretation to the Amsterdam Treaty - assuming that it does enter into force - even before the establishment of the relevant judicial and extra-parliamentary practice."
"We must devote particular attention here to the regulatory nature of the new legislative procedures, since in its next term, Parliament is certain to enjoy equal status with the Council in a twin-chamber legislative system."
"More specifically, according to this blueprint, the new codecision procedure is in line both with the resolution adopted by Parliament on this matter and with the joint interinstitutional agreement that is soon to be approved. I must however endorse the requested addition to Rule 66, recognising the Commission's role in so-called informal conciliation."
"The Commission's monopoly over legislative initiative is undoubtedly an anomaly within the Community system; but it is a welcome anomaly, considering the meagre legislative output of many national parliaments."
"The Commission's role of counterbalancing the two legislative bodies is in itself an element of regulatory coherence and consistency, with its constant emphasis on the rationale behind proposed legislation."
"But this role must be performed throughout the legislative process."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is a young parliament."
"This is a fundamental difference between it and the national parliaments, some of which have been sitting for centuries."
"Twenty years is barely an anniversary, not quite the age of reason."
"So our Rules, which are the charter of our parliamentary life, are particularly important."
"For democracy to work despite all our differences, the letter as well as the spirit of the Rules must be observed."
"They cannot be bent to the dictates of the political climate."
"Their reliability depends on consistency in their daily interpretation and application."
"That is also why the Rules need to evolve."
"Above all they must be amended to make the procedures simpler and less burdensome so that they are faster and more effective."
"We must not allow them to be used politically to block a parliamentary institution whose role is to take legislative decisions."
"In a Parliament where five-year government majorities do not exist, but where majorities change with the issues, simple and transparent procedures are essential for the public to understand what we do."
"So I cannot accept Mr Voggenhuber's complaint that this change in the Rules means less democracy."
"I think a balance has been struck between democracy and effectiveness."
"I would like to make one last remark, Mr President, following what Mr Spencer has just said in the debate."
"It has been suggested that when we restructure the committees in the next parliamentary term, we should remove the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities by merging it with another committee."
"I would regret such a merger."
"Personally I think it would be better to create a proper constitutional committee in the European Parliament to deal with all aspects of the working life of Parliament."
"I think it is important to oil the wheels of our procedures."
"As chairman of the Rules Committee may I make one last comment on the controversial issue of entry into force."
"I think, and the three rapporteurs agree with me, that this package of amendments to the Rules should come into force at the same time as the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"There are two series of provisions here, some adapting the Rules to the Treaty of Amsterdam, others independent of the Treaty."
"So for reasons of simplicity, Mr President, I think the best course is to bring the changes into force at the same time as the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"Orphan medicinal products"
"The next item is the report (A4-0078/99) by Mr Cabrol, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) on orphan medicinal products (COM(98)0450 - C4-0470/98-98/0240(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation that is before us concerns orphan medicinal products."
"Its purpose is to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to concentrate on the research and marketing of medicinal products which would not otherwise be marketed by the industry because they concern rare diseases affecting only a very few people, and are consequently not commercially viable."
"Tropical diseases, which affect so many who have no hope of paying, should also be included. That is the aim of Amendment No 2, which I support."
"This regulation raises two main issues and several secondary issues."
"The initial problem is that of definition."
"The first criterion is epidemiological, in this case diseases affecting no more than 5 per 10 000 of the population and, of course, serious, chronic and debilitating diseases."
"This is specified in Amendments Nos 3 and 7."
"Then there is a medical criterion which applies where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment for these diseases."
"I think that is an excellent criterion, and I reject Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41, 42 and 43, which seek to limit diagnostic research to curable diseases, as if it were not important to be able to recognise a disease."
"That seems ridiculous, to doctors in any case."
"The second issue is that of incentives."
"I think they will be effective, whether it be assistance in drawing up a research protocol, exemption from registration fees - supported by Amendments Nos 11, 14 and 21 - national incentives, fiscal for example, and above all market exclusivity for ten years, although with provision to reduce it to six years if certain criteria are no longer met or a clinically superior medicinal product is discovered."
"I shall not be supporting Amendments Nos 25, 28 and 31, which seek to remove this criterion, because I think it will be quite simple to observe in practice."
"In terms of obtaining excessive profit, I find the guarantee relevant."
"I shall therefore uphold that criterion against Amendments Nos 17, 32, 36, 37 and 39 which seek to remove it, but propose to pay the excessive profit - if there is one - to a research support fund for new orphan medicinal products."
"And I shall be supporting Amendment No 38, which makes it impossible to extend an authorisation to market a similar non-orphan medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication."
"I am also in favour of a retroactive measure for orphan medicinal products presented before this regulation comes into force, in order to benefit the sick people concerned as early as possible."
"That is the aim of Amendment No 40."
"In accordance with the proposed regulation, the designation of these orphan medicinal products will be obtained from a special committee set up within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products."
"Finally, I support Amendment No 15, which calls for that Agency to receive a special contribution that is sufficient to cover the exemptions from registration fees and is intended to maximise the incentive to carry out research in the orphan medicinal products sector and submit these applications for authorisation."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this regulation is extremely important and useful as it will not only allow the treatment of diseases for which no diagnostic or therapeutic resources are currently available - and that includes vaccinations of course - but it will also lead to research in the pharmaceutical industry that will create employment, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I therefore urge you to vote for this regulation, taking into account, of course, the amendments I have mentioned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after lengthy preparatory work, this proposal for a regulation is a step in the right direction."
"In accordance with a need felt by millions of patients, it aims to create favourable conditions at Community level for research into and the development and marketing of medicinal products to treat rare diseases."
"First and foremost, the development of treatment possibilities for patients requires that the field of application of the regulation be extended as far as possible, in particular to new indications even for well-known pharmaceutical products and forms of treatment."
"Since most of the applications come from small and medium-sized enterprises, at least in the United States, it would be appropriate for the Commission to specify special conditions for the SMEs so as to step up the use of funds earmarked under the fifth framework programme and the programme of Community action on rare diseases."
"We agree completely with the idea of full access to the centralised procedure, without this becoming binding, and a partial or total exemption from the payment of fees to the Agency, provided that it is guaranteed an adequate supply of funds, and we would hope that this financial incentive would also be adopted by the Member States in the event of the mutual recognition procedure being applied. This should explicitly be laid down in the regulation, at least in the form of an emphatic recommendation to the Member States."
"Exclusivity is one of the lynchpins of any system of incentives and hence should be extended to every application, in particular to new indications for well-known medicines, so as to encourage research in fields which otherwise would not be exploited for lack of adequate patent protection, provided that the criteria set out in Articles 3(1) and 3(2) are respected, especially in the case of well-known drugs."
"The concept of a 'similar medical product' should be given a more detailed scientific definition in order to take into account current scientific developments and the characteristics of the products."
"Only through cooperation between the private and the public sector and the creation of favourable conditions for research into new medicines, with the help of treatment and diagnosis, can we respond to the patients' needs."
"Mr President, Europe is finally catching up with the United States, which has for some time been encouraging the research, manufacture and marketing of medicinal products intended for the diagnosis and treatment of rare disorders which - although affecting only a small number of people - are serious, incapacitating and often fatal."
"We note with satisfaction that the Commission has kept its word to Parliament and, after the adoption of the provisions on rare diseases, has presented to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation intended to steer the industry towards researching and manufacturing medicinal products which are unlikely to be profitable, given the narrow user base."
"In this way, the European Union as an institution is meeting its commitment - laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and consolidated in the Amsterdam Treaty - to contribute to ensuring a high level of health protection for all European people; it is also, for humanity as a whole, assuming the responsibilities deriving from its economic and cultural strength."
"Biomedical science has made tremendous progress and yet, in the case of certain genetic diseases and rare disorders, our degree of impotence is unacceptable to patients' families, who feel abandoned and betrayed."
"The families have achieved a good deal by grouping together and organising themselves."
"Celebrities from political and artistic circles have joined them in collecting funds for research: we need only think of the growing role, year by year, of initiatives such as 'Telethon'."
"The European Union cannot shirk its duty, which is not to take over the role of private manufacturers in the individual Member States, but to draw all the necessary strands together."
"To this end, the measures provided for in this regulation will be complemented by Community funding under the fifth R&D framework programme."
"The main incentives will be market exclusivity for ten years, awarded to the manufacturing company on certain conditions, assistance from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, exemption from paying all or part of the fees due, and the possibility of tax incentives - albeit at national level."
"Having pressed the Commission to present this proposal, the Socialist Group - to which I have the privilege of belonging - now supports it enthusiastically. We would stress that the final version of the regulation must prioritise scientific and humanitarian bodies rather than economic ones."
"In other words, the caution required in a field such as this must not cause difficulties in offering incentives or implementing the provisions, which must be formulated and read in such a way as to open the door wide to the research, manufacture and marketing of medicinal products to treat rare disorders."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to express our full support for the proposal for a regulation put forward by the European Commission."
"It responds to a social need and to long-standing requests by patients' groups."
"Incidentally, I believe that those groups deserve special public commendation here and now, in the House, for their excellent support of the parliamentary work we all carry out."
"For his part, Professor Cabrol has prepared an excellent report. We are happy to support its general approach and agree with its main conclusions."
"Nevertheless, we have tabled a number of amendments aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the regulation."
"I should also highlight the fact that there has been an excellent climate of cooperation and agreement amongst all the political groups represented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"In my view, it is important to accept the amendment that allows the committee on orphan medicinal products envisaged in the Commission's proposal to operate under the aegis of the European Agency for the Assessment of Medicines."
"This would lead to increased efficiency whilst the Commission's powers would remain intact."
"It is also important to make adequate financial resources available in the European Union's budget on a regular and permanent basis."
"Amendment No 18, which I tabled, aims to create a fund to promote innovation, Mr Bangemann."
"The intention here is to respond to the demands of efficiency and demands of an ethical nature."
"Once the period of special protection for these orphan medicinal products has elapsed, it is only reasonable that part of the income from them should be used to build up a fund which will continue to support this regulation and new orphan medicinal products. This will in fact provide better treatment and respond to what could be called society's ethical demand for continued operation."
"I urge the Commission to study the operational experience gained in the United States and Japan."
"Our proposal must be in line with our own European identity and the restrictions imposed by Community legislation and our institutions."
"I believe it is workable, though it may be somewhat complicated."
"I hope that the Commission will welcome this idea with the high degree of efficiency we have come to expect of it and I should like to thank the Commission in advance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is just as difficult and costs just as much to find a treatment and develop a medicinal product which will save a few human lives as it does to market a medicinal product which will save millions of lives."
"If we want to do more than simply fight a lot of very common diseases but also help those who suffer from one of the 5 000 identified rare diseases, then we have to give the necessary incentives to the industry."
"And we should not forget that today's rare condition may become tomorrow's far commoner disease."
"So we must encourage research into these rare diseases by assuring investors of a measure of exclusivity and allowing them advantageous tax treatment."
"The regulation is certainly a step in the right direction, but I think the Commission needs to rethink its definition of 'orphan medicinal products'."
"A number of other Members as well as myself have tabled amendments on this."
"Perhaps a compromise amongst the various suggestions can produce a better definition."
"Together with Mrs Dybkjær, I have also tabled an amendment which provides for the industry to be given an extra incentive in the case of a disease which has around three thousand sufferers in Europe."
"We suggest that the pharmaceutical industry should receive six months' additional patent protection for another medicinal product which it places on the market, if it develops a remedy to treat an extremely rare disease."
"I hope a majority of the House will back this amendment, and I would welcome Mr Bangemann's opinion on it."
"Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cabrol, on the excellent work he has done on this subject."
"Secondly, I want to say that I am particularly pleased about the creation of a Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products."
"However, questions may arise as to the composition of this committee, the way it operates, and the real weight it will carry, in other words, at the end of the day, what resources will effectively be made available to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products."
"There is one other point I need to mention. There has been an attempt to float the idea of unreasonable profits."
"I am no fanatical defender of profits for pharmaceutical industry multinationals."
"All the same, I find this idea utterly arbitrary. As regards the planned ten-year period, if there is a review at the end of the fifth year - which seems appropriate - then rather than assess the profits it should check that the therapeutic indications have not been extended and that the prevalence has not changed."
"If these two factors are taken into account our group will vote for this resolution."
"Mr President, there has been no willingness to invest substantially in pharmaceutical research into some 500 diseases, afflicting a limited number of people, or to comply with the existing procedures, because it is well known that the end product - which is subject to various evaluations and must absorb high manufacturing costs - will be of relevance only to the few people who suffer from a rare disease."
"As the United States is now at the forefront of clinical and pharmacological research, it has become a model of contemporary society in several respects. That country has had extremely successful legislation on orphan medicinal products since 1983."
"The EU is now hoping to follow suit, through Professor Cabrol's report."
"No fewer than 837 drugs have been designated 'orphan medicinal products' in the US over the past decade. Research and experimentation on these products - which we are discussing today - has been facilitated in various ways, contributing to the identification and knowledge of previously unknown etiologies and hence their treatments."
"The question is what incentives to offer the industry; the main one offered by the US authorities seems to me to be tax relief, which covers almost 50 % of clinical research."
"Unfortunately, rare diseases are in fact well-known diseases, although their low incidence of morbidity on the population places them in a limbo of unanswered questions."
"We support Professor Cabrol's attempt to get things moving and put the uncertainties behind us."
"Moreover, on the threshold of the third millennium, it is distressing to think of patients being prevented by the market from obtaining appropriate treatments."
"If this society of ours cannot express proper solidarity under such circumstances, then goodbye Europe!"
"Mr President, first of all, and most importantly, I should like to add my strong support for both the Commission proposal and particularly Mr Cabrol's excellent report which is well drafted and pertinent, as his reports always are."
"As my colleague Mrs Marinucci has set out, we, on this side, will maintain our approach taken in committee."
"Providing meaningful incentives to ensure development of products to tackle some of the most debilitating and upsetting conditions in the world is clearly a job for a new kind of innovative, public/private partnership."
"To succeed, progress must be based on epidemiological and economic criteria which have been worked out in the rather difficult passage of these proposals to this stage."
"The Commission has rightly made provisions for unreasonable profit-taking to be avoided."
"Although some within the pharmaceutical sector protest at the very thought that there might be any risk of that, it seems reasonable to myself and many others that the use of public resources and legal support should be absolutely transparent."
"Therefore I hope that Parliament and the Council will vote to maintain the concept as part of the partnership with research and development sectors and will include the practical means for the programme decision-makers to reach fair, just and accurate conclusions which also bear in mind the generic development industry."
"This is an important development in the context of the many exciting advances being made in genetic identification, treatment and, best of all, prevention of diseases."
"Some of this work I saw for myself just last week in my own region."
"Together with the forthcoming programme on rare diseases, plus what I hope will prove an effective new framework for public health policy over the next five years, this initiative offers realistic new hope to those who suffer pain and misery."
"Credit is therefore due to all those who have worked so hard to bring this proposal before us today."
"Now it is up to all of us to take responsibility for ensuring its future success on behalf of those patients who suffer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present proposal for a regulation is certainly to be welcomed."
"The hopes of many patients suffering from rare diseases rely on our obtaining a regulation on orphan drugs in Europe too as soon as possible."
"We should be guided by the experiences of the USA and Japan."
"We should also learn from experience."
"In that sense, Mr Cabrol's report proposes a series of improvements to the Commission proposal, although I do have problems with some of the proposed amendments."
"I believe it is most important that we also include tropical diseases in Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"It is important for Europe to look further than the end of its own nose and also to consider people suffering from tropical diseases."
"That is not necessarily the case under this regulation, but we must create an instrument to do so very quickly."
"I have problems with the amendments that impose additional obstacles on industry in regard to obtaining orphan drug status for a particular medicine."
"This applies, for instance, to Amendment No 18, on which I would be interested to hear the Commission's view."
"My impression is that if we siphon off the revenue obtained by industry after the ten-year period, that will in turn reduce the incentive to invest in the first place and I would be interested to know whether things really work in the USA in the way suggested in that amendment."
"Personally I doubt it."
"Finally, I want to raise the question of diagnosis, which we have already had occasion to consider in committee."
"I believe I can say from my own experience that particularly in the case of genetically-related diseases - which after all means most of the rare diseases - the patients are waiting for prevention and treatment while we, if we only have diagnosis but no corresponding prevention or treatment, sometimes actually produce problems."
"That is why I personally am in favour of giving priority to treatment and only supporting diagnosis if treatment or prevention are also available."
"For the rest, however, we should certainly support Mr Cabrol's report and the proposal for a regulation and should not jeopardise the entire project by quarrelling about details."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a German proverb that fits the bill in the EU as regards orphan drugs. It goes as follows: if you go on long enough, it will be alright in the end."
"It took the Commission long enough to present a proposal for a European orphan drug act."
"What I expect of this regulation is that it will provide a strong incentive for the development of these medicines and therefore for research into molecular biology."
"Unfortunately, the Commission felt it was unable to follow the US model in regard to providing additional tax relief, tax relief at least in the sense of definite recommendations for action on the part of the Member States."
"I would certainly be interested to know whether the Commission sees any possibility of doing so."
"But experiences in the USA show that tax advantages offer the most effective stimulus for investment in orphan drug development."
"In general terms, the reasons for EU-wide tax harmonisation are accumulating by the day and the orphan drug regulation is another reason."
"It would also be a good idea to set up a special fund for additional support for the development of these medicines."
"There are no bounds to what we could imagine here, even if a certain amount of state dirigisme is required to achieve our aims."
"Mr President, we are very happy about the very positive response to our proposal."
"The rapporteur has done much towards achieving this, thanks to his very careful work."
"Since we are now at first reading, I will not go into all the amendments tabled. Instead, I will take up the most important ones that were raised during the discussion and explain why the Commission does not regard some of them as very useful."
"First of all, everyone realises - and this became clear during the discussion - that we need this proposal because market mechanisms alone cannot produce useful results in the cases we are dealing with here, the so-called orphan drugs."
"And that is perfectly understandable."
"The fact is that research in particular is becoming increasingly expensive and if by definition this expenditure cannot be recouped at all, then of course nobody working in the private sector can be expected to take it on board."
"For the rest, we have been trying for many years to control and counter this situation."
"It is not the case that nothing has been done in past years."
"We have made quite substantial funds available for research in these areas in the research programmes, in the third and fourth framework programmes of research."
"The fact that we are only now proposing this regulation - I believe the American legislation has existed since 1983 - does not mean that we have done nothing since then."
"But it is clear that with the experience we have gained from America we can perhaps present an improved proposal now."
"The problem is easy to describe."
"Since there are no economic incentives, we have to compensate for this."
"Of course we can do so directly through support for research, and we shall continue to do so in future."
"Even more emphasis has been put on this kind of research in the fifth framework programme."
"In that respect the situation there has not changed, and if it has, only for the good."
"But we also want to create a range of additional incentives, for instance through the ten-year market exclusivity right."
"This kind of market exclusivity right does of course offer an additional opportunity to make profits, but since this market is by definition very small, nobody can in fact count on making enormous profits."
"On the contrary, the opportunities to do so will be fairly restricted."
"Nevertheless, these ten years are a key element and cornerstone of our system of incentives for research and development in the area of orphan drugs, which indeed are also found in a very similar form in the other existing legislation."
"We cannot propose any tax relief, at least not at this stage, because it is not up to us to decide this. The Member States would have to do so."
"At this point we want to wait and see what the effects are of these experiences."
"Tax relief is always a very convenient way of creating incentives."
"Here we have a whole range of options that are at least equally effective."
"Access to the centralised procedure, in particular reduction of the fees - and here I agree with Mrs Heinisch - is of crucial importance to small and medium-sized enterprises, who often complain of these fees."
"The fees can be waived in part or in whole."
"The Agency in London can also be of assistance in developing a protocol for trials and we believe this can certainly lead to useful support."
"I am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee, during the debate."
"We believe that this is such a specialised problem that we need this kind of committee and cannot and should not use the committees normally available."
"We have proposed two kinds of criteria."
"Of course you can always try to formulate others."
"But then you must remember the aim of our proposal."
"We want to support research."
"We want to make it more attractive, which is why we believe that the right criteria are epidemiological criteria, because they are objective and in particular because they can easily be applied at an early stage of product development."
"There are problems with economic criteria."
"Forecasts and projections can hardly be made before the expiry of the ten-year period."
"Of course we would have to call for considerable transparency on the part of the undertakings, which they are not always prepared to agree to, in order to be able to make these forecasts and projections."
"As I said, we are at first reading."
"Let me begin by telling you which amendments we can accept."
"There is a whole series of them: Nos 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 29, 32, 38 and 9 in part."
"Then I want to make a few comments on the amendments we cannot accept, beginning with No 6, which sets out an additional economic criterion."
"I already said that it is not very attractive, it makes the whole trial procedure more difficult and after all we have learned from the American experience."
"The USA had a similar criterion, which did not prove successful."
"It did not work."
"That is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult."
"That is why we do not want to accept that amendment."
"I will now look at the second group, concerning diagnosis, namely Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41 and 42."
"They all aim to exclude medicines for diagnostic purposes where no procedure exists for the treatment or prevention of the disease to be diagnosed."
"That could mean that we were preventing access to diagnosis, with the result that no appropriate treatment could be developed."
"We believe that is a risk we should not necessarily take on."
"Then we come to the question of the fund, which has also been raised during the debate."
"It concerns Amendment No 18."
"In our view, the idea of a special fund that could be set up from the proceeds from the sale of orphan drugs following the expiry of the ten-year period of market exclusivity could reduce the potential interest of undertakings, which would mean that we would still not have enough resources available in the fund, because the proceeds would not be enormous."
"For by definition an orphan drug is precisely a drug that offers very limited prospects of making a profit."
"I will turn now to the measures for tropical diseases, which have also been mentioned."
"Of course we support the view that specific measures to support research in developing countries are useful."
"But we do not take the view that including a corresponding reference to this in a recital can produce that result."
"It would mean that, as unfortunately happens so often when we submit a detailed proposal, its scope is broadened because people want to take the opportunity to include a whole lot of other problems."
"But that is not a very logical way to make legislation."
"That is why we hope we can come back to this question of tropical diseases."
"For the rest we can say that research into and consideration of tropical diseases is traditionally in the very best hands in the European Union."
"It is not the case that we have not lived up to our obligations here to date."
"But if Parliament so wishes, we can of course take another look at the question of how we can further improve this specific area of research into pharmaceutical products."
"Mr President, may I have an answer from Mr Bangemann to the question I asked concerning his thoughts on Amendment No 30 which I have tabled with Mrs Dybkjær."
"This asks for a pharmaceutical company to be given an additional or extended period of six months' protection on a patent if it develops an orphan medicinal product - in other words, a further six months' protection for another product already introduced or marketed."
"I did not go into this matter directly."
"As I already said, this is the first reading."
"That is why I did not want to go into all the amendments."
"That is more or less the same argument I put forward in regard to tax relief and against the fund in general."
"I have already spoken against the fund."
"If additional patent protection is to be introduced, for instance in the event of the development of treatments or of the returns flowing back into a special fund, we would virtually be precluding competition from generic drugs."
"After all, that is what always happens."
"Once a medicinal product has been developed, researched and authorised, the ten-year market exclusivity, which can in addition become a patent protection period, applies in all cases and the result is that during that period of protection no generic drugs can come onto the market."
"But if this period were further extended, that would have adverse effects."
"For generic drugs at the end of a patent or other protection period are of course useful."
"They may have additional effects, but at any rate they tend to be a little cheaper."
"That is why we do not regard this amendment as useful, because it would preclude the supply of generic drugs once the protection period has expired."
"In our view that cannot be the purpose of the proposal."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Electromagnetic fields"
"The next item is the report (A4-0101/99) by Mr Tamino, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields 0 Hz - 300 GHz (COM(98)0268 - C4-0427/98-98/0166(CNS))."
"Mr President, no one can have missed all the press coverage of electromagnetic pollution over the past few years; public opinion is very alive to this issue."
"The reason why electromagnetic pollution is currently attracting public attention is that, unlike other forms of pollution, it cannot be seen and does not smell."
"People are not aware of it; they can just see appliances which could be the cause of such pollution."
"It was established 20 years ago, thanks to the work of Nancy Wertheimer in Colorado, that electromagnetic fields could have not only direct effects, causing damage due to heating - acute thermal effects, as they are called - but also long-term effects, leading to leukaemia and cancer."
"It was partly because of these concerns that, during the last parliamentary term, Messrs Vernier, Santos and Pimenta tabled a resolution which then became the report by Mr Lannoye, adopted on 5 May 1994."
"Parliament established certain facts in that report, including the need to apply the precautionary principle to EMF effects on the population."
"In response to Parliament's report, the Commission saw fit to present a recommendation - now under discussion - concerning the entire radiation spectrum from 0 Hz to 300 Ghz."
"As was pointed out in our Environment Committee, this recommendation lays down limits for acute thermal effects only."
"With regard to long-term non-thermal effects, however, it is considered on the basis of opinions from certain international bodies that there is insufficient evidence to lay down limits for such exposure."
"Clearly, in a formal sense, most of the evidence could be said to prove incontrovertibly that electromagnetic fields cause thermal effects; after all, everyone knows that microwave ovens are used for heating food."
"But as regards long-term effects, the current wide-ranging debate has brought to light many scientific investigations, some epidemiological and others related specifically to cells and tissue, in vitro as well as in vivo , which indicate a probable EMF effect on cellular connections."
"This could cause the epidemiological effects which have resulted in leukaemia and cancer, as well as several other forms of long-term damage, such as nervous disorders, amnesia and so on."
"The public is concerned not only about fixed installations such as electricity transmission lines, television transmitters and mobile phone antennas, but also about the fact that we are continually in contact with domestic appliances and other devices which emit electromagnetic fields; the best-known one at present is perhaps the mobile phone, currently the subject of much debate."
"For these reasons, Parliament's Environment Committee decided to table various amendments to the Commission recommendation, so as to take long-term effects into account."
"First of all, the committee proposes taking into account the health of workers and consumer protection, by introducing the precautionary principle and the principle that the best available technology should be used so as to keep radiation as low as possible."
"Next, the committee draws attention to the large existing body of scientific documentation on the application of the precautionary principle and, hence, the need to review the data and to keep it under regular review, as well as the need for reporting to the European Parliament."
"It also calls for higher levels of protection in areas where the public spend significant time, and for minimum distances from fixed installations and appliances to be laid down."
"It is however also true to say that the Environment Committee did not come up with any clear or precise data on ways of protecting the public from long-term exposure."
"That concludes my presentation - which is also on behalf of my group - of certain amendments which take account of long-term effects and others, on the basis of the precautionary principle and of safety levels adopted in some countries, such as Italy and Sweden."
"This is the thrust of Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 19, 21 and 22."
"Mr President, this is a recommendation and not a directive."
"As such it may not be transformed into a more serious piece of legislation for some years."
"The main emphasis that Mr Tamino has quite properly laid in his report, which is entirely endorsed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, is that the precautionary principle must apply."
"And here this principle inevitably means scrutiny, scrutiny and scrutiny."
"It is a powerful infant industry we are dealing with, in particular when we consider many of the reservations about mobile telephones."
"We appreciate its economic importance."
"Speaking not only for my group but for the majority of the Committee on the Environment, I can say that we did not think that the levels set by Mr Tamino were practical at this stage."
"They would, in effect, have meant the elimination of many electronic devices which are used in the home, as well as taking a major stand against electricity pylons and the industry as a whole."
"However, we believe that it is absolutely necessary to monitor these devices and the Committee on the Environment's amendments have attempted to set out precisely why and how."
"I will read Amendment No 9 to the House."
"If anything carries the spirit of what Mr Tamino is attempting to do and what we endorse it would be Amendment No 9 as adopted by the Committee on the Environment."
"It says that Member States should 'lay down minimum safety distances from electrical equipment and minimum distances from public buildings, housing and workplaces for the siting of high-voltage transmission lines, radar equipment and broadcasting and rebroadcasting transmitters, including cellular phone base stations and shall set down the recommended safety distances for use'."
"Such recommendations should be 'displayed on the product concerned, paying particular attention - because of the proximity and length of exposure involved - to mobile telephones'."
"These measures have to be taken immediately and the process of monitoring should thereafter be continuous."
"All of us would wish to see by 2001 - not in four or five years' time or ten years' time but within the space of 18 months - a further review of the safety measures used and of these instruments themselves."
"There are widespread public misgivings."
"There are a number of studies now which begin to suggest further cause for concern."
"When we referred this matter to Dr Michael Repacholi who carried out one of the original studies in Australia on the possible inducing of cancer in rats, he said that he believed that the standards now set down on the WHO guidelines were sufficient."
"However, I believe we should further monitor this situation in the interests of the public, consumers and public safety generally."
"We shall adjourn the debate at this point for voting time."
"It will be resumed at 3 p.m."
"VOTES"
"Madam President, Amendment No 1 tabled by the Europe of Nations Group states that 'young people still consider the family as their main reference framework'. I would like to amend this orally to read 'young people still consider the family as part of their main reference framework'."
"Madam President, we have no objection to this oral amendment. We accept it."
"I would just mention that in our amendment we merely followed Mrs Hermange's wording."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Madam President, in yesterday's debate I ended my introduction by asking the Commission to give a clear and firm commitment, before the vote on the legislative proposal, to accept the two paragraphs of our draft legislative resolution."
"First there is the paragraph inviting the Commission to withdraw its proposal."
"We are sorry to hear from Mrs Gradin that Mr Flynn cannot be here, but she has explained that he intended to propose withdrawing the proposal to amend the 1976 directive."
"I do not know whether that formula is to do with the internal organisation of the Commission."
"Is Mr Flynn required to propose withdrawal of the proposal to the Commission, which we know to be a college after all the debates we have had on the subject?"
"If he does so, can we be sure the college will back him? It is very important for us to know that."
"If the Commission had told us it was withdrawing the proposal, that would have been fine."
"But it is telling us it is going to propose - I do not know to whom, to itself, I suppose - to withdraw the proposal to amend the 1976 directive, which we consider dangerous for positive action, and I want to know whether the Commission is effectively going to withdraw this proposal. Is it going to back Mr Flynn?"
"Secondly, ..."
"Mixed reactions"
"I am sorry, but this is very important."
"You may think issues of equal opportunity for men and women do not matter much. Well, I want to point out to the male majority here that they will soon need positive action too, because the professions are becoming more predominantly female."
"In my country there are hardly any male teachers in primary schools and hardly any male magistrates left."
"So positive action is not just for women. It is for under-represented sexes and you will soon be an under-represented sex."
"So you need to realise that positive action is for you as well."
"Applause"
"Mrs Lulling, I think that Commissioner Pinheiro has heard you loud and clear and that he will be able to enlighten us not on the state of mind of Mr Flynn, but simply as to whether, in accordance with Rule 59, the Commission will or will not withdraw its proposal for a directive."
"I would therefore ask Mr Pinheiro to enlighten us, if he can, on this specific point."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am able to announce that the Commission will be withdrawing its proposal as requested by the Committee on Women's Rights."
"I am also able to tell you that my colleague, Mr Flynn, intends to legislate under Article 141 and will obviously do so in a spirit of greater cooperation with the European Parliament."
"Madam President, in that case we will trust the Commission to withdraw its proposal and put forward a proposal for a directive on the basis of Article 141."
"Mrs Gradin still had some qualms and reservations but we now think this proposal for a directive will come to us on the basis of Article 141."
"I can therefore propose that Parliament vote not on the three articles, but on the draft legislative resolution as a whole."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"Madam President, in the Swedish version of Amendment No 4 there is an unfortunate mistake."
"It reads 'uppmanar medlemsstaterna att ... under vissa omständigheter ... '"
"We have requested that these last three words 'under certain conditions' should be deleted."
"It is therefore very odd that the original text has been retained in this amendment."
"I would like to draw this to the attention of all Swedish Members."
"We shall see."
"If the amendment is adopted, then of course we will make the correction."
"We shall take care to do that."
"Madam President, this is very important."
"The French text states that Parliament calls on the Member States to legalise induced abortion 'under certain conditions', and we are asking for a separate vote on the phrase 'under certain conditions'."
"The English text has 'in certain circumstances', which is quite different."
"There is a difference between 'in certain circumstances' and 'under certain conditions'."
"The authentic text is 'under certain conditions'."
"That needs to be made very clear."
"Obviously we do not want to legalise abortion wholesale, without conditions, at least not in my group."
"So it has to be 'under certain conditions'."
"Normally, the version deemed authentic is that in the language of the rapporteur, who is Mrs Hautala, unless she drew up her original text in a language other than Finnish."
"We shall of course carry out a check, when the vote has taken place, so that everything is brought into line with the original text."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"We have voted against the report for the following reasons:"
"1.Negotiations between the governments on the reform of agricultural policy are still in progress and will be resumed today."
"There is no reason for Parliament to comment on individual sections of agricultural policy in the current situation.2.Special decisions which benefit some Members States pose a threat to the reform process as a whole.3.Parliament should not make pronouncements on increased assistance for some countries when the objective is to lessen the heavy burden imposed on the Union's agricultural policy."
"In this report, the rapporteur describes the future harmonisation of taxes and tax systems."
"Through this explanation of vote, we wish to make it clear that taxation is a national responsibility and therefore does not come within the EU's field of competence."
"Members of the Europe of Nations Group are particularly interested in small and medium-sized enterprises. They are a central factor in development and the keystone of employment in European Union countries."
"In the European Union 99 % of companies have fewer than 250 employees and they represent 66 % of total employment."
"Almost all of them contributed to net job creation during the period 1988-1995."
"At some stage in their development all SMEs experience problems arising from their weak capital resources. So risk capital needs to be developed."
"If we take the United States as an example, of seven million jobs created in that country between 1991 and 1995, six million were the result of new SMEs starting up."
"Some of them have become large companies, even world leaders, in the high-technology sector."
"In the United States it is easy for an SME to obtain access to risk capital."
"Things are very different today in European Union countries, where SMEs with competitive advantages in terms of high technology are penalised in this respect."
"So entrepreneurs must be able to access start-up capital, then intermediate and development capital as the company expands, and, finally, they must be able to access institutional and private investors supported by a sizeable European financial market."
"At Community level, the absence of legislation on venture capital funds is an obstacle to the operation of the market."
"Existing Community financial regulations are too fragmented and are lacking in terms of both readability and consistency."
"We might do well here to draw on the experience of the United States, which created a national control body - the Security and Exchange Commission - by establishing a regulatory body responsible for harmonising the provisions of national regulations so as to allow secondary financial markets to develop."
"In addition to the finance that venture capitalists can mobilise, there is also a vital need for mentorship in terms of management."
"Finance and mentorship should go hand in hand."
"A simple but effective way for the investor to reduce risk is to be directly or indirectly involved in the daily management of his or her investment and to give the entrepreneur real support."
"But the Europe of Nations Group would like to highlight the contradiction we face."
"We are all aware of the role of SMEs, and we often boast of their economic success and the major role they play in creating jobs, but when we are dealing with environmental standards, technical standards and administrative measures, the majority in our Parliament does not pay enough attention to the concerns of entrepreneurs and their special responsibilities."
"Entrepreneurs take major risks with few guarantees, either in terms of welfare payments and or in terms of retaining their family property."
"A long process of contacts and consultations with the arts world in a good many European countries (not just the 15 Member States) is coming to a close."
"The ground had barely been explored previously."
"Not even the Member States seem to be aware of the potential contribution by their artists to their own quality of life and nor do the artists themselves seem eager to emerge from their own circles and discover other practices and other countries."
"Not only are the various national laws on the status of artists diverse and incomplete, but also the Member States have not made the slightest effort to work together to make it easier for artists, their works and productions to circulate."
"At least now an attempt has been made to pinpoint the problems and outline possible approaches for political action in the future."
"By taking the initiative to produce this report, the Committee on Culture set out to equip the European institutions - at the vital moment of enlargement and the definition of a new political and financial framework - with a political instrument that will have a huge impact if only they know how to use it."
"An ongoing coordinated policy supporting and promoting artistic creation and education may be the missing factor needed by European society to make the leap into the 21st century."
"The fight against violence and exclusion relies upon it."
"This report by Mrs Guinebertière, as amended by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, lays the foundations of a genuine integrated and comprehensive youth policy."
"Community cooperation policy for youth has undeniably achieved a great deal in terms of education, vocational training and exchanges through the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes (and we should add the European voluntary service initiative to that). But these achievements are still not enough to meet the specific needs of young people."
"Highlighting the need for education and training for all, however essential that may be, is not sufficient to create a youth policy."
"Complementary issues need to be considered, such as creativity, civic education, learning about tolerance and democracy, health and housing."
"Our rapporteur sets out these objectives very clearly, while respecting the necessary complementarity and added value that Europe brings to the 'plinth' formed by the Member States."
"Hence her appeal to the Member States to draw up 'national plans for young people', similar to those they drew up for employment."
"The Commission's role, after evaluating the national youth policies, is to disseminate information about best practice and the most successful examples within the European Union."
"All of this can assist the creation of innovative projects, by and for young people, and encourage young people's spirit of enterprise."
"Youth policy at Union level must be designed to pay greater attention to young people and involve them more in decisions through youth groups. I will therefore be voting for this report, which gives us an overall view of what that European policy might be at the dawn of the 21st century."
"Madam President, I voted against the Hautala report, or rather against all the amendments except those tabled by the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, out of inner conviction."
"As Christians we cannot pronounce against life and the unborn child is just as alive as the child that has been born."
"This is something we find quite simply intolerable, which is why I voted against out of my innermost conviction."
"Today we are in the minority."
"Perhaps we will be in the majority one day, for in the long term this situation will be a great disaster for our population."
"Let me also say that I am not against women, for whom I have infinite respect."
"I have seven children and 18 grandchildren."
"So you can imagine how much I respect my wife. All I want to say here is that this is precisely why I voted against the Hautala report."
"Madam President, there are many aspects of this report which I support because it addresses serious problems in relation to women's health."
"However, I cannot support the reference to abortion."
"The European Union has absolutely no competence in this area."
"It cannot interfere in the policy of individual Member States in this sensitive area, nor, I believe, would it wish to do so."
"This is formally stated in the Treaties in reference to public policy, which is reserved exclusively for the Member States."
"Member States have an absolute right to legislate in matters of public policy."
"As far as my own personal position is concerned, I have voted in accordance with my own conscience, which is that I am opposed to abortion."
"However, just as I am guided by my own conscience, I do not presume to pass judgement on how other people will act in relation to their own consciences and in very difficult circumstances."
"I have also supported paragraph 10, simply because if one wants to reduce the number of abortions, one should recognise the right of individuals to avail of counselling about sex education, including counselling about responsibilities in relationships and information about contraception."
"I was guided by these particular principles when I voted on this important report."
"Madam President, I greatly regret that the Hautala report was debated yesterday, on International Women's Day, because I do not believe it really contributes to the dignity and honour of women; it is in fact a disgrace."
"It is surely rather curious for a report on women's health to call for the alleged right to abortion."
"For me, health policy means saving lives and not destroying them."
"If a report on women's health does refer to abortion in the first place, then in my view there should also be some discussion of the effects of post-abortion syndrome."
"But the harmful psychological effects that abortions have on women are deliberately and constantly concealed."
"Pregnancy is not an illness!"
"It is absurd to posit a so-called women's right to go against the right to life, which applies to everyone."
"Demands of this kind abuse the dignity of women and create a culture of death, which in the final analysis rebounds against women and harms them."
"For these reasons I had to vote against the Hautala report."
"This excellent report throws some more light on gender-related health issues."
"Furthermore, the report contains a number of specific ideas which should lead to a breakthrough as regards the status of gender in health."
"However, there is one issue, outlined in paragraph 11, which clearly detracts from the report's otherwise good intentions."
"Entitlement to free abortions equates with women having the right to manage their lives and make decisions about their own bodies."
"It should always be the woman's choice as to whether she wishes to terminate her pregnancy."
"Every day, 500 women die from the complications that arise as a result of illegal and risky abortions."
"The only way to deal with the problem is to give women access to contraceptives and safe, legal abortions."
"In our view, the right to free abortions should be unconditional."
"Generally speaking, we think that Mrs Hautala's report on the state of women's health is a good one."
"It points out some of the illnesses faced by women and also puts forward some proposals about how certain policies could be adapted so that consideration is given to women's special needs."
"However, we have problems with some parts of the report, for example the sections where the Commission is called upon to ensure that regular check-ups for breast and uterine cancer are free and repeated at intervals, where attention is drawn to the benefits and side-effects of hormone replacement therapy in connection with menstruation problems, and where the demand is made for the sexual rights of women to be safeguarded."
"We believe that these are matters which should be dealt with by the Member States."
"However, we can fully support these measures, as long as they are carried out at national level."
"On the basis of the above considerations, we have decided not to vote against the report."
"By means of the Hautala report the European Parliament has expressed its legitimate interest in the state of women's health in the Community."
"Given the stresses of contemporary society and the increasing responsibilities women rightly have within it, it is important to recognise in this way the specific health problems women are facing, or are liable to face."
"Unfortunately, the Committee on Women's Rights and the European Parliament thought fit to include abortion in the list of problems."
"In chairing the meeting, Mrs Fontaine herself recognised that this was a 'sensitive' issue."
"Is it right that the life of a child in its mother's womb should be dealt with surreptitiously, as one point among so many others, in a report examined between a request for waiver of immunity and a communication from the Commission?"
"There is no easy answer to the painful issue of abortion."
"Respect for all life should make us act responsibly when faced with the distress some mothers suffer, as well as welcoming life which only women have the joy of giving, though not without the intervention of a man; this is a fact that we must unfortunately point out, since the affirmation of women's rights can lead to the rights - and duties - of fathers being overlooked."
"At any rate, this subject should at least be dealt with more objectively and seriously than has been the case today."
"Finally, I am sorry to find some on the left applauding this text, just as they applaud the liberalisation of the 'drug market' or the recognition of euthanasia, seeing this as progress in our society while in fact only a terrible culture of death is gaining ground."
"I am equally sorry to find some on the right again showing disdain for convictions so often proclaimed ... in the corridors."
"What emerges from Mrs Hautala's report is that men and women are not equal when it comes to illness."
"This means a specific health policy for each sex is absolutely essential."
"That can only be a source of satisfaction. The European Commission must continue to forge ahead, paying special attention to the problem of women's health in its new action programme on health."
"Some health problems concern only, or mainly, women."
"Specific measures are therefore needed."
"I would also like to highlight the new eating disorders which are wreaking havoc among adolescents."
"It is deplorable that the European Commission's report does not give them higher priority."
"Women live five years longer than men on average and are more affected by physical and psychological problems linked to ageing."
"As a member of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I would like to mention that the fifth framework programme provides funding for research to meet the challenge of ageing population."
"Finally, we must take account of the fact that unemployment, which is more frequent amongst women, job insecurity and poor social security cover have repercussions on women's health."
"It is well known that health care is virtually a luxury for people with limited means."
"That is absolutely intolerable."
"So we must implement a global approach that includes both a specific health policy for women and employment and social security policies which incorporate a health dimension."
"I will conclude by giving the rapporteur my full support on making domestic violence against women a criminal offence."
"We naturally welcome the fact that the Commission has chosen the state of women's health as the subject of its first specific report."
"Too often, in fact, the issue of health is approached globally, disregarding the specific needs of each sex."
"So I fully support the demand for regular assessment of the gender impact in all health budgets, programmes and projects."
"I think it is particularly important to emphasise how much the state of women's health may depend not on the specific physiology of their sex but on socio-economic disparities that are objectively quantifiable and verifiable. Member States need to recognise this and remedy the situation by means of appropriate policies and measures."
"Domestic violence - including marital rape and sexual mutilation - also constitutes a particularly worrying attack on women's health and we need to put maximum effort into combating it."
"In fact this must be a fundamental dimension of Community-funded campaigns for combating violence against women."
"In the same spirit, I share the rapporteur's conviction that Member States must implement all necessary measures, including criminal prosecution, to eradicate this evil and help the women who are victims of it."
"In conclusion, and more generally, I want to stress the importance of prevention as a means of fighting early deterioration of health in general, and the consequent importance of the kind of society we want for ourselves and our children."
"As a Danish Conservative, I have abstained from voting on this report because in principle I take the view that the subject primarily concerns matters which should be decided by each of the Member States individually."
"If the principle of subsidiarity is to have any meaning, it must be applied to matters of this nature."
"I am thinking here, amongst other things, of issues such as the law on abortion."
"Every woman should have the right to decide under national legislation."
"It is the women themselves who should decide whether or not to have an abortion."
"The rapporteur starts by observing that the Beijing Conference, the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission communication of February 1996, the Luxembourg European Council in 1997 and the Cardiff summit in June 1998 have all stressed the need to ensure equal opportunities for men and women."
"This involves bringing about fundamental changes of both an external and internal nature to and in the existing institutions. 'Quite simply, what is involved is a power struggle."
"A redistribution which is as difficult for those with power to accept as the struggle to redistribute economic resources from the haves to the have-nots.'"
"This objective requires a comprehensive approach to policy making and the mobilisation of all policy actors."
"It involves a systematic rather than an individual approach, which is why the rapporteur is calling on the Commission to develop an evaluation method to identify the impact of all Community policies and measures on gender equality."
"She also asks for gender relevant statistics and for the Member States to act in a similar manner."
"The rapporteur also calls on the Commission to identify the circumstances and reasons why, for equal work, women are valued lower than men in terms of pay."
"In addition, she gives specific examples of how to promote gender equality in various policy fields, in particular by setting aside a percentage of the Structural Funds for measures specifically for women or by treating social services which provide child care and care for the elderly as infrastructural requirements."
"Similarly, in public contracting, tenders should indicate how many jobs per year the project will create and how these jobs will be divided between women and men, and so on."
"Finally, the rapporteur calls for a working party to be set up between Parliament and the Commission to promote the objective of equality in all spheres of activity of the institutions."
"There are therefore plenty of reasons to vote for this report."
"Mrs Eriksson's report is intended to follow up the communication on 'Incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities'."
"As may be expected, this involves underlining the current shortcomings and the subsequent requirements."
"The rapporteur's requests include the following: an evaluation method to identify the impact of the measures taken; the implementation by the Member States of the recommendation on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process; the identification by the Commission of the reasons why women with equivalent qualifications are valued lower than men in terms of pay, and the setting up of a working party between Parliament and the Commission to promote the objective of equality between women and men in all spheres of activity of the institutions."
"Mrs Lulling's report on the 'proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions' is radical, and rightly so."
"It rejects the Commission proposal which is based on the European Court of Justice ruling on the Kalanke case and it calls for a new proposal for a directive based instead on the Treaty of Amsterdam and on recognition of the collective nature of the positive action measures needed in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for men and women."
"On the basis of the Kalanke and Marschall rulings, the rapporteur rightly concludes that 'only rigid, inflexible and automatic positive discrimination granting the absolute and unconditional right to appoint or promote women where they are under-represented would be incompatible with Community law'."
"She consequently calls on the Commission to await the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam which requires the Community to eliminate all inequalities and to promote equality between men and women and which allows Member States to maintain and adopt positive action measures in favour of the under-represented sex."
"The Commission must withdraw its now outdated proposal and present a new directive which clearly must be based on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Only constant vigilance on our part to ensure that our equality requirements become reality will allow us to fight against the ever-prevalent spirit of conservatism."
"To a certain extent, ensuring equal opportunities for men and women is like trying to attain the unattainable."
"However, equal opportunities cannot just remain an ideal but must become an objective which must be achieved."
"In this respect, we welcome the fact that this objective was incorporated into the European employment strategy, as agreed in Luxembourg in November 1997, and that the Vienna European Council called on the Member States to make tangible progress on this issue."
"We clearly have a long way to go to achieve real equality as so many sexist prejudices and attitudes are still so ingrained in us and in our actions that we are not even aware of their profoundly discriminatory nature."
"Without underestimating the extent and difficulty of an evaluation task which is uniquely complicated by the diversity of our cultures and traditions, I share the rapporteur's belief that the Commission must strive to define accurate indicators and common criteria which will enable the progress made in equal opportunities to be regularly evaluated."
"This work must be based on specific objectives and clear and predefined accountability mechanisms."
"To change society is an ambitious objective and we must therefore firstly make sure that our own 'house' is in order."
"This is why I totally support the rapporteur's proposal calling on Parliament and its political groups to take certain initiatives to effectively promote genuine equal opportunities for men and women within the European Parliament."
"Yesterday was International Women's Day."
"We all know that the future of society depends on women and so everyone is in favour of equality, parity and justice."
"The situation in India is appalling as 50 million women are missing because they are eliminated right from the stage of conception."
"Yet this legitimate defence of dignity, equality and freedom is hypocritical!"
"How can Europe allow the immigration of Jews, Muslims and those with diminished legal status while defending the rights of women enslaved by countries, religions and 'civilisations' supported by us?"
"In Belgrade, we are threatening to bomb a people who refuse to hand over the region of Kosovo to a culture which practises concealment and confinement."
"In Baghdad, we are bombing a secular people where the women teach and work, and yet we are supporting the interests of countries where women are veiled, confined and demeaned."
"You should realise that the defence of women is simply rhetoric when not confirmed by the facts."
"But it gets worse."
"Are we really sure that blatant injustice is based on gender rather than society?"
"Are women marginalised because they are women or because they are members of a disadvantaged social group?"
"When Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister of India, it is well known that women were not victimised among the Brahmins."
"It was among the poor, the untouchables and the working class that women were victimised."
"This is the cynical part of the Left's feminist rhetoric as it uses gender to classify discriminations which are actually social."
"It is not because she is a woman that the female worker in the textile industry is in a sorry situation, it is because she is working class."
"What is appalling is not so much that the number of women in parliament is small but that the number of working-class women, female employees, women who are socially of low birth and women of modest income is played down."
"Where is the progress in replacing a male MP from the upper middle classes with his privileged wife, sister or daughter?"
"This is even more pertinent given that those supervising the political leadership will always replace elected males from modest backgrounds with elected females from privileged backgrounds."
"What a deception the Left is practising!"
"It is forgetting its working-class roots."
"It is forgetting the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalised in order to protect one more advantage of the social category which already has everything, even a clear conscience."
"We have already had to suffer the anti-racist rhetoric which would have us believe that social discrimination is based on colour. In fact, the basis of racism is social."
"The top universities, the highest circles, the magical places of power are not closed to blacks or to women, but to the poor."
"From now on we will have to suffer even more of the anti-patriarchal rhetoric of Mrs Eriksson in particular and of the Scandinavians in general or of Swedes."
"It was in Sweden under a Socialist government that 60 000 women from modest backgrounds were sterilised."
"The descendants of that government are here today claiming to be defenders of freedom and dignity."
"The revolution in our societies will not occur by changing the sexual order as this is only a reflection of other greater inequalities."
"Now and in the future, the revolution to prevent actions which injure, humiliate and destroy will occur by changing the social inequalities which Europe has simply aggravated."
"The fate of the poorest, of those at the bottom of the wage, income and asset scales, still depends on the goodwill of those at the top of the tree."
"This is what is appalling and this is what feminism, like anti-racism, makes us forget."
"It is clearly not by chance that feminists and anti-racists are by profession from the privileged classes."
"Agenda"
"Ladies and gentlemen, would you agree to bringing forward the Commission statement on bananas to this afternoon, and taking it before the Haug report? That would enable us to benefit from the presence of Sir Leon Brittan."
"Parliament approved this proposal"
"Madam President, in an atmosphere of general confusion you proposed bringing forward the report to enable Sir Leon Brittan to attend."
"This has been approved."
"However, this means that Mrs Haug's report, on which I and Mr Fabre-Aubrespy are due to speak, has been postponed until the 9.00 p.m. sitting."
"Unfortunately, tonight we should both be attending a student debate at the Political Studies Institute in Strasbourg."
"In my opinion, the casual manner in which the agenda of this House has been changed is open to criticism as this change was approved in an atmosphere of complete confusion."
"I believe that the students of the Political Studies Institute deserve as much consideration as Sir Leon Brittan."
"I would like this to be recorded in the Minutes."
"Mr Giansily, I would say quite simply that I shared your reservations when I was given this piece of information at the last minute, as you too will have seen."
"Having said that, the only point on which I disagree with you is that I have the impression that there was a very large majority in the House in favour of this proposal, as you are well aware, that Members were not at all confused when they voted, that they understood quite clearly what was involved, and that if this change had been put to the vote before, it would have been unanimously accepted, Mr Giansily, as you well know."
"However, I am very sorry for the inconvenience which may have been caused to some Members who will not be able to speak on the Haug report."
"Once again, I share your feelings, but I cannot agree with you when you say that this was decided in confusion and that Members did not understand what was involved."
"They understood that very well, as you and I both know."
"The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Electromagnetic fields (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0101/99) by Mr Tamino, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields 0 Hz - 300 GHz (COM(98)0268 - C4-0427/98-98/0166(CNS))."
"Mr President, this report is a very important and interesting one."
"In my opinion, the important thing when we discuss legislation at European level are the reports and scientific evidence which underlie this legislation."
"It is very important that the quality of legislation is right."
"We talk about this a great deal in the individual Member States, and we should also be aware of it when we are creating European legislation."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, I would like to say that many of the amendments proposed by the Greens make the Commission's proposal far more restrictive than is necessary."
"I would very much like to know on what kind of scientific evidence the Greens are basing all these amendments."
"If I may take the liberty of referring to my own country, Denmark, where the Anti-Cancer Association has carried out analyses of risks in this area, it has been found that there is no connection between electromagnetic fields and cancer."
"Children and workers at power stations were both studied."
"With children there was a very small risk, and with power station workers there was no risk."
"That was, of course, a Danish study."
"But I fail to see how studies from other countries would justify the requirements being proposed by Mr Tamino."
"I would therefore like to ask the rapporteur, and not least the Commission, what scientific basis there is for these very restrictive demands from the Greens, because if the Greens' amendments are adopted, there would be very serious economic consequences for power stations and, not least, for general consumers."
"The Liberal Group is therefore opposed to the Greens' amendments, and I would ask the Commission on behalf of the Liberal Group what it has to say about the scientific studies to which Mr Tamino refers."
"I must say that on the basis of the national and international studies which have been carried out in this area, I have difficulty in recognising the assertions which have been made."
"Mr President, I on the other hand believe that the report by Mr Tamino is very important as it makes reference to very specific scientific studies, carried out in Sweden and elsewhere, and includes names and a bibliography."
"This is a significant problem that is very familiar to people living in Greece, where we are literally drowning in a sea of television transmitters."
"Just recently hundreds of transmitters for mobile phones were erected in Pefki, which is just outside Athens, and we have high voltage transmission lines and so on."
"We have evidence, Mr President, but we apparently do not have proof."
"However, three Member States have much stricter legislation than what is being called for here."
"We also have the precautionary principle, which we are obliged to implement."
"This is why I believe that, until further studies have been carried out and the facts have been observed further, as Mr Whitehead said, we must abide by the recommendations made by Mr Tamino. There are very significant issues at stake regarding public health on a long term basis."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal for a recommendation on limiting exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields was formulated against the background of increasing public concern over possible links between electromagnetic fields and health problems."
"This is an issue which affects aspects of everyday life."
"The fields concerned are created not only by high voltage lines and broadcasting transmitters but by ordinary household appliances that we are all in regular contact with, such as mobile phones and television screens."
"Naturally there is a need to reassure customers by providing adequate protection from real and proven risks and by keeping them informed."
"What we do not need is irresponsible misinformation and scare tactics."
"The Commission sought to take into consideration all well-founded scientific and experimental evidence in preparing its proposed recommendation."
"The guidelines and exposure proposed by the Commissioner are based on those recently published by the International Convention on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. This is a formally recognised organ of the World Health Organization."
"Thus there is a solid scientific basis for the proposed limit values."
"Furthermore, this WHO body takes the added precaution of incorporating large safety factors into the limit values to public exposure."
"In fact, we are talking about a safety margin at least 50 times lower than the levels for which possible health effects have been established."
"The national authorities in most EU states have already accepted the health basis from which the WHO body derives its guidelines."
"These are enforced in the Member States which ensure compliance by industry and are vigilant in protecting the health of their citizens."
"Mr Tamino's proposals are therefore greatly disproportionate."
"They seek to impose exposure limits which go far beyond what the Commission is proposing and what are scientifically shown to be necessary."
"If such exaggerated proposals were to be approved they would have a serious socio-economic impact with no health benefit."
"Furthermore, the report fails to address the basic problem that there is no common European measurement system."
"This allows different national limits which create barriers to trade and distort a single market."
"The differences in standards have also contributed to public anxieties - consumers wonder why their countries have a different limit to another country."
"My group and I are calling for a European research project aimed at harmonising calculation methodologies."
"Mr President, there seems to be a great deal of confusion in this debate on Mr Tamino's report."
"In particular this is because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and some of our colleagues are proposing to lay down limit values for the distance between certain installations generating electromagnetic fields and people living close by, and also because they consider that the Commission's proposals are acceptable."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission's proposals do not strictly change current practices in any way."
"In actual fact, these proposals endorse the activities of industrial groups which, with regard to the transport and distribution of electricity or telecommunications, are exposing people to significant electromagnetic fields."
"For example, there is a magnetic field of a few micro tesla in a vertical line from a high-voltage power line of 380 000 volts."
"The Commission's proposal fixes a limit value of 100 micro tesla which means that it is endorsing what is already in common practice."
"This is unacceptable because numerous epidemiological studies and several laboratory studies have shown that effects on health involving the nervous, endocrine or immune systems start to be detected from values which are up to 1 000 times smaller."
"Limiting the problem to the appearance of cancer is a simplistic approach which will cause us to make serious mistakes in terms of public health."
"On the basis of what is already occurring today in one of the Member States, namely Italy, we therefore believe that it is possible to recommend much lower limit values, with which Mr Tamino agrees."
"These certainly do not threaten the various current economic activities but they do prevent people being exposed to electromagnetic fields which may endanger their health."
"I therefore propose that everyone thoroughly reviews this dossier in order to avoid falling into the trap of saying that Mr Tamino's proposals would cause excessive economic damage."
"This statement has already been made three or four times but has not been proven by any argument."
"Mr President, electromagnetic fields can be a danger to public health. According to various scientific studies, they can lead to the development of cancerous cells."
"Although the findings of these reports are not totally conclusive, it would be wise for the Commission to take account of the two basic principles of risk prevention: the safeguard principle, that is, avoiding risk in cases of doubt; and the ALARA principle, in other words, that exposure to radiation should be as low as may reasonably be achieved."
"In this context, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a project currently under consideration: the connection of the French and Spanish electricity grids through a high-voltage line of 400 000 volts across the Pyrenees."
"This project was approved at Essen."
"Citizens likely to be affected by the line have been campaigning against it for more than 15 years on account of its environmental impact and the electromagnetic fields that would be generated."
"This is a good opportunity for the Commission to adopt a common sense approach and look for alternative solutions in order to ensure that we have no regrets in the future."
"The Commission needs to establish a common framework to safeguard public health. This should stipulate that minimum safety distances and an environmental impact assessment are essential preconditions for the construction of power lines."
"Mr President, there should be no doubt that the June Movement in general is a great supporter of applying the precautionary principle."
"This means that the consumer should be given the benefit of any doubt, even if there is only a hint of risk in using modern techniques."
"That could quite easily be the case, and GM foods are only one example of it."
"But today we are considering the short-term effects of exposure to radiation from electromagnetic fields."
"The Greens' amendments in the report, on the other hand, concern the long-term effects, and they have not yet been adequately studied."
"We therefore think that the very restrictive advice which would result from supporting the amendments is untenable."
"We cannot get round the fact that electricity is a fundamental cornerstone of modern society."
"It is also clear that all scientists agree that the short-term effects of being exposed to radiation are very small, and to hinder or even prevent the supply and consumption of electricity would be like using cannons to shoot sparrows, as we say in Denmark."
"In this context, I have also stressed the fact that, after extensive research, the Anti-Cancer Association came to the conclusion that it would be quite irresponsible to make people afraid to use various electrical appliances which are part of every household, such as kitchen equipment and shavers."
"One cannot of course rule out the possibility that the long-term effects might be different."
"This is being studied at the moment by the World Health Organisation, and if they should come to a conclusion which reflects Mr Tamino's amendments, then we in the June Movement would of course fully support the amendments which we are rejecting today."
"Mr President, electromagnetic fields are increasingly present in our environment."
"High-voltage power lines, GSM radio transmitters and many domestic appliances are disrupting the natural balance."
"The 1994 Lannoye report demonstrated the harmful effect of these electromagnetic fields on health and in particular the risk of the development of cancers, leukaemias and diseases of the nervous system and brain."
"However, just because scientists do not yet understand the mechanisms of these attacks on the human body, this must not be used as a pretext to stick our heads in the sand."
"On the contrary, we must use the precautionary principle and prohibit or at least limit any equipment, even any technology, which endangers human health."
"The current situation gives the consumer the responsibility of proving that a device is dangerous."
"The burden of proof must be reversed and manufacturers must be required to prove that their goods are harmless."
"A Commissioner said that the best way to validate a product is to place it on the market."
"In the case which concerns us today, major suspicions exist about the harmfulness of these electromagnetic fields to the human body."
"It is therefore high time to act and we must not put off implementing limit values on the effects, whatever they may be, and not just the thermal effects."
"If over the five years since the Lannoye report there has not been enough sufficiently convincing scientific research, this is precisely because some people had much to lose from this."
"In any case, it is scandalous to say that this report would harm industrial development, firstly because this is false and secondly, and in particular, because public health must come before any economic considerations."
"Mr President, with the advent of modern telecommunication systems, the large-scale expansion of electrical and electronic equipment and the proliferation of high-voltage electricity transmission lines, interest in and concerns about the effects of electromagnetic fields have increased considerably over the last few years, amidst repeated calls for measures and standards in this area."
"And yet the precise effects on the organism of exposure to electromagnetic radiation are not known."
"Worrying theories have been put forward on the possible harmful health effects of exposure to artificially produced fields, and a debate is under way concerning the existence of possible long-term effects, first and foremost cancer, and particularly cancer of the blood, leukaemia."
"At the present time, however, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that electromagnetic fields can directly cause cancer."
"In most Member States, the authorities are constantly being questioned about such effects, revealing considerable concern among the public."
"Experiments have proved only that prolonged exposure to high frequencies may cause pathologies."
"As draftsman of the opinion of Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which I chair, on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, I believe that it is crucial for Europe to create a single, coherent body of legislation enabling all the Member States to protect their inhabitants from these potentially harmful effects."
"Such limits should not however exceed the bounds of knowledge and reasonableness, causing severe economic damage both to industry and to employment."
"The recommendation introduces, throughout Europe, a proper level of protection against EMF health effects."
"It is rightly based on well-established health effects, the acute ones, while stating that there is currently no convincing evidence that these fields produce long-term carcinogenic effects; the available data cannot be used as a basis for developing exposure guidelines."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I believe that it is absolutely crucial for further high-level studies to be conducted on long-term exposure, on the one hand so as to protect the public and, on the other, to avoid panic and unemployment."
"Mr President, Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has done some excellent work on this report."
"I have no doubts at all about the rapporteur's well-meaning proposals for limit values, but the committee was unable to accept them on the basis of the facts presented here."
"This in now way implies that the principle of preparedness should not be vital for everyone, for example, in the elimination of the adverse effects of non-ionising radiation."
"The basis here must, however, be the results of research and the WHO recommendations, as well as the principle that the degree of exposure to electromagnetic radiation must be kept as low as is reasonably possible."
"Member States must also introduce minimum values for safe distances from electronic equipment and minimum distances in general which must be complied with in the vicinity of people's homes and places of work."
"This a very new subject area, and research into possible problems and their prevention must continue."
"This will be one of the sections of the Fifth Research and Development Framework Programme."
"Responsibility for the research will lie with the equipment manufacturers as far as product development is concerned, but to ensure impartial results the source material will have to be as broad in scope as possible and independent of any bias on the part of the researchers."
"While there are calls for an increase in research into the possible problems of non-ionising radiation we have to ensure that resources are used effectively in the health sector as a whole."
"There are limited resources for public health and we must see to it that they are exploited effectively. We have to consider what social costs are worth paying so that public health can expect a good return on its investment."
"Assessment of the social costs is the job of politicians, and acquiring information on the possible risks is that of researchers and scientists."
"Politicians have a responsibility in all this."
"Mr President, for some twenty years now there has been research into the effects on health of electromagnetic fields produced by low-frequency electronic equipment and the electrical power network."
"The Commission's estimates of what would be health-endangering values reflect the outcome of the research carried out."
"Certain MEPs, however, have suggested values which are considerable more stringent than the Commission's recommendations, in recognition of the possible health impact."
"This method of investigation, where conclusions are based on vague estimates and the policy is to ignore other research data, cannot have any real meaning."
"Furthermore, we also have to take into account the relationship between the desired recommendations and the tangible effects on health as well as the cost of any action that needs to be taken."
"In recent years one subject of debate that has quickly assumed prominence is the possible effect on people's health of the increasing use of mobile phones."
"Hopefully, we all appreciate the need for a closer study of the effects of these on users, and the possible need to take action when we have some real facts before us."
"I do not believe that anyone wants to start restructuring the electrical power networks in heavily populated areas, preventing the use of mobile phones in cities, or replacing household appliances as a result of possibly unfounded restrictions."
"We must respect the precautionary principle, but excessive caution must be substantiated by the results of research."
"Mr President, most people speaking here today talk about how 'the precautionary principle must be respected, but... '."
"There is a total contradiction there."
"If the precautionary principle is to be respected, then we need to ensure that we have definite evidence that this kind of radiation is not dangerous."
"We do not have that evidence."
"One of the major failings in the Commission's proposal is that it does not take the precautionary approach."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been a complete disaster on this."
"It has completely diluted the rapporteur's proposal."
"It has failed to protect public health and the environment."
"This issue has come up again and again and the Commission has done nothing about it."
"Even Member State governments have done nothing about it."
"In my own country mobile phone masts are erected close to people's houses and right beside schools."
"The central nervous system bioeffects - which the Commission does not refer to - seem to be occurring where mobile phone masts are located close to people's homes."
"There are reports of headaches, sleep disruption and a number of other effects, which are not referred to by the Commission."
"As the rapporteur has pointed out, there is a suggestion that exposure to electromagnetic fields could lead to an increase in occurrences of cancer and other serious threats to human health."
"We need to ensure that the precautionary approach is taken."
"The Commission seems to base its findings on certain research but to ignore other research that is available."
"We need proper research centres to be set up to ensure that the real effects of this kind of non-ionizing radiation are properly examined by independent assessors."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that this is an important matter."
"We obviously have to regulate the amount of radiation that people are exposed to."
"However, it is essential that the rules should be reasonable."
"We cannot have a situation in which a single political group claims a monopoly of the scientific knowledge; instead, we take it for granted that the Environment Committee and the House will do their best to reach a satisfactory decision."
"Electromagnetic fields and their effect on people are subjects that have come up for debate with increasing frequency in recent years."
"In point of fact, we still do not have any precise answers to the questions which they raise."
"We do not know how ordinary electric currents and magnetic fields affect us."
"What we do know, however, is that more and more people are becoming hypersensitive to electricity."
"We should be establishing limit values on a Europe-wide basis, but they should be reasonable as well."
"Sweden has been mentioned in the discussion as one of the countries with satisfactory limit values."
"All I can say about this is that the limit values are well above the levels proposed by Mr Tamino."
"The values are 100 micro tesla in normal daily life and 500 micro tesla in industry and places of work."
"That is substantially different from those proposed by Mr Tamino."
"Mr President, when we talk about radiation damage, we must make distinctions."
"First of all there is low-frequency radiation from high-tension cables and frequencies generated by them."
"All the experience from all the new research carried out by our governments shows that nothing can be proved."
"In Denmark, we have a cancer register in which all cancer cases are recorded, and the central register of persons shows where people live."
"All the 30 000 people who work in the electricity supply industry were examined in a major study carried out in 1998, and no connection was found between their work in the electricity supply industry and cancer."
"The claims that extensive studies have not been carried out are incorrect."
"Then there are mobile telephones."
"More or less everyone in this Parliament uses a mobile telephone, sometimes a great deal, although there are some who believe that mobile telephones are dangerous."
"I agree that not enough research has been done on this question to know whether the vital parts of cells or the basic building-blocks of human life are being destroyed by this radiation."
"Considering how many children in their teens and younger use mobile telephones, it is important that such research is started, so that we can have some specific conclusions."
"However, I am not aware of suggestions that there is any danger from the base stations which are being set up or the DECT stations in supermarkets. And of course no one stands in front of a radar beam or rays from a microwave source."
"These are concentrated rays, but they do not penetrate down to where we usually are."
"Many of the amendments, in other words Nos 14 to 24, are only designed to create unease and are not based on the necessary scientific research."
"Mr President, it is really important that we produce a recommendation for minimum distances from people's homes for mobile phone masts."
"These are proliferating in my own country."
"If, as the companies producing them say, there are no health risks, why should we not have a mandatory health indemnity?"
"The vested interests that produce these should be legally liable for insuring people's health if something goes wrong."
"That is something that we should be considering seriously at European level."
"If they are not dangerous, then there is no risk."
"So why should we not insure people against the problem?"
"A recent conference in Vienna concluded that the biological effects from low-intensity exposure are scientifically established, so it is no longer acceptable for Member State governments or the Commission to say that more research is required before setting standards."
"People deserve to have their health protected and not have the ball kicked into touch for a scientific investigation that may take years."
"Then we will be in the same situation as with the tobacco companies where millions could be paid out to people whose health has been put in danger."
"I am very shocked that my own government has made several attempts to water down EU proposals to regulate emissions of electromagnetic radiation from mobile home masts."
"It is scandalous that these attempts by the Irish delegation to delete clauses are claimed as being in accordance with the precautionary principle."
"There is sufficient evidence to warrant a whole re-think on the health implications of these masts."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak on this issue, which I think everyone agrees is of major public concern."
"In my own country in the last three days there have been front-page articles about the effects of mobile phones and in my local newspapers stories about power lines and their effects on people."
"Some of these reports are alarming and some are worrying and it is not surprising that the public are confused and do not really know what to think."
"So the Commission proposals are very timely."
"We need some form of European-wide action on this issue."
"The approach of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is also very balanced."
"I want to stress two amendments which are important."
"The first deals with the application of the precautionary principle, based on the ALARA proposals from the World Health Organization."
"My second point is that we must keep this under constant review."
"It is not enough to set standards now and then never come back to them."
"People are increasing their mobile phone usage; parents are buying mobile phones for their children; people are switching to mobile phones."
"So I hope the Commission will take into account some of these amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us concerns limiting the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields 0 Hz - 300 GHz, which is the entire spectrum of possible effects. This is no doubt a good approach, but it does not allow for detailed rules at European level so that in my view the subsidiarity principle should be applied in some areas."
"Overall, it is to be welcomed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept the doubtless well-intentioned proposals from the rapporteur, on the grounds I referred to above."
"But well-intentioned does not always mean good."
"Moreover, the rapporteur's proposals could not be justified scientifically - as many speakers have mentioned today - and would in practice have led to low limits that could not have been adhered to."
"Or should we go so far as to get rid of mobile phones and emergency telephones?"
"I do not think that can do us much good."
"Let me raise another point."
"The discussion between experts has shown that laying down safety distances from fixed installations, for example high-voltage transmission lines, is of extremely questionable use in protecting against radiation because, apart from the distance as such, numerous parameters specific to the installation can have quite a determining effect on exposure."
"In the case of electrical devices, laying down minimum safety distances is even more of a problem."
"As a rule the distance between such devices and the public is surely determined by whether they are used as they should be."
"In this case I think it is confusing, unhelpful and inconsistent with the aims of adequate protection against radiation to lay down additional safety distances."
"The situation is different in the case of equipment that is designed to produce fields, such as broadcasting transmitters."
"Here, safety distances can no doubt simplify matters."
"I would ask you to consider this at the vote."
"I have tabled the corresponding amendments."
"Mr President, the Commission would like to begin by warmly thanking the committee and also the rapporteur."
"Of course this is a subject on which opinions can differ, as they do here in the discussion too, for not every individual issue has undergone adequate scientific investigation and been supported by unequivocal findings."
"Nevertheless we wanted to take a first step with our proposal."
"For one thing, there is increasing concern - and that is undoubtedly true - on the part of experts too."
"There is a wide debate, particularly among the public, which is not always very objective but which does of course create doubts in the public mind."
"That is why we believe it is right, given also that the Maastricht Treaty commits us to aim for a high level of public health, to propose a common framework of basic restrictions and reference levels under this recommendation."
"One thing I want to say quite clearly here, since Mrs Riis-Jørgensen also put this question to the Commission - even if she has gone now; indeed it is sadly becoming increasingly common for Members to put questions and then to disappear - is that even if you raise the question of scientific findings, our proposal is based on the recommendations of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection and on the positions of the Commission's Scientific Steering Committee."
"So it is not the case that we have not taken account of these scientific positions."
"I could now discuss all the amendments, but that would be going too far, given also that this is a recommendation."
"But let me say that we can accept in whole or in part Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 13."
"Other amendments go far beyond the recommendation, for instance in assuming that this kind of recommendation also has legal implications, which is not the case."
"By definition a recommendation is addressed to Member States and they may follow it but are not obliged to do so, which means that this kind of recommendation cannot lay down other legal commitments."
"That applies in particular to the question of minimum safety distances."
"Mr Schnellhardt made a few comments on this question that are worth considering."
"But I must say that even if everything he says is right - and basically I have no doubt it is - we cannot lay down any binding minimum safety distances in the recommendation."
"Then there is Amendment No 12."
"We have already made provision for a review system."
"That means that we will of course ourselves draft a report for the Union, on the basis of the Member States' reports, and naturally we will take account of all the new scientific findings as they become known."
"If necessary, the Commission will act at once."
"But it is also certain that we cannot act according to the principle that this is a matter of health and that we must therefore discontinue all our activities, even if that cannot be justified on scientific grounds."
"We cannot proceed according to that kind of principle."
"I am saying this with particular reference to some of the comments made by the Greens."
"If, for instance, we switched off the entire electricity network, I wonder what the public would say to that."
"Heckling"
"I did say 'if'."
"So if we want to proceed in a sensible manner here, we can only do so in the light of and on the basis of scientific findings."
"Any other approach would be arbitrary and not right."
"That could not be justified in a constitutional state!"
"What is called the precautionary principle relates to very restricted exceptional cases in which it allows us to do something when we do not yet have the relevant scientific findings."
"And the Commission does apply that principle."
"For example we introduced very strict limits for baby food, even though there are no scientific findings, because in that case it was justified, even in terms of the expenditure involved, to do something although we did not know whether it was necessary."
"But obviously we cannot make that a general principle."
"If we were to proceed according to this principle, the end results really would be totally absurd."
"And you cannot expect that of the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Public health policy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0082/99) by Mr Needle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the development of public health policy in the European Community (COM(98)0230 - C4-0393/98)."
"Mr President, the development of the European public health policy has now reached a very important stage."
"This welcome Commission communication identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the first framework period, which is now coming to a close, and points to both the challenges and opportunities which can be foreseen, offering a positive and clear new framework."
"This Parliament has a strong reputation for promoting the protection and improvement of public health and, as I will indicate later, we ourselves can still improve."
"Many distinguished Members of this House have been prominent in ensuring that the European Union has a role in health policy, to say nothing of the established and growing part it now plays in research or food safety, environmental policies, for example."
"The first point to make is that the Amsterdam Treaty thoroughly enshrines that role by declaring in the new Article 152 that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities."
"The rest of the article is far from perfect, but provides the basis for some serious work over the next five years."
"How should that work be organised?"
"I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has achieved a broad consensus that the way forward is via clearly focused priorities which offer added value to the work of partners in Member States, agencies such as the World Health Organization, and non-governmental organisations."
"That will require the Council, the Commission and Parliament to do two things at the crucial next stage, when the three newly identified strands of information, rapid response, promotion and prevention are translated into new horizontal action programmes."
"Firstly, it is time for bold thinking."
"The interpretation of the draft Treaty will be vital and, if the benefits of new technologies, skills, knowledge and freedoms are to be realised by European citizens, there will have to be a political and administrative willingness to move forward."
"In this I refer particularly to the need to share information on best practices - we have to be prepared to address common and specific problems transparently and honestly - and to the recent judgments in the European Court of Justice regarding cross-border access to medical products."
"I also have in mind the need to address health factors which are exacerbated by decisions within the EU."
"A great many of our citizens regard the situation whereby we introduce anti-cancer or cardiovascular disease programmes alongside support for tobacco producers to be nonsensical."
"I fear we are going to repeat that error in another report later this week."
"We must work to end that in a sensible way."
"I would ask the Commission today to tell us of its strong support for proposals which are imminent on combating tobacco consumption."
"We also need to make sense of often conflicting information on diets and nutrition - I suspect that is of interest to the Commissioner and myself in particular - and to develop coherent new food policies on that basis."
"That leads to the second requirement, which is one of responsibility."
"At the very time we are seeking these steps forward, the non-governmental organisations which play a leading part in sustaining and nurturing public, professional and political awareness of health issues are being faced with potentially damaging budget cuts."
"It is not acceptable for the budgetary authorities to be so out of step with previously agreed commitments, but it also demonstrates that we must all face up to some tough choices."
"That is why clear and decisive prioritisation of future programmes will be essential, matched by a clear and certain simplified budgetary procedure."
"That is why we not only support the move away from small vertical programmes to horizontal strands but also seek a vastly more integrated approach, based around an identifiable single health directorate so that health truly becomes an integral part of the EU process, at its very heart."
"That means appropriate health impact assessments, starting with the Commission's own programmes, and proportionately more officials with the appropriate expertise, as identified in the excellent study carried out by Parliament's services in support of our well-received public hearing last October."
"It means partnership at all levels to tackle the greatest public needs and health inequalities most effectively, not least in the current process of enlargement of the Union, where a much-needed further Commission text is imminent."
"With its report, Parliament has responded thoroughly, responsibly and with vision to help establish a sound framework for progress."
"In 13 tightly-argued recommendations, we have made a cogent case for a new priority for health as part of a European decade for health, which will truly begin to meet the real needs of our citizens."
"But it is the next step in the new Parliament which will determine whether we have the courage and determination to turn those aims into reality by ensuring the major chronic diseases of this century do not bedevil the next."
"I finish by thanking all those who have contributed to the communication and to the publication of this report and have worked so hard to take EU health policies to this stage from where we can look forward confidently to the road ahead."
"Mr President, one of the hardest things to explain to Europeans, when one meets them privately or at public debates, is that the Community has no real competence over health."
"The public wonder how it can be that a supranational entity, which has equipped itself with a single currency and been extremely successful in securing peace, progress and well-being for its citizens, does not concern itself with health and is confined just to the limited scope offered at long last by the Maastricht Treaty and reinforced by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"As we all know, the Treaty of Rome made no provision at all in this area."
"It is hard to explain."
"It is also hard, on the other hand, to expect countries to surrender sovereignty over their national health systems."
"So what should be done?"
"We must ensure that the limited scope that does exist, in terms of both competence and resources, is harnessed to achieve maximum results in terms of cooperation, information exchanges, identification of best practice, and health education - as has already been done under the various specific programmes and the 1993 framework programme."
"The Commission's presentation of this communication is most timely: in a sense, it establishes a transition between the final phase of that programme and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, when there will be a new framework programme."
"Mr Needle's excellent report makes a series of timely and practical proposals."
"There could be others too, and I believe that this debate should continue outside this House: health researchers and operators should provide the Commission with information and proposals as to how maximum benefit can be drawn from the meagre powers and resources available."
"Yesterday this House discussed a document on women's health; in both that report and this one, we call for separate statistics on and specific programmes for women."
"Finally, for the sake of Europe's women and men, we call for a Community presence in the health arena which offers real protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication on the development of public health in the European Community will probably be the last major health policy issue on which Parliament expresses an opinion before the end of this parliamentary term."
"Mr Needle has produced an excellent and most welcome report, and has made considerable efforts to amend the Commission's text."
"The communication takes stock of what has been done over the past five years, but above all it outlines a new global public health strategy for Europe in the twenty-first century, which will very soon be followed by specific measures, once the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force."
"I would recall that the eight existing health programmes - 'Europe against cancer', AIDS, drug addiction, health monitoring, the epidemiological surveillance network on communicable diseases, and so on - will lapse in or around the year 2000."
"The EU's citizens, who enjoy the advantages of a single market and are about to acquire a single currency, also have a right to a high level of health protection, as stipulated in the new Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"But if this objective is to be attained in practice, public health must stop being the Cinderella of Community policies: it must be funded much more generously than to date."
"Whilst fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity, the Union can do a good deal to improve information in this area, to react rapidly to health threats and, above all, to confront the main causes of diseases through prevention."
"We therefore welcome the rapporteur's suggestion of a single operational unit and enhanced administrative structures within the Commission, in order to equip DG V-F with sufficient staff and resources to manage effectively all aspects of health policy."
"It is crucial, however, that the Commission should present as soon as possible detailed, concrete proposals for the next five years, taking Parliament's wishes into account."
"We very much regret that not all the recommendations contained in the 1993 resolution on health policy after Maastricht were acted on, and that inadequate follow-up was given to three important resolutions adopted almost unanimously by this House in 1996, concerning the European health passport, blood self-sufficiency in the Community and, especially, Alzheimer's disease."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the period 2000-2010 has been declared the European Decade for Health."
"It is our duty to fulfil the expectations of 375 million people who aspire to live in peace and prosperity, but above all in good health."
"Mr President, my compliments to Mr Needle on this excellent report, in which he rightly notes that the Amsterdam Treaty offers new opportunities for greater weight to be given to public health in the European Union."
"The current policy is ripe for review and the financial resources are regrettably very limited."
"The Commission, and I am looking to Mr Bangemann here, must do something about that."
"I am keen to see what initiatives the Commission will take to meet the growing need for public health policy in the early years of the next century."
"As rapporteur on the 1999 budget for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I advocated increasing public health spending to EUR 50 million."
"By way of comparison, that is just 5 % of the total budget for premiums to tobacco growers."
"It is obvious to me that an effective public health policy in Europe is not just a matter of more money. What we have to do is integrate public health aspects more effectively into other areas of policy."
"Take agriculture and transport, two areas where there is much to be gained."
"I do not need to spell it out: BSE, the countless deaths on our roads and the pollution caused by the transport industry have everything to do with public health policy."
"One final point on enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe."
"The public health problems there are huge."
"It will take a great deal to bring their standards of public health up to our own. And their standards have great implications for ours."
"So I hope the Commission will put a good deal of energy into solving the public health problems of Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, my group supports Mr Needle's report because by taking the Treaty of Amsterdam as a starting point to promote a high level of public health protection, it deals with all the issues that are crucial to achieving such protection."
"Funding comes first and foremost, and Agenda 2000 is currently under discussion."
"We do not yet know how European Union funds will be distributed between 2000 and 2006; it remains to be seen how much will eventually be available for the health sector."
"Secondly, cooperation with Member States and with international organisations involved in health protection must be strengthened."
"Thirdly, we need to integrate our health policy with all other European policies."
"The memory of the consequences of a misguided agricultural economic policy, namely the BSE problem, must surely be fresh in all our minds."
"Fourthly, the need for prevention must be emphasised. We must remember that although responsibility for the provision of health care rests with the Member States, the European Union and the Member States can cooperate on issues concerning prevention."
"The European Union is in a position to promote and develop cooperation and information networks at all levels."
"Previous health programmes experienced problems relating to transparency, inadequate assessment and insufficient funding."
"Mr Needle proposes eliminating the shortcomings of previous programmes during what ought to be the decade for health, between 2000 and 2010."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission communication on the development of public health policy in the European Community expresses the Union's concern to increase the competence which it has acquired in this area due to the Maastricht Treaty being ratified and which has been confirmed by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"However, with regard to this public health policy, it is proving somewhat difficult to gain the acceptance of certain principles to which all the Member States should adhere."
"For example, I could mention the European epidemiological monitoring centre which is particularly needed and which my various reports on health have called for over the last four years."
"However, this has encountered resistance from both the Commission and the Council."
"Yet, as indicated by the Commission, this centre would allow us to react rapidly to threats to health."
"The other two principles proposed by the Commission for a future health policy are an improvement in information on public health and effective actions for health promotion and disease prevention."
"These principles and the issues which they raise are genuine problems which the Union must solve in the future."
"Their main priorities will be nutrition, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, Alzheimer's disease and so on."
"In this respect, I must forewarn you about the new scares which might arise due to the progress needed in order to allow this health policy."
"These scares might lead to this progress being blocked as a result of the misuse of the sacrosanct precautionary principle."
"It is true that all progress involves risk."
"This is where we must apply the cost/benefit principle by weighing the advantages against the disadvantages."
"It is only if the disadvantages equal the advantages that we should use the precautionary principle."
"In this respect, public information must be clear and objective without being distorted."
"This is why I must congratulate the rapporteur and this is also why the Commission's communication is an excellent initiative which is along the lines intended by the European Union."
"We will therefore vote in favour of this."
"Mr President, this report gives the European Parliament another opportunity to draw attention to the importance of health policy which, thanks first to the Maastricht Treaty and then to that of Amsterdam, is at last no longer subordinate to economic policies but has its own dignity and independence."
"Not only projects, programmes and research can now be pursued in this area but so can directives, and - thanks to the inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty of the precautionary principle - prevention has become the cornerstone of European health policy."
"This does not however mean in practice that these statements of principle are applied unreservedly."
"Colleagues have already referred to the lack of action over the European health passport, the fact that health funding remains utterly inadequate, and that even after the BSE scare, insufficient attention is being paid to the linkage between health and food."
"In general terms, it can be said that the public is still not being properly informed about health issues, assuming that public health should not be subject to the interests of economic lobbies."
"Regrettably, the opposite was likewise demonstrated in the previous debate on electromagnetic fields."
"Mr President, what we have just heard about public health policy in Europe raises two issues."
"Firstly, we need to take into account all the inhabitants of this continent, both the sick and the healthy."
"The sick must be listened to individually by doctors, which is precisely the latter's role, but they must also be listened to collectively by politicians, particularly through associations for the sick."
"It is AIDS which has taught us these lessons in recent years."
"By bringing these people together we can promote a dialogue between the public authorities, as the responsible authority, the experts, led naturally by the WHO, the medical profession, which must not be forgotten, the NGOs, industry and the trade unions."
"Everyone must have two objectives: firstly, to identify priorities and concentrate resources to combat epidemics which will be accurately identified, and secondly, to fight against inequalities among the people of this continent with regard to the protection of their health."
"Mr President, people in the European Union are amongst the healthiest and longest-lived in the world."
"The Needle report on the European Union's new public health policy seems to ignore this fact completely."
"The Commission notes it, but talks of a large number of 'premature deaths' in Europe."
"What, I ask myself, is premature?"
"In the Commission proposal, the age of 68 is the critical threshold."
"But we are forgetting that elsewhere in the world, life expectancy is far shorter."
"We also have to accept that we are mortal and that European citizens, with or without a European policy on public health, cannot be absolutely sure of surviving past 68."
"I would also make the point that Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty clearly aims merely to complement the public health policies of the Member States."
"Only if there is a clear benefit for Europe as a whole can we make budget funds available, for example to fund the exchange of knowledge of new medicines and therapies and the development of orphan medicinal products."
"I would therefore like to see a limited budget, and I regard a separate directorate-general for public health as unnecessary."
"If we are going to spend more on public health, let us show solidarity and support the public health policies of the Central and Eastern European countries, rather than giving greater priority to health-related obligations, as the rapporteur would like to do."
"Mr President, one of the greatest dangers to our health comes from air pollution."
"Emissions into the atmosphere are catastrophic to health."
"Up to 24 000 people in my country die prematurely each year due to this major hazard."
"Already in Northern Ireland, a product - Soltron - is in use which has had immediate results in combating poisons emitted."
"If we are to make progress as fast as possible in our efforts to improve Community health, we should be creating an incentive for the use of this product in order that a major health gain can be made."
"We must harness the field of science to deliver rapid and affordable solutions today."
"In Northern Ireland it has been discovered by the largest transport operation called Translink that 60 % of black smoke and 40 % of carbon monoxide has been wiped out by using this product."
"This technology is available now."
"It is our duty in the quest for improved public health to put it to use."
"I regret that both my colleagues and myself who met with Commission officials many months ago have not heard from them or seen any action taken."
"Mr President, as has been pointed out, Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam decrees that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in all Community policies."
"The Treaty makes people's health a more binding policy aim than previously, not only at Community but also at national level, and it is important to focus attention on how we can acquire that Community added value, so that it is visible at both Community level and national level."
"I do not intend to repeat the praise that has already been heaped on Mr Needle's excellent report."
"I would like to go a little further and make a few remarks on the fact that public health must be seen from a very broad perspective."
"Of course it is already very broadly based at the present, but it must be said that employment is an important basis too for public health."
"We have discovered from various sets of statistics that unemployment is one reason for deteriorating public health; exclusion in particular, stemming from long-term unemployment, for example, is a clear risk to health."
"We obviously have to act against this, taking advantage of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in which employment was placed at the centre of Community policy."
"Public services, universally available health services and effective social networks are the factors which ensure we have a standard of public health that is as high as possible."
"Furthermore, consumer and environmental policies are extremely important, as is the fact that public health should play a clearer role in the enlargement strategy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Needle has gone to great trouble with the hearing in committee."
"Of course many wishes and desires were voiced about all the things Europe could do."
"Naturally I agree with Mr Needle that we must devote a great deal of attention to health, but unlike many previous speakers I do not believe that this can all be done in Europe"
"I believe that the Member States have a very major responsibility."
"There is a short phrase in one paragraph to the effect that a future revision of the Treaty should provide for greater involvement of the Community in matters relating to health protection."
"In my view only the Member States can take on this responsibility."
"If we keep giving the Community more responsibility, I do not believe, given the relatively restricted apparatus of the Commission, that it will be in a position to accomplish everything the Member States have so far been able to do with their much more extensive administrative resources."
"So I would like to draw attention to a few points I am not happy with."
"At this point I would like to see the EU implement those matters that are referred to in the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty but I would not like it to go beyond that or to call on the Commission to do so either."
"I also think we are not in a position to create equality in health."
"There are very different ideas and considerations on, for instance, cures and treatments."
"I am glad we have these widely different approaches and also that we have freedom of movement."
"After all, the Court of Justice has ruled that people can be treated differently in different countries."
"I want to retain this and would not like to see everything forced into line in Europe."
"I would far rather see the responsibility left with the Member States."
"I also believe that the regional authorities are not all in a position to establish contacts with the Commission."
"I would like to see pilot projects."
"Information can be provided but information campaigns are another difficult matter, as we cannot conduct an information campaign that is the same for all Member States because health policy also has to be conveyed in a psychologically very different manner."
"That is why I take a different view on these points and would be glad if these points, with which I am not happy, were dropped as a result of the vote."
"Only then could I approve the report."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I support the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection because it positively confirms the importance of public health in Europe and the need to have improved resources at all levels."
"However, this debate on health takes me back to the vote at midday today on the Hautala report on women's health and I am astonished that nobody has referred to this."
"The vote on paragraph 11 restricting the legalisation of abortion marks a real backward step when compared with many national laws."
"I would never have imagined myself participating in such a setback for women, particularly after yesterday."
"This challenging of the right to the termination of pregnancies is the result of one of those awful compromises which the PSE and the PPE so often make."
"It is indicative of political cowardliness, capitulation and the renunciation of all the struggles which have helped to increase women's rights over their own bodies."
"It just shows contempt for the battles which have in their time led to vital alliances in the political struggle of certain women, in particular Simone Veil, in defiance of the insults which she received from her own side."
"This attitude shows irresponsibility and political poverty."
"You can count on me and the 54 Members who voted for our amendment to continue the struggle in an atmosphere of heightened solidarity with the most reactionary women in our countries on this subject."
"Mr President, the Maastricht Treaty and then that of Amsterdam have considerably increased the competence of the Parliament and Commission in the field of public health."
"This has given us greater responsibilities, because we must now issue directives and interpret responsibly a role which until recently was a mere aspiration."
"First of all, therefore, we must change our attitude and attempt to address Europe's public health problems."
"That is what Mr Needle's report seeks to do, and consequently we are happy to approve it."
"One fundamental aspect here is to recognise Parliament's role in determining and controlling the health budget."
"This is a vital point, in that resources are the overriding problem in our attempt to achieve common standards and respond to public health requirements."
"Then there are the problems of improving information and reacting to health threats."
"In my opinion, it is no longer enough to confine ourselves to certain initiatives, as we did in the past; nutrition, obesity, cardiovascular disease - and not only cancer, AIDS and so on - now need to be addressed in a harmonised, coherent fashion in all the EU countries."
"In this context, Professor Cabrol's suggestion of a European Health Observatory, which is also taken up in Mr Needle's report, is well worth considering."
"Mention is made in particular of a Directorate-General for Health located in Brussels: that would undoubtedly be a fresh approach to dealing with this problem."
"Then there are other problems, including enlargement to the east, where scientific trends and responses to health requirements undoubtedly lag behind those in Western European countries."
"It is important to tackle this problem, because harmonisation is crucial and cannot be achieved in circumstances of inequality."
"I would merely say in conclusion that, since we are approaching the European Decade for Health - from 2000 to 2010 - I hope that the Needle report, which we support, will generate renewed and reinforced interest in public health."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that public health policy is, to a very large extent, a national matter."
"Mr Needle's excellent report also makes this plain."
"Nevertheless, there are obvious areas where collaboration at European level creates added value."
"Cooperation between the Member States might be advisable in certain circumstances, thereby avoiding duplication of work, for example in analysing the health risks posed by chemical substances or in disseminating information more effectively."
"The report mentions best practice and standards in health care."
"In my view, this is the area where the Commission has an important role to play."
"In the business sector, best practice - known as 'benchmarking' - is an excellent way for businesses to maximise their performance."
"Similarly, it would be worthwhile for the EU countries to pool their experiences with such things as how policy-driven systems operate compared with patient-driven ones, how private and state-funded health care compete with one another, and the effects of competition between the different systems on medical care."
"I am sure that most of this information is available today, but it should be compiled and made available to the Member States."
"The proper use of this information could lead to improved medical care at a lower cost."
"I am convinced that my own country, Sweden, would also find the exercise very valuable."
"The report also mentions agricultural policy and the BSE crisis."
"However, I think that support for tobacco growers is a matter of serious concern."
"Smoking already claims hundreds of thousands of victims every day."
"So it seems unreasonable to support tobacco cultivation to the tune of EUR 1 billion every year."
"The support should be phased out and transferred from agriculture to the regional policy budget."
"This would make it easier to reach a decision on providing support for alternative sources of employment."
"Mr President, standing in for my colleague who is in fact the Commissioner responsible and who regrets not being able to be present at the debate, let me thank Mr Needle for his very good report."
"It has become clear from the discussion where we must start with our work."
"If there is still confusion even in this House about what the priority should be in European health activities, then of course we must first be clear in our own minds what we can do to combat existing weaknesses in the EU health system."
"In my view, there is a great deal we can do."
"Of course it is not a question of setting up a new administration, that is to say to add a new, European health administration to the various administrations that already exist at national and also regional level."
"Here I can reassure Mrs Schleicher that that is not our intention."
"But I must say that in our view the idea put forward by some Members that we need simply to increase the funds and then spend the resources accordingly, and then we would manage to tackle the problem properly, is not the right method either."
"In the area of health we cannot hope to create a greater effect simply by allocating more resources; instead we must realise that this system is no longer working in the way it really should."
"It is not efficient enough."
"That is why the Commission considers it very important that we begin by collecting and collating the information in order, as Mr Virgin just said, to establish a kind of benchmarking for the various systems, so as to identify where there are better options that can perhaps be recommended to others."
"Even the collection of information on, for example, the use of medicinal products, would do a great deal towards reducing costs and making treatment more efficient, because at present the experience gained in particular clinics or by practising doctors is simply not being collected or made available on a Europe-wide basis."
"That is in itself a disadvantage for research, but it is an even greater disadvantage in practice, because patients could be cared for much better if general findings were available that could then be tailored to the individual patient."
"So there is a great deal to do here."
"Of course the Member States can also do it on their own behalf, but collating the findings would indeed produce a European added value."
"In any case, there is no need to discuss that further."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam has now passed that task on to the European Union and Mrs Schleicher does indeed appreciate that competition between systems, for instance the freedom to offer medical services in the single market, can be useful; I also find the European Court of Justice rulings in this area very positive."
"There is something else we should not overlook, and where we also have experience, especially from the USA which puts far more emphasis on the involvement of the patient in question or the potential patient; this means the patient is involved in the shaping of the health system."
"Where that happens, for example where drugs are freely obtainable, namely what are known as OTC or over the counter products, we find a markedly higher health awareness on the part of the individual."
"That means that the more you involve the public in the decision making and the more they themselves are asked to make the decisions, the surer you can be that they will become more health conscious."
"For that is certainly one of the problems."
"I have been looking at the judgments pronounced in America against the cigarette industry, as you probably all have too."
"It is not fitting for us to criticise this on legal grounds, but if someone comes along and institutes proceedings claiming that he was not adequately informed about the risks of smoking, then we can only wonder whether than person has been living in our society at all."
"The risks have constantly been indicated for the past twenty years, not just on the packets but all around us, and here we should not do something that would be very dangerous, namely release individuals from their responsibility for their own, highly personal health and in a sense look after them, care for them and prescribe to them exactly what they must do, from the cradle to the grave."
"That would certainly shorten rather than extend their lifespan."
"So what we want to achieve is the active involvement of the public, and especially of those who are sick, of the patients."
"I therefore very much agree with what Mr Pradier said, namely that we should cooperate even more closely than before with patients' associations, whether they centre on a particular disease or simply represent particular patients' interests."
"That is in fact the point of departure we have chosen here and I am very glad all this has been properly understood."
"Of course I will report back to my colleague, who is responsible for this area, and also tell him what you said about setting up a new directorate-general."
"If Parliament in its wisdom follows this up and grants us the corresponding posts, we will be able to do all these things. Similarly we agree with Mr Virgin's comment that it makes no sense whatsoever to spend money on preventive health care, especially on information about the risks of smoking, while at the same time subsidising tobacco crops."
"Here we agree with his assessment of the situation."
"Unfortunately, at its last vote on the subject Parliament approved these subsidies by a majority."
"Since, thank God, we live in a democracy, this time it is for Parliament to cry mea culpa ."
"Commissioner, before you disappear: I am grateful for much of your answer but I asked you a specific question."
"I deliberately did not devote much of the report to the measures on tobacco consumption which are expected imminently from the Commission because we thought that that would come at the same time."
"I wonder can you say what progress is being made in the Commission in bringing those forward so that we can take the practical measures which you are talking about."
"Sorry for not answering your question."
"I was rushing out not to avoid answering your question but because bananas is the next item and I cannot hear any more on the subject of bananas."
"I have just learnt that the proposal is within inter-service consultations."
"That means that a decision will be taken within the next couple of weeks in the Commission and then it will be handed over to you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Bananas"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the trade dispute between the European Union and the United States over bananas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I last spoke about this topic on 10 February this year, several new developments have taken place."
"On 15 February the WTO General Council discussed the EC request for an authoritative interpretation that a member cannot be authorised to suspend concessions in the absence of any WTO ruling on the conformity of the measures complained of."
"Most WTO members who spoke supported our position on this and rejected unilateralism."
"However, because of a widespread reluctance on the part of other members to vote on this, we opted for a chairman's conclusion registering the prevailing sentiment in the General Council."
"On 2 March we obtained the establishment of a panel against the United States' section 301 legislation."
"As you know, this legislation is the domestic legal base for the United States' unilateral threats and actions in the banana case."
"This panel will start its work shortly."
"Also on 2 March, the arbitrators, who had been appointed to examine whether the US proposed level of concessions of $520 million is equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment, rendered an initial decision."
"This decision states very clearly - as we had argued all along - that it is not possible for the arbitrators to set any level of concessions in the absence of an examination of the WTO conformity of the revised banana regime."
"This point of principle is very important."
"The arbitrators also ruled that the 60-day time limit from the end of the reasonable period for amending the regime which the US had claimed to be all-determinant is, in fact, not a decisive factor."
"This removes any excuse from the United States to claim a right to take sanctions at the expiry of the 60-day period."
"Finally, the arbitrators also gave a clear indication that the American estimate of damage will at least have to be reduced by the amount of indirect damage they have wrongly claimed which should, in any event, reduce the total damage by half."
"The arbitrators have requested further information from the European Union and the US by 15 March and their final ruling is expected shortly after that."
"Notwithstanding this initial ruling, the US decided on 3 March to impose sanctions effective as of that date against over $500m of European imports."
"These sanctions take the form of withholding liquidation and subjecting imports to a contingent liability of 100 % duties to be imposed retroactively."
"This is not just a provisional measure to preserve US rights."
"Its real intent and effect is to stop all imports of the products in question immediately."
"The United States has admitted as much."
"From information we have received from European industry this is exactly what seems to have occurred."
"This action is a blatant defiance of WTO rules which explicitly prohibit the suspension of concessions while arbitration is still taking place."
"The Commission reacted immediately by asking on the same day for urgent dispute settlement consultations with the United States."
"This will permit us to request a further panel on this issue after 20 days."
"The Commission also requested a special General Council meeting."
"That took place on 8 March."
"The United States' behaviour was strongly criticised by most WTO members."
"The position of the European Union as agreed with Member States is that our own reaction should be in conformity with the WTO rules."
"We do not intend to follow the American approach of taking unilateral and illegal action."
"The WTO procedures will inevitably lead to a condemnation of current US behaviour."
"In the meantime, the panels launched by Ecuador and the EC regarding the WTO conformity of the revised EC banana regime are due to issue their rulings on 12 April."
"In parallel we continue to be willing to pursue our discussions with the United States on the substance of the banana regime."
"With a view to exploring the American position and the possibilities of solving the problem, the Commission has, at the request of the Member States, entered into informal discussions with Washington."
"We have made it very clear to the United States, however, that any ideas for resolving the dispute must take into account the rights and economic well-being of the ACP countries."
"We have not been negotiating but are continuing to explore the US position."
"In conclusion, our approach is two-fold."
"Firstly, we will resolutely oppose American unilateralism and take all steps available to us in the WTO system to see to it that this behaviour is condemned and that action flowing from that condemnation can be taken if necessary."
"Secondly, it is important to stress that we will find out shortly from the WTO dispute settlement system whether or not our current amended banana regime complies with the WTO rules and, to the extent that it does not, we will have to put our house in order."
"This dispute must not be allowed to fester and we will continue to strive urgently to resolve it."
"But Europe will not stand by while the world's trade rules are flouted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sir Leon, this is the second time this year that the European Parliament is reacting to the current transatlantic trade dispute about bananas."
"Sir Leon has just described the background very accurately."
"The dispute is becoming increasingly bitter and is beginning to look like a trade war."
"It is becoming more and more absurd and putting the credibility of the WTO and its procedures as a whole at risk."
"The European Union put a new and revised banana regime in place on 1 January 1999."
"It did so after the WTO decided that the previous regime was not in conformity with WTO rules."
"The USA continues to doubt whether even this new, revised complies with WTO rules."
"That is its right."
"But it is not within its rights to pronounce unilateral trade sanctions in the form of punitive tariffs directed against the companies of its transatlantic partner."
"This conflicts in every respect with the spirit of the World Trade Organisation and therefore means a breach of the WTO rules, in particular Articles 1, 2 and 22."
"In so doing the United States is placing itself outside the multilateral legal system."
"Sanctions may not be imposed before the conclusion of the arbitration procedure."
"My group supports the Commission's negotiating position."
"We support the Commission's statement that our side will not impose unilateral measures and we want to remain in conformity with WTO rules."
"However, we certainly believe it would be sensible to keep all the options open."
"Let me at this point appeal to our American colleagues in the Congress and the Senate."
"It is especially important that the transatlantic partnership, and in particular the economic partnership that we have approved, prove themselves in times of crisis."
"However much sympathy I have for national interests, however much sympathy I have for the desire to make up the American trade deficit, these must not put the very fragile WTO rules at risk."
"It is rather ironic that the EU-USA parliamentary delegation will, we hope, be holding its first video conference this week at which it will be discussing and also organising closer political coordination and management of the transatlantic dialogue."
"I think we should jointly discuss how we can strengthen a common world organisation and ensure that we do not unilaterally put it at risk by playing on national interests."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what Mrs Mann said on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"The European People's Party also finds that the USA has quite clearly breached the WTO rules."
"But that does not necessarily mean we know what will happen next."
"We are familiar with the Americans' political rules of play; the US Administration feels under pressure from Congress, and rather like the case of the Helms-Burton Act, it no longer pays any heed to the rules of international law but seeks instead ways of defending itself from within, which is presumably how we should regard the imposition of unilateral sanctions."
"Let me point out quite firmly that we would be well-advised - even if we are in the right with the second part - not to forget that the panel, that the WTO, will probably only find conditionally in our favour on the main issue."
"That happens to be the way things go in international law, which is why I would advise the Commission, on behalf of the European People's Party, to do all it can to explore further in the discussions - which Sir Leon described as informal - with the US Administration where there are possibilities of resolving the conflict, rather than leaving it to the final WTO decision, if only because we will be facing an incredible number of points of conflict with the USA in the coming years."
"If we believe we have to win this time, we will be the losers in other cases where there might be a willingness to compromise."
"That is why we, who all supported and wanted the WTO, urge that it not be regarded merely as a pawn in the conflict of interests between the USA and Europe."
"Mr President, the quarrel between the USA and the EU runs very deep."
"It is no longer merely a question of bananas but threatens to affect EU/US trade on a much wider scale."
"More than that, it could conceivably affect the very future of the WTO and tip the balance away from free trade to protectionism."
"As I said in a letter to the Financial Times this very day, it is a great misfortune that European Union political leaders, including the UK Prime Minister, Mr Blair, I regret to say, have failed to heed the many warning signals and failed to grasp the nettle with the Americans at a much earlier stage."
"For that and many other reasons we support the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in February the European Parliament called on the United States to comply with the international rules and not to introduce customs duties unilaterally and illegally block access by European products to the American market."
"At the same time, the European Parliament warned of the need for the European Union to make plans to retaliate against the US decision."
"Despite our appeals the Americans have carried out their threats."
"The Commission should not accept this situation and must react against this blatant provocation which to my mind is typically imperialistic."
"It must block all transatlantic economic partnership negotiations, protest against the Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts as the European Parliament has already demanded, and block access by all American products to European markets."
"The United States has shown that it holds negotiations in contempt."
"We have to take action rather than insisting on an approach that is clearly not being respected."
"The Commission must also reassert its commitment to defend Community law and to fulfill its obligations towards the ACP countries and Community banana producers."
"The Commission must also tell the United States that it will not let it undermine the European Union's social and employment policies or try and jeopardise public health and the environment in the European Union."
"In conclusion, the Commission and all the Member States, without exception, must tell the United States that the tactic of divide and rule is an ancient one but is well known to us Europeans and will not work with the European Union."
"Mr President, bananas have become the symbol of a looming and escalating trade war which has in fact been simmering away quietly for six years already."
"Fiercer world competition is forcing the protagonists to take a clear and tough position."
"But the US, in threatening a trade boycott, is overstepping the bounds of that clear position and the bounds of the transatlantic partnership."
"The boycott is illegal until such time as the WTO panel has given its verdict and it is politically unacceptable, coming at a time when we have just concluded our economic partnership."
"This uncompromising attitude undermines the authority and rules of the WTO, poses a major problem for the next 'millennium round' of talks due to begin in December in Seattle, and will not least be harmful - if the US gets its way - to British exporters above all."
"Once again, none of the parties, least of all the Caribbean banana producers, have anything to gain from a trade war."
"Commissioner Brittan has played a leading role in the debate on world free trade."
"According to today's Financial Times , your swan song could turn out to be bananas - because we shall hear it one day when you step down."
"But I doubt it, because in recent years you have dealt with all manner of trade issues."
"So I ask you, where do we go from here?"
"Do we wait for the ruling of the WTO panel?"
"Are Washington and Brussels going to talk, or is the EU going to pay the US back in the same coin?"
"And if so, what coin will that be?"
"Mr President, it is with bananas of all things that the USA is currently making huge efforts to dismantle the WTO. Just because Bill Clinton promised the US Congress in autumn 1998 to impose punitive tariffs on 3 March, the WTO rules were bent and broken."
"But in fact this will go on happening even after the banana dispute: in May there will the ban on meat with hormones, next will come genetically modified food."
"The USA announced and began this massive campaign for free trade a long time ago, without regard for human health or the environment."
"But just to appeal to one's adversary to be reasonable really is not enough."
"What we must remember is that the USA is overruling the legislation in force."
"We must not go on negotiating considerately with opponents of this kind because, Sir Leon, that is precisely the way to further undermine the credibility of the WTO."
"The dispute must be settled by the WTO and until that happens all other negotiations with the USA should be suspended."
"Here I am thinking in particular of the TEP and the preparations for the millennium round."
"I am definitely not a protectionist, but please consider what decisive steps you can take to protect undertakings in the European Union, for things really cannot go on as they are."
"If we do not achieve our objective of resolving this dispute, then I fear the WTO will slip on a banana skin."
"Mr President, one really wonders why the most powerful state in the world has sunk so low into global immorality."
"But we learned from the press - if they are correct - that both parties in America get substantial donations from the three big banana companies."
"That makes the situation even worse."
"Again, one wonders why they are so greedy as they seem to have 40 % of the EU bananas and the Caribbean only 9 %."
"They seem to be prepared to write off the Third World."
"I am glad that Commissioner Brittan mentioned the ACP."
"Why is it that we have been in Lomé all these years?"
"We have always had this commitment of access to our markets."
"Why now?"
"It is a most puzzling matter."
"I represent Moray where there is a big cashmere mill."
"Along with mills on the borders, a fragile area, they are losing orders of £1 million."
"Commissioner Brittan should know this."
"I heard it on Friday."
"Even before the event, orders are being cut down and people are being put out of jobs."
"I also have the shortbread biscuits."
"So I feel that in the north of Scotland, at any rate, any claim of a special relationship will be treated with some considerable derision."
"Mr President, I would urge the Commission not to lose sight of the interests of the people of Europe, and indeed the people of all parts of the Community, in this banana dispute."
"The banana regime may have doubly adverse effects on the people and therefore on the consumers, in Austria for example."
"Since its accession to the European Union, banana prices have risen steeply."
"In a country with a continental climate, this hits the so-called man in the street, who relies heavily on bananas for his fresh fruit supplies in winter, particularly hard."
"I realise that is not the issue today."
"But if as a result of possible protective tariffs against European exports, our exports to the USA, our most important overseas market, were to fall, that could lead to bankruptcies and massive redundancies."
"In view of the extremely difficult situation on the European labour market, the Commission should therefore take a more pragmatic stance on this question, which unlike the case of meat with hormones does not involve health considerations, in order to prevent the dispute from escalating."
"Mr President, what the European Union has to do in this phase of the so-called 'banana war' is extremely awkward."
"It must attempt at one and the same time to defend its own legitimate interests and those of its ACP partners, and to prevent the escalation of a trade war consisting of reprisals on both sides, which could severely damage Europe's political, economic and commercial interests."
"The appropriate forum for the settlement of this dispute is the World Trade Organisation."
"It was the WTO which condemned the previous rules on banana imports and sales in the EU."
"The decision of the WTO 'banana panel' was what made the Union move its own goalposts."
"The onus is now on the WTO, to which the United States has again appealed concerning the new European regime, to issue an unequivocal condemnation of the illegal, unilateral steps taken by the American administration."
"The United States is now triggering a fully-fledged trade war, which could do serious damage not only to vital export sectors in the Community - and particularly in Italy - but also to transatlantic relations in general."
"Although there is no doubt that the commercial interests of the US and the EU differ - indeed in the near future they will conflict increasingly - what seems unacceptable is that the Union should submit to WTO rulings even when they are clearly biased, as in the case of bananas, but that the United States should flout them at will."
"What is more, this situation strengthens our conviction that, in the new age of globalisation, the European countries' interests very often converge with those of many developing countries, especially the ACP countries."
"The Union must therefore take steps, both bilaterally, multilaterally and within international organisations, to stand shoulder to shoulder with the poorest countries more often, beginning with the ACP countries, to give us greater strength to face the challenges confronting us."
"Mr President, it is astonishing that we are confronted by a dispute about a product of which neither the EU nor the US is a major producer."
"Intemperate comments are the order of the day."
"One has the cynical feeling that in the United States the degree of intensity of their comments perhaps depends on the degree of lobbying which they have had from, as one speaker said, the three companies which control over 80 % of the world banana trade."
"I should like to congratulate the acts that have been taken so far by the Commissioner on our behalf and, in particular, to look after our European interests in the context of the WTO and to make sure that the solution is fair to ACP producers."
"In The Times today a comment sums it up for me: 'Justice, fairness, mutual global responsibility should outweigh lumbering regulation."
"Chiquita and the rest do not depend desperately on that last little slice of the European market."
"The Caribbean producers do."
"If big producers can sleep easy at night after fighting this ignoble cause of the day, the same should not be true of responsible world leaders.'."
"Therefore, secondly, in the light of the fact that the EU and the US are the leaders of the global economy, we should now see an initiative at presidency level: of that of the head of the EU presidency with President Clinton to make sure that the proper procedures in the WTO are followed and to lessen some of the rising political impact of this conflict which could become very dangerous."
"Lastly, it seems to me that there is a lesson for our longer-term transatlantic partnership."
"We can invent any dialogue that we like or an economic partnership, but unless you get the political communities buying into this system with a broader partnership agreement between the EU and the US so that we can, as politicians, not talk by video conference but actually have a deeper dialogue between the two sides of the Atlantic, then the situation will not improve."
"I therefore urge the German presidency to take whatever initiative is necessary in the Bonn EU/US summit in June."
"Mr President, this banal issue is turning into a western entitled 'Once Upon a Time in the West - of Europe'."
"The United States of America is advancing with a 'Colt' 301 at its hip whereas Sir Leon Brittan is advancing with his hands behind his back prattling on about the law."
"This banana dispute is definitely revealing the hidden truth about Europe."
"Europe represents a union of great strength, yet we have been giving way on this issue for three years."
"Europe represents cooperation with Africa, yet we are abandoning Cameroon and the Côte d'Ivoire."
"Europe represents the ultra-peripheral regions, yet we are abandoning Crete, Madeira, the Canaries, Guadeloupe and Martinique."
"Europe represents social welfare, yet we are abandoning the banana workers, paid EUR 10 per hour, in favour of the slaves of the multinationals, paid EUR 2 per hour."
"Europe represents the market and free trade of which Sir Leon is a symbol, yet we are yielding to American protectionism, to Section 301 and to 100 % customs duties."
"Europe represents the law and the superiority of European law, yet we are yielding to the law of Geneva."
"Just two multinationals, Chiquita and Dole, are forcing the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Union as a whole to their knees."
"This is why there must be changes in Europe."
"We too must adopt a Section 301."
"We must reestablish unanimity, and the European Commission must not be left to defend our commercial interests because where there is sovereignty there is freedom and superiority."
"Mr President, I should first like to make a minor correction to what my good friend James Elles has just said."
"I do support his point of view, but according to him, neither the United States nor the European Union are major producers of bananas."
"This is something the CNN channel has been reiterating in a campaign on behalf of the United States."
"I am not sure if this is true of the United States, but Europe certainly is a major producer of bananas."
"We produce about a million tonnes of bananas in the European Union, in the autonomous community I represent, in Madeira, Greece, Martinique and Guadeloupe."
"The European Union is indeed a major producer of bananas. I do however agree with everything else James Elles said and, of course, I agree entirely with Erika Mann."
"The Union is currently involved in a legal dispute."
"In such a situation, when a country like the United States has flouted the law, the only course of action open for the Community is to defend its position from within the law."
"I find the position advocated by the Group of the European People's Party through its spokesman Mr Kittelmann rather dangerous. The proposal made was that we should now sit down and negotiate with the United States."
"It is as if someone were to steal my wallet and I were then expected to sit down and negotiate with him."
"If someone stole my wallet, I would go straight to the police, I would not sit down and negotiate with the thief."
"The present situation is that the United States is in breach of the World Trade Organisation regulations and the only possible response is to take the action the Commission has taken, and deal with the matter through legal channels."
"I should like to draw the Commissioner's attention to certain statements printed in the Financial Times . They may not be correct, but Mr Rod Abbot, the European Union Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation is quoted as saying that 'they will find probably something out of line' and 'I don't expect the answer to be zero because this is a political process as well'."
"The Union is not involved in a political process at this juncture."
"What we are involved in is essentially a legal process."
"The time to sit down and negotiate will be after the World Trade Organisation has decided on the solution."
"I have asked the Commission to advise its representative to consider his actions carefully, because any statement by him may later be used against the Union."
"Mr President, because of this dispute and its impact on the cashmere industry, feelings in Scotland are running very high."
"People feel hurt and bewildered at being involved in a dispute which is not of their making but which threatens to devastate significant parts of the economy."
"Such is the strength of feeling that a major Scottish newspaper The Sunday Mail has organised a campaign to boycott Chiquita bananas and it has received a massive response."
"And this is understandable."
"In this House also we are angry and dismayed at the petty vindictiveness of the United States."
"So, let us take the gloves off."
"No more softly, softly on Helms-Burton."
"Let us have a WTO panel on that."
"Full support from this House for your attack on the extra- territoriality of Section 301, a re-affirmation of our solidarity with the EU's traditional suppliers in the ACP, an unequivocal warning to the United States of what is at stake here - an ordered regime of world trade which we can build upon or a descent into chaos."
"Who can now have faith in the WTO and its disputes settlement procedure, in particular the developing world."
"They can see their vital interests being sacrificed on an altar of free trade which amounts to no more than a platform for the imperialist ambitions of the corporate cartels of the United States."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I represent a country with very remote banana-producing regions, I have to tell you of the deep revulsion felt by many communities in those regions at the frequency and duration of these never-ending conflicts over banana production."
"Very often the problem is not so much the size of the banana production in these regions or countries but the important part that it plays in their economy or social and environmental fabric."
"We cannot only look at volume or quantities; we have to take into account our communities, our European Union and our ultraperipheral regions, regardless of whether they are small or big producers."
"The ACP countries represent a pledge made by the European Union, a pledge that it has to honoured."
"We have already given in to the World Trade Organisation on many occasions."
"What is the aim?"
"To flood the European Union with bananas produced in countries where low labour costs mean that they can practise unfair competition."
"The attitude of the United States is an unfair one and calls for a firm stance from the Commission, with no giving in."
"Fundamentally, the Commission must continue to fight for the interests of the small and poor regions that still exist in the European Union."
"Mr President, bearing in mind, Commissioner, that the WTO referred the US call for sanctions to arbitration and that a panel has been established to determine whether the proposed new EU regime is in fact illegal, can you now assure this European Parliament, as my colleagues have asked you to do, that the Commission will not bow to illegal pressure from the United States."
"This is essentially blackmail and a manipulation of the World Trade Organisation disputes procedure."
"This blackmail aims to force the European Union to renege on its obligation to our traditional suppliers to advance the interests of one well-connected corporation, namely Chiquita."
"Will you be prepared to stand firm in face of this kind of pressure and will you acknowledge, as I do, that in the past companies like the United Fruits Company were companies which bought Costa Rica and bought Hondurus."
"Now we can say that the banana barons in the United States are actually buying the United States and buying favours from the people on Capitol Hill in Washington."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying how much I appreciate the broad degree of support that Parliament has given to the position that the European Union, and the Commission in particular, has taken."
"That support is not only appreciated; it is heartening, because it has to be added to the support given by the international community represented by the members of the WTO in their deliberations in Geneva."
"I can assure all concerned that I share the sense of indignation expressed, for example by Mr Smith and Mrs Kinnock, at the fact that innocent people, both in Europe and in the banana-producing countries of the ACP, are being taken hostage in a battle for which they have no responsibility whatsoever."
"I can assure you that we, the European Union, will take action against the United States, have taken action against the United States, but we shall do so in accordance with the rules of the WTO."
"In discussing matters with the United States, as I was careful to say in my opening statement, we will stress above all our obligations to the ACP countries but also to producers of bananas within the European Union."
"It is indeed the case that the companies concerned already have some 70 % and more of the market."
"It is not the case that they are being excluded from Europe in any sense of the word."
"It is also the case, as Mr Medina Ortega has rightly said, that we are engaged at the moment in a legal, and not just a political, process."
"We shall abide by the law, when it is pronounced, and we shall condemn those, such as the United States, who break it in advance of any decision."
"We shall not only condemn them."
"We shall, as we have done, take them to the WTO and follow the consequences of that action."
"Finally, I wish to say that there has been talk of trade wars."
"We have not started a trade war and we shall not pursue a trade war but we shall do what we are entitled to do under the WTO rules."
"Talk has also been prevalent about the impact of this on transatlantic relations generally."
"I would say both to this House and to our American friends that it is impossible for action to be taken in flagrant violation of the rules of the WTO by the United States and for the United States to believe that can have no impact on our relations generally, important as they are."
"I believe I have worked as hard as anybody not only to maintain but to develop those relations."
"That is in the interests of Europe, it is in the interests of the United States and it is in the interests of the world as well."
"However, for that to happen and for that to happen effectively and for the work of those who have striven to improve those relations not to be set at naught, the United States must play its part: it must abandon its resort to unilateralism and conform to the rules of world trade."
"That is the appeal I launched to them but it is not just a vain appeal; it is also expressed with the support of this Parliament and the determination of the European Union to defend its legitimate interests."
"One speaker referred to an article which suggested that bananas might be my nemesis."
"We all have our nemeses in due course."
"It affects people and it reaches them at different times and on different issues."
"I am not afraid of a banana nemesis because I know that the policy we are pursuing, with your support, is one of complete adherence to world trade, of a determination to build a relationship with the United States but on the solid basis of mutual respect and of equality on both sides of the Atlantic."
"On that basis, nemesis can be avoided."
"However, let us, in avoiding that nemesis in this way, also recognise that wiser counsels exist."
"It is our task to ensure that wiser counsels prevail."
"Thank you, Commissioner, we are behind you."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"Own resources"
"The next item is the report (A4-0105/99) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the need to modify and reform the European Union's own resources system."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy first has a point of order."
"Mr President, before the debate on the Haug report starts, I wish to move the inadmissibility of this report. This is for the following two reasons: firstly on a matter of substance, linked to the report's content, and secondly on a procedural matter, linked to the way in which the report was drafted in the Committee on Budgets."
"Firstly, on the substance, this reports contains a provision which can simply be called the cofinancing of agricultural expenditure."
"However, under the Treaty, agricultural expenditure is regarded as compulsory expenditure. For this reason, financing shared between the European Union budget and the national budgets cannot be permitted."
"A minority opinion from Mr Bourlanges sets out this point."
"Moreover, the report in question was not submitted for an opinion to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, although this committee is clearly responsible for expressing an opinion on an issue of this kind."
"The procedural matter involves the fact that Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure has not been applied."
"This is because the principle of compromise amendments has been adopted, as so often happens in this committee, whereas the rapporteur should have presented a new report with a new deadline for the tabling of amendments."
"These are the two reasons why, pursuant to Rule 128, I am moving the inadmissibility of this matter which I would ask to be put to the vote."
"As I understand it, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you wish this item to be removed from the agenda."
"I can now give the floor to one speaker in favour and one against."
"Mr President, added to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's arguments is the fact that the Haug report is not available in French at the documentation centre."
"A pirate electronic version is available but not in French."
"Mr President, I wish to speak against the motion, since in my view the argument put forward by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, namely that cofinancing is impossible because the expenditure is compulsory, is not covered by the EC Treaty."
"The question of compulsory expenditure has nothing to do with the way decisions are legitimised, which is why I would ask for the motion to be rejected and the Haug report to be debated now."
"Mr President, I believe it should be quite normal and necessary in the European Parliament to discuss the future too and quite simply to mark out the course we want to follow in future, which is the purpose of this discussion."
"I put to the vote Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's motion to remove this item from the agenda."
"Parliament rejected the motion"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite clear that this week we are waiting for important signals to be set in the European Union, even if that is precisely what Mr Fabre-Aubrespy and a few other Members wanted to prevent."
"In addition to the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy, the financing of the Community needs to undergo radical reform."
"President Santer rightly pointed out that financial reform is one of the main pillars of Agenda 2000."
"Parliament has already taken important steps in regard to the interinstitutional agreement by laying down our principles, but financial reform will quite simply remain inadequate unless we also see changes on the revenue side."
"Interinstitutional agreement and reform of own resources are two sides of the same coin."
"The financing structure we have at present no longer matches up to the increased demands made on it."
"We need greater flexibility, transparency and autonomy in the European financial system."
"The present system relies too heavily on sources of finance that are calculated in a highly complicated manner and which, on top of that, virtually still take the form of Member State contributions."
"These shortcomings, together with the obvious imbalances in the distribution of the burden among the more prosperous Member States, need to be remedied."
"The Committee on Budgets therefore proposes a step-by-step readjustment of the own resources system."
"We voted on this last night and basically reached the following conclusions. Firstly, European budgetary revenue must take a simpler and more transparent form and come under stricter democratic control."
"We want to replace VAT-based own resources and GNP-based own resources with a uniform, new, simplified source of own resources on a GNP basis."
"This measure will also help eliminate the imbalances between Member States in relation to funding the budget."
"Secondly, in principle the European budget must be financed under the same conditions for all Member States."
"This means that existing correction mechanisms must be phased out and we must not add new correction mechanisms or even rebate systems."
"In concrete terms this means that the British rebate must have been phased out gradually by the time of the accession of the first new Member State at the latest."
"In its time, this rebate was granted to make up for the fact that the UK received too small a share of payments under the common agricultural policy."
"But at that time the agricultural proportion of the budget, accounting for over 70 %, was considerably higher than it is today."
"A rebate is anti-systemic and in no way justifiable, even in relation to financing the Structural Funds or the costs of enlargement."
"Thirdly, I would emphasise that reducing economic differences and achieving solidarity among the Member States are an important pillar of the Treaty and of European integration."
"But we cannot achieve this important aim on the expenditure side."
"Such an attempt would merely create rules that would make the budget complicated and less transparent."
"We have policies created specifically for the purpose of achieving solidarity among the Member States, such as structural policy."
"We want horizontal justice and vertical solidarity to be our principle for shaping the budget."
"Fourthly, ever widening imbalances have emerged in the course of time in the financing of the budget. They now form a considerable obstacle to the development of the European Union."
"You can see that just by looking at the current discussions in the Council."
"To put it plainly: there will always be net contributors and net beneficiaries, nobody disputes that."
"But we must avoid excessive imbalances and unfair distributions of the burden."
"Otherwise there is a risk that our people will doubt the legitimacy of the Union."
"It is obvious that these imbalances can only be eliminated if the largest expenditure heading, agricultural policy, which accounts for almost 50 % of the budget, is not disregarded."
"It is all the more important to have rules that include agriculture because that is where many of these imbalances stem from."
"That is why it is sensible and reasonable for agricultural policy to be cofinanced in future, as the Committee on Budgets decided last night."
"In this context let me also emphasise again that cofinancing does not mean renationalisation - on the contrary."
"In fact it involves the Member States more closely in framing Community policy, in qualitative terms too, and therefore leads to deeper integration."
"Nobody would even think of denying the Community nature of our structural policy."
"However, we do not want anyone to be overburdened as a result of this kind of measure, and I could imagine that when cofinancing is implemented, differentiated rules, which is to say lower cofinancing rates, could perhaps be found for economically weaker Member States."
"I would also add that the considerable differences of opinion in the Council on this subject have naturally also had an impact on the discussions on our report, and have also had an impact on Parliament."
"Since there were heated disputes about the instrument of cofinancing, I submitted a compromise proposal to the Committee on Budgets. Accordingly, agricultural expenditure was to be reduced every year by a certain percentage and part of the resources thus obtained would go on structural aid measures in rural areas."
"This compromise did not obtain a majority, for which those who strongly rejected cofinancing bear particular responsibility."
"But since any solution that disregarded agricultural policy would have no substance and no prospects, we re-submitted the original cofinancing proposal, which was then accepted, although not until after the compromise proposal had been rejected."
"By correcting the unbalanced distribution of the burden we create the conditions for a viable budget for the future."
"To ensure that the European Union is financially independent, in the long term its financing should be based on new own revenue which does not take the form of Member State contributions."
"Primarily this revenue would consist of own taxes."
"As a first step towards this objective, a proportion of these taxes should accrue to the Union budget, on the basis of an agreement between the Member States on certain types of tax."
"Here we must emphasise, however, that this new own revenue should not be additional but should replace existing revenue, so as to avoid putting a further burden on the European taxpayer."
"In my view, what we are trying to achieve is to adjust the financing of the Union to the requirements of the new quality of Communitisation."
"We have nearly achieved this new quality of Communitisation with the completion of economic and monetary union."
"The Member States' economies are interwoven in a particular manner."
"That means that the Member States' budgets and the European budget can no longer be looked at in isolation from one another."
"In the long term the stability of our common currency and the potential for growth of our closely linked economies depend on whether the European budget also becomes capable of taking economic action."
"When we vote on this report we will also be deciding our own ability to act."
"Shall we sit and wait for Council decisions or are we capable of developing the power to shape policies by ourselves?"
"If we adopt this report here on Thursday and make its demands the subject of negotiations with the Council on the new interinstitutional agreement, we will have made an important contribution to the reform of the European Union."
"Support us along this new road and let us dare to embark on it together."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I would be prepared to support the revolution but it is actually the opposite which is being proposed."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs had two concerns on this issue."
"The first was to ensure that clarification was given on whether, in the future, own resources should be national contributions or resources collected in the form of taxes from economic operators."
"Although I must congratulate Mrs Haug's report which has achieved some very important work, I do not share its conclusions and find its answer to this question to be rather paradoxical."
"This is because it initially suggests that national contributions should end and then it proposes extending the GNP national contribution and making this the main resource of the Union's budget."
"Work that one out if you can!"
"The second concern of the Committee on Institutional Affairs was to clarify the status of cofinancing."
"Would this be a subsidy granted by the Member States on a voluntary basis to supply certain areas of Community expenditure?"
"If so, this would involve a system which would call into question the unity of the common agricultural market and which would involve renationalisation and distortion of competition, as each country would subsidise its own agriculture at will."
"If, on the contrary, this involved compulsory cofinancing imposed on the Member States, this would be a new own resource, which is what justifies the project appearing in the Haug report."
"This new resource would be outside the legal framework of the Treaty as it would not comply with Article 201."
"Either we have a system of own resources with unanimous agreement and ratification by the national parliaments or we forget this and work within Article 43, in which case this would be highly illegal."
"The main proposal of your report, Mrs Haug, is therefore contrary to the Treaty."
"Applause"
"Mr President, despite the increased use of the concept of gross national product, I should like to look at contributions to the European Union's budget from the point of view of the people's Europe."
"If we take as a point of reference the contribution made by each individual in each Member State expressed as a percentage of his or her income, it emerges that the contribution made to the Union's budget by people in certain countries with a lower standard of living is higher than the Community average in terms of a proportion of their income."
"On the other hand, if the same terms of reference are applied, say, to an Italian or to a British person, it is clear that their contributions are well below the average."
"The European Commission's communication puts forward three courses of action aimed at resolving the problem of budgetary imbalances. It should be borne in mind, however, that the Commission has been accused of partiality in formulating these proposals, as it only seems to defend the interests of certain net contributors."
"It is abundantly clear that the Commission's communication does not exhaust all possible solutions."
"One of the most ingenious, as far as fairness is concerned, involves compensating countries whose balance differs from what it should be as a function of their gross national product and relative per capita wealth. The combined negative balance would be financed by the remaining members, excluding the Member States benefiting from cohesion funds."
"This option would allow cohesion to be preserved within the Union and would permit a fairer distribution of the financial effort required to maintain this level of cohesion."
"Though I commend the rapporteur for the work she has put into this report, I have to disagree with her. We should be advocating fairness - equitas - a principle which dates from the earliest days of Roman law."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her report, not just because she is from our group but because she embarked on a Mission Impossible to try to get the agreement of the European Parliament on the future financing of the European Union."
"I am sure when we come to the vote you will see how impossible that position has proved to be."
"And yet the hard work she has put into it has made some progress towards a position that all the political groups can support."
"Her original drafts resulted in 241 amendments."
"That shows there was more than a little interest."
"The fact that 241 amendments were tabled gave rise to some concern in the Committee on Budgets."
"The last thing we wanted to do was to come before Parliament with so many amendments to be voted on."
"So we asked the rapporteur to try to obtain as many compromise amendments as possible."
"And that is exactly what she did."
"She then put together a revised draft."
"And that is what the Socialist Group has tried to go along with."
"She has pleased just about every nationality except one, namely my own, in the way she has taken on the majority of interests."
"She has done very well."
"However, I would not be telling the truth if I were to say that we were unanimous in our support for the final report we voted on last night in committee."
"If I were Greek or Irish, where the GDP of my country would be affected by Amendment No 141 which refers to the co-financing of agriculture, I would not want to vote for that amendmen."
"Others believe that Amendment No 141 should be supported wholeheartedly as it would help reduce the net payments of their Member States and if I were German or Dutch, I would wholeheartedly support this new paragraph 13."
"Fourteen out of the fifteen delegations within the Socialist Group want rid of the UK rebate and they will vote for those paragraphs which refer to it."
"If I were speaking for the British, I would make a valid case why the UK rebate is fair and justified but I am not speaking for the British and therefore I cannot say these things."
"The one thing my group can agree on is that the status quo needs to be changed."
"It has not developed in any systematic way nor in accordance with any European strategy or real forward planning."
"Rather, it has developed as a reaction to events at given periods of time."
"I will give you a couple of examples."
"The original traditional own resources was the one truly European own resource."
"At the same time that one truly European own resource is waning rapidly in its importance."
"Yet, the good old traditional own resources are the cause of major headaches for control and concern about fraud."
"And what about the VAT and GNP-based own resources?"
"As a member of the Committee on Budgets for almost ten years I would challenge any Member - except Mr Samland and Mr Colom I Naval - to explain the formula for VAT and GNP-based own resources, that is to say how to calculate Member States contributions."
"Try to explain it to members of the general public and - even if you can do it - how are they to understand it?"
"That is the situation that exists."
"We have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency."
"All this Parliament wants is a clear and comprehensible system."
"We are somewhere near to getting an agreement on that through Mrs Haug's report."
"I would hope that at the end of the voting we have a clear and concise position and most of my group will be supporting it."
"Mr President, I wish to move a procedural motion."
"At the end of the morning sitting, the President put to an informal vote a change in the agenda for this afternoon in order to allow Sir Leon Brittan to attend."
"We have now reached Question Time and this change has caused a totally unacceptable imbalance between the political groups in this debate."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Haug from the Socialist Group, has just spoken for eight minutes followed by Mr Wynn from the Socialist Group for five minutes."
"This means that this debate on a report that is extremely important for European finances will now be suspended until the evening sitting, thereby preventing the other political groups from speaking before 9.00 p.m."
"For this reason I urge you to ensure that at least one speaker from each group is given the floor by encroaching into Question Time."
"Otherwise, the press who are listening in the press room will have heard thirteen minutes from one group - actually five but the rapporteur is from the same group - and nothing from the other groups."
"In view of the importance of this report and of the vote on Thursday which will be closely followed, with three minority opinions and roll-call votes, particularly with regard to agriculture, I would consider it deplorable if this House were to begin Question Time without at least one speaker per group having spoken."
"Mr President, I would ask you to consult our colleagues because I feel that the groups must be allowed to vote on this in the same way as you put to the vote the possible referral of the report back to committee due to the inadmissibility of the matter."
"You are right, Mr Giansily, that there is a tremendous problem every time we change the agenda."
"It makes life very difficult for Members, Commissioners and the press."
"I also hope you will appreciate that when it is established that Question Time begins at 5.30 p.m. it is very difficult for the President of the sitting to disregard that."
"But if you insist that we take a vote on the matter, then of course it can be done."
"However, I would prefer it if we could avoid that and let Question Time begin now."
"On the other hand, I think it is important that Mr Giansily has made our audience and the press aware of the imbalance which has arisen in that only members of one political group have had the floor."
"I think you are quite right in that respect, although I would point out that Mr Bourlanges has also spoken, as well as Mr Valdivielso."
"Do you insist on having a vote, Mr Giansily?"
"Yes, Mr President, I am asking for a vote."
"Mr President, I just wanted to propose a compromise."
"I think seven groups still have to speak and there are only a few minutes left."
"Perhaps we could come to a compromise."
"After all, you do not have to work through the whole list of speakers."
"I understood Mr Giansily to mean that he wanted the seven Members who are speaking on behalf of the political groups to have the floor before Question Time."
"One speaker per group, Mr President."
"Mr President, I should like to make a further remark."
"When the opinion of the House was sought on the timing of the Commission's declaration on bananas, we were never told that that would mean cutting short the debate on own resources."
"I am one of those paying the price for this, as I am will now have to speak in the evening."
"It does seem to me, however, that it is politically unacceptable not to allow all the groups to express an opinion at least once before postponing the debate."
"Mr President, I would suggest that we continue the debate here in plenary immediately after Question Time."
"I put to the vote Mr Giansily's request for the political group spokesmen to be given the floor before Question Time."
"Parliament approved the request"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgetary Control has repeatedly considered the system of own resources on the basis of the various reports by the Court of Auditors."
"Mrs Haug has now done an extremely comprehensive job on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, but I am sorry to have to say that the great number of amendments tabled in committee have not made the whole business any clearer or more convincing."
"Basically I would like to point out that as long as the issue is confined to the fair distribution between the Member States of the own resources that have to be found, we will keep having to deal with conflicting financial and budgetary interests, to bemoan the lack of transparency and lack of ascribability of both revenue and expenditure."
"Only if the contribution of each individual taxpayer throughout Europe is taken seriously and evaluated could this dispute be brought to an end."
"That is why I particularly regret the rejection of the proposal from our Committee on Budgetary Control that the Commission provide information concerning the possibility of personalising the contributions that feed the own resources system."
"We should adhere to the principle of own resources, even if only traditional own resources - duties and agricultural levies - are genuine own resources, which in addition have been regressive for years."
"In addition, the Member States deduct these own resources as their contribution and ask for 10 % of them back for their customs administrations."
"One should at least check whether this 10 % can be appropriated for the customs administrations in the first place."
"At any rate, there is still quite a lot of circumvention and evasion in this area by the Member States."
"VAT-based own resources are tending increasingly to take the form of national contributions to the EU budget."
"Their share is being distorted because of the size of the black economy in some states."
"GNP-based own resources still correspond most closely to contributions."
"But I am sorry that the net-contributor issue is not being resolved at all."
"I am in favour of cofinancing, I am in favour of the phased abolition of the British rebate and I am also in favour of examining the question of new own resources."
"Mr President, I should also like to compliment Mrs Haug on her report."
"She nearly had a mission impossible but we should make a distinction between some very controversial points and the general direction in which Parliament can express itself."
"It is essential for Parliament to indicate before the Berlin summit that it does not like the concept of juste retour , that it does not want to have further exemptions, that it wants to review the exemptions of the British rebate and that it does not want to go in the direction of a general correction mechanism."
"These are very fundamental points for the future."
"It is also important for the future for us to look at the prospect of having own resources of a real nature, although this may still take some time yet."
"In that respect it is a report of fundamental importance which we should welcome."
"Obviously there are a number of points which cause difficulties."
"The issue of cofinancing will clearly be shared by a large majority of my group."
"I would take issue with Mr Bourlanges who says it is illegal."
"He said so in so many words."
"It is not illegal."
"It is the review of a policy which should remain communautaire ."
"There is no question about that."
"The question is whether, in 1999, we should still have the same amount of finance in the Community budget for an agricultural policy which is in need of review."
"That element has nothing to do with legality."
"It is a question of appropriateness and of review."
"In the same way it is very important that the report very clearly says that we should find corrections on the expenditure side in the future."
"We know, for instance, that within the framework of the review the Spanish Government has put forward suggestions concerning asylum and immigration."
"It may be that the specific ways in which it is formulated need correction, but it is that kind of correction which will ultimately make, as Mrs Haug said, a Community of solidarity and a Community of justice."
"Against that general background the Liberal Group is very positive about her overall approach."
"There will certainly be individual items with which we may disagree."
"It is clear also that not everybody would be happy to phase out the UK rebate right away."
"We have heard that point before."
"But again, it is relevant to know that a large majority in Europe does not want to have any specific positions for any specific group of countries or individual countries."
"Indeed, as Mrs Haug rightly said, it should also be clear that by the time the first new batch of countries comes in, there should be an end to such special arrangements."
"That is a very positive point."
"It would be quite illogical if one Member State were not to cofinance enlargement of the European Union, which has nothing to do with the fact that in 1984 there was a specific situation concerning agriculture."
"Against that background it is also important that Mrs Haug makes it clear that we should have more democracy and a bigger say for Parliament in the future."
"Our colleague, Mr Colom i Naval will have considerable support for the issue of having more flexibility and transparency."
"Mr President, thank you for having agreed to put our proposals to the vote."
"Clearly they were positively supported. In my opinion, this is because Mrs Haug's report is extremely important for the future of this House and the European Union."
"This report boils down to just a few questions."
"Are the own resources that allow Community policies to be financed still sufficient?"
"Do they guarantee the financial autonomy of the European Union?"
"And finally, will they be sufficient to finance the future enlargement and to allow the Community to keep its commitments with regard to the common policies?"
"The problem is that, although the rapporteur asked good questions, the Committee on Budgets provided poor answers in its vote yesterday."
"Firstly, Mrs Haug has instigated a real witch-hunt against the common agricultural policy because, just by citing the share of agricultural expenditure in the Community budget, she has asserted that this is a main cause of the budgetary imbalance."
"We cannot support such an erroneous assumption."
"Although the share of agricultural expenditure in the budget has remained constant over the last twenty years in terms of GDP, it has nevertheless constantly fallen from year to year because the other policies have increased and also because a financial straitjacket has been imposed on this."
"Agricultural expenditure now represents less than 45 % of the total volume of EU expenditure whereas, when this House was elected for the first time in 1979, it represented over 90 %."
"Secondly, having found that the CAP share of the budget is inappropriate, Mrs Haug proposes nothing less than cofinancing of agricultural expenditure by the Member States."
"Mr Bourlanges has just explained that this is totally unacceptable."
"This is due primarily to the special status of agricultural expenditure which, because of its effect on the economy and its support of the markets, cannot be lumped together with all the non-compulsory expenditure and cannot be subject to the will of this House."
"Even partial cofinancing of the CAP from national budgets would inevitably lead to agricultural expenditure being renationalised and would lead the European Union down the dangerous road of reversing the integrated nature of the common policies."
"In this case, we cannot risk heading disastrously towards the disintegration of the common policies as, due to financial convenience and political opportunity, full financing would no longer be assured."
"Any reform of Europe's finances must consolidate Community solidarity, yet the options put forward by certain delegations continue to give cause for concern, particularly in terms of the Structural Funds."
"In my opinion, as recalled after the Brussels and Edinburgh European Councils of 1988 and 1992 respectively and the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the main priority in this issue is to respect the commitment made to the Member States which most need these funds, namely Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In this respect I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Nikitas Kaklamanis."
"Finally, how can we fail to keep the commitments made previously when we are trying to integrate these states into the European Union and to ask for their full solidarity?"
"The vote on Thursday will demonstrate that solidarity must be maintained between the Members of this House and between the European partners."
"Mr President, the first question to be asked about the European Union's own resources is whether they are sufficient for the policies that we intend to implement."
"What policies and at what level?"
"Or, in other words, to use an expression we have often used, we must have the means to realise our ambitions."
"This is our vital starting-point, especially now that we are heading towards a further and considerable enlargement due to bring into the European Union a large number of countries that, at best, have a level of development that is markedly below the current Community average."
"These questions cannot be avoided. That is why, in our opinion, a clear answer will have to be found to the following questions: do we or do we not wish to continue with the current Community policies - and now is not the time for us to discuss what kind of policies they are - and do we or do we not want to prepare the ground for extending them in the future to the applicant countries?"
"Furthermore, we must also consider whether there might not be other areas in which Community action is desirable and which would need resources to be allocated to them."
"I am thinking, for example, of the fight against unemployment."
"What I have just said obviously clashes with the general direction taken in this discussion since, very often, the level of implementation in terms of revenue is confused with the level of implementation in terms of expenditure. Also, on a more fundamental level, there seems to be one overriding concern: to regard the current level of own resources as adequate and as a proper starting-point and, in the light of the new developments - particularly preparations for enlargement - to settle for a fresh redistribution and allocation of those resources."
"Obviously, we do not go along with that approach, which is, in any case, out of keeping with all of the efforts made by the European Parliament on this subject for many years."
"We are the first to call for a root-and-branch reform of the CAP, but that does not mean that a properly reformed CAP will require less finances."
"We must, after all, ensure a fresh distribution of the available resources between producers and regions."
"Therefore, we reject outright the proposal to renationalise CAP funding and the proposals to introduce a degressive approach."
"On the other hand, we feel that solidarity and cohesion must be at the forefront of the European Union's concerns, and we even believe that the current 1.27 % of GNP earmarked for those objectives will prove insufficient to guarantee effective redistribution in the future."
"In particular, we should make it crystal clear that there can be no enlargement with this level of own resources."
"Furthermore, there are other job-creation projects which cannot be delayed, and they also call for additional funding."
"I would say that this is the central issue: how the European Union is to be properly financed."
"Therefore, in our opinion, and without wishing to go over the top, we think that this problem can only be solved if we improve the existing system of own resources, in particular by giving greater weight to GNP when calculating the transfers."
"We believe that this is the only sure way to achieve this objective."
"Mr President, the fate of the Haug report on Thursday still rests in the lap of the gods, but nevertheless, many thanks for this great endeavour."
"I would like to make it clear that the question of cofinancing agricultural policy has nothing to do with the cheapest version of the net-contributor debate that we keep hearing but that it is necessary in order to achieve what we have always called for: structural reform that will bring about more democracy in expenditure policy and that, above all, can make us capable of enlargement, for otherwise we would never manage to finance eastward enlargement."
"In my view, to describe this is as 'the only communitised policy' is just a cliché to hide the fact that in this area, which accounts for nearly half the budget, there is no democratic control."
"When the ministers for agriculture meet and decide on their EUR 45 billion, neither the European Parliament nor any regional or national parliament has any say."
"That is the fundamental mistake in what is called the communitised agricultural policy."
"Support for environmental policy in rural areas, yes, as a structural policy, but support for a single sector, the agricultural sector, really is out of date in my view. It casts very serious doubt on the credibility of European policy-making and is something that must also be discussed during the negotiations on a new financial framework."
"In that respect I warmly thank the Committee on Budgets for nailing its colours to the mast!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a shame that so little attention is being paid to this very important debate, which we owe to Mrs Haug, because we are in the eye of a major storm which arose in our Committee on Budgetary Control in what I might describe as a spectacularly unacceptable way."
"I must say we are content that the question of national rebates has been abandoned: that notion - like all other such demands relating to sums totalling some 10 or 12 000 billion lire, a mere fraction of a Member State's overall budget - goes to the core of a topical debate which is gnawing away at European integration."
"I welcome the abandonment of this principle; however I do not welcome some of the attitudes struck in the report, particularly where we resuscitate an idea that has disappeared from the agenda of our governments and the Council of Ministers."
"We learned a few days ago that the German Government, which had been calling more loudly than any other for a new method of cofinancing the common agricultural policy, has withdrawn its proposal."
"To make Parliament, which unfortunately has a purely advisory role, return to the fray on this issue now strikes me as a mistake on the part of our committee yesterday."
"We shall vote in favour of the report, as long as it is somehow divested of all such inappropriate and blatantly controversial considerations."
"European integration does not depend on a few thousand million lire, but on creating true political union among the peoples of Europe."
"Mr President, the characteristic feature of our four own resources is that they are inappropriate. There are three reasons for this."
"Firstly, their basis of assessment is fudged. This is true of both VAT and GNP."
"Secondly, they are not clear or transparent. Who among us can calculate the British rebate?"
"Thirdly, these resources fortunately do not belong exclusively to Europe but are disguised contributions from the Member States."
"It is now intended to alter this system under pressure due to enlargement to the East and pressure from Germany."
"The European Commission has made a number of proposals."
"In fact, these own resources are serving to reveal the truth."
"The European Union cannot maintain its ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP and so we will ultimately end up with additional European taxes."
"Federalism will roll on implacably. Just as in the United States of America, Brazil, India and Australia, we will have to share income tax and corporation tax receipts between the nation-states and Europe."
"Only one thing can protect us from this unfortunate fate and that is the rule of unanimity."
"Thank you, Mr Martinez."
"We shall adjourn the debate at this point."
"It will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0144/99)."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today's Question Time to the Commission is starting 26 minutes later than it should according to the agenda approved on Monday."
"I apologise to the Commissioners for the delay."
"We had asked them to attend at 5.30 p.m."
"I apologise also to the authors of the questions."
"Question No 41 by José Valverde López (H-0139/99)"
"Subject: Food analysis unit of the Environment Institute (Ispra) The European Environment Institute in Ispra has a food analysis unit which monitors the quality of food ingredients, additives and chemical products generally used in the preparation of foodstuffs."
"What links does this unit have with the various Commission services responsible for food security?"
"Are there any plans to incorporate this unit into the planned European Food Security Agency?"
"I should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Valverde's question."
"Mr President, I am happy to answer this question which concerns an important subject, namely the Environment Institute and the problem of food safety."
"Since 1 October 1998, the Food Products Unit has been part of the new Institute for Health and Consumer Protection of the Joint Research Centre."
"This unit provides the independent scientific expertise needed for preparing and implementing various EU policies."
"As the fifth framework programme for research is implemented, the unit will continue to provide scientific and technical support to various directorates-general of the Commission, for example to DG III for industry, to DG VI for agriculture, to DG XI for the environment, to DG XXI for customs and to DG XXIV for consumer health protection."
"The main research priorities of the unit within the fifth framework programme for research are to control the safety and quality of food and related items and to detect genetically modified organisms in food and also in the environment."
"The unit's activities will essentially involve developing, validating and harmonising analytical methods."
"To a certain extent this involves determining uniform European analytical methods which we can therefore regard as reference methods."
"The unit's activities will also involve developing databases and disseminating the results of research."
"The areas covered by the unit include food and animal feed, cosmetics, food packaging and childcare products and toys."
"I can give you some more specific examples of the work to be carried out by this Institute. In particular it will validate two methods, one involving general screening and the other which will be more specific, for the detection of genetically modified organisms in staple foods, for example soya bean or maize flour."
"This study will be extended to processed products."
"I can also cite the development of methods for determining the presence of vegetable oils and fats other than cocoa butter in chocolate."
"This study will serve as a scientific basis for the new 'chocolate' directive which is being prepared."
"The Institute will also participate in studies on the migration of phthalates in toys."
"This work involves developing and coordinating the validation of a mechanical method to simulate the sucking of toys and childcare products."
"You will be aware that there was recently a major debate on this subject because phthalates can be the cause of serious illnesses in children who suck or chew toys."
"Another example is the validation of methods in respect of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the safety of animal feed, one demonstrating the appropriate heat treatment of animal meals according to the legislation and the other allowing the detection of animal meals in animal feed."
"Finally, I can mention a database for wine, covering over 10 000 wines, and the fight against fraud in the area of wine, alcohol and spirits. These are just a few specific examples of the Institute's activity."
"As for the reference to the European Agency for Food Safety, the Commission would point out that it has not so far put forward any proposals on this."
"It therefore seems premature today to discuss the possible participation of joint research centres. However, this is clearly something which can be studied at a later date."
"I should first like to thank the Commissioner most sincerely for her lengthy reply to my question. Her detailed account of the major restructuring which has taken place at Ispra and, in particular, of the new activities undertaken by the Institute for Health will also be of great interest to the general public."
"What I would like to emphasise if I may, Commissioner, is that the Commission must continue working on the project to establish the new food analysis unit which will be able to coordinate all these activities and render the combined effort more efficient."
"I am reiterating a hope rather than putting a question, and I hope that the Commission will be as efficient as it has been in restructuring the Ispra centre and will be able to complete its work with the creation of this unit."
"I can confirm to the honorable Member my interest in the problem of food safety."
"I am keen that particular attention is paid to this subject within the restructuring of the Joint Research Centre."
"I can inform you that a document will be made available to Members."
"This gives the work programme for 1999 and also contains a description of what has been achieved, in greater detail than I can give you today, together with the list of publications which have been issued as a result of the work carried out by the Joint Research Centre."
"Thank you for your reply, Mrs Cresson."
"Once again, I apologise for the delay and thank you for waiting so patiently to reply to Mr Valverde's question."
"Thank you very much."
"Question No 42 by Christine Oddy (H-0211/99)"
"Subject: Financial control problems in Nicaragua I visited Nicaragua from 17-21 February and was alarmed to find, when I went to the Commission office in Waspam Rio Coco that no work appeared to be carried out and the people at the office were watching television; a caretaker showed us round and said the project manager had gone to Managua in December and had not returned."
"The skeleton staff had not been paid for several months, there were no files in the filing cabinet, the Land Rover outside had lost its spare tyre and was not properly locked and another Commission car was lying wrecked in another part of the village."
"I have severe misgivings about the appropriateness of such a lavish Commission office in such a small remote village."
"Will the Commission investigate urgently?"
"I offer you a warm welcome, Mr Marín. Mr Marín and I go back a long time."
"Not only are we friends but we also fought side by side in the cause of civil liberties in Spain during a difficult period. So I am particularly pleased to be able to give him the floor."
"Mr Marín, you may reply to Mrs Oddy's question."
"Thank you for your kind introduction, Mr President."
"Mrs Oddy has asked me about the situation concerning what appears to be a European Commission office in the Río Coco area of Nicaragua. I must first of all make it quite clear that the only European Commission delegation in Nicaragua is located in Managua."
"The premises you visited do not belong to the European Commission and the staff you met are not employed by the European Commission."
"That project was completed in 1997."
"Therefore, none of the individuals on the premises have any professional association with the European Commission."
"As regards the office equipment and the two Land Rovers which you said were not being put to good use in 1997, you will doubtless be aware that whenever a project is concluded, any remaining vehicles and office equipment which are sufficiently depreciated are handed over to the local authorities. In this case, the vehicles and office equipment were handed over to the Nicaraguan governor of the Río Coco province."
"Clearly, there has been a misunderstanding."
"Nevertheless, I have instructed the Commission's delegate in Managua to visit the Waspam region and ascertain in situ why the Nicaraguan authorities did not, as it appears, put the two Land Rovers and the office equipment donated to them to good use."
"Thank you for the answer."
"I am aware that the project was closed down but nevertheless the building is operating to all intents and purposes as a Commission building."
"It has a sign to that effect outside and the two vehicles I referred to have Commission logos on them."
"To the outside world it appears to be a Commission office and people in the village refer to it as a Commission office."
"I do not accept the answer I was given and the people who I spoke to thought that they were still employed by the Commission."
"I can only reiterate what I have asked in the original question."
"This situation needs to be investigated urgently."
"If there is a misunderstanding then the people should be put right who think that they are in arrears of salary."
"Mrs Oddy, the necessary checks have already been carried out, and I can confirm that the building in question does not belong to the Commission."
"I am unaware of the reasons behind this situation you describe though I can make an educated guess at them."
"The delegate has indeed confirmed that the European Union's logo is painted on the wall of the building."
"The European Union's logo is also painted on the two Land Rovers."
"As I explained, when a project is completed any sufficiently depreciated vehicles are handed over to the local authorities, and in this case they were given to the local governor."
"I will tell our delegate to get rid of the logos on the Land Rovers."
"But I must stress that the building does not belong to the European Commission."
"It used to, but we stopped using it two years ago."
"A misunderstanding has arisen."
"Quite apart from all this and following the devastation caused by hurricane Mitch, the Commission decided to repeat the process, as you will doubtless be aware."
"On this occasion, of course, it was handled in a different way, and not through the local governor of the Río Coco province."
"A competition was held and was won by an Italian NGO."
"We decided on such a procedure because this small example illustrates once again how difficult it is to deal with what we always term sustainable development."
"The European Union financed this project aimed at the Misquito Indians for five years."
"According to the arrangements for sustainable development, once a certain period of time has elapsed, responsibility must be transferred to the local authorities."
"We did so two years ago in 1997. You have seen for yourself how sustainable development often requires constant European presence, because when European cooperation is withdrawn, the kind of situation you witnessed can arise."
"Rest assured that the delegate has been instructed to ask the governor of the Río Coco region for an explanation, and I shall also ask for the logos to be removed from the office and from the Land Rovers in order to prevent any confusion amongst the local population."
"I have not been to Nicaragua but Christine Oddy has and she has reported faithfully what she saw."
"It would seem to me to indicate an unhappy situation in the representative's office because he should have done two years ago what you are now arranging to do."
"That office is overdue for a visit of inspection from your department - possibly, from the Financial Controller and possibly also from the Court of Auditors."
"When this question was raised some months ago, the body concerned foolishly wrote to Managua and said it is not intended to make a visit during this year."
"If one is worried about things not being properly run it seems a pity if you advertise the fact that they are not going to be checked."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, I am not exactly sure what you are trying to say."
"Could you please explain it more clearly?"
"I thought I was clear enough."
"What I have been hearing about the representative in Nicaragua is indicative that the project had not been properly closed down."
"A visit to Managua should be made."
"I invite you to say that an inspection visit will be made, possibly from your department, from the Financial Controller and from the Court of Auditors."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, I understand you now."
"The delegate has been asked to visit the area to ascertain exactly how the local governor of the Río Coco region has been dealing with the project since it was transferred to the Nicaraguan authorities. I must however reiterate that a misunderstanding has arisen."
"I have been asked how Commission premises came to be in such a regrettable state and I can only reply that the premises in question do not belong to the Commission."
"Secondly, the staff on those premises - who were indulging in rather unorthodox behaviour, according to Mrs Oddy - are not Commission employees."
"I would like to make that crystal clear."
"Therefore, neither the building nor the staff have any connection with the Commission."
"How do you expect a financial audit to be carried out in relation to a situation that is based on a misunderstanding over officials who are not employed by the Commission?"
"I said Managua, I did not say the site of the project."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, when the Commission states the obvious, it sometimes provokes a reaction I cannot comprehend."
"I am referring to the Río Coco project."
"Naturally, the Managua delegation ..."
"The President cut the Commissioner off"
"Mr Marín, please reply without engaging in a dialogue, as the Rules do not provide for one."
"I have been far too generous with Mr Kellett-Bowman because he and I work together on Fridays, but I cannot allow myself to continue in this vein."
"Please reply as you feel appropriate and we shall move on to another question."
"There is no difficulty over carrying out an audit of our official delegation in Managua as you request. It has to be audited in any case, as part of SEM 2000."
"As regards the premises referred to in Mrs Oddy's question however, those premises do not, I stress, belong to the European Commission, nor, I repeat, are the people she saw at those premises employed by the European Commission."
"It is as simple as that."
"I am sorry, but that is the way it is."
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question."
"In reply I would say that following the Council decision of 16 July 1998, the Commission was authorised to open negotiations with the states whose civil aviation regulatory authorities are full members of the joint aviation authorities but not members of the European Community, with a view to concluding an agreement establishing a European civil aviation safety authority that takes the legal form of an international organisation."
"The negotiations will be carried out in accordance with the negotiating directives and in accordance with the ad hoc procedures specified by the Council in order to ensure close coordination between the Community and its Member States."
"The authorisation to open negotiations entailed the establishment of a special committee to which the Commission is obliged to submit a draft text of the founding treaty before commencing negotiations."
"The Commission has prepared a first draft text which has recently been submitted to the members of the special committee."
"When a text has been finalised it will serve as a basis for the negotiations with the European countries outside the Community."
"It is envisaged that such negotiations can be finalised within the course of this year The European Parliament will naturally be kept fully informed of the process."
"The convention will then have to be ratified by the contracting parties and signatories in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements."
"For the Community this will be done in conformity with Article 228 of the Treaty, that is after consultation of this Parliament by the Council."
"In order to avoid delay in implementation it is envisaged that the potential contacting parties should agree to implement the convention on a provisional basis as early as possible."
"Thank you for your reply."
"I have asked this question on behalf of the voters in my country who are interested in what you have to say."
"I am not especially knowledgeable myself, but I understand from Commissioner Kinnock's remarks that 'things are coming along', the task is on the way to completion and work is progressing on the forthcoming convention."
"I am well aware that it is not possible for Mr Kinnock to tell us when it is likely to be completed or become a reality, since it will have to be ratified by the Member States."
"However, I should still like to have some idea of when we may expect the convention to enter into force, as it is a matter of considerable importance for all the Member States of the Union and for people in general."
"I am getting used to procedures here very gradually."
"I share the honourable Member's eagerness to ensure that the safety authority is established quickly and is soon operational."
"Indeed, I think I can safely say that there is nothing but goodwill towards this development which is why, exceptionally, we have a provision which will allow for the operation of the convention on a provisional basis as soon as possible."
"Everybody is working in a cooperative spirit and I hope the time for the establishment and operation of this essential safety authority is now not far away."
"I doubt, however, whether it will fall within the term of this Commission."
"I just hope that I will be invited to the opening ceremony because we worked damned hard to get it."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"We trust you will be invited to that opening ceremony and to many more."
"Question No 44 by Bernie Malone (H-0209/99)"
"Subject: Dumping of canned fruit on South African market Is the Commission aware of the profoundly detrimental impact that certain aspects of the present Common Agricultural Policy are having on many third-world farmers?"
"Does the Commission agree that this situation is undoing much of the good work being done by Community development policy, and if so, what does the Commission intend to do to rectify this?"
"I should like to welcome Mr Pinheiro and ask him to reply to Mrs Malone's question."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question put to me by Bernie Malone could also apply to other products in the past, especially beef, during the upheaval on the South African market."
"European exports rose during that period but the situation has now been rectified."
"As for the issue of canned fruit and vegetables on the South African market, I can tell you that European exports are extremely small."
"The only product of any significance is canned tomatoes, but even they account for no more than 7 % of the market."
"They are therefore unlikely to lead to any sort of crisis or cause major concern."
"As far as the fruit and vegetable market in South Africa is concerned, the country suffered serious problems in the wake of the World Trade Organisation agreements, especially since South Africa applied a highly irrational customs system, often imposing customs duties instead of quotas."
"In some cases, the reduction in customs duties was excessive."
"The situation was such that, when we started negotiating the cooperation and trade agreement with South Africa, we had to accept - and did - that the principles of 'stand still' and 'roll back' - traditionally sacrosanct principles in negotiations and free trade agreements - could be subject to a number of exemptions in the case of South Africa, so as to take account of the unusually large reduction in customs duties on certain South African products and, specifically, on goods such as canned fruit and vegetables."
"The negotiations that took place forced us to look in detail at our bilateral trade in canned fruits and vegetables and all other products and enabled us to reach a satisfactory solution: South African exports to Europe will continue to take account of our ability to absorb them, the country's export capacity and the Community's own supplies."
"These were by no means easy negotiations but I can tell you that the final outcome is well-balanced. It is true that some Mediterranean countries maintain that we were too generous with the South Africans."
"For my part, I feel that the negotiations were balanced and that they open the way for achieving a sustainable market."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"This is an area of European policy that a lot of citizens are very worried about."
"You are aware of the campaign that is being run in relation to canned tomatoes in particular."
"It is not just a few people campaigning but it is a massive campaign."
"Many of the letters I receive in Dublin are from members of religious orders, for example."
"They have a very healthy respect for the European Union but they disagree fundamentally with the way the common agricultural policy operates with regard to all the areas mentioned in relation to food and also in relation to fisheries."
"You know yourself that the agreement with South Africa was held up because of the fisheries question, too."
"Europeans are going down there and trawling for whatever they can get, damaging the indigenous fishing industry."
"You have to take more into account the whole question of, not just giving aid, but fair trade."
"I would like you to come back and tell us what reply I can give to the people who have written to me."
"As regards canned tomatoes, the largest exports that we had account for roughly 7 % of the South African market."
"As regards other African countries, our exports are of roughly 90 000 tonnes for the whole ACP area."
"So, I do not think frankly they are disrupting the internal market in South Africa."
"As regards fisheries, nowadays there is no access for European boats to South African waters."
"We have asked South Africa to put us on an equal footing with other countries which have access to South African waters."
"It is not asking too much to be considered on an equal footing especially when we are prepared to open up our markets to South African fisheries products in a way which suits South Africa."
"It is quite easy to blame big Europe for some of the difficulties that exist from time to time in South Africa."
"But let me reassure you that in the Development Council, and in the Commission as well, we have been looking very carefully at all the potential inconsistencies between CAP policies and development policies."
"The problem with beef arose a few years ago and I am quite confident that has been solved and that there is no such problem today."
"But if one should occur, we are always prepared to deal with it."
"Our policy is to have coherence between the CAP and development policy."
"So we are always open to listen to complaints and study them, in any situation whatsoever."
"I congratulate the Commissioner on his valour in doing the dirty work for DG VI on this question but the information that I have received is that dumping of cheap subsidised tomatoes on South Africa has had very serious consequences for domestic producers there."
"It may only be 7 % spread over a year but the information I have received and which I will pass on to you is that a flood of cheap tomatoes, particularly last year, contributed to the loss of some 10 000 jobs in the canning industry, in areas with extremely high unemployment in South Africa."
"Certainly the trade unions and others have been blaming the European Union for that."
"I think that matter does need looking at again."
"On a related matter: as you know, when the trade agreement with South Africa was rejected by the General Affairs Council, France raised the general issue of export refunds as one of its reasons for refusing the deal."
"Can you tell us how confident you are that the meeting of 22 March will endorse the trade agreement?"
"Sometimes subsidies are paid to canned-tomato producers because the price at which they have to purchase tomatoes is higher than the international average price."
"So it is to compensate them for the higher prices which the CAP imposes on tomatoes, to ensure a level playing field as regards canned tomatoes."
"Sometimes we are accused of dumping because of those subsidies to the producers of canned tomatoes."
"I do not think it is appropriate to use that word."
"The overall amount was 6 500 tonnes of canned tomatoes."
"That is the figure of our exports to South Africa which accounts for 7 % of their consumption."
"No doubt, after these two interventions, we will look at it again, together with DG VI."
"As to trade agreement and refunds, it was indeed suggested at a certain moment in the negotiations that if South Africa would lower some tariffs we would phase out our export refunds."
"For the European Union, the difficulty for France is not with the specificity of a given product but the fact that these may rise or may open up the door for phasing out export subsidies altogether, which France is not prepared to do at this stage."
"The compromise of lowering tariffs, phasing out export subsidies: at the end the one who pays is the South African consumer."
"So for South Africa it was not such a big deal."
"That is why when France raised some difficulties, I immediately said that I had no doubt whatsoever that I could take it out of the agreement without any difficulty at all, because in the end it would be South Africa which would have to pay for this kind of deal."
"That was why I said I would take it out immediately because South Africa, of course, was ready to accept that."
"Mr President, following the Commissioner's answer I would like to put a general question to the Commission."
"Is it really in the EU's interest that we thereby also put many of our trading partners in a very difficult position?"
"Is it really in our interest that we thereby cause market disturbances, whereas in my view it would be far more important to have strong partners and fair competition?"
"Mr President, I agree 100 % with Mrs Schierhuber."
"The problem is that in trade negotiations we must bear in mind the interests of our Member States."
"That is our first obligation."
"The second is to try to make the agreement as fair as possible and take account of the special requirements of the other party."
"That is where negotiations sometimes throw up difficult points for one side or the other and that is why sometimes it is difficult to reach an agreement."
"I have to say, however, that in my opinion the European Union was exemplary in the way in which it took account of certain legitimate South African concerns - in particular the fact that it had inherited a difficult situation in terms of how customs duties were applied, and the need to restructure the automobile and textile sectors (something now under way), to mention just two examples. Similarly, we met with some understanding on the South African side over some of the problems that we face within the European Union, reflected in some specific points of the agreement."
"I still believe that this agreement is a good one and have high hopes that on 22 March, perhaps with some fine tuning, the Member States will see the final outcome as positive for the European Union and acceptable for each of the Member States."
"But, as for the principle, I fully agree with Mrs Schierhuber."
"Question No 45 by Fernando Pérez Royo (H-0121/99)"
"Subject: Fishing in Gibraltar Has the Commission studied the situation in Gibraltar, in the wake of last week's events (the seizure of the Spanish fishing boat 'Piraña' by the Gibraltarian authorities), and is it planning to take any measures to ensure that Community legislation is respected?"
"I should like to welcome Mrs Bonino and ask her to reply to Mr Pérez Royo's question."
"All the Commission has to say is that the cause of the conflict between the Spanish fishermen and the Gibraltar inspectorate does not in any way involve infringement of Community fisheries regulations."
"It concerns the limits of territorial waters, a matter which is not within the Community's competence."
"As it has said many times in the past and reiterated only recently, the Commission is not therefore empowered to intervene directly in this situation. All the Commission can do is encourage both parties to resolve the problem and maintain contact with the governments involved."
"The Commission does however regret that because of its legal basis, this issue does not fall within the Community's competence."
"The events to which my question refers - the detention of the crew of a Spanish fishing vessel in Spanish waters by the Gibraltarian police - are indeed a matter for international law and do not involve the Commission directly."
"Nevertheless, these events took place in an area where Community law does apply."
"The area in question is covered by the Treaty. Indeed, serious doubts have also been cast on the effective application of a whole range of Community directives in this area relating not only to fisheries but also to other issues such as taxation, finance, money laundering and so on."
"This apart, I should like to make a final political comment."
"I agree with your remarks on good relations and the need to create a climate in which this and other disputes can be handled in a reasonable way, avoiding unnecessary tension in the area. Such tension has a negative impact on both the Spanish and the Gibraltarian populations, though the Spanish population are uppermost in my mind at present."
"The appropriate climate in which to deal with this dispute in a reasonable way will not be created by making life difficult for the local Spanish population."
"What is needed at the moment is a series of measures designed to reduce the tension which has built up in the area. Only then will it be possible to resolve this dispute and any others which might arise in the future."
"The Commission shares the view that it is essential to reduce tension and work towards a solution."
"I feel it would also be relevant to read you a note on the application of Community law to the sectors you mentioned. The text of the note is as follows:"
"The Commission seeks to ensure the correct implementation of Community directives in Gibraltar as it does in all areas of the Community, taking account of the particular regime that applies to Gibraltar as defined in particular in the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom."
"Where appropriate the Commission has launched infringement proceedings against the UK for failure to implement applicable directives."
"In the area of company law, for example, the Commission has sent four reasoned opinions to the UK for failure to implement company law directives in the territory of Gibraltar, etc. etc."
"This is just to explain that although, strictly speaking, the matter is not within the Commission's competence, we are working to ensure that the acquis communautaire is applied, as it should be in all cases."
"I wish the Commissioner well in her presidential campaign in Italy."
"I will support your campaign."
"This is a very important point which was brought up by Mr Pérez Royo, particularly the matter of is it planning to take any measures to ensure the Community legislation is respected?"
"In terms of actually reducing tension in that area, the most important thing is to start to implement freedom of movement between Gibraltar and Spain."
"If we actually started that and sorted it out locally, as the fishing dispute has been pretty well sorted out locally between those two communities, tensions would disappear very quickly."
"So could the Commissioner suggest ways in which Mr Pérez Royo could help towards that freedom of movement as required by the Treaties, and reduce those tensions?"
"I do not think it is a real question."
"It is mostly a debate between two Member States."
"The Commission is really trying to de-escalate and help so you can both resolve this conflict."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say to Mr Teverson that I am not campaigning for any presidency."
"It is procedurally impossible in my country."
"There is no question about it."
"I am a full-time commissioner and I will act as a commissioner, full-time, as is my duty."
"I merely wish to make a remark concerning the limits of territorial waters."
"There is no reference to territorial waters surrounding the Rock in the Treaty of Utrecht, which justifies and legitimises certain British activities in Gibraltar."
"You will be aware, Commissioner, that according to the Treaty of Utrecht, the town and fortress of Gibraltar were ceded to the United Kingdom. However, that Treaty does not cover the area later occupied by the British and which does not have territorial waters."
"The extent of Spanish and British territorial waters has never been specified, because although Spain recognises the Treaty of Utrecht, it disputes the United Kingdom's claims in this respect."
"Furthermore, Spain's claims were not affected in any way by its accession to the Community."
"On 12 June 1985, Spain signed the Accession Treaty along with the United Kingdom."
"On 15 June, letters were exchanged with the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, making it quite clear that Spain's accession to the Community did not affect its claim to Gibraltar."
"Thank you, Mr Morán."
"Mrs Bonino, I invite you to respond to Mr Morán's remarks."
"Mrs Bonino tells me that no response is necessary."
"Thank you for being here today, Mrs Bonino, and thank you for your replies and for your courtesy."
"Question No 46 by Robin Teverson (H-0132/99)"
"Subject: Fraud In the event of fraud, who should take responsibility for a directorate-general's finances - the individual Commissioner in charge of the directorate-general, the Director-General of the DG concerned, or the entire Commission?"
"I should like to welcome Mrs Gradin and ask her to reply to Mr Teverson's question."
"The Commission bears the overall political responsibility for budget execution and for the fight against fraud."
"It may delegate management of individual budget lines to a Member of the Commission or to a Director-General."
"In any specific case of fraud, it is the individual who committed the crime who will be held legally responsible."
"However, the Commission or Commissioner or the Director-General concerned are still responsible for appropriate control and management measures being put in place."
"I thank the Commissioner for that reply with words like 'responsibility' and 'individual responsibility for certain areas'."
"My supplementary question is very precise."
"If the report from the experts finds very specific problems within the Commission, will that mean that individual Commissioners will at that time take responsibility for the areas under them and, if appropriate politically, resign individually?"
"I need only a short answer, just one word will do in any of the official languages."
"I have already given the answer and I am not going to say what will happen after the Committee of Wise Men give their report."
"Commissioner, in the Committee on Budgetary Control Mrs Cresson recently denied any knowledge of certain scandals."
"Meanwhile we have learned that she was informed of them by her administration and we now want to know: who is it who has to resign here?"
"The official who informed her or the Commissioner who falsely said in committee that she had no knowledge of these facts?"
"I would like to ask Mrs Gradin whether she would reinstate Paul van Buitenen, who was suspended because he took the trouble to give an elected representative a document which he believed the elected representatives ought to read as part of the investigation into fraud at the Commission?"
"Mr President, it seems to me that we have digressed from the question that was put to me and to which I have already replied."
"So I think that is enough for today!"
"Question No 47 by Jan Andersson (H-0136/99)"
"Subject: The Commission's action programme on drugs The EU's current action programme on drugs is due to end soon, and the Commission is said to be drawing up a new action programme."
"Will the Commission say what the timetable is for putting together its new action programme on drugs?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Gradin to answer Mr Andersson's question, which has now been taken over by Mrs Hulthén."
"As you know, the EU's current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year."
"The European Council has therefore requested the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission to draw up a new action plan for the period 2000 to 2004."
"In the Commission, the work is progressing well."
"Most of our services are directly involved and are now working flat out to produce their contribution."
"I and my officials are responsible partly for the internal coordination of the work and partly for the sectors that have a bearing on the area of justice and home affairs."
"It takes several decades to develop a European drugs policy."
"Consequently, my premiss is that the EU's actions must have a sound body of knowledge and well-evaluated experience on which to build."
"In the long term, therefore, continuity and consistency will be the main themes in our forthcoming proposal."
"As a result, our contribution will build on the previous plan, but it will include an evaluation of what has been accomplished during the last five-year period."
"And last but not least, we are describing new trends and tendencies that require special treatment."
"Our goal is to be in a position to present the new action plan by the end of the spring - in May."
"Our proposal will then as usual be forwarded directly to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for further consideration."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Gradin for her reply."
"This is merely an observation, but it will presumably be another Parliament and presumably another Commission too that will be adopting a position on the new action plan."
"While the issue is still under discussion, and since Mrs Gradin has just mentioned some points that will be central to the new action plan, it would be interesting to know which areas she is intending to concentrate on."
"For example, is the Commission in a position to say, in terms of preventive measures in the face of new types of drugs, how we are going to safeguard our external frontiers to ensure that we do not have more drugs inside the Union than we do at present?"
"We should appreciate a reply on that aspect too."
"Most of the private offices and directorates are already involved."
"What is needed is a combination of repressive measures and social commitment."
"We should therefore be trying to combine a policy of repression with social responsibility."
"We shall be discussing the new trends in consumption and trafficking and the prospects for the future."
"We shall also be discussing what is to be done at international level to evaluate and meet the new challenges."
"We shall look into how we are going to involve the Central and Eastern European countries that are currently knocking at our door and asking to be admitted as members."
"Accordingly, we shall be discussing access to and demand for drugs, and of course the new trends such as synthetic drugs, as well as the need for Europe to keep its own house in order if it is to be a credible cooperation partner, for example on the international stage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I was in America again recently and one thing was crystal clear to me: drugs cannot just be combated at the frontiers, by checking consignments from the producer countries to the consumer countries; it is far more effective to shape the legal system in the consumer countries in such a way as to make drugs traffic more difficult, as is done in the United States for instance."
"What does the Commission propose to do to combat drugs here in Europe?"
"Like the USA, the Commission is working at international level."
"We have formed cooperation links in Latin America and in the golden triangle in order to promote alternative types of crops and to restrict access to drugs."
"At the same time, we are tackling the problem of consumption, just as we have in the Member States."
"In this respect, we are extremely keen to involve voluntary organisations as well as schools and parents, since we believe that the people who practise drug abuse do not just listen to us politicians, but that the efforts of friends in the workplace and at school are also needed to influence and dissuade them."
"Consequently, we are trying to tackle this very serious problem on all fronts."
"Question No 48 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0149/99)"
"Subject: Illegal emigration from northern Morocco to the EU What is the Commission's view, with regard to illegal emigration, of the current situation and possible future developments in the Straits of Gibraltar and north Morocco area?"
"What progress and improvements are in prospect?"
"What steps will be taken to prevent deaths among those making the crossing in small boats next summer?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Gradin to answer Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question."
"Illegal immigration to the European Union from northern Morocco is, in many cases, a straightforward matter of the smuggling of human beings."
"It is not only a pressing problem for the Member States in the Mediterranean region, but also concerns, to a large extent, the entire European Union."
"The individuals who allow themselves to be persuaded by the people-smugglers are, more often than not, the poorest and most vulnerable migrants, some of whom are desperately seeking better living conditions and are prepared to take enormous risks to achieve their goal."
"Others fall victim to the modern slave trade in women that goes on all over Europe."
"Each year, a growing number of young women are lured by false promises of well-paid work into prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation."
"Many lives are wasted every year because of the depredations of the people-smugglers."
"We know for certain that those who try to reach the coast of Europe by sea from Morocco often meet a grim fate."
"The battle against the trade in people must remain a priority in the Union."
"During the past year, a great deal has also been done to step up cooperation in precisely this area within the Union."
"In 1996, the EDU's mandate was extended to include the smuggling of human beings."
"With the establishment of Europol, the Union's capacity in this area will be further enhanced."
"In November of the same year, the Council of Ministers also set up the STOP programme, the aim of which was to strengthen the Member States' ability to combat the trade in human beings."
"It has enabled us to support and encourage an exchange of experiences and to pursue activities to raise the level of competence throughout Europe."
"Together with the American Government, we have also carried out preventive work in the countries where the trade in women originates."
"Among other initiatives, campaigns have been mounted with the aim of trying to make young girls aware of the risks involved in trying to reach Europe with the help of people-smugglers."
"These measures are only regarded as a first step along the right road."
"Obviously, major economic interests are at stake and fundamental values are being put to the test."
"In future, the Commission will continue to avail itself of every opportunity to put a stop to the smuggling of human beings."
"It is also gratifying that the new Treaty makes it easier for us to really get to grips with this problem in the future."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply, which was doubtless well-intentioned."
"Her reply was very specific as far as the analysis of the problem was concerned, but quite inadequate when it came to the Commission's competence, that is to say, the measures it plans to take."
"The feeling here is that her answer has not provided us with any information at all."
"As you stated yourself, Commissioner, the problem is very serious indeed but certain measures could easily be taken."
"For instance, in the summer it would perhaps be possible to set up surveillance operations to detect the flimsy craft used to make the crossing."
"Such arrangements already exist to detect fishing operations and fish, yet we seem unable to do the same in order to detect people."
"In addition, television campaigns designed to dissuade would-be immigrants from making the crossing could be broadcast on television in northern Morocco."
"The Commission is doing nothing at all to cope with the very serious problems which exist on the southern borders of the European Union. For you to reply to a question like this by merely setting out all the possible measures amounts to an abdication of responsibility."
"It amounts to saying nothing at all, Commissioner."
"Of course the Union is doing a great deal, as I made clear in my reply to the honourable Member."
"There are good prospects for Europol, but at the same time, if it is to achieve practical results in its surveillance operations, as the honourable Member would like it to do, this has to be done through cooperation with and between the Member States."
"We know that there are boats plying between Morocco and Spain and Gibraltar, and that the different authorities concerned are cooperating fully."
"I have been to the places in question myself to see what is being done, both as regards control of the trade in human beings and the presence of drugs on these boats."
"Of course practical measures are being carried out, in which Europol is also participating."
"Furthermore, the Council of Ministers has only recently set up a high-level group specifically to study the countries from which large numbers of people are trying to reach our nations."
"In point of fact, Morocco is one of the countries they will be studying in that context."
"It appears that I have to contradict what you have just said, Commissioner, because I have been informed by the director of Europol himself that no operation or investigation is currently under way concerning the organised mafias operating along the south-western border of Europe. I am referring in particular here to the area of northern Africa which has a direct influence on the migratory pressures originating in the Maghreb."
"I should like to enquire what the Commission's view is on this blatant neglect of an area through which such significant migration towards Europe takes place, neglect recognised by the director of Europol himself. I should also like to know what steps the Commission intends to take to ensure that Europol does turn its attention to this dreadful scourge of organised crime which is leading to so many tragic deaths around the Straits of Gibraltar."
"With regard to Europol, I should be extremely grateful for the support of this House so that we can get Europol up and running at long last."
"The convention itself has been ratified, but there are a number of protocols which still need to be ratified by the Member States before Europol can fully enter into force."
"Consequently, I should really appreciate your support since this would allow us to further reinforce its work."
"Mr President, how is it planned to distribute the burden in regard to this problem within Europe?"
"What do you think are the target routes here?"
"As the honourable Member will be aware, during the four years that I have been a Member of the Commission, I have worked hard to bring about a situation in which we all share the burden."
"The first proposal was not accepted, and another proposal is now before the Council of Ministers."
"Unfortunately, some Member States are deeply committed to burden-sharing, while others are not."
"As you know, unanimity is required to reach a decision under the third pillar, which functions on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation."
"I had hoped that we would have made more progress, but we may now hope that the German Presidency will be successful in persuading its colleagues that what is needed is a really vigorous effort."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin."
"That brings us to the end of the time set aside for questions to Mrs Gradin."
"Question No 49 will therefore receive a written answer."
"Question No 50 by Concepció Ferrer (H-0111/99)"
"Subject: Follow-up to the complaint concerning unfair trade measures which has been lodged with the TWO At the end of 1997, in response to trade restrictions imposed on exports of skins and hides produced in India, the Commission initiated a WTO dispute settlement procedure in order to protect the interests of the European leather sector which had been suffering from the harmful effects of those restrictions for some time."
"From the initial consultations held in Geneva at the beginning of 1998 there emerged clear confirmation of the fact that the complaint lodged by the Commission was justified."
"Since that first meeting under the procedure laid down by the TWO, it appears that the negotiations have ground to a halt."
"Could the Commission explain why a date has not yet been set for a resumption of the dispute settlement procedure?"
"I should like to welcome Sir Leon and ask him to reply to Mrs Ferrer's question."
"The de facto export ban on hides and skins by India led the Community to hold formal WTO consultations at the beginning of 1998."
"The Commission has repeatedly raised its concerns with regard to the GATT incompatibility of the Indian regime since then."
"The Indian authorities finally promised in October 1998 to seriously consider the suggestion of replacing the current export licensing scheme by tariff-based measures which could take the form of an export tax."
"In the context of the preparation of the new budget such a proposal is currently being discussed by the Indian authorities."
"We are closely monitoring the matter and should know whether the regime has been modified within the next few weeks."
"I remain hopeful that we will be able to solve this sensitive issue."
"If that does not happen by the time of my planned visit to India in early April I intend to raise this matter at Ministerial level."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, and thank you also for pursuing the matter of the Indian Government's failure to comply with regulations on opening up the markets for leather goods. I would however like to ask you as a matter of urgency to move things on as quickly as possible, so as to guarantee full compliance with the rules governing international trade."
"I am not making this request as a matter of principle but because it is the only way of ensuring that all those companies that have been making great efforts to update their business and become competitive are able to export freely and thus ensure their survival."
"Once again, I urge you to remain vigilant. If you wait until April, many companies may already have closed, precisely because of the difficulties involved in exporting."
"I do appreciate the importance of the imports of raw material for the European tanning industry and I can assure you that I take this issue very seriously."
"I cannot promise a result before April."
"We are pressing hard and we will continue to press and take whatever action is open to us."
"Question No 51 by Paul Rübig (H-0113/99)"
"Subject: Differences in punitive duties and voting behaviour in the Council There are many aspects to the trans-Atlantic discussions on banana imports into the EU."
"One fundamental issue relates to the selective imposition of punitive US duties on imports from thirteen Member States."
"The equivalent of the sum that has been announced amounts to unilaterally estimated losses of EURO 508 million."
"The banana market organisation applies equally to all fifteen Member States."
"Within the WTO, too, the EU speaks with one voice."
"However, punitive duties which affect the EU Member States in different ways distort comparative costs and competition in the Internal Market."
"What action will the Commission take to ensure that sanctions imposed by third countries do not deliberately favour individual Member State, so that such 'tactical manoeuvres' do not affect future voting behaviour in the Council and overshadow common interests?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Rübig's question."
"I agree that the issue raised is serious."
"There are two reasons why third countries exclude some Member States from retaliatory measures against the Community."
"First, Member States are still, separately from the Community, individual members of the WTO."
"Secondly, the origin rules applicable to imports to third countries from the Community are still based on individual Member States."
"Although Community legislation provides for the notion of Community origin, which is mandatory in certain situations, US and other third countries continue to make a distinction between Member States in this field."
"It is worth recalling that retaliatory measures may only be applied legally after authorisation by the WTO."
"In the case of the bananas dispute the United States has not received such authorisation."
"Mr President, my supplementary concerns the punitive tariffs themselves that the United States has imposed unilaterally."
"According to our view of the law these measures are direct trade restrictions that even now, at this cautionary stage, are inflicting serious damage on our domestic firms."
"How will you bring claims for compensation in the event that the WTO panel declares these measures inadmissible on principle or in terms of their level?"
"If our case against the United States on the basis that the measures that have been taken are unlawful is successful, then either the United States will have to withdraw the measures and give us compensation or we will be entitled to take lawful retaliation."
"Question No 52 by Arthur Newens (H-0127/99)"
"Subject: Trade with Cuba Would the Commission make a statement about the trade agreement reached with the United States in May 1998 and whether it is still likely to come into operation, and will it give details of the present state of trade between the EU, its Member States and Cuba and of the effect that the Helms-Burton Act is having upon those relations?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Newens's question."
"The agreements reached with the United States on Helms-Burton and ILSA legislation in May last year represent important progress on the issue."
"The Commission continues to work towards full implementation of these agreements."
"The onus is on the United States but we on our side are ready to implement the agreements once the United States grants a waiver under Title IV of the Helms-Burton Act as foreseen in the London Agreements."
"From the outset we have expressed determined opposition to both acts."
"As part of the defence of the European Union against the extra-territorial effects of these acts the Council passed the blocking statute in November 1996."
"Its object is to counter the extra-territorial effects of legislation on a third country, such as the Helms-Burton Act and ILSA on the territory of the Community."
"Detailed statistics on EU trade with Cuba are not available. We have consistently taken the view that such trade is legitimate."
"The Helms-Burton Act has had a chilling effect in the past and may have distorted the channels in which trade has flowed."
"That is why the May 1998 agreement was an important step forward."
"While thanking the Commissioner for his answer, I do not accept that it is true that as long as Congress in the United States refuses to agree to the waiving of Titles III and IV, no real progress in implementing the basis of the agreement can be put into effect."
"At the same time, some individuals, some traders and some companies who would otherwise trade with Cuba are playing safe and holding off."
"In those circumstances, how much longer can we continue with this state of affairs in which there is real uncertainty for all concerned?"
"Does he see any change taking place in the near future?"
"It is true that the agreement is not fully implemented and cannot be until Congress passes the necessary legislation."
"It is not true, however, to say that it has no effect."
"I would draw the attention of those whom you describe to the fact that, since the agreement was entered into, no coercive action has been taken against any European company or individual under either of the two pieces of legislation."
"That is something that the businessmen should note and a lot of trade is going on."
"As to further progress, we are pressing the US Congress and have made it clear that we will not implement our part of the rest of the agreement until they implement theirs."
"Question No 53 by Hugh McMahon (H-0174/99)"
"Subject: Predatory pricing and dumping of salmon by Norwegian producers in European markets Can the Commission inform Parliament of the steps it has recently taken with respect to actions against Norwegian companies which have flouted agreements with the EU through practices of predatory pricing in the salmon market and will it indicate which Norwegian companies have been involved in such practices?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr McMahon's question."
"In June 1997 an agreement was reached with Norway as part of the definitive anti-dumping and countervailing measures."
"These consist mainly of individual price undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters."
"The Commission devotes considerable resources to monitoring those undertakings and 84 exporters have now had duties imposed upon them because they breached or withdrew from their undertakings."
"In addition, the market is being constantly monitored, the time given for the reports on the undertakings has been shortened, and when the monitoring showed that the minimum price for salmon fillets was too low, it was increased to include an amount for processing costs."
"Having found that a number of parties with undertakings were not exporters, those parties were made to withdraw their undertakings, and after it appeared that the proceeds of the Norwegian export tax, which is part of the countervailing measures, were not used in accordance with the agreement, a further agreement between the European Union and Norwegian industries was entered into in October 1998 to deal with that."
"More recently, the Commission and the Norwegian authorities have agreed on further joint action specifically to root out the possibilities of circumvention."
"Norway introduced in December 1998 a regulation making it illegal for there to be any salmon sales to the Community via intermediary exporters not bound by the undertakings."
"The Commission mirrored this restriction and the text of the undertakings also included a stricter minimum price provision where importers related to exporters in Norway source salmon from other intermediary importers in the Community."
"I thank the Commissioner for a very full answer."
"Could he give me an up-to-date position?"
"I understand from sources in the Scottish industry that there is a major company involved in Norway at the moment."
"Would he be prepared to give the House the name of this major company?"
"It is not entirely clear what the major company is supposed to have done or which one the honourable Member is referring to."
"As I have said, 84 exporters have had the undertakings replaced by duties instead."
"I do not know which particular one the honourable gentleman is referring to."
"If he would like to write to me giving me the details, I will see whether there is any further information I am able to supply."
"Question No 54 by Richard Howitt (H-0217/99)"
"Subject: Burma Selective Purchase Law In 1996, the State of Massachusetts in the USA introduced the Burma Selective Purchase Law banning government procurement from companies that do business in Myanmar."
"The EC expressed its opposition to the Federal authorities and also filed a complaint before the WTO."
"Aware that this complaint has temporarily been suspended awaiting the results of a legal investigation into the validity of its ruling, the fact that the Commission submitted a complaint before the WTO is not only contradictory to its own policies imposing sanctions against Myanmar and expressing concern for human rights violations, but it can also be considered a cynical act of impeding an attempt to set a precedent in making international trade policies more coherent with international human rights standards."
"Can the Commission explain why it applies such contradictory policies and has pursued this policy, thus expressing a contempt for human rights in Myanmar?"
"Under what circumstances can it withdraw its complaint?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Howitt's question."
"Our position on Burma is clear: we deplore the situation facing the people there and support Member States in their determination to maintain pressure on the leadership."
"This has led to the adoption of a common position on Burma and the withdrawal of GSP benefits."
"Last October the Council adopted an extension to the common position and strengthened it through the widening of a visa ban and by suspending high-level government visits to Burma."
"We have also sought to coordinate policies on Burma internationally in order to make the actions of all concerned more effective."
"While our objectives as far as Burma is concerned are similar to those of the United States, that does not mean that we can condone the flagrant breach of international obligations arising from the Massachusetts law."
"We took the decision to request the panel to rule on the compatibility of the law with the relevant WTO rules, in particular the plurilateral government procurement agreement in July 1998, after having failed in two years to resolve the matter in other ways."
"The National Foreign Trade Council of the United States also challenged the Massachusetts law and the US District Court last November declared the law unconstitutional and suspended its application, so, naturally, we suspended our proceedings in the WTO but the American court ruling is under appeal."
"Our decision to complain to the WTO is not an endorsement of the regime; it is about ensuring predictability in the international trading environment and adhering to internationally binding trade rules."
"There is no contradiction between the steps we have taken against the Burma regime and our expectation that the United States observes its international commitments."
"Thank you, Commissioner, I think you will understand that I profoundly disagree with your answer though it was helpful to the House that you expressed it so clearly."
"The contradiction was contained in what you said."
"For us to deplore human rights abuses in Burma and say that we wish to coordinate actions internationally to make the Burmese regime change its policies and then to eschew the opportunity of using trading opportunities through the WTO in order to coordinate those actions is contradictory."
"I appreciate that we have a set of rules under the World Trade Organization but it has repeatedly been the position of this House, both in September last year when the actions of the Commission were condemned, and in my own report on codes of conduct of multinational companies, to say that we must use trading relations through the WTO to uphold trading which is ethical, and respects the environment and human rights."
"Can he answer the last part of my question which is under what circumstances, should the appeal go the other way in the United States, would the Commission withdraw and ensure that the panel is not revived?"
"The WTO proceedings are suspended at the moment because of the decision of the US district court."
"That has already happened."
"But I have to say that it is a very different question as to whether or not we should use trade sanctions for example under the WTO, where permitted by the WTO, and whether we should just accept that, without consultation and not as part of an international agreement, an individual state in the United States should take action to apply, as it were, its own foreign policy."
"We may have a very high degree of sympathy with the motives behind the Massachusetts legislature but you really cannot have a world trading system in which the particular way of imposing pressure on a country is determined by one state in one country with consequential affects upon the rest of the trading world."
"It damages the front against Burma for us to find fragmentary action of that kind being taken, which damages the European Union and is not part of a consolidated, agreed international package of action against a particular country which we have profound disagreements with."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"With that question by Mr Howitt, we have completed the group of questions to Sir Leon Brittan."
"We thank him for attending Question Time."
"Question No 55 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0107/99)"
"Subject: Transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings In reply to my Oral Question H-0761/98 , the Commission informed me that the Greek authorities had notified it, on 2 July 1998, of the provisions that they had adopted to incorporate Directive 80/723/EEC , as amended, into Greek law."
"However, owing to a disagreement over the obligations deriving from that Directive, the Commission had decided to wait for the supplementary information it had requested from the Greek authorities before expressing its opinion on the possible discontinuation of infringement proceedings."
"Could the Commission say precisely what the disagreement concerning the obligations deriving from Directive 80/723/EEC, as amended by Directive 93/84/EEC , consists of and whether the supplementary information provided by the Greek authorities does or does not warrant the discontinuation of the infringement procedure initiated against Greece in 1996 because the information provided was not consistent with the requirements of the above Directive?"
"I should like to welcome Mr Van Miert and ask him to reply to Mr Papayannakis's question."
"The Commission can inform the honorable Member that the disagreement in question concerned the scope of the obligation to inform the Commission under Article 5 of Directive 93/84/EEC."
"According to these provisions, Member States must in particular send the Commission a list of their public undertakings in the manufacturing sector by 31 March of each year at the latest."
"Non-compliance with this obligation constitutes an infringement of the law to which the Commission must respond through an appropriate procedure."
"A few days ago, on 3 March, Greece finally supplied the information requested and it seems satisfactory with regard to the undertakings in question."
"In so doing, Greece has therefore abandoned its alternative view of its obligations under the directive in question."
"Consequently, the Commission will in all likelihood discontinue the infringement proceedings, subject to a detailed analysis of the information provided."
"I can therefore give you good news as I believe that Greece is on the way to complying with Community law."
"Commissioner, as far as I understand it, the issue centres around whether the list of companies was submitted or not."
"What concerns me most, and what I would like your opinion on, is whether the provisions of the directive were adhered to, in particular as regards transparency and the actual use to which public funds were put."
"I personally am in favour of funds going to public companies on condition that there are clear objectives, that the methods of allocating the money are transparent, and that this is where the money actually goes."
"Does the Commission have any information on this or does it wish to comment on the issue, or was the dispute with Greece merely procedural?"
"A distinction must be made between the obligation deriving from the directive, which only now seems to have been complied with by Greece, as I have just indicated, and the scrutiny by the Commission of the report in question on the undertakings which are on the list."
"This is a different process on which I cannot comment at the moment, given that we only received a fairly full report a few days ago."
"I must congratulate and thank the Greek authorities for having finally agreed to fulfil their Community duty."
"Question No 56 by John Iversen (H-0144/99)"
"Subject: Merger The Commission is currently considering the notification of plans for a merger between Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier."
"How will the Commission ensure that a merger will not mean that Danish Crown/Vestjyske Slagterier acquires influence over and an insight into a smaller, competing business such as Defco Food, in which Danish Crown currently has a minority shareholding?"
"Defco is a limited company which manufactures and sells products to FDB and Dansk Supermarked in direct competition with Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier."
"Obviously, it is of the utmost importance for a company such as Defco that the merger does not mean that Danish Crown/Vestjyske Slagterier will acquire an insight into and influence over Defco Food."
"I give the floor to Mr Van Miert to answer Mr Iversen's question."
"I would like to thank you for your reply."
"The background to my question was a criticism of the merger."
"I fully understand it - in fact I think it is a sensible thing."
"I am a little tired of the fact that people have not been willing to look more closely at the problem which arises, for example, from the fact that the company concerned is dependent on Danish Crown."
"This means, amongst other things, that the company cannot give its employees the opportunity to buy shares because the new, very large merged company will be entitled to step in and acquire shares ahead of the employees."
"But I do understand that it is a difficult problem for the Commission to solve, so I would like to thank you for your reply."
"This is an issue which clearly concerns this House because I have answered questions on this before."
"As you know, we have stressed to the Spanish Government that it must notify this case because it involves what are called stranded costs."
"You will also know that this problem is not unique to Spain as it has arisen in several other Member States due to the electricity directive."
"We have stressed that, when a system of stranded costs is specified, this may in principle involve a public aid operation and therefore the Commission must at least be able to check whether this aid is in accordance with the stranded costs."
"As the problem is currently arising in different ways in several Member States, we are trying to develop a coherent method."
"With regard to the Spanish case, we have received the notification and are currently analysing this."
"Contact will no doubt be made with the Spanish authorities in the coming weeks in order to discuss the Commission's analysis."
"As for the consumer, given that this involves public aid, we must judge this case according to the rules in question, namely to see whether the 'aid' specified is actually compensation for the stranded costs."
"Consequently, consumer concerns are not a priority in these 'state aid' matters."
"These are the rules."
"Having said that, we must not ignore this issue."
"However, I must remind you that the rule requires the Commission to check whether, in such an operation, the specified aid exceeds what is justifiable."
"By doing this, I personally believe that we are also acting in the interests of consumers."
"In the first instance, if we try to limit any state aid, be it in this case or another case, to the strict minimum, at the end of the day it is to the benefit of the consumers because they are usually also taxpayers."
"Also, we are going to continue to pursue this case, as I explained earlier, the reason being that we felt that this case had to be notified to allow the Commission to do its job."
"Apart from that I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the declared aim of the policy, namely to liberalise the electricity sector, is entirely shared by the Commission."
"We feel that more flexibility, more real competition means that we have to see to it that in the energy sector companies do not have too much control of the market; that there is real competition, not only for companies, but also for the individual consumers."
"As you know, this is not yet the case with the directive."
"The directive is more modest."
"But we certainly share the view, which is apparently held by the Spanish Government, that one should liberalise beyond what has been agreed in the directive."
"That is being encouraged and acknowledged in a positive way by the Commission."
"But that should not distract us from our other task, to scrutinise whether the costs are strictly proportionate to the money which is under consideration."
"Commissioner, you must be aware that as things stand at the moment, these costs will be borne by domestic consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The rates they are charged will not be reduced as they should have been, even without taking liberalisation into account."
"Rule 3 of the Council's Rules of Procedure on the subject of aid states that aid will only be allocated following a Commission decision to authorise it. I do not know if the Commission is aware that the 4.5 % in question is already being deducted from the charges."
"Aid is therefore already being received. Do you intend to stand firm, Commissioner, and call the Spanish Minister for Industry to account tomorrow, insisting that such charges and the amounts already illegally charged to consumers be frozen, and insisting, too, that all these monies be returned until you authorise the aid?"
"There has clearly been a misunderstanding."
"The authorities should have notified their intentions under the directive and the majority have done this."
"However, it was not properly understood that this type of operation should also have been notified under Articles 92 and 93."
"We have had to stress this before certain governments would accept it and this has taken time."
"This has now been achieved. In short, there are two scrutinies: firstly the scrutiny under the directive, for which Mr Papoutsis is responsible, and secondly the scrutiny of a problem or case concerning a state aid."
"In the case in question, we recorded this as unnotified aid given that the measure had actually already been implemented."
"However, I must acknowledge that, given the rather confused and unclear situation and perhaps without any intention to mislead, certain governments thought that it was sufficient to notify the case under the directive."
"We are therefore in an embarrassing position with a government which, I believe in good faith, thought that it had done its work whereas we have had to remind it that it had additional work."
"This is the situation."
"As for the others, you will recall that in this very House I warned the authorities concerned that, as the case was being scrutinised, it was perhaps ill-advised to continue the measure in question, given that the result of the Commission's scrutiny must normally be awaited."
"You did indeed advise that in cases such as this, it would be wise to delay implementation of the mechanism provided for under Spanish law until the Commission's ruling was published."
"The fact is that the Spanish Government and the electricity companies have not heeded this advice and have already implemented the mechanism. This has given rise to the problem of how to reimburse customers if it turns out that they have been overcharged."
"How could millions of customers be reimbursed if the charge had already been included in their electricity bills?"
"Do you not think that in terms of monitoring state aid, which is what this really is, it would be more transparent and more workable if payments were made in stages, annually, through the state budget? Monitoring would also be easier and any wrongs could easily be righted should the need arise."
"Such an arrangement is already in place for aid to the coal sector. Do you not think that this would be a more sensible method than introducing a 4.5 % surcharge to electricity bills, as well as floating such aid on the financial markets?"
"Firstly, we warned the authorities that if they went ahead with the securitisation they would be doing so at their own risk. This is because, as I have already said, the situation remains uncertain until the Commission has completed its work, in this case drawn its conclusions from the scrutiny."
"However, the authorities are responsible for this."
"Secondly, with regard to the amounts, for the moment no one can say what these may be."
"I would repeat that it is only after scrutinising the stranded costs to check that these exist that we can conclude what amount is correct and justifiable in relation to these stranded costs."
"It is only then that we can say that a particular sum is acceptable for this stranded costs operation and that a sum beyond that is not acceptable."
"However, I will only be able to tell you this when our scrutiny is completed."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Question No 59 will not be taken because the subject to which it refers is included on the agenda of this part-session."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with that joint answer to Questions Nos 57 and 58, we have reached the end of the time set aside for questions to the Commission."
"Questions Nos 60 to 111 will therefore receive written answers."
"For reasons beyond the Chair's control, Question Time to the Commission has exceeded the allotted time by 42 minutes."
"This has placed a considerable strain on Parliament's services and I offer them my apologies."
"Their cooperation is much appreciated."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Own resources (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0105/99) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the need to modify and reform the European Union's own resources system."
"Mr President, I confess that, at the time, I doubted the chances of this report ever being drawn up. I was concerned about its consistency in relation to the report I have the honour of presenting on Agenda 2000."
"Now the draft report has been voted through in the Committee on Budgets and - this is not just a personal opinion - I admit that it seems not only superfluous but also counter-productive."
"And I say this whilst being fully aware of the work the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, has put into the report and the excellent hearing she organised where we all learned a great deal about own resources."
"But in my opinion, the Committee on Budgets has not reached the right conclusions."
"Frankly, I am concerned that the Committee on Budgets has submitted a text to this House which, I might add, does not correspond to the proposed commitments the rapporteur was defending yesterday in the meeting."
"The text of the motion for a resolution never really gets off the ground and it is also confused."
"What are we really talking about here?"
"In theory, we are discussing own resources. In practice, we are discussing national contributions."
"But this is an artificial problem. It was created by politicians themselves in the Member States but it lacks an objective basis and is strongly anti-European."
"It has no legal basis whatsoever."
"The Treaty has for many years included the concept that the European budget should be financed wholly from own resources, without prejudice to other revenue. In 1992, the Treaty on European Union, which was signed by the Maastricht Council and ratified by all the national parliaments, including those of the countries that joined afterwards, repealed Article 200."
"This was the article relating to national contributions and their scale."
"For electoral reasons and in order to appeal to the masses, the subject has been brought up again. We are undermining European political integration with all our comparative injustices between countries, budget balances, cheques and cries of 'I want my money back'."
"We talk about having more Europe, but some wish to see less Europe. This whole debate is leading to a renationalisation of the budget, and here I am not talking about cofinancing but rather about the general approach of the report by the Committee on Budgets."
"In my opinion, this motion for a resolution misses the point."
"It is unable to get away from the perverse logic of national contributions and step up the debate."
"As I see it, it does not complete its task of showing the Council what the medium-term objective should be."
"Ladies and gentlemen, how often do we have to point out that citizens pay taxes, not countries?"
"The main inequality has nothing to do with whether or not the level of contributions from Germany or the United Kingdom are fair, but rather that two citizens with the same income may contribute in totally different ways depending on the country they live in."
"As a result, it could be that the unemployed in Brandenburg are funding large estate owners in Andalusia."
"Therefore, we have a duty to ensure fair treatment insofar as every inhabitant of the European Union should contribute to the budget - this paltry budget that represents approximately 1.1 % of GNP - according to their income."
"This is the first injustice that must be rectified."
"One objective we must have is to introduce a straightforward and proportional European income tax."
"Yet what does the motion for a resolution suggest?"
"It concentrates on national balances that lead to rivalry and that discourage solidarity. And, to top it all, it suggests cofinancing the CAP, an idea that was rejected by this very House in November and that was even rejected by the government that proposed it to the Council."
"Mr President, my proposal may be utopian, as Mr Spinelli's was, but the proposal in the report is an anachronism."
"It is 25 years out of date."
"Mr President, the issue of own resources is, and always has been, extremely complex, as the system requires unanimity to change it and, above all, as improving its shortcomings by amending the current decision on own resources would give rise to other shortcomings and would most likely create new opposition."
"The Commission itself accepts that the shortcomings of the system are not sufficient to motivate an urgent amendment of the decision on own resources and confines itself to putting forward alternative solutions to addressing the problem of financial imbalances, which was raised by some Member States."
"Mrs Haug's report does not avoid this logic; it enlists the measures put forward in the short term solely to achieve the same objective, that is, to reduce the differences in contributions for the financing of Community expenditure, while in the medium and long term, it resorts to general recommendations."
"Mrs Haug has attempted to reconcile opposing views but unfortunately these remain as far apart as ever."
"In addition, we have focused all our attention on the issue of cofinancing agricultural subsidies and we have forgotten many other issues which we could have tackled and which, unfortunately, have gone by the board."
"The solution proposed in the report therefore, which is the partial cofinancing of the common agricultural policy, despite assertions to the contrary, essentially boils down to the partial renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. This touches on a fundamental aspect of Community policy, which goes beyond the amendments this policy is called upon to undergo in the context of Agenda 2000 not only due to the planned enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but also because of the commitments which the European Union has assumed in the context of GATT, which we are to some extent ignoring."
"What this new provision contains, moreover, runs counter to the philosophy we would expect to govern a union in which the achievement of EMU would normally provide the impetus to aim for greater unification rather than lead to the adoption of the notion of correcting financial imbalances which arise from its operation and from the implementation of policies which were defined many years ago."
"The notion of net financial surpluses is therefore a retrogressive notion and must be abandoned by the European Parliament."
"Any direct or indirect attempt to cofinance the common agricultural policy must also be abandoned."
"An increase in the receipts of some Member States cannot be made on the back of the reduction of the receipts of other Member States. Nor can it have the character of a correction."
"Quite the contrary: it must be creative, in other words it must be the outcome of participation in existing or unfolding new policies."
"Mr President, it would be a sad fact if the logic of financial accounting were to dominate, especially at a time when the eyes of the people of Europe are on the European Parliament in view of the forthcoming elections, and if we were to give the impression that we were betraying policies and achievements of the European Union that were of long-standing, great historical significance and of great importance in relation to issues which were fundamentally accounting solutions."
"Mr President, Mrs Haug's report on the organisation of the EU's own resources is both relevant and necessary."
"It aims at the heart of the matter, as Agenda 2000 negotiations have reached a critical stage."
"For that reason I wish to thank Mrs Haug most sincerely for an excellent report."
"The report's most important proposal concerns not EU income but expenditure, and suggests that the Member States should meet half the costs of the CAP."
"The proposal is a radical one and would have enormous consequences for the EU budget, which would shrink by some EUR 18 billion, approximately the cost of eastward enlargement."
"Thus the proposal would solve the financial problem threatening eastward enlargement."
"The common funding of agriculture would have an immense impact on net contributions."
"At a rough estimate, Germany's net contribution would be reduced by approximately EUR 1 300 million a year and that of the Netherlands by approximately EUR 450 million, while the contributions of Spain, Greece and France would increase by EUR 1 billion."
"The proposal would also have enormous consequences for matters of principle."
"If the point of departure here is for consumers to benefit from EU agricultural aid in the shape of reduced food prices, is it right that some producing countries should have to pay more?"
"Would it not be fairer if all those benefiting also paid?"
"From the point of view of the farmer, it is also a question of whether the new system will be as secure as the present one."
"The main question is whether the CAP should remain under the tightly-controlled jurisdiction of the EU, with levels of aid at least stable, and nationally based aid which does not distort the single market."
"Mrs Haug's report is an important addition to the Agenda 2000 debate, and to the ongoing preparation process for the next phase of the programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have noticed in this debate that those countries which are net beneficiaries do not wish to speak about net contributors or net beneficiaries, whereas this is exactly what the countries that are net contributors want to talk about."
"The issue is the financing of EU enlargement."
"We are now fighting over who is going to pay for it."
"On that basis I would like to express an opinion which is important to me and from our point of view generally."
"The total EU budget should not be increased by more than 1.27 %."
"The EU should not be given the powers to tax its citizens or collect taxes in the Member States: the money must be collected from the Member States themselves."
"The best basis for calculating how much each Member State should pay is GNP."
"I do not think it is out of the question to increase the share that agriculture itself contributes."
"It will only divide up EU income and expenditure in a new way, but we cannot object to that in principle."
"Mr President, this report gives us the opportunity to raise some important questions of principle regarding the financing of the European Union."
"In fact, the European Union's so-called 'own-resources' system - as it functions at present - seems to us to be dangerous for the taxpayer, as demonstrated by the changes in budgetary revenue in recent years."
"Studies on the economic rationality of parliaments - particularly, for example, those carried out by Professor Buchanan, who won a Nobel prize - have successfully demonstrated that parliaments are always interested in increasing taxes, the burden of which is shared amongst all taxpayers whilst the expenditure itself can relate to an individual group, and benefit a specific group of politicians."
"Owing to this rationality, each elected Member of the European Parliament therefore receives payment for expenditure which he can make in his constituency, and he is not disadvantaged by the burden of having to pay taxes which are levied by the national authorities."
"As regards the bureaucratic machinery itself, most of which comes under the Commission, its interest in extending the tax system is obvious."
"Numerous studies have shown that when the members of the general public themselves vote for taxes by referendum, as is the case in Switzerland and some states in the United States, for example, they do not vote at all as parliamentarians or bureaucrats would wish them to."
"This tells us a great deal."
"Admittedly, however, such referendums can only take place at local or national level, and it is difficult to imagine a large-scale referendum on tax taking place at European level."
"Therefore, if we want to avoid an increase in tax, it would seem preferable for the Union to be financed through payments made by the Member States that would be fixed on the basis of unanimity and would put into practice the principle of 'juste retour ' in order to prevent tax increases."
"Our defence of taxpayers therefore leads us to reject the Haug report."
"Finally, we should point out that defending the taxpayer is at the heart of defending the freedom of nations."
"Mr President, Mrs Haug's report represents a significant effort to draw together many differing strands of opinion."
"I want to congratulate her on that. However, she left me with a serious physiological dilemma: how to applaud her with one hand while gesticulating angrily to her with the other."
"A lot of her report deserves applause but she went somewhat awry when she tried to interfere in decisions that were made at Fontainebleau and were incorporated in the own resources decision, a decision which requires unanimity to change it."
"I speak on behalf of the British Labour Members on that major area of dissent."
"The United Kingdom rebate was created because of the inequity of our net contribution compared to our receipts from the Community budget."
"That inequity continues and the circumstances of Fontainebleau have not changed for the better."
"If anything, they have worsened over the years."
"Instead of threatening the United Kingdom rebate, what we ought to be concentrating all our efforts on doing is mitigating the necessity for the United Kingdom to have such a rebate."
"That means a combination of all of four things: agricultural spending reform and deep agricultural spending cuts; cofinancing in addition to that reform; a re-evaluation of the cohesion fund countries who have qualified to join the single European currency and therefore an examination of their entitlement together with a capping of the budget and strict budgetary stringency."
"Therefore, while I welcome much of the Haug report, the British Labour Members stand firmly behind the efforts of successive British Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair, in their just demand for budgetary fairness and equity."
"Mr President, I really think this is much ado about very little."
"We have spent the last three or four years talking about cutting back on spending at European level, freezing the budget and maintaining the present rate of spending."
"At the moment we spend 1.11 % of Community GDP and we have written a great volume on the whole question of how we are to collect this money."
"Personally, I think own-resources is whatever we decide own-resources are."
"Whatever European law says is own-resources, that is own-resources."
"Even if we ask the county councils or national governments to collect it and pass it on to us, that does not prevent it from being own-resources."
"So I think we make too much of that issue."
"The other point is the question of the just return."
"Maybe I am wrong when I tell people that when the European Union was founded there was a common agricultural policy not because it made absolute common sense that we took that particular industry and made it common, but because it was recognised that the single market would give great advantages to a skilled, industrialised country like Germany, and the French demanded, as a corresponding benefit, a common agricultural policy."
"So we recognised that there were benefits to be gained from the single market in the European Union other than just the amount of money that people got from the budget."
"That has been borne out because we cannot just evaluate the benefits of European Union on the basis of how the balance of payments in the European budget works out."
"At the moment, Germany has a massive surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the Union - something like 25 billion."
"That is fair enough!"
"I do not begrudge Germany that, it got that out of the single market because of its efficiency and hard work."
"The Dutch have a bigger surplus still, something like 35 billion."
"Some of that may be the Rotterdam factor but, even if it is, it still leaves profit that would not have been there and could not possibly accrue to the Dutch economy if it were not for the single market."
"So the single market gives benefit to the Dutch and Germans."
"Ireland gains because it has a surplus in its trade with the rest of the Community, except the British."
"We also are net beneficiaries, and have the best of all worlds."
"So I am not in favour of rapid change!"
"Being serious, we are going much too far and the demand for national contributions to the common agricultural policy is not a reasonable proposal."
"It is definitely renationalisation."
"Mr President, in the one minute I have at my disposal I should like to make three short comments."
"Firstly, does the total amount of Community budget receipts cover the current requirement of the European Union?"
"My opinion is that it does not."
"The report has nothing to say on this."
"Secondly, this is a distortion of reality: while here we are talking about the system of own resources, that is, the system of collecting budget receipts, the report concerns itself essentially with expenditure."
"It wants to reduce expenditure on the common agricultural policy, the Committee on Budgets is transformed into the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it recommends the restructuring of agricultural policy and finally calls for national contributions to this policy."
"From 70 % of the budget the common agricultural policy has fallen to 45 %."
"How much further do we want it to fall?"
"How much further do you want it to fall?"
"Let us just reflect on the fact that, without a common agricultural policy, there would be no European Union today."
"My third and final comment is this: the notion of net contributions must cease."
"We must accept that contributions are determined by the single market as a whole and not just by the Community budget."
"Mr President, this report is an admirable and very well formulated attempt to chart a course between various conflicting mega-interests, what a skier would call a slalom."
"But it has no clear thrust."
"In order to develop that, the report should really be referred back to committee."
"During the debate emphasis has repeatedly been put on the need for economic and social cohesion and solidarity, and rightly so."
"But solidarity also means that all the Member States must commit themselves fully to combating waste, corruption and mismanagement."
"For when it comes to collecting revenue we see particularly large losses in the Member States as a result of irregularities and fraud."
"The aim of the future own resources system must not just be to make the revenue system more transparent, simpler and more rational but also to reduce the burden on European taxpayers as a whole."
"In this context, any European Central Bank profits should not, as proposed, be paid into the Community budget but accrue to the Member States' budgets."
"Mr President, I want to extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur for what she has done on behalf of the Committee on Budgets and this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I rather got the impression today that you thought Mrs Haug had drawn up this report largely for her own amusement."
"Every one of us should realise that she took a real Sisyphean task upon herself here and I believe she has done an admirable and fantastic job."
"Each of us comes from our own Member State and we really have seen today that we are all bringing our own Member State's special interests with us here."
"The discussion showed that extensively enough."
"The way I read this report, Mrs Haug has tried to propose short and medium-term measures."
"They include the question of the British rebate and of course they include the question of cofinancing agricultural policy. And to the Member who declared it was about renationalising the agricultural system - something people sometimes say against their better judgment and that has been debated at length - I would say that such matters must of course be addressed here."
"But Mrs Haug has also paved the way for what we will in the final analysis need on the revenue side, namely European revenue in the form of European taxes."
"Only then will we see an end to the interminable debate about who is the biggest net contributor, who is the biggest net recipient, which is what it is obviously all about just now."
"Because this report is sufficiently logical and well constructed and because it comes very close to fulfilling the task we set, namely to formulate and document Parliament's position prior to the European Council decisions, I would call on everyone to support it accordingly."
"It will not be the last report by the Committee on Budgets to cause us problems."
"Looking at the question of the financial perspective, we may find that the balance of interests differs somewhat from today's, but we as the European Parliament should seek to remain capable of action at budgetary level."
"With this report we certainly are, which is why we should support it on Thursday."
"Mr President, with the Haug report the European Parliament underlines once again its political commitment to the question of the Community's own resources."
"Although the number of parliamentarians present today is not very high I must say that the issue is still of the highest political topicality in all the member countries as we prepare for the Berlin summit."
"Like its predecessors, in particular the famous Langes report of 1994, the Haug report combines short-term realism and long-term vision."
"I am happy to note that the same difficulties that we had in the Commission when we had to draw up our report have also been encountered in the European Parliament."
"I congratulate Mrs Haug for this balanced combination of those issues: short-term realism and long-term vision."
"The Haug report and the Commission report on the operation of own resources published last October are on the same wave-length on many questions."
"For example, both reports agree that the present system has provided sufficient resources to finance the Community expenditure, but also that it lacks transparency, comprehensibility and financial autonomy."
"Both reports agree that the notion of juste retour is unrepresentative of the relationship of the EU with the Member States and misleading in several respects."
"Both reports note that VAT resources pose a series of difficulties in terms of transparency and complexity, as well as the possibility of replacing VAT resources by GNP resources."
"This has been given a lot of attention in the present discussion with the member countries."
"Both reports recognise the diminishing importance of the traditional resources: it is necessary to take the cost benefit aspects of their collection into account."
"Finally, if the weight of the GNP resources increases - which may prove possible in the next few weeks - it will become even more necessary to use the latest and most credible GNP estimates which take account of all the underground economy aspects."
"With regard to specific new own resources, positions still differ considerably."
"These differences have also manifested themselves within the European Parliament."
"Given the cumbersome decision-making procedure in the field, more convergence of views will be required before an initiative can hope to have any possibility of succeeding."
"Intellectually it is very interesting but politically there are not very many realistic options today."
"Timing is important here."
"The successful launch of the euro and the difficult negotiations on the harmonisation of certain taxes in Europe could be slowed if too close a link is made with the question of potential Community own resources."
"I fully agree that the question of the financing of the Union has to be seen as an integral part of the integration process of the Union, that it has to move forward in tandem with it."
"I once again congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"Transportable pressure equipment"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0094/99), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council (12050/98 - C4-0679/98-97/0011(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Directive on transportable pressure equipment (Rapporteur: Mr Camisón Asensio)."
"Mr President, one year ago, Mr Camisón Asensio drew up an excellent report, as this House confirmed during the first reading of this timely proposal for a directive."
"The report's view has not changed at second reading and is one that will help increase safety as well as improve conditions for free movement in terms of the manufacture, use and transport of transportable pressure equipment in Europe."
"The Socialist Group supports the criteria of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which are the rapporteur's initial criteria. Our group will therefore vote in favour of the small yet important amendments contained in this report and that the rapporteur has summarised."
"The creation of a single economic area based on a common market remains one of the objectives from the Treaty of Rome that requires constant improvement."
"Consequently, Parliament and the Commission have a lasting obligation to iron out technical problems in the trade of industrial goods in this area whenever there are cases where eliminating such problems will still guarantee a high level of safety."
"Both high safety levels and the elimination of technical difficulties can be achieved with this report."
"I still do not understand how the Council can be against approving and increasing transparency in limits on times when loaded lorries can use European motorways at weekends. Fortunately, we only have three months left of the German Presidency, after which we can assume that such approval will be granted."
"We should like to congratulate Mr Camisón Asensio for his work throughout these two readings and also the Commission for its excellent initiative and for accepting most of the amendments from this House."
"I should like to begin by thanking the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, in particular, Mr Camisón Asensio for the time and productive effort that he has spent on this issue, not only at this time, but for the period in which he has been living with this proposal - the past 18 months or more."
"The result of his efforts has been improvement in the Commission's proposal."
"We have recognised that in the most practical way by accepting a significant number of his first reading amendments."
"The sight of Mr Jarzembowski always disorientates me."
"Such a thing of beauty at this time of night!"
"The Commission's position, which includes all the amendments accepted by the Commission - the common position - will improve the safety of transportable pressure equipment such as gas cylinders or tanks, will allow their free circulation and free use and will meet these purposes through provisions relating, among other things, to the conformity of new equipment, the reassessment of existing equipment, periodic testing and relevant Community marking."
"Let me comment on the amendments to the common position that are offered by the report that we are considering tonight."
"First of all, the Commission is able to accept Amendment No 2 since it introduces the compulsory notification to the Commission in case of undue marking."
"We are not, however, able to accept Amendment No 1."
"The reason for that is that reassessment of an existing receptacle by an agreed body is only a possibility under the terms of the proposal."
"The House will know that the Member States that are going to use this provision are those that already have a lot of experience with agreed bodies."
"They will only authorise some specific agreed bodies for the reassessment activities."
"In those circumstances and taking into account the fact that a notified body will have previously reassessed the type of conformity, unannounced visits by a notified body are not necessary."
"I should like to congratulate the interpreters on the way in which they followed that passage that I have just read out."
"Since Amendment No 4 is a consequence of Amendment No 1, that too is not acceptable."
"The Commission is also not able to accept Amendment No 3 for the simple and formal reason - which I know the rapporteur understands - that the report to the Council and the European Parliament on the adaptations to technical progress are laid down in the directives of the Commission which are published in the Official Journal."
"I hope that the honourable Members will accept that the Commission's reasons for not accepting these few amendments are entirely the result of practical and procedural considerations and not objections in principle."
"I should like to offer my thanks to the rapporteur and his colleagues for their very constructive approach and bid Godspeed to this useful piece of legislation."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Ports and intermodal terminals"
"The next item is the report (A4-0074/99) by Mr Piecyk, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision amending Decision No 1692/96/EC as regards seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals, as well as project No 8 in Annex III (COM(97)0681 - C4-0151/98-97/0358(COD))."
"Mr President, perhaps I will not need my whole seven minutes of speaking time."
"After all, one can keep it a bit shorter."
"We transport politicians always try to be precise, without letting things get out of hand."
"When we began working on the TENs in 1994, it was clear from the outset that the TENs will not be some unique event that suddenly erupts like a volcano, something that is decided just like that; what was clear is that there will be a process that will continue for a number of years and will also have to be reviewed constantly."
"That is why the 1996 decision taken by the Council and Parliament is sensibly entitled 'Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network'."
"During the conciliation procedure the Council and Parliament could not agree on what Parliament called for at the time, namely the need to include ports in the TENs."
"I think that anyone with any brains and common sense will realise that a transport network without interconnection points is an incomplete system, but then nobody has ever pretended that every member of the Council shines with common sense."
"I would never go so far as to say that."
"During the conciliation procedure the Commission - indeed you, Commissioner - declared that a proposal on seaports would be on the table immediately."
"Immediately took rather longer than we would normally understand by the word."
"But in the end we did get what I would regard as a very sensible proposal, namely to bring seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals together in one proposal."
"It makes sense because all three are after all transport connection points and as such they are indeed the condition for linking the various transport modes together."
"Moreover, seaports and inland connection points interact with one another and are a significant factor in the development of intermodal transport."
"The market is crucial to the development of seaports."
"We do not deny that either and so when we lay down European criteria for seaports this must not lead to any distortions of competition."
"But regarding the volume criterion, I believe that a traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes of freight a year is quite certainly more appropriate for a European network than the 1 million proposed by the Commission."
"What is totally incomprehensible, however, is the Commission's specifications for seaports."
"Quite rightly, there is a great deal of detail about port infrastructure, but in the end the Commission proposal says that infrastructure projects are not eligible for aid!"
"We, and indeed I, regard that as totally wrong."
"We stick to our original approach: we want to recognise port infrastructure as eligible for aid on principle, but certainly not superstructure, which is a different matter."
"To make it quite clear what infrastructure means, my report proposes a basic definition of the term."
"After all, we have all sorts of fancies in our mind about all the things that could be supported."
"But if these are to be kept in check, we must also have a basic definition of what infrastructure means in the future networks."
"The situation regarding inland ports is somewhat different."
"Of course, as the Commission proposes, they should be equipped with transhipment installations for intermodal transport; that would be one criterion."
"But those inland ports that only tranship bulk freight should have an annual traffic volume of at least 500 000 tonnes of freight."
"The Transport Committee is adding that criterion to the report."
"There are two other points I would like to address."
"The Commission also wants to include rail freight freeways in the TENs."
"Parliament has always supported the Commission and you personally, Commissioner, on the matter of freeways."
"We think this is necessary in order to move more freight from the roads to the railways."
"And we continue to support you."
"However, by virtue of their construction, the freeways are a service installation and not an infrastructure."
"That is why both I and the committee believe that in terms of the system - not of the principle, where we entirely agree - they do not belong in the TENs, simply because they are not an infrastructure."
"Then there is the famous project No 8 of the 14 very important projects endorsed by the Essen summit."
"For God's sake, these projects have been examined a thousand times as to whether they can go ahead!"
"The Christophersen Group went to great trouble, and now everything is to be changed again!"
"This is certainly not a glorious chapter in the annals of the Council."
"But I believe Parliament and the Commission should both forgive and forget here and say yes, while specifying one thing, namely that to be precise project No 8 is a project consisting of several individual projects."
"And that is the basis on which we should decide tomorrow."
"All that remains is for me to thank my colleagues in the committee for their cooperation, to also thank the Commission departments with whom we also cooperated, and finally to call on the Council to finally get round to producing a common position before the end of the legislative term, so that we can get on with this in the autumn."
"Finally, on principle the Commission is considering possibly presenting a white paper on the basis of its review of the networks."
"We think that is wrong."
"Article 21 of the decision provides that the review shall be followed by Commission proposals, which means we should not rethink the whole matter again in the form of a white paper."
"That is why we expect the review, when it finally appears, to put forward new, revised proposals, but not, so to speak, to start from scratch again."
"We have worked on the networks too long for this to happen."
"That is why it is useful to have the completed proposal on the table now."
"I can only wish the Commissioner luck in his work and hope that we will manage to achieve a common position during this electoral term."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Piecyk for a good report and a resolution which is a leftover from our resolution on trans-European networks."
"We did not get as far as how ports should be included in the master plan."
"Since then, we have shown that a lack of efficiency and higher costs both in ports used for inland shipping and seaports have contributed to restricting shipping."
"The report on short-sea shipping demonstrated that."
"We have discussed the green paper on ports, and we have in fact progressed a long way in our debate on ports."
"There is a need for development all over Europe."
"We are now jointly picking out some priorities and some ports."
"It is important for us to consider not only the functional aspect, but also the need for uniform conditions as far as bureaucracy is concerned."
"That is what I want to talk about today."
"There is one thing that is very inconvenient for ships when they arrive at ports, and that is the inconsistency in the way they are received and the way the ports operate."
"I would therefore urge the ports in the Member States which, through the 'fellowship' of the trans-European network, are now expected to provide a more sustainable transport system, to fulfil the obligation which goes with being part of the transport chain and all its bureaucracy."
"Another point is that the selection of ports should be based on strategic considerations, and not just on regional and local factors."
"A port may have great local significance, but it may not live up to the idea of a trans-European network."
"Local desires for expansion should therefore be held in check when we talk about the development of trans-European networks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Tuesday evening is the time for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, so let us get to work again."
"I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, very warmly for his report."
"He has managed most successfully to incorporate the points we made at the time of the discussion on the green paper on seaports."
"In terms of the white paper and amendment of the TEN proposal, he has included Parliament's views in his report and reconciled them."
"That is a most important task and ensures that we do not have two different legal acts and follow different courses."
"I believe it also demonstrates how right we were to be stubborn in 1996 and not to adopt the seaports proposal at the time. For with the Piecyk report we now have a far more precise and clear definition of the tasks relating to supporting or not supporting seaports and inland ports."
"I admit that, Commissioner, and also thank the Commission for improving its proposal compared to the original text."
"In that respect, we have come closer to one another."
"I also believe it is important for us to have a proper map of European seaports, for the public did not understand why we had a map showing airports, railway lines and roads, without any indication of seaports. I agree with Mr Piecyk that including seaports in the maps does not mean that no other ports have a chance of achieving prominence in Europe; those ports simply have to manage that themselves."
"I think that is the crucial point."
"In particular, I think it is very good that we have a clear delineation between port infrastructure and port superstructure in the Piecyk report."
"One of our central tasks continues to be to avoid distortions of competition between seaports through national aid or even aid from the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds."
"That means we need clear definitions of port infrastructure and port superstructure."
"I hope the Commission, Mr Kinnock, will agree with our more precise definition of project No 8."
"The Council keeps talking about the Essen and Dublin projects, but we have always taken that to mean that this is a matter of codecision and not of a Council decision: it is after all a list of priority projects and not a list of generally applicable priority tasks."
"Unfortunately No 8 was a generally applicable commitment."
"We have defined it more precisely on the basis of the Commission's practical proposals, and we are prepared at the next stage perhaps to find a common, stronger, more precise definition."
"But it is important that we are clear in our minds what the priorities are and do not restrict ourselves to generally non-applicable tasks."
"I also agree with Mr Piecyk that we do not want a white paper on the TENs, for that always means two years of discussions and everyone in this House and everyone in the Council knows what we are talking about here."
"We need a brief report summarising the experience gained and a clear review."
"That is our task and I believe the Commissioner should do us that favour."
"Mr President, following Mr Jarzembowski who spoke of Tuesday evening being transport night, I would add that it is striking to see how many of us transport people are on the back benches."
"Perhaps, Commissioner Kinnock, if you keep this portfolio and we exercise our powers of codecision, we can make an effort to move this a little closer to the centre of the political stage and have it acknowledged as rather more important."
"Having said that, I must begin by complimenting Mr Piecyk. We have worked together on this remarkably well, and if his predecessor Günther Topmann could see the harmonious atmosphere in which this report was produced, I think he would find it heartwarming."
"I share the views that have been expressed, but there is one aspect which I should like to develop a little further."
"Ports are of course the most important points of intersection in our trans-European networks."
"After all, all our Union imports and exports pass through them."
"The importance of ports is determined not only by history, but also by the ease of their links to the hinterland."
"Why, for example, is the port of Oporto rather less busy than that of Rotterdam?"
"Because, despite the fact that it means two or three days' less sailing time, transport from the coast to the interior is more difficult because the infrastructure which the port requires is not yet well enough developed."
"That is one of the reasons why we established the TENs and why it is most important to have multimodal transport services from the ports to the hinterland."
"So I am also grateful to the rapporteur for mentioning waterways which are at least as important, the Elbe-Lübeck canal and the Twente-Mittelland canal which was added in committee as the result of an amendment."
"We should be very glad to see the Commission stressing the importance of these waterways as well."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Piecyk on his excellent and important report."
"Please bear with me if, in the short amount of time at my disposal, I concentrate on priority project No 8, dealing with links between Portugal and Europe via Spain."
"The project now submitted could be regarded as a genuine revolution in the world of transport as far as Portugal is concerned."
"It fully incorporates the new philosophy which we in the European Union, and particularly in the European Parliament, have always supported."
"The fact that Portugal's current Public Works Minister used to be a member of the European Parliament may have something to do with the far-reaching transformation that has occurred in proposals for Community projects affecting Portugal."
"The previously planned project consisted of a motorway between Lisbon and Valladolid, and this is also part of the new project, but what has changed in my opinion is, above all, the philosophy behind it."
"Account has been taken of ports and intermodal transport, with rail and road links guaranteeing merchandise improved access to ports outside and inside Europe."
"As Mr Wijsenbeek said earlier, there really is a world of a difference between the port of Oporto and the port of Rotterdam in terms of infrastructure."
"What is being proposed in this project - in my view nothing short of a revolution in the world of transport in my country, which is why I ask both the European Parliament and the Commission to support it - will enable Portugal to overhaul its transport system and create a logical and complementary network that will link up the different means of transport and modernise every form of access to the Portuguese ports. That means that we will be on a new cutting edge of development."
"We therefore think that this project must be approved. It is of overriding importance for Europe and Portugal alike."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, for this report because, as we have come to expect, he has once again done some excellent work."
"We gladly welcome the Commission's proposal as it is important and urgent that we complete the conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council. This procedure began in 1996, as no agreement could be reached on the way in which ports were to be incorporated in the TENs."
"However, the Commission's proposal, as the rapporteur has already highlighted, was delayed and the procedure for the current proposal will overlap with the preparations for the Commission report on the fundamental revision of the guidelines."
"In fact, the Commission's explanatory statement in its proposal for amendment constantly refers to the forthcoming review that will take place in accordance with Article 21 of Decision 1692/96/EC."
"What is more, I do not believe that the proposal for a continuous process of updating and reviewing the guidelines should be made through a White Paper."
"And as regards Amendment No 13, concerning point 8, and more specifically on the corridors in the Commission's proposal, 'Multimodal link Portugal/Spain with the rest of Europe', the following corridors are included: Galicia (La Coruña)/Portugal (Lisbon), the southwest corridor (Lisbon/Seville) and a third corridor Irún/Portugal (Lisbon)."
"I believe this is a transcription error, as it should read Irún-Valladolid/Portugal (Lisbon). As a result, I ask that this be corrected in order to avoid any misunderstanding and I would ask the rapporteur to clarify this when it comes to the vote."
"Mr President, this Commission proposal completes a significant range of measures concerning the trans-European networks, although it has to be said that the solution envisaged will not be the last word on this matter."
"Unlike some colleagues, I am convinced that the new TENs project requires in-depth discussion, harking back to the original spirit of the White Paper by Jacques Delors and stimulating innovation, above all by linking these networks to the development of urban and industrial areas."
"I am therefore in favour of a Commission communication which generates a wide-ranging debate with Parliament and with European society, and is not merely a list of projects mediated by national governments."
"I am broadly in agreement with this proposal, and I think that a compromise should be possible on one point."
"In my opinion, the classification of seaports on the basis of freight volume should not be related exclusively to an annual volume of 1.5 million tonnes, but should be considered over a longer period of at least three years."
"As far as competition is concerned, although careful attention must be paid to distortions, I believe that support from the Structural and Cohesion Funds is crucial to port structure and superstructure activities."
"The Commission's survey of ports is most useful here, considering that public funding also benefits many non-Mediterranean ports, albeit indirectly."
"A very clear and accurate analysis of both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean ports is required."
"I believe that the important concepts here are nodes, intermodality, technological innovation and the rational development of interconnected networks, including links with railway nodes."
"Intermodality is a key factor."
"Mr President, of the fourteen priority projects for the trans-European transport networks established at the Essen Council in December 1994, three are at the finishing stages and six are due to be completed by the year 2005, while for the other five there is a great deal of vagueness about their timetable, costs and funding."
"That is the case with the multimodal link between Portugal and Spain and the rest of Europe."
"In 1996 when the new Socialist government came to power in Portugal, policies changed, Madrid moved into line and, at the Dublin Council, the European Union approved the new emphasis on multimodal transport with which we happen to agree."
"Two and a half years later we still do not know what actual projects for multimodal links with Portugal and Spain and what economic or environmental impact studies have been presented in Brussels or what their cost and sources of funding will be."
"It is curious that as we are changing the designation of project No 8, which relates to three Iberian multimodal corridors, the Portuguese Government has just presented its national social and economic development plan for the period 2000-2006 and refers to four main Iberian corridors as part of the current set of trans-European network projects, namely the Galician-Portuguese corridor from Vigo to Lisbon; the Irun-Portugal corridor; the Extremadura corridor from Lisbon to Madrid; and the Mediterranean corridor from Lisbon to Seville via Faro and Huelva."
"So where does that leave us?"
"Are there three or four corridors?"
"Which text accurately reflects the current political will of the Portuguese Government?"
"Which of them can we rely on in the future?"
"We must avoid getting bogged down in vagueness, toing and froing, putting off the vital day when Union funding must be forthcoming."
"In particular, regions such as the Algarve and Andalucia cannot be satisfied with simply being 'on the map' while in practice being indefinitely left out of the transport corridors linking those regions to Europe."
"The rail network in southern Portugal is the worst in Europe as there are no links with Seville or with Faro airport."
"In the short term the Lisbon-Algarve motorway, the second stage of the Via do Infante and the Ayamonte-Seville link must be joined up to form part of the European road network."
"We have now had enough inertia and vacillation."
"Mr President, I begin by offering my regrets that I will not be as precise and brief as Mr Piecyk, partly because there is a complexity about this report."
"I want to make a candid and as full as possible response to what has been said because these are important issues."
"So I hope the House will bear with me if I stray a little over the five minutes."
"I also think that Mr Wijsenbeek, as ever, has made an excellent suggestion that in these late night sessions we actually gather closer together so that we can save electricity by not having to project our voices so far and maybe, at the end of the evening, we can join in some community singing."
"That would be very good."
"Sometimes I feel rather lonely, although, as Mr Wijsenbeek says, this is a packed House by comparison with what we are sometimes used to."
"That is a testimony to the very great interest that is expressed in this important subject."
"I am glad that Parliament has taken up the proposal we have put forward and there is general support in the House for its objective, which is the completion of the trans-European networks transport guidelines with the inclusion of seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals."
"Mr Piecyk, the rapporteur, must have a particular sense of accomplishment in producing this report since, after our joint experiences in 1995 and 1996, I always think of him as the parliamentary midwife of the transport TEN guidelines."
"It will be clear to honourable Members that the development of a multimodal trans-European transport network would be incomplete if the principal interconnection points were not included."
"That is the reason, as several Members of the House will know, why the Commission, following the request of this House, declared in the conciliation procedure on the guidelines that we would submit a proposal for seaport projects in 1997."
"Indeed, it is consistent with the entire thrust of our TENs policy which, because of the mission of developing real networks, must focus increasingly on connection points and access to main arteries rather than simply on traditional stretches of infrastructure."
"I am glad that the committee has supported the main principles and the main objectives of the Commission."
"A number of amendments adopted by the committee can be accepted either in their entirety or, at least, in principle."
"Before dealing with the substantive amendments, I should like to comment on Amendment No 1 - an issue that has arisen repeatedly in the course of this debate - which inserts a recital stating that the European Parliament expects a legislative proposal on the revision of the guidelines, rather than the White Paper that the Commission has announced."
"I understand that view very well."
"However, it must be said that under Article 21 of the guidelines decision the Commission is requested to present a report and not a proposal for an amendment of the law."
"We are therefore fulfilling that requirement."
"I hope that the House will agree that there is good sense in producing a report as a White Paper, deliberately in order to provide this Parliament and others with a real opportunity for a broader debate on the trans-European networks policy in general before a new proposal is finally decided upon."
"Parliament and the wider community have everything to gain and absolutely nothing to lose by this approach, especially in terms of real participation in policy development in what is a crucial strategy for the European Union."
"So rather than in any sense being evasive in not immediately coming forward with a legislative proposal, we are, frankly, trying to do the opposite and being more transparent and more inclusive in the approach that we are making to consideration of the TENs guidelines after the experience and after the evolution of the policy over four years in which a great many developments have taken place."
"I shall address the other amendments in three main groups: those relating to 'Trans-European Rail Freight Freeways'; secondly, those on the criteria for deciding which ports are included; and, thirdly, those relating to the types of infrastructure, superstructure and rolling stock investment support that are eligible."
"Amendments Nos 2 and 7 refer to the 'Trans-European Rail Freight Freeways' which, as Mr Piecyk said, have been supported by this Parliament as a means of making early progress in reviving rail freight across the Union."
"This revision of the guidelines provides us with a further means of encouraging the development of rail freight freeways by making clear that infrastructure investment in the freeways routes will be given priority."
"That makes sense because the viability of infrastructure investments obviously depends on competitive revenue-raising services and competitive services clearly need quality infrastructure."
"So investment in infrastructure will certainly help to deliver better services."
"But I thought that was the whole purpose of infrastructure investment in any case."
"Indeed it is in line with the amendments that Parliament itself put, and we accepted, on the project action for combined transport programmes."
"So I cannot support Amendments Nos 2 and 7 which have the effect of dropping all references to trans-European rail freight freeways."
"I would, however, be happy to consider a reformulation of the provision that does not directly refer to the rail freight freeways but rather to cross-border trans-European rail freight corridors open to all operators."
"If that was accepted, I hope that all parts of this House could then give support to the reference."
"Turning to criteria for identifying ports, the Commission accepts that part of Amendment No 4 gives special treatment to ports in the outermost regions."
"However, the increase in the minimum traffic volume stipulated in the proposal from 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes of freight would exclude about 27 ports, mainly in remote areas of the Union."
"We, therefore, cannot support this specific point because of the breadth of our commitment and indeed the Treaty requirements relating to the function of the trans-European network strategy in connecting up the peripheral regions of the Union to the centre."
"Meanwhile the stipulation that ports must be connected to the TENs routes that is set out in the amendment would have the effect of excluding a number of ports that are not currently linked to the trans-European network."
"Similarly, the inclusion of a minimum volume threshold for bulk freight in inland ports envisaged in Amendment No 3 would alter the present approach which is essentially based on intermodal freight."
"Those proposed amendments cannot, therefore, be accepted entirely."
"I hope the House will recognise that there are practical reasons for the Commission taking this view as well as reasons that are also connected to a desire to provide a breadth of effective coverage in the trans-European network strategy as we are further developing it."
"Amendment No 6 makes more radical changes to the guideline maps, adding new links and creating new categories of ports."
"As I am sure the House recognises, these are, in reality, issues for consideration in the forthcoming general revision process."
"Consequently, I cannot accept that amendment for that reason."
"Amendment No 5 mainly tightens up definitions and can be readily accepted."
"I am grateful to Mr Piecyk for putting that amendment."
"Turning to types of eligible investments, I can easily concur with the argument that all projects of common interest, including those related to ports, should, in principle, be potentially eligible for TENs funding."
"That means dropping a restrictive paragraph in our proposal on the non-availability of funding for infrastructure in the port area."
"Of course financing of those infrastructures - as Mr Jarzembowski pointed out - must not distort competition."
"What would, however, create real problems is the introduction of a new concept of superstructures in ports as the distinction between superstructure and infrastructure is far from clear."
"We would open the door to uncertainty about eligibility, in particular in the area of combined transport."
"If the Union in its wisdom would appoint Mr Jarzembowski to be the inspector of TENs superstructures in all the ports of the European Union, that would mean he was gainfully employed, dedicated to the service of the Community."
"All I would regret was his prolonged absence from this House."
"But if that power was not vested in Mr Jarzembowski I am not sure that I could accept any definition that clearly delineated between superstructure and infrastructure."
"I will illustrate the point by taking the argument further."
"The idea of giving a detailed definition of port infrastructure in Amendments Nos 8 and 9, although I recognise the good intentions of putting it forward in that way, has been very thoroughly examined by the Commission."
"We have had to conclude, however, that the provision of a detailed definition would definitely carry the risk that relevant features could be missed out."
"In the case, for example, of this specific amendment, the proposed definition, although it is carefully crafted, still misses landing places, quay walls and locks - matters of critical interest in both sea and inland ports."
"On balance, therefore, and for practical reasons, I prefer not to have a more precise and exhaustive definition of the term 'port infrastructure' in the legal text."
"I emphasise strongly to the House that it is only for practical reasons that are directly connected with the desire of the Commission to get effective commitment to the development of ports."
"Finally, the Commission accepts in essence Amendment No 13 which seeks to describe more precisely the specific project No. 8 in Annex III which has been the subject of several references in the course of the debate, though the accuracy needs cross-checking with the two Member States concerned."
"Summing up, the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, part of 4, 6, 7, most of 8 and 9, and 11."
"But we can accept Amendments Nos 5, 10, 12, the first part of Amendment No 8, and 9, and we can certainly subscribe to the principles of Amendment No 13 and part of 4."
"I warmly thank the House for having taken this proposal forward and also by expressing my particular gratitude to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and specifically to the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, for the excellent work that once again has been done by himself and his colleagues."
"Commissioner, I would just remind you that when you became Commissioner for transport five years ago you promised to listen to Parliament."
"What you have just offered us, namely to reject all the proposals we submitted, is outrageous!"
"But perhaps we will be meeting again next year!"
"Mr President, I have a similar, short question."
"The Commissioner did not accept the amendments on the specific inland waterway links with ports."
"Could the Commissioner at least assure this House that he will take seriously inland waterway links with the important points that ports constitute for our trans-European networks?"
"Mr President, I will be extremely brief because I am conscious of the fact that unavoidably my first contribution was long."
"Firstly, I entirely sympathise with the point that Mr Wijsenbeek makes."
"This, however, is not the proposal before the House."
"It is not a general revision of the trans-European network strategy."
"I very firmly give him the undertaking that precisely the point he is making will be a feature of our proposal relating to the general revision."
"He need have no worry about that."
"Secondly, I say to Mr Jarzembowski, who is a Parliamentarian like myself, that I made a solemn undertaking - which I honour every moment that I work - to listen to the Parliament."
"He will recognise, however, democrat that he is, that this does not imply being a rubber stamp or accepting everything the Parliament says."
"It does, however, mean, that I owe the Parliament my honest judgment."
"That he always gets, whether he likes it or not."
"Happily, he likes it more often than he dislikes it!"
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Railways"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0058/99 by Mr Sarlis, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways (COM(98)0480 - C4-0561/98-98/0265(SYN)); -A4-0059/99 by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, onI.the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings (COM(98)0480 - C4-0562/98-98/0266(SYN))II.the proposal for a Council Directive relating to the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (COM(98)0480 - C4-0563/98-98/0267(SYN))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its resolution of 13 January 1998 on the White Paper on a strategy for revitalising the Community's railways - the personal work of Commissioner Kinnock - this House wholeheartedly and consistently supported the Commission's strategy on virtually all its lines of attack."
"However, it also highlighted several important points."
"One of these was that we called upon the Commission to submit proposals in order to give railway undertakings the right of free access to railway infrastructure on the basis of an amendment to Article 10 of Directive 91/440/EEC regarding the operation of international freight transport, along with accompanying measures."
"The Commission's new proposal, or rather the package of three separate proposals, one of which concerns the amendments to Directive 91/440/EEC, goes in the right direction but is not sufficiently substantial."
"The most important point I would like to highlight is that the Commission proposal fails to make recommendations for the gradual extension of the liberalisation of the railways, as I mentioned earlier, which this House introduced in its resolution of 13 January 1998."
"This omission becomes even more apparent when we realise that this issue has stagnated somewhat in Council circles and that the third directive of the package submitted by the Commission is essentially a measure accompanying a policy which is leading to partial liberalisation, which was set out in the White Paper and, above all, in Parliament's resolution of January 1998."
"As a result, in line with what I have already said and, most importantly, with the almost unanimous view of this House, which was expressed in January 1998, I put before the Committee on Transport and Tourism Amendment No 10 granting Community railway undertakings free access and transit rights on equitable conditions to the infrastructure in all Member States for the purpose of operating international railway services for the transport of goods."
"This right currently exists only for international groupings of railway undertakings and not for individual railway undertakings."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have the 1969 directive, which expressly provides for the gradual liberalisation of rail transport in the European Union - which was then the European Community - and has not been implemented since that time."
"As a result, with this amendment, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we are putting back on track the process towards the gradual liberalisation of rail transport, starting with the transport of goods."
"Amendment No 6 puts forward a new provision which obliges Member States to create legal entities, separate from railway undertakings, for the management of their national railway infrastructure, not later than two years following the date of entry into force of the directive."
"Finally, the remaining amendments which I propose, and which have been adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, concern improvements to the Commission proposals. For example, Amendment No 5, in contrast to what was proposed by the Commission, reconfirms that responsibility for operating the control and safety systems lies with rail infrastructure providers."
"Last of all, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to underline three things."
"Firstly, the reports being debated this evening in joint debate are harmonised and complement each other."
"Secondly, there has been an announcement from the German Presidency that, very soon, some time in March, it will take the initiative to promote issues relating to the railways."
"Thirdly, this is a significant milestone in the liberalisation of this important form of transport in Europe."
"I hope that the solidarity that was shown in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will still be there tomorrow during the vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank my colleagues in the committee, who worked together admirably, and especially Mr Sarlis, with whom I cooperated closely. I am also grateful to our Commission colleagues, who provided us with a great deal of information and were most understanding, although I very much regret - as did the entire committee - that one Commission colleague decided in the end that none of the amendments was acceptable."
"Commissioner, I do not know what you will say; as a democrat of course I have to accept it."
"But I would certainly be sorry to see all the amendments simply dismissed out of hand."
"Commission, I entirely agree with what you have repeatedly said, namely that the European railway system needs to be reformed."
"But I cannot agree with those - even if we have close political links in the unions and in other areas - who believe that it would be best to leave things as they stand, or who believe that the difficult problems with the railways had been created by the Commission's proposals."
"No, the difficult situation of the railways has arisen partly because many railway undertakings believed they did not need to reform, they did not need to change anything, they could continue operating in a national framework."
"That is not true and in principle I agree with the ideas put forward by the Commissioner and the Commission."
"It is certainly true that the difficult situation as regards rail/road competition in my view disadvantages the railways and that this needs rectifying."
"In that regard I have taken several aspects into account."
"And I can understand that the unions and the railway undertakings are highlighting this."
"There is much talk of privatisation and liberalisation."
"But privatisation does not even come into question in this context, it is not being proposed."
"We can certainly consider liberalisation up to a certain point."
"I would prefer to say something different, in relation to our proposals: it is a question of Europeanising the railway system."
"Air transport has been Europeanised, all the undertakings have been Europeanised, there is a common market."
"However, many railway undertakings continue to believe they can frame their programmes at national level and then they wonder why freight traffic and employment and so forth are declining."
"That is untenable!"
"That is why I, like Mr Sarlis - and that is the thrust of my amendments - believe that we should target the next step towards liberalisation or Europeanisation at an area where we have a European market, where the competition between rail and road is particularly strong, namely cross-border freight traffic; I have made the corresponding proposals."
"So I entirely support the Commission's basic premise and its proposals on opening up the market."
"It is up to the railway undertakings to decide whether to do so more in the form of cooperation or of competition."
"Of course we do not want new monopolies to emerge."
"It is a question of the transparency of the decisions, the transparency of the allocations."
"Although this sector has not been regulated, it is certainly also a question of technical framework conditions."
"So we need harmonisation in the technical field too."
"And it is a question of equal competition and fairness, not just between rail and road but also as regards the railways themselves, in these individual decisions."
"I come now to a central point, where my opinion differs from that of the Commission."
"In particular it concerns the large number of both central and decentralised rules."
"I believe the Commission has done a very good job in many cases."
"Its detailed proposals are probably also the most sensible way to go about this."
"But I do not think it is always sensible of the Commission to want to propose and implement them without making the national rules sufficiently flexible in their turn."
"That is why I have deleted a fair number of provisions - and this really must not be seen as any disrespect for the Commission's work here - not because I think they are bad but because I believe it is not the Commission's job to regulate this in such detail, particularly since I am convinced that nobody can control all this centrally."
"I happen to believe that we should only adopt rules of this kind if compliance with them can also be checked, rather than having an abundance of rules that cannot be monitored."
"As for the charging principles, here again I agree with the Commission: on principle marginal charges should be required."
"But I think the external costs should only be charged in the railway system if they can also be charged at about the same rate for road traffic."
"I believe that a profit that bears a proper relation to the costs would be entirely acceptable and could be calculated, and that higher costs could also be charged for certain special investments."
"However, I have deleted the detailed rules on this from the report."
"Regarding the central issue of the authorised applicant, I personally have nothing against the Commission's views on this."
"But I have added one restriction, which I consider important to ensure that this is acceptable and that we really concentrate on what is necessary."
"Each country should continue to be able to regulate this as it wishes in its area of jurisdiction."
"But all European Member States must note and accept that for cross-border freight traffic all European railway undertakings shall be regarded as authorised applicants, meaning that they shall be eligible to request capacity."
"I think that is the essential point."
"If we take this decision in Parliament tomorrow, then I believe it will be a real milestone in the development of a European railway system."
"We will then have competition in cross-border freight traffic; that is where it is most important, that is where the railways must make efforts."
"For I hope we will take a decision on all those matters that the Commission is rightly proposing, such as on the European tax disc, on the Switzerland package and the fair distribution of costs between rail and road."
"It is vital for the railways also to show that they are willing to reform and to make the appropriate reforms."
"That is why I hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to accept some of these amendments and that this package will help us finally also to have a European railway system."
"Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has adopted a number of amendments, all of which involve the deletion of sections containing over-detailed rules."
"In general, one should be very careful about over-regulating, for example in relation to charges, times of operation and so on."
"It can easily lead to a situation where the gains made through increased efficiency are swallowed up by administrative costs."
"Personally, I should like to see a number of other requirements deleted."
"I do not believe it is possible to forcibly increase efficiency by means of highly detailed directives from Brussels."
"In my view, it is totally unacceptable for directives to specify the exact date on which all railway companies in the Union should change their timetables."
"The requirement that all railways should have separate accounting for freight and passenger transport is also quite unnecessary."
"Both these proposals may well cause serious problems, especially for small railway companies that wish to participate in the market, while the bigger former monopolies can easily adapt to them."
"Consequently, the proposals could, in practice, produce the opposite effect to that intended and become an obstacle to increased competition."
"In my view, before introducing all these detailed requirements, it would have been wiser to wait and assess the long-term effects of the ground-breaking directives approved by the Council in 1991 and 1995, which established the principle of increased competition in the rail sector."
"Mr President, these changes to existing directives and the adoption of a new directive on the allocation of infrastructure and the levying of charges represent a final break with national monopolies and provide opportunities for competition."
"Or is that really the case?"
"As Mr Wibe has just been saying, there are problems."
"It is a long way from decision to reality."
"Consideration for public services and social obligations make the consequences difficult for many people."
"Many countries and regions are worried, and perhaps with reason."
"We should bear that in mind."
"But the opportunity for the renaissance of the railways is at hand, and that is what we should strive for."
"That is our goal."
"The goal is to ensure that an appropriate share of all transport work goes to the railways."
"Like the ports, the railways are also part of the transport chain and are therefore under an obligation to develop sustainable transport."
"We must solve the problems of this process together with our citizens."
"This afternoon we discussed public services, competition and state aid with Commissioner Van Miert in a working group, and it is very interesting to see how things are developing in Europe."
"I believe we should be aware of the fact that changes and market developments do not happen by themselves."
"We have to prompt them in one way or another."
"Whether or not it is too detailed, as Mr Wibe suggests, I could not say at present, but if we want the best for the railways, we have to work on it seriously."
"Parliament should also say to the Council and the Member States that if we want something like this, then we also have an obligation to act."
"There has been a great deal of talk about the railways over the past ten years, but it has done little to help."
"Decisions need to be taken."
"The market will not change this situation by itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us see what you have to say to Mr Sarlis's and Mr Swoboda's proposals today."
"Compared with my own objectives, I do not think the demands made by either of them are tough enough."
"A year ago we called for a gradual liberalisation that took account of social framework conditions but was sufficiently clear-cut."
"Nevertheless I endorse both reports."
"They are a balanced mix of Parliament's views and I hope, Commissioner, that you will prove a rather more generous benefactor this time and accept the amendments."
"Let me address a few points."
"In my view we cannot accept that the railways should decline as a result of your deliberate policy of not applying European legislation."
"Directive 91/440/EEC - separation of infrastructure management and operation of trains - has been applicable by all Member States since 1986."
"Some simply refuse to do so."
"I hope that at least you, Commissioner, are in favour of the call in both reports for progress to be made towards this objective in the next two years."
"If need be, we will have to initiate proceedings here."
"For only if we separate the two can other railway undertakings also effectively use the railways; we want to see effective use made of the railway network, we do not want some countries to seal themselves off and not let anyone through."
"That is why we need a clear separation between infrastructure management and operation services; we need clear rights of access, as both colleagues called for, we need wider rights of access, lenient rights of access, but definite improvements; and thirdly, we need uniform rules on transport charges."
"Mr Swoboda, in your place I would have preferred not to bring up the idea of marginal costs."
"After the hearing in committee, we should not get involved in this."
"For the rest, I agree with you that if we look first at road costs - building and maintenance costs - we would say that external costs may only be increased if the other transport modes are required to bear similar costs."
"In the same way I would like to see the railways given greater opportunity to compete with the other transport modes on the basis of sensible and reasonable transport charges."
"But I also think we must then say that regardless of how high or low we set the transport charges, they must be charged in all the Member States."
"We cannot have some Member States saying that temporarily, for the next two years, we will not impose any transport charges, at least not on certain routes."
"In this respect it is then up to the Commission to ensure equality under the law."
"In this difficult battle between Council, Parliament and Commission to open up the railways so that they will become client-oriented and effective, we are on your side, Commissioner, and I hope you are on our side!"
"Mr President, here too I must congratulate the two rapporteurs."
"Mr Jarzembowski is right in saying that there is indeed a broad measure of agreement on this amongst the various groups. And there were times when that was not the case, when we had some fairly heated clashes on the subject of railways."
"But there are a few facts that we must face."
"We have made nothing like the progress on railways which we ought to have achieved."
"The proportion of freight carried by rail continues to decline."
"So that is the opposite of what we actually want."
"Mr Wibe has left the Chamber, but as draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy he said that there was not really any need to separate the exploitation of infrastructure from actual transport operations."
"I do not agree with him at all."
"How can we license individual operators if we do not make that separation?"
"I think the Commission will have to press that point and stick to it."
"And for this reason too, not so much because it makes all that much difference, but more because we wanted to send a signal, our group wished to maintain an amendment which says that we want to see the separation between the exploitation of infrastructure and rolling-stock within the year, and not in two years' time."
"Why do we say that?"
"Because the railways have had plenty of time since Directive 44/91."
"That is eight years ago. They have still not all taken the measures which the Commission wants the railways to take."
"So we should like to hear from the Commissioner how things stand, and which railway operators have not yet taken the necessary action and why not."
"And we want to see a real separation, not the kind between SNCF and VFF which is a separation in name only, and not in practice."
"I welcome this report on the need to upgrade the railway systems within the European Union, as well as guaranteeing the most efficient use of railway infrastructure to meet consumer needs."
"This is quite a timely report from an Irish perspective."
"Only last week the Irish Government announced a dual strategy involving the spending of £Irl 430 million on improving rail safety standards, alongside the expansion of commuter train services in Ireland."
"As a result of this investment, which I fully support, the suburban rail network will be increased in capacity in terms of over 60 %."
"As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, it is good news because towns such as Naas, Newbridge, Kilcullen, Wicklow, Athy, Arklow, Kildare and Monasterevin must all in the near future secure the necessary finance for the upgrading of their respective railway operations."
"While the upgrading of rail infrastructure is of paramount importance, equal concern must also be the quality of service, and the Irish rail company Iarnród Éireann must, in my view, be up to the task."
"The legitimate request of the people in Monasterevin, for example, for the re-opening of their train station and the people of Portlaoise for the upgrading of the service is fully justified."
"The overcrowding problem on suburban trains will also be eased by the addition of more passenger carriages, and platforms will also be lengthened."
"Mr President, with the reports by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda the European Parliament is forced to take a stand which is fraught with consequences for the future of rail transport."
"The Commission's directives - and, by extension, both reports - are in keeping with a policy of liberalisation, as they open the market in international freight transport to competition."
"Mr Sarlis's report even goes beyond the Commission directives, which do not advocate liberalisation, for example by proposing to amend Article 10 of Council Directive 91/440/EEC."
"Yet, there has been no evidence in the railway sector to confirm the belief that liberalisation is the only way it can be revived."
"On the contrary, the sorry state of affairs that resulted from the liberalisation of British railways represents a genuine counter-example."
"Conversely, high-speed trains which have brought about the irrefutable development of railways could not have come into existence in a liberalised system."
"This is also the case for the first rail freight corridor which was set up on the basis of cooperation between public services."
"I should like to go back over two points."
"Firstly, the amendment of the concept of authorised applicants which allows any natural or legal person to request infrastructure capacity."
"This is likely to lead to a chaotic liberalisation with the increase in the number of new operators."
"The railway undertakings would thus be restricted to a role of service providers ensuring the traction of trains."
"This system can only lead to the most profitable sectors being creamed off, leaving the railway undertakings to take responsibility for personnel, maintenance of rolling stock, and the least profitable sectors."
"Only one liberty is therefore granted, that of allowing companies who are not at all involved in the rail sector to take the biggest share of the profits without providing the conditions for developing this sector."
"The nuance provided by the Committee on Transport and Tourism which makes it possible for Member States to provide for authorised applicants is an illusory precaution, since one unauthorised applicant in any given country would in fact impose itself on others."
"The second point I should like to make concerns competition."
"Rail transport is subject to competition, competition from road transport which benefits from its small-scale use of infrastructure and the extremely low level of social conditions it needs to provide."
"No effort is made to remedy this distortion of competition that is so costly in terms of the environment, social protection and safety."
"The reports by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda advocate competition within the rail sector itself, which does not exist in any country and risks compromising the progress achieved, particularly in view of the specialised infrastructure for rail transport in comparison with that for road and air transport."
"Together with their trade unions and the ETUC, the railway workers of the European Union made known their opposition to the liberalisation of railways during a day of large-scale strike action across the European Union."
"Within the Council, governments are divided on the issue: some, including the French Government, are against it, whilst others think there is no need to force liberalisation on countries that do not want it."
"For this reason, before voting starts tomorrow, I will be requesting that both these reports be referred back to committee so that Parliament does not take such an important decision as this in haste."
"The European Parliament must reject the liberalisation proposals and envisage instead measures to encourage the development and modernisation of the rail sector and its public service obligations, as well as the development of cooperation and social harmonisation at a high level."
"Mr President, I can deal briefly with the Commission proposal, though it is far too detailed, and with the proposals put forward by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda."
"We are happy with them."
"Discussions outside Parliament often assume that the Greens will probably be against, like our colleagues on the left."
"That is a major misconception."
"The Greens are in favour of more freight going by rail, and they are for fair competition and against monopolies, whether they are private or state monopolies."
"So we are also in favour of breaking national monopolies on the management of infrastructure."
"We are in favour of transparent administrative and financial structures for managing infrastructure and providing services."
"We are in favour of the market being opened up to all kinds of responsible operators, with an independent body to scrutinise them."
"And I would say in reply to Mrs Moreau that this is not a kind of wild west-style liberalisation or privatisation."
"In our opinion it is a gradual, cautious but very resolute attempt to ensure a future at last for rail freight."
"We all know that the market share of the railways has declined in recent years."
"That trend has to be reversed, and I think that these proposals are a good start."
"Mr President, European railways need to undergo far-reaching reforms that tend towards liberalisation but that do not jeopardise their role as a public service."
"The proposal to end monopolies and separate infrastructure management from railway undertakings is an interesting one but how are we going to guarantee the adequate maintenance of lines that are less profitable in economic terms but that are needed by society?"
"We cannot forget that railways are a strategic element in vital development in many regions. Let me give you an example: service on the only international link through the central Pyrenees, through Canfranc, has been interrupted as a bridge collapsed on the French side and it has not been repaired."
"It has not been repaired for 30 years."
"The reason for this is very simple: the line was not very profitable for the publicly-owned undertaking that was operating it and, as a result, the line is now closed."
"In other words, the deterioration of infrastructures is hindering the liberalisation process."
"This means that we must find ways to ensure that networks are maintained, no matter what their current uses and profitability may be. In contrast, liberalisation will only lead to reduced services, particularly in the less developed European regions."
"Mr President, first of all I will resist the temptation to list all the stations on the West Coast main line in my constituency and also on the trans-Pennine route."
"But I note that Mr Hyland has left."
"First of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Pavlos Sarlis and Hannes Swoboda for their work in this very important area."
"It has been, for a long time now, a priority of my group to revitalise the railways of the European Union."
"We have also recognised that the action that needs to be taken to enable our railway industry to survive has to be radical in its approach, innovative in its conception and courageous in its actions."
"The scale of the problems facing the railway industry cannot be underestimated."
"At a time when the overall transport market is expanding, we find that rail's share of that market has been reduced to no more than 6 % of the passenger - and 16 % of the freight - sector."
"Put simply, the railway sector throughout the EU is in such a perilous state that we have to question whether international passenger services or freight services will still exist in 15 years' time."
"Therefore, if I can use a medical analogy here, we have a very sick patient who is in need of major help, and I believe that our two rapporteurs, along with the Commission, have given us the medicine to make our railways fit and healthy well into the next century."
"There are some in the railway industry, and indeed, some in this Parliament, who believe that we can carry on with a system that is based on old working practices, functioning only within a national network based on the ideals of the 1930s."
"My group believes that the status quo is not an option in this case, and that those who believe it is will contribute to the death of our railways."
"If we are to ensure that railways have a future outside of commuter services, particularly in freight, then we have to take the actions that have been outlined to us by our rapporteurs."
"Rail cannot compete in the freight sector against road haulage if the service it has to offer takes 67 hours to travel 850 kilometres in comparison with 13 hours by truck."
"However, my group recognises that there are concerns amongst railway workers - after all, we are proposing a shift in emphasis that is quite radical."
"This is why we have supported a more guarded approach to the introduction of free market rules in other areas outside of freight, coupled with social protection measures, and with the public service obligation a high priority."
"We have an opportunity today to lay the foundations for a new railway age in the new millennium."
"My group welcomes that opportunity and supports the Commission and our rapporteurs in their efforts to secure a future for Europe's railways."
"Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome the Commission proposals presented to us this evening with the intention of liberalising European railways and opening up the markets to greater competition."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate both rapporteurs on the exceptionally hard work they have put in on each report."
"It gives me particular pleasure, in the presence of the British Commissioner here tonight, to recognise a historic moment at which the Commission has caught up with Britain; Britain being the first country to liberalise its railway network, which was, at the time, a brave move, foreshadowing these Commission proposals, and bringing, in my view, very positive results: more passengers travelling by train, more freight travelling by rail and therefore off the roads, with high levels of safety achieved."
"The main proposals contained in the Commission proposals and Mr Sarlis' and Mr Swoboda's reports, and the three main developments, are very welcome: greater transparency, separating the provision of the infrastructure from the operation of services on it; for accounting purposes, taking infrastructure, passenger and freight operations and putting them into separate business units; extending the current E regime for licensing international operators to all rail sectors, both domestic and international, across the European Union; making track charging and train path allocation based on principles regarding how the charges should be set and what conditions should apply in the allocation of train paths."
"I welcome these proposals and the developments towards the liberalisation of the rail sector."
"But these are modest steps."
"We think we should have progressed much further to open up the European market for all types of international freight."
"The challenge is to make this a truly single market for European railways."
"More needs to be done, especially on the licensing system, requiring operators to participate in certain common arrangements for networking and resolving the question of marginal cost pricing."
"Mr President, the Commission is proposing a package of directives which seek to modernise the rail sector, but its assumption that intermodal competition is the only way to develop Community railways is incorrect."
"The French members of the ARE Group oppose the direction that is being taken here, as it does not seem capable of resolving the present difficulties in the rail sector."
"Why is this?"
"Introducing more competition in rail transport at this time will serve only to undermine a sector which is already in difficulty."
"The privatisation of British railways at the start of the 1990s led to dissatisfaction amongst the general public and a deterioration in the quality of service."
"According to the Sunday Times, British railways have since been less reliable and less punctual than those in Pakistan, India and China."
"We can therefore understand why railway workers protested last year against the shift towards liberalism."
"We are not opposed to increasing cooperation between European railway undertakings, in accordance with the examples set in passenger transport by Thalys or Eurostar ."
"As regards freight transport, we began setting up freight corridors between France and its neighbouring countries at the end of 1997 at the initiative of the Commission; these have allowed the capacities required for long-distance rail links to be requested for freight."
"So why change direction before we have had a chance to develop this approach?"
"The Community should instead help to complete infrastructure, set up trans-European networks and facilitate the technical and social harmonisation of railways."
"We are therefore fighting to encourage as much coordination as possible between European railway undertakings."
"Who better than the public authorities to take up such a challenge by creating vast networks and rail freight corridors across the Union."
"While we are not against all aspects of the draft directives, we cannot support the measures seeking to open up the market, as provided for in the definition of authorised applicants in the draft Council Directive 95/19/EC, or Amendment No 10 by Mr Sarlis, seeking to broaden the scope of Council Directive 91/440/EEC."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda, for their cooperation in committee."
"There is no doubt that these are two very important reports."
"The whole package of measures is crucial to the further development of European policy on rail transport; or I could say, looking at the station clock, that we had better run for the train so as not to miss it, that it is high time Parliament and the Council finally tackled this subject."
"So I welcome the proposals on gradual liberalisation and boosting competitiveness."
"Another important aspect is the separation between railway undertakings, the separation between transport infrastructure management and transport services, between use and maintenance."
"This separation is vital to prevent distortion of competition and discrimination."
"Let me also point to the importance of the railways in relation to combined transport."
"The railways are a more environmentally friendly, safe and expandable mode of transport and must therefore continue to be supported in future."
"As we all know, the capacity of the railways is still far from exhausted, in relation to the transport of both goods and passengers."
"It is vital for the railways to become competitive and become a serious alternative to road transport."
"The EU and the Member States must remedy any shortcomings in this respect if they genuinely are to put forward a credible policy in support of an environmentally friendly transport mode."
"That also means allocating the necessary budget funds."
"Shifting transport from road to rail will help preserve the environment throughout Europe."
"It is also important to promote rail transport with a view to the new Member States we will no doubt be welcoming among us one day."
"Mr President, we all realise that the railways have to be improved in order to ensure their survival."
"European railways, with their outdated structures, have declined steadily since the 1960s."
"The Commission's White Paper on a strategy for revitalising the Community's railways and the proposal relating to trans-European freight corridors were the first step in a new direction."
"The fact that the work is now in hand is a positive development."
"Both the reports before us today represent further necessary steps along the same road."
"In particular, today's debate demonstrates that there is a far greater understanding of the need for continued liberalisation if we are to halt the rapid decline."
"There will certainly have to be more liberalisation if constructive changes are to come about."
"Amongst other things, there is a need for a division in all the Member States between those who are responsible for the tracks and those who run trains on them."
"Presumably, it is perfectly reasonable that the various states will, for the most part, continue to own, build and maintain most of the infrastructure."
"However, it is equally reasonable that competition among the operators who use their tracks should be as free as possible."
"The infrastructure should be financed mainly by all those who use the tracks paying for the privilege."
"Should that happen, the national companies will doubtless continue to be the major operators, but they will have to compete with others on the same terms."
"This is the direction in which things are going today."
"The Transport Committee's report supports this type of development, which will allow new railway companies to compete."
"The reports we are considering today both take a decisive step in that direction, thereby giving Europe's railways the chance to develop positively in the future."
"However, it is worth emphasising that this is only the first step."
"The Commission must continue to come up with further initiatives if the railways are to have a future in the twenty-first century."
"Mr President, I welcome the very constructive reports by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda on the Commission's rail transport proposals."
"These reports certainly advance the debate on the future of railways, which is essential to the changes that have to be pursued if rail is to fulfil its true potential in modern Europe."
"That is a theme that has been taken up and emphasised by just about every speaker in the course of the debate tonight."
"Rail is in competition with road, as Mrs Moreau says, and the tragedy is that rail, for the last three decades, has become an increasingly poor second."
"What is evident from all that experience therefore is that carrying on with current conventions simply will not do."
"If rail is to have real vitality, then rail is going to have to change."
"What we are putting forward in this proposal and, indeed, other proposals is very strictly related to trying to achieve that objective, with all the economic, transport, environmental and employment implications and benefits that stem from that."
"I shall begin with Mr Sarlis' report on the Commission's proposal to amend Council Directive 91/440 on the development of the Community's railways."
"Naturally I am grateful for the support given to our proposals in the report and the very hard work of Mr Sarlis on this issue over a very long period of time."
"As I welcome the report, I also take serious note of Mr Sarlis' observation that the proposed amendments may not be sufficiently substantial."
"I am pleased to say that we can accept the majority of the committee's proposed amendments."
"Indeed, I have to say that we do not reject the others because we think they would be unacceptable in principle; we cannot accept them simply because they would be likely in practice to increase the difficulty of getting wider agreement to this package in the Council."
"In short, we share many of Mr Sarlis' views but if we accept some of his amendments there is a real danger that in pursuing the best we could risk losing the good."
"I hope he understands, therefore, that our inability to accept some of his proposals is a product of necessary pragmatism and not opposition in principle."
"There are two main areas where the committee favours an approach that would be more radical than that proposed by the Commission, and I should like to concentrate on them."
"First, I want to emphasise that I am grateful for the strong support given for further liberalisation of the railway sector through the careful creation of greater access rights."
"I also share the conviction that rapid progress is now essential - indeed, that has been the case for some time past."
"I hope, therefore, that this Parliament will be able to encourage a similar view amongst those Member States which are still reluctant to accept the need for such advance."
"Having said all that, I also have to emphasise that the proposals before the House this evening are not liberalisation proposals."
"We have always argued and very strongly emphasised that this package - on the separation of management, on licensing, on capacity allocation and on other relevant issues like charging practices - is required whether further access rights are created or not."
"This package is required simply to make the legal proposals that theoretically govern rail in the European Union work as they were intended back in 1991."
"Of course the Council still has our proposal to extend Article 10 of Directive 91/440 in a way that is similar to what we are proposing here."
"Both of these factors lead me to believe that while fully endorsing the position set out in Mr Sarlis' report, it would not be productive to include the rapporteur's proposed text in our proposal and, therefore with reluctance, we have to reject Amendment No 10."
"I sympathise with the view expressed in the report that the Commission did not go far enough in requiring separation of railway undertakings from infrastructure managers."
"However, our position has to be to achieve what is legally required while, at the same time, permitting those Member States which do not favour complete separation to retain a single overall railway company."
"We have consequently required the separation of those functions which determine access to the infrastructure."
"Nevertheless, we have no objection in principle to going further where that is consistent with the practical purposes."
"I am glad to be able to incorporate Amendment No 6 in our proposal."
"In a similar manner, I could accept the proposed Amendment No 11, which would require the same separation but in a shorter time period."
"However, even with full separation we still have to ensure that essential regulatory functions - licensing functions, for instance - are not carried out by incumbent railway undertakings."
"Nowadays this situation borders on the absurd as well as being extremely distortive of potential competition."
"I am sure that honourable Members also share that view - indeed it has been expressed in the course of this evening."
"That is why we have to reject Amendment No 4, which would, in practice, have removed this specific requirement."
"There are two other amendments which we do not feel able to accept."
"The first is Amendment No 3, which would remove the laying down of safety rules from recital 4 in the proposal."
"I believe that this function is as important as the monitoring and enforcement of the safety rules and that it must also therefore be referred to in the text."
"On reflection, I hope that honourable Members will accept that point and not pursue the amendment."
"The second amendment that we cannot accept is Amendment No 12, which removes the reference to railway undertakings having to provide rail services."
"It results in a less clear definition and is, in our view, an unnecessary change."
"In short, therefore, the Commission accepts Amendment Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11, whilst rejecting Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 10 and 12."
"I now move to Mr Swoboda's report, which deals with the other two proposals in this package of measures."
"With regard to the proposal to amend Directive 95/18 on the licensing of railway undertakings, we are glad to accept the first amendment but we have to reject the second amendment, which seems to us not to be based on relevant criterion."
"The second part of the report deals with the proposal for a directive on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for use."
"Here again I am happy to say that we wish to incorporate almost half of the amendments in our revised proposal."
"Those include most of the new recitals, the definition changes and the creation of the charging framework."
"I have great sympathy with the view that Community legislation should not be over-prescriptive."
"Mr Swoboda proposed a number of amendments that helpfully sought to simplify this proposal."
"Some of the simplifications are, as I say, welcome but we felt unable to endorse some others which appear to cut into the substance of the proposal - inadvertently, I am absolutely certain."
"Many of these latter amendments deal with the proposed rules for capacity allocation."
"In our view, it is important to establish precise procedural rules in order to ensure that these processes, which go to the very heart of being able to offer railway services, are coordinated and fair to all undertakings."
"We will therefore endeavour to make some simplifications along the lines that have been suggested by Mr Swoboda, but maybe not to the degree that he envisages."
"There are a number of key points that I would like to address before concluding."
"Firstly, there are the charging rules."
"We believe that the proposal in Amendment No 12 to include a rate of return in Article 8 (3) is unnecessary since such a provision already exists in the proposal in respect of investments and for passenger services."
"Amendment No 13, to reduce the text relating to external costs in Article 8 (5), is not acceptable to us. That is because the purpose of our text was to create clear conditions for the development of these charges for rail while safeguarding rail from undue experimentation."
"I feel that the simplified text is insufficiently precise and therefore I have to resist that text."
"Similarly, the changes proposed in Amendment No 15 to the discount provisions in Article 10, set out principles which we believe should apply to this type of business as defined in the ruling in the Zaventem airport charges."
"It is preferable for all concerned that these are very clearly understood."
"The key proposed change relating to charges is Amendment No 14 on Article 9 of the proposal."
"Here again there is a strong desire to simplify the rules and also to permit some of the higher charges for freight traffic."
"We can accept those principles though the proposed wording causes some difficulty and we will have to re-examine that."
"Secondly, there is the question of authorised applicants in Article 19."
"The Commission strongly believes that whether or not there is further progress on access rights, the concept of authorised applicants can create more attractive conditions for large purchases of rail transport services."
"It will encourage them to place greater reliance on this mode of transport."
"They have to make a stronger commitment to rail."
"One would have presumed that all the rail companies and all indeed working in rail would welcome a real inducement for large rail users and potential rail users to use this facility of authorised applicants in order to strengthen further their commitment or even to make a new commitment to the use of rail."
"I know that both Parliament and the Commission want that greater commitment to rail."
"I suggest that this is one very practical way of securing that commitment."
"In view of that we cannot support the demotion of this concept to a matter for national legislation as suggested in Amendments Nos 19 and 5."
"It is the concept, the authorised applicant, that can be particularly important at international level in view of the fact that there are currently no cross-border railway undertaking."
"To use Mr Swoboda's very useful phrase, we want this application in Community law in order, literally, to Europeanise the prospect of this means of increasing the attractiveness of rail freight transport for major users."
"Thirdly, as I mentioned briefly, Amendments Nos 19 to 27 seek to simplify the articles dealing with capacity allocation."
"But unfortunately and, I think inadvertently, these would delete important elements such as the requirements to treat all services equally and to consult during the scheduling and coordination process and in the development of enhancement plans."
"I subscribe to the objective of simplification and we will therefore look very hard to see how the text can be tidied up."
"But the loss of these elements through the adoption of the proposed amendments would be a cause of significant concern."
"I would like to deal with the proposed Amendments Nos 17 and 18 and their implication of reintroducing the priority rules from Directive 95/19."
"One objective of the Commission proposal which I am certain that the rapporteur and others share is to make freight and passenger rail more commercially attractive, not least because it will ensure better use of infrastructure and lead to consequent reductions in costs for all services."
"Clearly where there is an absolute shortage of capacity choices have to be made."
"Our proposal does not stop one type of traffic being favoured in those circumstances."
"I believe that it would be a mistake, therefore, to seek to grant better treatment to one type of traffic over another during the normal allocation process."
"In addition, the ability to grant special rights to enable the development, for example, of new or dedicated infrastructure is already clearly provided for in Article 27 of the existing proposal."
"I cannot accept the new proposed amendments to the Swoboda report: Amendments Nos 29 and 31 would change the definition of railway undertaking."
"The consequences would be a loss of clarity in the definition and therefore, as I hope the House will accept, unnecessary."
"The change to authorised applicants in Amendment No 30 restricts its scope to licensed railway undertakings, thereby negating the objective and indeed the effect of the proposal."
"Consequently we cannot accept that."
"To sum up, therefore, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 28 as well as the principles contained in Amendment No 14."
"I hope that honourable Members can agree with me that our underlying objectives are similar - indeed almost identical - and that even though we cannot accept all of the proposed amendments, we will endeavour to incorporate the objectives of many of the amendments in our revised proposal."
"In particular, I am confident that Mr Swoboda's report will provide significant strengthening for the further discussions in the Council."
"Mr Sarlis' report will also have that beneficial effect."
"Obviously we are far from the end of this process."
"I warmly welcome Parliament's continued interest and the pressure for progress."
"I conclude by thanking both rapporteurs - Mr Swoboda and Mr Sarlis - and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their valued support on all of the essentials."
"I hope that the whole House will endorse their constructive approach."
"Mr President, the Commissioner very wisely said at the beginning of today's debate that a politician listens - and must listen - but does not commit him or herself."
"I hope that Commissioner Kinnock, despite his negative stance today on certain basic issues, listened, and that there will be some scope and some space available for him to reverse his negative views over time, as tomorrow - as I have been informed and as my colleagues are aware - he will be confronted with two proposals which have been unanimously adopted by the European Parliament."
"It is impossible for us to move forward, that is, for the Commission not to push through Article 10 and yet to ask us to fully accept the concept of authorised applicant."
"This is a position which, I think, no one is going to accept."
"I ask, therefore, that we have the benefit of a revision of opinions."
"I am sorry, Mr Sarlis, that is the end of the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Ro-ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0061/99), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council (12893/3/98 - C4-0004/99-98/0064(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Directive on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services in the Community (Rapporteur: Mr Watts)."
"Mr President, the history of ferry safety can only be described as scandal: despite the tragic events in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, next to nothing was done."
"Literally thousands of lives were lost before the basic, fundamental, and in some cases outrageous shortcomings in ferry design and operations were addressed, despite repeated warnings from the unions, consumer groups and indeed this Parliament."
"In particular, it took the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Scandinavian Star and, most tragic of all, the Estonia , before ferry companies and governments started to come to terms with the consequences of their negligence."
"However, since 1994 we have all at last seen both words and action from the Commission - action this Parliament has welcomed and I believe, as rapporteur, sought at every turn to facilitate."
"The latest measure from the Commission seeks to submit regular Ro-ro passenger ferries and high-speed passenger craft to mandatory survey regimes by host states before entry into service and then at regular intervals."
"The unique feature is that this will apply irrespective of the flag state."
"These measures therefore also close the loop-hole which currently prevents Member States from investigating accidents involving their own citizens."
"For the purpose of facilitating the investigation the proposal includes a carriage requirement of a voyage data recorder - a black box."
"However, on first reading, the Parliament highlighted the weak wording which would in effect, in my view and that of the Parliament, allow certain ferries to either carry a sub- standard black box or not carry a black box at all."
"Hence our reasonable demand that black boxes meeting the latest standards must be fitted to all ferries within five years."
"This unfortunately was rejected by both the Council and the Commission."
"The Commission commented in its communication to this Parliament that it could not accept this because, in its words, it would render the further operation of the ferry or craft 'economically non-viable'."
"I am, as your rapporteur, informed that to retro-fit a black box to a ferry undergoing a refit would cost a lot less than new carpets or curtains."
"I invite the Commission tonight to join with me in putting safety first by supporting our amendment."
"On first reading, we also welcome the desire on the part of the Commission to require the data relating to compliance to be made available to the Commission in order to establish a new transparent system accessible to all parties concerned."
"However, our demands for public access were rejected."
"The Commission commented in its communication that neither the Commission nor the Council could accept the request by the European Parliament that information on the ferries and craft should be made publicly available."
"We would point out that such a view flies in the face of the Commission's own quality shipping initiative, which says: 'exposure of the sub-standard players to public knowledge is essential to the objective of the quality shipping initiative.'"
"Indeed, the Commission itself is already establishing a European quality shipping information system available to the public."
"What better way to shift the initiative and the campaign away from a mere list of nice intentions towards real action?"
"After all, what has the industry to hide?"
"Of all the interested parties, do the travelling public not have a particular right of access to information about the safety of the vessel to which they entrust their lives and those of their families?"
"It is time to make black boxes a mandatory requirement on all ferries and high-speed craft in the interests of passenger safety and confidence."
"It is time that ferry safety data be made publicly available so that we can name and shame sub-standard ships and operators."
"It is time to put ferry safety first."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, in particular, Mr Watts, for the quick and thorough work on the Council's common position on this important proposal."
"As the report acknowledges, most of the amendments adopted at first reading were accepted by the Commission in its amended proposal and incorporated in the Council's common position."
"That obviously signifies a very useful consensus on the main features of the legislation."
"For reasons which I well understand and which he has again articulated very effectively, Mr Watts is resubmitting two amendments which the Commission could not accept at first reading, and I should like to respond further to those amendments tonight."
"The first amendment deals with the issue of granting derogation from the technical specifications for voyage-data recorders to be installed on board existing ferries and high-speed craft."
"When the Commission tabled this proposal, we took due account of the technical difficulties that could arise from fitting these instruments on board existing ships and craft and we therefore made the provision that the committee could agree on exemptions from some of the technical requirements that VDRs have to comply with."
"I understand that Mr Watts agrees with this approach in principle but that he wishes to see this derogation limited in time so that after the proposed five-year period, existing ferries and high-speed craft should be equipped with VDRs that comply fully with all the technical specifications that are applicable for new ships."
"I understand the principle but it must be said that a provision of this kind would require the replacement of the voyage-data recorder and, in almost all cases, the replacement of navigation and engine-control equipment in order to ensure the availability of the right communication protocols for feeding information into the VDR."
"In many cases that would also entail extensive recabling between the VDR and the equipment from which it has to retrieve its information."
"Obviously, the cost associated with this re-engineering work would greatly exceed the purchase cost of the voyage-data recorder."
"In my view, that would not be justified or proportionate, when we recall that the envisaged objective of the proposal is to make possible the collection of information for the purposes of accident investigation."
"In addition, I must also say that ferry companies which have already voluntarily installed VDRs on board their vessels should not be penalised by being forced to replace such equipment, with all the re-engineering that implies."
"So, for all those reasons - practical reasons, not reasons of principle - I cannot accept the five-year limitation period that is proposed in Amendment No 1."
"Amendment No 2 repeats the request made at first reading for the information on the particulars of roll-on/roll-off ferries and high-speed craft permitted to operate on regular services, including information about any operational limitation."
"It asks for that information to be made public and available by the Commission."
"In response, I have to say that the House may recall that at first reading I cautioned about the risk of making public all data on the inspected ships and craft, particularly so far as reliability, security and the possibility of commercial abuse were concerned."
"It is that concern which prompted the Commission to propose that it is for the committee, established for the purposes of this directive, to determine the conditions for access to such data."
"So there is no question of closing down, there is a question of the practical discretion of the committee."
"I hope that honourable Members can accept the validity of that approach."
"The ferry survey database proposed in this directive should be considered as a specialised instrument that is designed primarily to assist Member States and the Commission in monitoring and enforcing the implementation of the directive by providing detailed information on the application of this survey regime."
"Having said that, I wholeheartedly share Mr Watts' opinion that any relevant information on matters relating to the safety of passengers should be disseminated to the public as widely and clearly as possible."
"On that basis, as Mr Watts stressed in his report, the Commission has undertaken to develop a database on the quality performance of shipping called Equasis, in the context of our quality shipping campaign, and in order to greatly improve transparency of information about the safety performance of shipping in general."
"We will meet that commitment."
"The Equasis database will be widely accessible to the shipping community and to the general public."
"I consider that it will provide the most appropriate means of disseminating all relevant information on the safety performance of ferries, the issue which rightly excites the particular interest and indeed missionary zeal of Mr Watts."
"When the conditions of access to the ferry survey database are elaborated in the committee, my services will give full attention to the need to feed as much information as possible from that database into the Equasis database."
"I am convinced that, in practice, this approach will ensure the level of transparency that Mr Watts and his colleagues in this House quite rightly are asking for, without having to amend the text of the common position."
"Finally, I can inform honourable Members that I support the objectives of Amendment No 3, since it clarifies the exact scope and extent of inspections for life-saving appliances and equipment in line with the requirements of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention."
"I conclude by thanking Mr Watts and his colleagues for facilitating the adoption of this directive, which, together with other measures already enacted and implemented in recent years, will have a direct and beneficial effect on the safety of people travelling on conventional and high-speed passenger vessels in European Union waters."
"Mr Watts rightly reminded us of the passenger ship tragedies of recent years."
"Let us hope that by the implementation of these measures we will make it almost impossible - as impossible as travel by sea can allow - for any repetition of such tragedies to take place."
"When we can say that, I must say that the useful work and the dedication shown by Members of this House will have played a significant part in reaching that desirable standard."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"European capital of culture 2005-2019"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0106/99), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the common position adopted by the Council (9268/1/98 - C4-0493/98-97/0290(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a Community action for the 'European Capital of Culture' event for the years 2005 to 2019 (Rapporteur: Mr Monfils)."
"Mr President, the dossier on European cities of culture which has been open since October 1997 will be closed, I hope, tomorrow."
"The debate has lasted for more than a year and a half because the position of the Commission and the European Parliament was profoundly different from that of the Council of Ministers."
"The European Parliament wanted the choice of city to be based on the quality of the projects, without reference to any contribution made by the Member States or choice made according to Community decision-making procedures, that is, the codecision procedure."
"The Council of Ministers had itself opted for Member States to nominate each year, in turn and on a pre-established rotational basis, one of their cities as European capital of culture."
"The European Parliament rejected the Council's common position at second reading by adopting a declaration of intended rejection."
"We therefore found ourselves faced with a choice: either to continue a dialogue of the deaf with the Council for several months, exhausting the procedure provided for by Article 189 - and I believe that there would have been no winners or losers at the end of this procedure, which would have continued indefinitely - or to see whether a compromise would be possible."
"We chose the second option and proposed to the Council of Ministers compromise amendments which took account of both the Council's point of view and, naturally, the European Parliament's position as well."
"This procedure, which is rather uncommon in the context of informal contacts, was accepted by the Council which used the paper we submitted as a basis for discussion, and the bargaining ended with an agreement."
"I think it is a creditable agreement considering the gap which separated the views of Parliament and the Council."
"Admittedly, the Council's idea of nominating cities in turn for each Member State has been preserved, but the direct choice of city to nominate by the Member State has been abandoned; several cities in the same country may submit an application."
"Moreover, the selection panel which was no longer included in the Council's common position, was re-established."
"It is composed of seven experts on the cultural sector, and it must issue a report on the nominations."
"Finally, each nominated city must make a detailed submission on its cultural project; this is something Parliament had wanted, and was also no longer included in the Council's common position."
"We did not obtain the right of codecision in the choice of city to nominate, but the European Parliament may deliver a prior opinion on the nominations; the Commission forwards its recommendations, which are based both on the selection panel's report and the opinion delivered by Parliament, to the Council."
"This compromise, which mainly reproduces the European Parliament's position, has been made possible due to the concern expressed by the German Presidency regarding opening up to other cultures, which I salute."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not very often that the Council takes Parliament's point of view into consideration, and this bargaining seems to me to be a positive example of how our institutions work."
"However, this compromise would not have been possible either without the constant support of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and its chairman; they have continually supported the rapporteur's opinions and have cooperated closely - through the amendments they have proposed - on the improvements to be made to the text, as well as taking part in the negotiations along with myself."
"I should like to conclude by saying that I hope these amendments which the Council has obviously accepted will be adopted tomorrow by Parliament, and I am convinced that in the concrete follow-up to this decision, the Commissioner responsible and his staff will pay particular attention to the cultural merit of the projects submitted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 'European Capital of Culture' programme is a success story."
"For the Member States, it has become a very strong symbol, so much so that taking away their power to designate and administer the programme has become a sensitive issue."
"But it is precisely because the governments do not want to lose control over the cultural capitals that the Commission and the European Parliament feel that a programme of such importance for the public could not remain in the inter-governmental sphere."
"The Commission therefore presented, in November 1997, a proposal to communitarise the programme with the backing of the European Parliament in May 1998, demanding co-decision for the nomination and selection of cities based on solid cultural criteria."
"For the European Parliament, it was vital to involve as many members of the arts world as possible in the events, to instigate forms of lasting cooperation, to foster the creation and circulation of works of art, while enhancing our historic heritage and urban design, opening up initiatives to a wide-ranging public and avoiding Eurocentrism by involving as many non-European cultures as possible."
"In a nutshell, the Parliament wanted to ensure that the programme would bring about a real change in the quality of life of the cities and their inhabitants long after the festivities themselves are over."
"The divide between the Council and the European Parliament turned into such an abyss that conciliation seemed impossible, yet it has succeeded."
"This is a great victory for democracy."
"Parliament's firmness and the negotiating skills of rapporteur Philippe Monfils worked the miracle of forcing the Council to abandon its undemocratic arrogance and come to the negotiating table."
"The outcome is an honourable compromise in which neither party loses face: the governments managed to hold on to the right to define a rota system among the Member States to decide which of them is entitled to nominate cities, while Parliament has been given the right to select the given cities within that system."
"The governments agreed to the principle of basing the choice of cultural capital on cultural criteria, on the basis of the opinions of a joint panel and the European Parliament, just as the European Parliament intended."
"Therefore, as of 2005, the European capital of culture will enjoy the optimum conditions for using the event as an ideal opportunity for inter-cultural collaboration."
"The governments are willing to come up with generous funding for this great joint festivity, as was the European Parliament's initial wish."
"Finally, I should like to say that today we are going to vote on this project and on behalf of my group I would ask you to lend your support to an excellent example of how politics work."
"That is because interinstitutional consultations are playing an increasingly important part in the Community's decision-making process and that is why the Group of the European People's Party will be voting for this report without any hesitation or regret."
"Mr President, we support the proposed compromise in order to optimise the way the European capital of culture is selected."
"But perhaps it is not so very important which city is finally chosen."
"Perhaps it is especially important, however, to define in precise terms the responsibility that city will have to assume."
"What is important here is the content of the submission, as listed in Article 2a for instance, including the need to promote dialogue between European cultures and those from other parts of the world."
"There is one thing we must not forget: in a future united Europe the cultural capital of Europe will not just represent itself but will act as Europe's cultural ambassador for that period."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, not only for his excellent work but also for having been so patient at an awkward stage in our deliberations."
"Article 128 of the Maastricht Treaty stresses the importance of cooperation among Member States to conserve and safeguard Europe's important cultural heritage."
"Europe has great cultural diversity: throughout history Europe has been - and still is - a pole of exceptionally rich and varied cultural development, where European cultures are still being shaped and disseminated."
"The desire for cultural integration in Europe also means becoming conscious of the European cultural area."
"Every city considered as a possible European capital of culture has its own characteristics which can be summarised in four key words: knowledge, tradition, mobility and communication."
"These words express the coexistence of attempts to modernise, innovate and safeguard our historical and artistic heritage: a combination of past, present and future which keeps alive the memory of the roles and functions which, down the ages, have led to a cross-fertilisation of cultures, knowledge and hence communication, by which I mean a diverse pattern of mobility and interaction."
"As the rapporteur has indicated, the European Parliament wishes to see greater Community involvement in the process of choosing the European Capital of Culture in the years 2005 to 2019, by altering the system of automatic nomination originally drawn up by the Council."
"The suggested changes to the common position include the possibility of having several cities nominated in any one year and the establishment of a panel of independent experts, appointed by the Community institutions to provide opinions on these nominations."
"The overwhelming majority of delegations in the Council are minded to endorse Parliament's suggestions and have called on the German Presidency to reach an early consensus with us."
"This consensus needs to be found rapidly, so that each European city which is nominated can, firstly, draw attention to cultural trends shared by the European people which that city has inspired and to which it has contributed significantly; secondly, promote cultural events in association with other cities in EU Member States, designed to bring about lasting cultural cooperation; thirdly, circulate these around the European Union; and fourthly, foster dialogue between the cultures of Europe and the rest of the world, but above all enhance that city's historical and artistic heritage by improving the quality of life there."
"Europe's architectural heritage is the expression of our different identities and, at the same time, of our common origins, in that materials, elements, forms and spaces meet, unite and divide in constant search of a balance between old and new."
"Knowledge and understanding of our architectural heritage are therefore key factors in determining our cultural identity and bear witness to our origins and our history."
"Mr President, I admit that I was greatly relieved when I saw the agreement that had been reached and when I saw how it had been reached because, at one point in time, I was seriously worried as I doubted that we would be able to reach an agreement at all. The lack of such an agreement would have been very serious indeed as it would have meant the loss of the European Capital of Culture, one of the most symbolic results of all cultural Community actions."
"For this reason, I should like to thank Mr Monfils in particular for having had the determination and, at the same time, the flexibility needed to reach these agreements."
"Also, I should like to thank the President of the Commission who, through his enthusiasm and good judgement, helped make this outcome possible."
"As you will remember, on 30 October 1997, the Commission presented a Community initiative for the European Capital of Culture. The Commission's proposal centred around three main elements."
"Then, the Commission forms a selection panel composed of independent members that will draw up a report on the cities nominated and submit it to the Commission. Lastly, on the Commission's proposal and after prior consultation with Parliament, the Council will select the European Capital of Culture by qualified majority."
"In effect, what we discussed was replacing the intergovernmental procedure that had been used until that point and had also proved to be increasingly cumbersome as a Community procedure that involved Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Then, in its common position of July 1998, the Council arrived at a solution that was barely satisfactory and that was based on a rota system linked to the Presidency."
"The selection procedure was significantly different to the Commission's proposal and, furthermore, Parliament was virtually excluded from the procedure."
"The determination of this House and the declaration of intent to reject the common position announced on 13 January gave rise to the so-called 'mini-conciliation' procedure and today we are reaping the benefits of negotiation between the two arms of the legislature, to which the Commission has also contributed."
"The eight amendments we have before us, and which the Commission accepts, reintroduce the panel of leading independent figures back into the body of the text along with criteria that allow us to ensure the cultural quality and European dimension of the city's programme."
"Lastly - and this is important - as an exceptional case the Council will adopt its decision on the basis of a recommendation by the Commission rather than a proposal. The recommendation will be drawn up after considering the European Parliament's opinion and the panel's report."
"In this way, a Community dimension going beyond the simple rotation of the Presidency will be introduced."
"We are therefore delighted by the outcome of the negotiations and we hope that both arms of the legislature will be able to accept the agreement that is today being put forward. And I should once again like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Monfils, for his active involvement in this procedure."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 12 midnight"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I refer to yesterday's Question Time, and in particular page 24 of the Minutes."
"At that point, I actually asked Mrs Gradin a question in connection with the false statement which Mrs Cresson made before the Committee on Budgetary Control; I asked her whether Mrs Cresson should resign because of this."
"Mrs Gradin did not answer the question."
"This course of events is now recorded in the Minutes as follows."
"It simply says: 'Mr Posselt spoke'."
"Loud applause"
"We shall ensure that the Minutes are corrected so that they reflect exactly what took place."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Mr President, I do not want to comment on the Minutes."
"I should simply like to point out to this noble House that today is the 40th anniversary of the occupation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China."
"Mr President, I have a complaint."
"It is true that I often speak in languages other than my own, but now I can no longer hear the Dutch interpretation on channel 5. I believe this is a deliberate act on the part of the administration."
"So in future, I will always speak in another language and I will also listen in other languages."
"We shall carry out the necessary technical checks straight away, because you do also speak Dutch."
"Laughter"
"Agenda"
"Mr President, on today's agenda one of the items under the heading 'Votes' is the vote on the De Giovanni report on the scrutiny of the exercise of the Commission's powers."
"You all know that the question of how far the European Parliament's right to information extends, pursuant to Article 206 of the Treaty, was the subject of fierce controversy with the Commission in connection with the UCLAF report on the ECHO affair."
"As a result, it was agreed that negotiations should be held between the Commission and Parliament with the aim of laying down rules on how Article 206 should be applied in the future."
"These rules are now on the table in the form of an agreement between the Commission and Parliament, and are supposed to be adopted today under the procedure without debate."
"Given the complex nature of this issue, and therefore the contents of the agreement, I do not believe that this is appropriate."
"In this agreement we undertake to waive our right to information in the case of, for example, final reports on administrative inquiries, which are internal Commission reports on administrative procedures."
"I would therefore request, pursuant to Rule 99 of the Rules of Procedure, that we do not simply put this to the vote today without having a debate."
"Parliament must have an opportunity to debate this complicated and sensitive issue, and I have just submitted the necessary 29 signatures in support of this request."
"Mrs Müller, your request has been made correctly in accordance with the Rules."
"However, I would like to say two things to you. Firstly, the UCLAF problem must not be mixed up with this other problem."
"They are totally separate."
"A working party made up of representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission has been established to look at the UCLAF problem."
"When they have completed their work, they will report to Parliament."
"Secondly, this is a different issue."
"This issue concerns one of the other points raised by President Santer: the forwarding of confidential information to Parliament."
"At this stage, we can choose one of two solutions, but I do not wish to prejudge the matter and I would like to know what the groups' opinions are."
"The first solution would be to enter the item, with debate, on today's agenda; the second would be to enter the item, with debate, on the agenda of the next part-session."
"Irrespective of what you decide to do, it is clear that no amendments can be tabled since the report concerns an interinstitutional agreement."
"As has been the case with all the interinstitutional agreements, we must either approve it or reject it."
"However, we can consider the two options available and I would like to ask the groups if they would prefer to include the item, with debate, in today's agenda or to wait until the next part-session."
"Mrs Green, you have the floor."
"Mr President, it is my view, given that Parliament and its Members have not had a chance to really see the proposal, let alone talk about it, that we should defer the vote until the next part-session."
"In particular, the Committee on Institutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control should have the chance to look at it and discuss it before it is put to the vote."
"Mr President, we - the three persons mentioned - had the task of drafting this proposal for an agreement, and that follows from the resolution which Parliament adopted in January."
"We started work on this very quickly, but worked very intensively, and negotiated it at political level."
"As far as budgetary control is concerned, I might tell you that UCLAF is excluded until the arrangements for OLAF - its replacement, which is also under discussion - are complete, which means that the provisions for UCLAF are not affected by this agreement; the same applies to the question of information we receive through the financial controller."
"The task we were given needed to be completed quickly."
"That was also what Parliament wanted."
"On the procedure, I would like to tell you that I did not have to determine this myself."
"It was the Conference of Presidents which approved the proposal put forward by the three experts, and I had assumed that the groups would have been informed of how their chairmen voted."
"I do not therefore see why we should protract this process, and I would certainly be in favour of voting, so that these arrangements can be applied accordingly."
"Mr President, when I gave my reasons for making my request, I only referred to UCLAF because of the row over handing over the report on the ECHO affair."
"I understand that these rules are not about UCLAF."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to support what Mrs Green has said."
"I believe that we should give the House the opportunity to read this carefully and in full, because we are formulating certain rights and conventions here which affect a fundamental right contained within Article 206."
"It should be examined with the utmost care."
"This week is very busy, so I suggest we postpone the issue to the next part-session, and then we can take our time over our decision."
"Mr President, it is important to say that, whilst we approved it quite clearly last Thursday - and I added my support to that in the Conference of Presidents - it is not available in all the languages and it had not been seen by Members, even as late as yesterday."
"My Group, I am sure, will add its support to an interinstitutional agreement of this sort, but we need at least for Members to be able to read it."
"I would have thought that Mrs Theato could have agreed to that."
"I see that there is no agreement between the groups as regards changing today's agenda."
"I shall therefore ask the House to decide whether or not we enter the item, with debate, on the agenda for today's sitting."
"Parliament rejected the proposal"
"Therefore, since we are not going to take the item with debate today, we shall put it on the agenda for the next part-session, pursuant to Rule 99 and as requested by Mrs Müller and other signatories."
"The report will be referred back to the committee responsible, which is the Committee on Institutional Affairs, since we are dealing with an interinstitutional agreement."
"As with all agreements of this type, I would remind you again that no amendments may be tabled."
"We can merely approve or reject the agreement, after giving it the necessary consideration, of course."
"Mr Elles has the floor."
"Mr President, as that decision has now been taken by the House, could we be assured that the same procedure will be used for the report of the Committee of the Wise Men, which will be distributed in all languages and available to all Members before it is brought to the floor of this House and to go to the appropriate committee, which is the Committee on Budgetary Control, before it is voted on?"
"The report of the Wise Men will not only be distributed to all Members but it will also be put on the Internet, so that everybody can look at it."
"In fact, the Conference of Presidents decided that the procedure would be resolutions by groups."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Budgetary Control will be familiar with this report when approval of the 1997 discharge comes before the House."
"That is a different question."
"It can use the report of the Wise Men or anything it thinks useful at that time."
"The will of the House on the report of the Wise Men will be expressed through resolutions tabled by the groups as they see fit during the week following presentation."
"Mr President, I should just like to seek clarification on the timetable."
"Obviously I accept that we will not be voting on the agreement on information today."
"I would simply like to know whether it will therefore be put on the agenda of the mini-session."
"I have to know so that I can plan a further discussion of it."
"I think that the same goes for the Committee on Institutional Affairs; it might also need to discuss it again, since it is of course the committee responsible."
"It is, after all, the one which has tabled this report here, not the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In any case, we want to discuss it again and I just need to know whether it will be on the agenda then."
"It will be taken at the next part-session in Brussels."
"Mr President, a Kurdish demonstration is currently taking place outside Parliament's premises."
"I should therefore like to ask the President whether he intends to send a delegation to meet the Kurdish representatives who are assembled outside to hear what they have to say."
"I think it would be wise to do so if we are to show the same consideration to everyone who wishes to express their point of view to us as Members of the European Parliament."
"Until now, Mr Lindqvist, we have had no request to receive a Kurdish delegation."
"When we had such a request in Brussels, during the last part-session, we received the delegation and they presented us with their requests."
"If they make the same proposal today, they will obtain the same response."
"In other words, we will meet the delegation and listen to what they are asking for so that we can then consider it in the House."
"Preparation for the extraordinary European Council in Berlin on 24-25 March 1999"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation for the extraordinary European Council meeting in Berlin on 24 and 25 March 1999."
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this opportunity today - immediately before the foreign ministers begin the final round of Agenda 2000 negotiations at their informal meeting this coming weekend - to give you an overview of developments in the Council and inform you of how the negotiations on Agenda 2000 will proceed in the run-up to the European Council in Berlin on 24 and 25 March."
"Some weeks have passed since this subject was last debated here in the plenary on 10 February, and in that time the Council has made considerable progress in its search for a balanced overall package."
"Of course, I am not giving anything away when I tell you that on some pivotal issues a compromise has not yet been reached."
"That is entirely due to the nature of the project and was not to be expected; it simply illustrates the need to find a balanced solution across all the sectors."
"As the holders of the presidency, we assumed from the outset that the overall package could only be tied up in Berlin, and this will indeed be the case."
"Over the last few weeks, however, it has been possible to make significant progress on the necessary preliminary work which is intended to prepare the ground for the Berlin summit."
"For example, the conclave of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on 21 February made substantial progress on a number of issues."
"I should like to outline this for you briefly."
"It is now generally acknowledged that the use of constant 1999 prices for drawing up the financial perspective offers a number of practical advantages."
"As far as accession and pre-accession expenditure is concerned, it is agreed that expenditure intended for the applicant countries will be set aside and clearly identified as either pre-accession expenditure or expenditure solely for accession, so as to ensure that appropriations for the new Member States cannot be used by the present 15 Member States and that, by the same token, appropriations earmarked for the present 15 Member States cannot be used to cover the costs of enlargement."
"The presidency has put forward a proposal on this which meets with the approval of the vast majority of the Member States."
"We were also able to note a large measure of agreement on the amounts proposed by the Commission for pre-accession aid in the immediate future."
"The fact that we already reached a broad political agreement on the pre-accession instruments under the Austrian Presidency therefore sends out a clear signal to the applicant countries that we attach particular importance to the pre-accession instruments, as they will enable enlargement to come about quickly."
"It has already been possible to reach agreement on several key aspects of the future financing of the common agricultural policy: it was agreed to keep the agricultural guideline and review it before the first enlargement, and to set a ceiling below that which better reflects actual expenditure."
"As regards structural expenditure, further consideration is being given to a presidency proposal which takes account of both the need to stabilise expenditure and the need to consolidate the cohesion effort."
"This plan proposes stabilising Structural Fund expenditure; this will involve the average per capita level of aid for the three objectives being consolidated at current levels for the forthcoming period."
"In general, there is support for reducing the number of Community initiatives to three, provided that the existing scope of other initiatives, which have proved to be effective, is covered by the core objectives."
"For Categories 3 to 5, as a basis for further negotiations, the delegations set ranges within which the final annual ceilings will lie."
"A large measure of agreement could be noted on Category 6, reserves."
"On the subject of own resources and budgetary imbalances, the ministers made an initial assessment of the elements which might form part of a comprehensive agreement."
"It was generally felt that a final agreement - if it is to improve the balance of the financial framework - will require a combination of measures on both the expenditure and revenue sides."
"At the same time, account will be taken of the effects the political reforms contained within Agenda 2000 will have on the Member States, and also of the need to implement measures of this kind in several phases, with the first phase beginning in the year 2000."
"On the basis of the foreign ministers' deliberations, the Heads of State and Government met on 26 February at Petersberg near Bonn and discussed Agenda 2000 as a whole for the first time, exploring the scope for an overall political compromise."
"It was clear from the outset that the aim could not be fundamental decisions or even an overall agreement."
"Neither were we surprised, therefore, when the compromise paper presented by the German Presidency attracted not only support but also criticism."
"I would, however, like to point out that the criticism came from both sides."
"We were criticised both by the Member States which want to save more and by the Member States which want to spend more."
"I think that this puts us more or less in the middle, and if we agree that a compromise certainly has to be found somewhere between the extreme positions, then I have a feeling that the presidency is not so very wide of the mark."
"Applause"
"In the end, a number of important and useful pointers came out of the meeting of the Heads of State and Government, and these will form the basis of the further work of the Council - in its various configurations - in the run-up to the special summit in Berlin."
"The most important point is that all the partners have once again reaffirmed their determination to comply with the instructions of the Cardiff European Council, and to achieve an overall political agreement by the end of March 1999 at the latest."
"On behalf of the presidency, I should also like to make it perfectly clear and state in all seriousness here that we will not abandon this goal and that we will strictly refuse to engage in any discussion on a possible extension of the deadline, also because this is in Parliament's interests."
"Applause"
"The principles governing the negotiating procedure, which were agreed at the Vienna European Council, were confirmed: Agenda 2000 to be treated as a complete package; all the Member States to be willing to compromise, and a need for all the elements to be on the table."
"That was on 26 February; today it is 10 March and all the elements are no longer on the table."
"In terms of substance, it became clear that no one is seriously calling into question the need for budgetary stabilisation and budgetary discipline."
"The feeling prevails amongst all the Member States that at a time when national budgets are characterised by austerity, it would be unacceptable to deliver anything other than this to the public."
"There is a general conviction, therefore, that at the end of March in Berlin it will be possible to reach an overall compromise which respects the own resources ceiling of 1.27 %."
"The discussion which the Heads of State and Government had on the future financing of the common agricultural policy also took account, to a large extent, of the need for budgetary stabilisation."
"A majority of the Heads of State and Government came down in favour of giving the agriculture ministers clear instructions to reconcile agricultural reform and genuine stability, and in this context also to examine various models for making step-by-step reductions in agricultural subsidies."
"In the course of their deliberations this week and last, the agriculture ministers have been endeavouring to produce a basis for a genuine and reasonable reform while satisfying the austerity constraint."
"Progress is being made as we speak which, given the diversity of different interests and the complexity of the subject, is to be judged favourably. It also makes me all the more confident that it will be possible to finalise a result in Berlin which will be acceptable to everyone."
"In structural policy, the overall approach to be adopted towards appropriations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds remains controversial."
"Support was expressed for the presidency proposal to provide EUR 200 billion for the period 2000 to 2006 for Category 2, that is including the Cohesion Fund, but - and I must be quite clear about this - it was also violently opposed."
"The issue of the appropriations to be allocated is being given further careful consideration at the present time, along with various models."
"I am assuming that it will only be possible to resolve this issue in the very last phase of the negotiations, that is in Berlin itself."
"In principle, there is agreement on the transitional arrangements for regions coming off aid, although some details are still to be decided."
"On the issue of own resources and budgetary imbalances, there is a general willingness in the Council to review the decision on own resources, provided that this initiative is part of a balanced package which also takes account of the expenditure side."
"This will be a question of combining the right measures with a phased or staged approach."
"It might also be appropriate to incorporate a safety net into the overall package."
"Since the summit at Petersberg near Bonn, the presidency has once again stepped up negotiations at all levels."
"The scope of the negotiations was revised in the light of the discussions and will once again be presented for discussion to the foreign ministers this weekend and the ECOFIN Council next Monday."
"In his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, the Chancellor will tour all the capitals between 15 and 19 March; he will discuss the results achieved so far with the Heads of State and Government and will try, as a result of the tour, to bring home with him the makings of a compromise."
"Following this, the General Affairs Council, meeting on 22 March, and a preliminary conclave, meeting on 21 March, will make the final preparations for the European Council in Berlin."
"The President of the European Parliament, Mr Gil Robles, was invited by Chancellor Schröder to meet the Heads of State and Government at Petersberg and to present Parliament's thoughts on Agenda 2000."
"This is what happened, and it underlines the great political importance which the Council attaches to dialogue with Parliament."
"In this context, Chancellor Schröder emphasised that this dialogue is not a one-way street, but that it should allow both the Council and Parliament to influence each other's opinions."
"My stay here in Strasbourg today and tomorrow will include further informal consultations on the Structural Funds and the pre-accession instruments and will therefore promote cooperation between the Council and Parliament, which is vital if Agenda 2000 is to be resolved on time."
"Our Minister, Mr Funke, will also be taking part in separate discussions with Parliament on agricultural policy shortly."
"I can assure you that the presidency will do its utmost to ensure that Parliament will be able to see its concerns reflected in the results of the Berlin summit."
"I think that we all want this great challenge that is Agenda 2000 to yield workable results for the future of Europe."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"I now give the floor to Mr Santer, President of the Commission."
"Mr President, the coming weeks will be crucial for the Union's future."
"We are preparing to take decisions on Agenda 2000 which will be decisive in meeting the challenges of the 21st century and which will pave the way for the Union to welcome a substantial number of new Member States."
"The European Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to conclude negotiations by the end of this month and to adopt the necessary reforms."
"I should like to stress once again why this deadline must be met."
"First of all, we must maintain the new momentum which the Union has shown with the euro."
"Secondly, we must make proper preparations for the new structural programmes for the period 2000 to 2006. Finally, we must send a clear message to the applicant countries."
"There is nothing to be gained by procrastinating, and much to be lost."
"The European Council must now assume its responsibilities."
"It is one thing to express the political will to conclude this package."
"It is another thing to accept the compromises needed to implement it."
"This means respecting several principles at the same time."
"First of all, there is budgetary discipline, to which the two arms of the budgetary authority have attached considerable importance in recent years. Then you must also have the necessary resources to finance the Union's projects: growth and employment, solidarity through economic and monetary cohesion, a viable agricultural policy and, finally, enlargement."
"I would add that the Commission is keen to ensure that the issue of financing the Union does not get reduced to pushing figures around on paper."
"While budgetary discipline is most certainly necessary, it must not become an end in itself with no attention being given to our actual ambitions for Europe."
"Mr President, in this context, I should like to make a comment which in my view is important."
"In our proposals on Agenda 2000, we drew attention to the resources which should be made available to the institutions, and to the Commission in particular, in order to achieve the stated ambitions."
"I want to say very clearly that the Commission is no longer be prepared to accept ever-increasing tasks without receiving the means to execute them."
"A compromise must be reached in Berlin and this is perfectly possible."
"It is possible because a great deal of headway has been made with the preparatory work, especially on the legislation."
"In this respect, I would congratulate Parliament on its commitment and its attitude to the legislative process."
"A lot of progress has also been made in terms of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Moreover, with regard to those matters not yet resolved, all the elements are now on the table to put together a package which should be acceptable to all."
"Allow me to briefly review the three key areas in which we must make further progress."
"First of all, I would like to look at the common agricultural policy and rural development."
"The negotiations in the Agriculture Council are difficult and are still going on."
"I cannot therefore go into the details."
"The real problem facing us is the call for genuine stabilisation of expenditure on the one hand and the need for a real reform of the common market organisations on the other."
"There are different ways of reconciling these objectives."
"Some have spoken of phased reductions, others of cofinancing."
"The Commission is prepared to consider all the options, but there is one direction it refuses to take, that of a diluted and distorted reform."
"This would be contrary to the interests of Europe and its farmers."
"It would be irresponsible to allow expensive intervention stocks to build up again which would eventually send CAP expenditure through the roof."
"We must also take action straight away to prepare the ground for the forthcoming negotiations within the World Trade Organisation."
"The second problem still to be resolved concerns economic and social cohesion."
"By way of a preliminary remark, I would like to point out that the solidarity implied in this concept is, and must remain, one of the cornerstones of the European Union."
"There can be no question of the Commission going back on what was achieved with the last financial perspective, though this area too must be subject to budgetary discipline."
"I believe that a reasonable compromise would involve consolidating the solidarity effort on the basis of the level of aid achieved in 1999.But resources must be targeted more on the regions and groups within our society that need them most."
"It cannot be right for more than half the Union's population to be dependent, in one way or another, on aid from the Structural Funds."
"As always in the Union, we will find the appropriate transitional solutions that enable us to avoid excessively brutal shocks."
"We will also take account of certain specific situations."
"I come now to the third item of Agenda 2000, the financial aspects."
"In its October 1998 report on own resources, the Commission placed a number of possible options on the table."
"It added that it was prepared to make the necessary proposals if there were signs that the Member States could reach an agreement."
"At Petersberg I saw that most of the Heads of State and Government do not believe it is possible to achieve a balanced compromise unless action is taken on the issue of how to finance our policies."
"In particular, the question of fairness of contributions to the Community budget was raised."
"We have to admit that this is a political issue, but at the same time, we must not allow everything to hinge on the highly ambiguous concept of net balances."
"Everybody at Petersberg stated what they wanted and how far they were able to go."
