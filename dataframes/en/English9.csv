"In addition, British fishermen from the south-west of England to the north of Scotland are continuing to suffer greatly because of the common fisheries policy."
"Fishermen are discarding thousands of tonnes of saleable fish and going bankrupt in the process, yet while this economic and conservation disaster is in progress, the EU is proposing to spend over EUR 7 million to give Greek, Spanish and Italian fishermen access to the waters."
"By any standards, this is preposterous."
"Not only will I vote against these proposals, but I shall urge my government to oppose them."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s two proposals on these two fisheries agreements, particularly the agreement with Guinea."
"I should like to begin by highlighting and expressing my support for the innovations introduced by the current agreement, which dedicate 50% of the European Union' s total support to specific actions aimed at the sustainable development of the sector."
"Amongst other new aspects of this agreement, I also wish to highlight the innovation of providing an additional premium of EUR 370 million in the event that the Republic of Guinea implements a range of actions designed to reduce its overall fishing effort."
"As Guinea is a country with an annual available production of 250 000 tonnes of fish, and since its small-scale fishing fleet only has the capacity to catch 50 000 tonnes, this is clearly an agreement of mutual convenience, which avoids any conflict of interest and which also enables Guinea to obtain exceptional financing to develop its fisheries sector."
"We see from this that, apart from the importance of fisheries agreements for the European Union, they can also be used as instruments for development in these countries."
"As a Portuguese citizen, I am bound to regret the fact in this context that the Commission and the Council are so far behind in their negotiations on the agreement with Morocco."
"I am also unhappy at the difficulties being raised over other Member States having access to fisheries belonging to Greenland, the agreement with whom has hardly been used, and which is shortly due for renewal."
"It is nevertheless important that the requirements of supervision and control, as well as the programmes designed to control the reduction of the fishing effort are also imposed on the other countries that fish in the waters of these developing countries and not only on the Member States of the European Union."
"I therefore ask the European Union, during its negotiations, to make an extra effort to ensure that this rule is applied to everyone and not just to us."
"Mr President, sadly, all too often in the past, the reorganisation of the European fishing fleet has led to these ships being transferred to the African coast."
"They was no limit on the extent to which they could be used there, which posed a serious threat, not just to the fish stocks but also to the livelihoods and the food supply of the people in the local area."
"Accordingly, when we draw up these fisheries agreements, we should not just take account of the interests of the European fishermen, we must also bear in mind the interests of the local population."
"The agreement with Mauritius concerns the tuna fish catch, but the situation is far more complex for Guinea."
"European ships fish there for fish species that are used by the local fishermen."
"It is encouraging to see that in both agreements 50% of the financial contribution will be allocated to developing the local fishing industry."
"Control over how this money is spent is certainly prerequisite to the future extension of the Protocol."
"Private contracts between European shipowners and the Guinean Government are often concluded without this form of assistance from the local fishing industry, and contribute to over-fishing due to a lack of controls."
"A very worrying recent development is that small French trawlers are concluding contracts outside the fisheries agreement."
"These trawlers will fish in the coastal zone, where they are a direct threat to local fishermen."
"All Member State ships should respect an economic twelve-mile exclusion zone."
"In addition, I feel it goes without saying that shipowners should contribute more to the costs of the fisheries agreements and that the tax payer should not be the one to subsidise this exploitation of fishing grounds."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to compliment the Commission, and also our rapporteur, on the agreement reached."
"The agreement takes more account of the developing countries themselves, in this case Guinea and Mauritius, than was formerly the case."
"That is something in its favour and what it in fact means is that these agreements should actually fall to be considered under the codecision procedure with Parliament. Perhaps this will take place next year though, after the IGC."
"I am critical of a number of other points."
"I believe it is a sound agreement."
"Clearly this agreement is extremely important to the countries of the south; after all, the southern fisheries agreements are directly responsible for 13 000 jobs in Spain and Portugal, among others."
"The turnover is no mean feat either, amounting as it does to around EUR 485 million, in comparison with which, an agreement with Greenland, for example, pales into insignificance."
"This means that the sums set aside for this purpose will also mainly be spent in these countries."
"There is something to be said for this alone."
"Historically, these countries had their agreements, but it would be a positive move if the business community itself were to make more of a contribution to this kind of agreement."
"I mention this because a balance must be struck between developing countries and countries with a large fishing industry, but it is also necessary to strike a balance in the way funds are spent across the various fishing zones."
"That being the case, I would point out that certain countries in the north, of which my own country is one, have great difficulty with the cutbacks they are experiencing in the multiannual orientation programme."
"The honourable member from Great Britain has already described the problems the fishing sector is having to contend with there."
"This simply means that when it comes to the fisheries policy, we must look with a critical eye at this agreement in order to ascertain where the interests lie and how the money is being spent."
"It is quite clear that regional elements are going to play a more prominent role."
"Let there be no mistake, I think this agreement is indispensable to Spanish and South European fishermen - that is the first point - but I think it is also essential for a regional policy to allow for restructuring of the fishing industry in the northern coastal areas, to offer scope for sound agreements with northern countries, and for it to be properly tailored to specific regional needs."
"Mr President, it seems that the Commission is happy to ignore the requests of the Council and this Parliament - the former clearly expressed at the Council of Ministers of October 1997 - and delay the work on the guidelines for the negotiation of the fisheries agreements."
"The protocol with Guinea-Conakry is a good example."
"We expected the payment quota for shipowners to be increased, but it is intolerable that, in the Council working groups, the Commission is prepared to describe that increase as light, given that it means an ever-greater sacrifice for the fleet and that - I repeat - in the agreements with the northern countries, shipowners do not pay a penny."
"Furthermore, the Commission has been prepared to ignore the principle of relative stability by casually removing from the Community fleet fishing rights that have been acquired in accordance with that principle."
"The principle of relative stability is either sacred or it is not, and it cannot be untouchable in Community waters when the complete opposite is the case in the fisheries agreements with the southern countries."
"The Commission says that it has taken away Spain' s allowances for fishing cephalopods because it did not fully utilise them during the last protocol, and it grants them to countries which had never fished there. That is all very well."
"I have always argued for the total exploitation of the fishing rights granted, but in all waters, not just in relation to the agreements with the southern countries."
"In the agreements with the northern countries they are completely under-exploited and there is no way that the fleets with the greatest interest in fishing there can do so."
"Why do these differences exist?"
"Could you please explain this once and for all."
"Furthermore, what makes the Commission think that, because it did not utilise the fishing allowances during the previous protocol, it will not do so during this one, given that its cephalopod-fishing fleet which was fishing in Morocco has been out of action for nine months and there is no solution in sight?"
"Mr President, all of this illustrates the mental and physical chaos of our Community fishing authorities, and it will only be resolved when the guidelines which I referred to earlier are established in a clear and agreed way."
"Can I first of all welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur for his work in bringing forward this report?"
"There is little doubt that fisheries agreements are coming under much closer scrutiny to determine what they achieve and what they deliver, not only for people in the European Union, but also for the countries with which they were concluded in the first place."
"The rapporteur rightly mentioned the agreement with Morocco several times."
"This agreement is causing tremendous concern to the people most directly affected and those who might benefit to some extent and has certainly prompted great disquiet in the Fisheries Committee."
"I want to ask the Commissioner very straightforwardly and point-blank whether the Commission, and Parliament, and the European Union are being held to ransom by Morocco because of its unwillingness to agree."
"Perhaps he could give an answer when he comments on the debate later on."
"We cannot overlook the concern about fisheries agreements."
"They are expensive and the amount of money involved is substantial."
"The money has to be taken into account to a greater extent in the future, and we cannot pretend otherwise."
"Yes, in the past the agreements have been acceptable, but we need a new approach and a new vision in the future."
"In the longer term the Commission will have to cooperate with Parliament, because Parliament is concerned to determine how agreements can best be achieved."
"Looking at what we have before us, I have to say to you, Commissioner, that the present situation cannot continue."
"Yes, I support the proposal submitted and I will support the proposal that emerges, but I wish to stress that the principle cannot continue for ever and support in the future cannot be taken for granted as it has been in the past."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to say a warm thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, for the two reports he has submitted today when the new protocol for a fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Republics of Mauritius and Guinea is up for discussion."
"Where the first agreement with Mauritius is concerned, I am glad to hear that you support the new technical features, as well as the further amendments to this protocol as these relate, for example, to the distribution of costs, to the increased finance available for scientific programmes, to monitoring and control and to subsequent financing."
"The agreement with Mauritius is a typical tuna fish agreement, involving a small number of fishing opportunities for line fishermen, and forms an important component of the EC network of tuna fish agreements in the Indian Ocean."
"This new protocol is the fourth since the Framework Agreement came into force in 1990."
"The three-year extension to the protocol creates fishing opportunities for 83 tuna fishermen and, by means of this protocol, the October 1997 guidelines of the Fisheries Council are to be included in the agreement for the first time, namely an increase in specific measures for developing the fisheries sector and a new distribution of the costs between the Community and the ship owners."
"Among the most important features of the protocol is the fact that, in view of the small quantities of fish caught during the three years that the last protocol was in force, the authorised tonnage has been reduced from 7 500 tonnes to 5 500 tonnes, which will also lead to a corresponding reduction - namely of 29% - in compensation payments."
"I can also inform you that 50%, that is to say half, of compensation payments are intended for specific measures to develop the local fisheries sector."
"Measures in the fields of science and technology, including plans for monitoring and control, are to be financed."
"In this connection, I should like to emphasise that the conditions for monitoring such measures have been improved by the fact that the authorities on Mauritius now have to submit a detailed report each year and by the fact that the Commission is able to review payments in the light of whether the various measures have in practice been carried out."
"Licence fees for ship owners have been considerably increased, from EUR 20 to EUR 25 per tonne."
"All in all, the protocol has led to a comprehensive redistribution of the costs between the Community and the ship owners, since the latter now have to bear 23.5% of the total costs compared with a previous figure of only 7%."
"That is in line with the Council' s 1997 decision in connection with the third country agreements, whereby costs are to be distributed in a balanced way."
"There are also technical improvements when it comes to catch notifications, the deduction of fees due and the procedures for taking catches on board."
"If I understand you correctly, you also welcome the technical features we have introduced into the agreement with Guinea, especially the fact that, by means of a special premium, more attention is being given to the development of marine resources."
"Since 1983, we have also maintained a Framework Agreement with the Republic of Guinea."
"This agreement too is important for the European Union because it specifies fishing opportunities for trawler and tuna fishermen."
"Within the framework of the agreements with various neighbouring States, particularly Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco, it also offers a partial alternative for the fisheries industry during the close seasons. It also, to some degree, offers an alternative to Moroccan waters."
"I am therefore pleased to be able to inform you that the protocol with the Republic of Guinea contains important innovations, aimed especially at promoting the precautionary principle and the sustainable use of resources."
"I should like specifically to mention at this point that a premium is to be introduced for the purpose of supporting the Guinean authorities in improving fish stocks in Guinea' s exclusive economic zone."
"This premium will only be paid if Guinea can prove that its overall fishing activities have been reduced and that the agreed measures aimed at more stringent monitoring and control have been applied."
"The idea is that we want to support Guinea in promoting bilateral fisheries agreements with other States and in reducing the number of private arrangements which frequently undermine sustained fisheries management."
"What is more, 46% of the total aid package is now to be spent on the financial counterpart for specific measures such as scientific and technical research and the monitoring and inspection of fishing activities, as well as on supporting technical training and further education in the sphere of fisheries and on supporting participation in the work of international organisations."
"Finally, the protocol provides for close cooperation between both parties in administering the measures."
"Monitoring is to be facilitated by means of a detailed financial report and by the Community' s ability to review payments in the light of whether or not the measures have in practice been carried out."
"Where your amendments are concerned, I should like to make it clear that the Commission can in principle accept the first two of these."
"The Commission has to reject Amendment No 3 because it contradicts the current theory on protocols to fisheries agreements and affects the Commission' s negotiating powers."
"Since the protocol constitutes an annex to the Framework Agreement, it can be regularly renewed without the need for any new negotiating mandate."
"It goes without saying however that, with its leading role in the negotiations, the Commission will see to it that the negotiating guidelines laid down by the Council are observed."
"The Commission must also reject Amendment No 4 because it contravenes the spirit of the Council' s 1997 decision calling for a distribution of costs between ship owners and the Community."
"Many thanks for your attention."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"We have exhausted the agenda and ourselves, I think."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I bid you goodnight."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)"
"Annex - formal sitting"
"It is my very great pleasure to welcome Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, and Mr Ahmed Qurie, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Assembly, to the European Parliament. I am thrilled to be able to do so, and to do so with great hopes for peace."
"I would like to thank you both for the courage and open-mindedness with which you have both accepted the invitation I made to you during my official visit to the Middle East in February this year."
"Your joint visit is unprecedented in the history of this institution."
"It has been made possible because you are both men of peace, and it is as such that Parliament welcomes you here today."
"I am mindful that your visit is also due in great part to the persuasive diplomatic efforts of our fellow Member, Luisa Morgantini, Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, whom I must thank particularly for this."
"(Applause)"
"It is highly significant that, in your capacities as the speakers of the two assemblies which will be required to ratify the agreements which are being drawn up, and in which negotiations you are yourselves taking part, you have opted to come together to address the European Parliament."
"We appreciate the true worth of your approach: the value of your shared determination to reach a peace agreement, the determination to see Europe involved in the ongoing process to a greater extent, and let me welcome Ambassador Moratinos at this point, and the determination to step up your cooperation with the European Union at parliamentary level."
"There is not one of us who is unaware of the complexity of the situation in the Middle East, in this land which is home to what a large part of the human race considers to be the most sacred historic sites, which are hence the most disputed sites."
"We Europeans are in a good position to know just how difficult it is to make peace rather than war."
"It has taken us, particularly in the twentieth century, devastating wars which have ravaged the entire world with the tragic loss of millions of lives before realising, at last, that war is a madness which wreaks universal ruin."
"The European Parliament is not welcoming you here today in order to preach at you, but as a friend to the two nations you represent, which are both finally entitled to peace, security and development."
"When the same process is under way in the Middle East as the one which has brought Europe not only from armed conflict to peace, but from peace to cooperation between neighbouring countries, perhaps we can envisage a parliamentary assembly uniting the peoples of your region as our counterpart!"
"What a wonderful dream this would be, and I am sure that our shared determination will one day make it a reality."
"Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Abu Ala, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the debate which you have just heard has testified to the European Union' s and, in particular, the European Parliament' s interest in the progress of the current negotiations."
"Your may rest assured that we shall be listening to your words with the utmost attention."
"Allow me to hope, without denying the major obstacles, weighty as we know them to be, during this crucial phase of the negotiations, that you will be able to assure this House that the gateway to peace will remain open and that both your nations will go through it together."
"Without further ado, I shall give the floor first to Mr Abu Ala and then to Mr Burg."
"Thank you, Mr Ahmed Qurie, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council,"
"for your compelling speech. I shall now give the floor to Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Israeli Knesset."
"Mr Burg, you have the floor."
"Madam President, Members of Parliament, Abu Ala, I am an optimist."
"I am not the kind of an optimist who, when once asked by somebody ""are you an optimist or a pessimist"", said ""of course I am an optimist."
"Today is better than tomorrow""."
"No, this is not the kind of optimism that I would like to share with you this morning."
"I would like to share with you a different kind of optimism, an optimism which says that tomorrow will be even better than today and today was a perfect morning."
"On behalf of so many of us in the Middle East, especially so many of us in Israel, I should like to thank you for your efforts and the efforts of the entire distinguished gathering here this morning to push forward dialogue, understanding, and the process of listening to each other in the Middle East."
"Today we are here together sharing both sides of your chair - and, by the way, responding to your proposal to have a joint parliament in the Middle East. I have no problem with that, but would ask only one thing, namely that you should chair it."
"It would be a bit more complicated for us to run the show ourselves."
"Nevertheless the day will come."
"A meeting such as the one we are having here on the very day that the leaders of our peoples are meeting each other again in the United States of America, trying to promote another step, one more centimetre towards a better future for our children, is a crucial moment."
"Not only do the leaders of our nations have the responsibility of making peace, but we, as elected representatives of our people, also bear the burden of responsibility for trying to enhance the people-to-people relationship in such a way that eventually, when peace is signed between the two sides, the people will be ready to accept the message."
"Therefore I am very happy to be here with you this morning."
"More than this, for many of us in Israel, Europe is not just a continent."
"For many of us in Israel Europe is a value system."
"For many of us in Israel Europe is something wider than its worldly presence."
"Europe for us is democracy."
"Europe for us is enlightenment."
"Europe for us is parliamentarism."
"Europe for us is culture."
"Europe for us is social engineering, social responsibility and social sensitivities."
"Europe for us is responsibility for the environment."
"Europe for us is economy."
"So when we are negotiating peace in the Middle East, we feel every day that we are not just doing what is good for our people, but we try harder and double our efforts because we have a sense of responsibility to the extent that the stability of our region is the key to the stability of the rest of the world."
"What stands against this kind of dialogue is the worst sort of enemy we have ever witnessed."
"Against this kind of dialogue, with all the frustration, the caveats, possibilities, corruptions, paragraphs, and verses, etc, stands the enemy of peace, which is religious fundamentalism."
"The Middle East is the key to the stability of the world."
"Will the stability of the world stem from the sovereign part of the former Soviet Union?"
"Will it stem from Europe through the relationship between North Africa and southern Europe, eventually all Europe?"
"Whatever happens in our little corner of the world - which is only 23 000 square kilometres, smaller than the Massif Central - will guarantee the future of the world."
"Will the Middle East be a black coalition of Khomenei mullahs in Iran, Shiites in Iraq, Muslim brothers in Jordan, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hammas in the Occupied Territories and Islamic fundamentalist organisations in North Africa or will it be a coalition of peace, oriented towards Europe and Western civilisation, consisting of Egypt as the linchpin of the peace, Jordan, Palestine as a state - I will come back to that in a minute - the state of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and the rest of the world?"
"These are the two options of the Middle East, a black-oriented Middle East or a peace-oriented Middle East."
"Both of us, for all our disagreements, are fully committed to a peaceful Middle East for our own sake and the sake of our children and the rest of the world."
"(Applause)It is a very personal privilege for me to share this very important European podium this morning with Abu Ala."
"Look at this man."
"He was the architect of the Oslo Agreement."
"He is the man to whom my children and the children of his people owe so much on account of his courage, creativity, devotion and commitment to change the strategy of the Middle East from a strategy of conflict to a strategy of dialogue, understanding and acceptance of the other."
"I would like, Abu Ala, to tell you what I told you when you came as my guest to the Knesset, when I met you at my home - I hope that I shall not do you any political damage back home by mentioning these things - and in all other places where we have met, namely that the Middle East of our generation is privileged to have a great man like you leading your people."
"(Applause)I feel very pleased to be here with you this morning."
"After so many years when we Israelis felt that Europe did not fully understand us - and the other way around - I have the feeling that this is a different environment in which we are carrying on a dialogue."
"Coming to this House after you passed the resolution on the memory of the Holocaust, first mooted in Stockholm and eventually embraced by the majority in this House; the kind of help you are giving openly and secretly, to Jews in need in distressed areas around the world; and of course your unequivocal commitment to peace encompassing various interpretations and schools of thought: all these things make me feel happy to be here this morning."
"When I am asked whether I am an optimist or a pessimist - well, of course I am an optimist because I prefer the frustrations of negotiation to the funerals of the wars."
"(Applause)Yes, we have frustration but it is a long way from the departure point."
"Look at history, look at the writing on the wall."
"In 1948 there were seven Arab parties engaged against the newly born state of Israel."
"In 1967 only three out of the seven - Egypt, Jordan and Syria - fought against us."
"In 1973 only two out of the three - Syria and Egypt - were against us."
"Now some 25 years later, we have peace with Egypt and are very close to peace with Syria."
"They say today the sun is rising in Syria."
"The Palestinians did not fight against us as a nation in 1948 or join the struggle against us as a belligerent in 1963, but all of a sudden - and unbelievably - we now find ourselves in the middle of negotiations."
"Thank God we are there."
"If I had told you ten years ago, before the Gulf War, that in the year 2000 the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council would have a debate with the Speaker of the Israeli Knesset before the European Parliament, you would have said that it would never happen."
"What if I had told you five years ago that the President of the United States would come to celebrate Christmas 2000 in Bethlehem, accompanied by the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser Arafat, who would fly there in a Palestinian helicopter, and both would be protected by thousands of armed Palestinians?"
"What if I had said that all this would happen only 300 metres from the southern part of Jerusalem?"
"You would have told me that I was fantasising and it will never happen."
"But it will happen."
"And when we meet here again in five or ten years' time all the obstacles that today look like abysses that we cannot cross will be behind us."
"And this will happen because of this kind of partnership and because our people and their people in the Middle East understand where the modern world is going."
"It is moving towards acceptance, reconciliation and forgiveness for the past, whatever the past might have been."
"The negotiations today, difficult as they are, are very good negotiations."
"The situation is not easy and far from resolved, but nevertheless the world has changed."
"All of us come from the political arena, and you know as well as I do that in politics there is no such thing as good timing."
"When you raise an issue and nothing happens, people say why raise it now, when nobody cares about it."
"At the height of a crisis they say why raise the issue at the height of a crisis, wait until it is over."
"Then, once it is over, everyone says ""It is over - who cares about it?""."
"The time is never right to do something."
"The Middle East has been no exception."
"There has always been an excuse not to raise an issue."
"For a long time the circumstances and the political environment were almost impossible."
"Now, all of a sudden, the world is not a bipolar world, and the Middle East is not being tugged apart by the Soviet bloc and the Western bloc."
"We are more or less alone and talking to each other."
"All of a sudden the rhetoric is getting down to pragmatic solutions."
"A world of pragmatic solutions is not an easy one."
"Because Abu Ala yes, international law is very important."
"People who are living in the family of nations live by the law."
"If they did not it would be a wilderness, a desert, chaos."
"Many of us - and I do not know all of you, but I know some of you - have deeply-felt value systems which are at least as deep as our commitment to law and understanding and humanity."
"Mine is my religious belief."
"Yes, I know it is an oxymoron."
"I am a rational individual who believes in God; do not ask me how."
"But this is what I have tried to do, in my commitment to this region of the world, to the monotheistic idea, to the dialogue between religions, all because sometime in history, the founding father of my nation, Abraham, after whom I am named, came up with the concept that there is one God."
"Thank God, this one God is represented by five parties in our Knesset today, but that is a different story."
"(Laughter)Therefore, when we are seeking practical political solutions, we have to understand that these are solutions for historical problems and people's faith and beliefs."
"It is not enough to say politically that it works when we have not prepared the spiritual background for acceptance of the compromises."
"What do I mean?"
"Practically, we have never been so close to each other, but what do we know about the icons, the symbols, the things that have been there for so many years?"
"Abu Ala must come home, Yassar Arafat must come back home and say ""I solved the problem of the refugees,"" and Ehud Barak must come back home and say ""Yes, the problem of the refugees was solved, but not within the recognised international borders of the State of Israel""."
"Yassar Arafat has to come home and say ""I solved the problem of Jerusalem and we have a full presence and full sovereignty in Jerusalem""."
"But on the other hand, no one can authorise Ehud Barak to compromise on King David's capital."
"How can he go home?"
"Therefore the problems are not just political but psychological as well."
"I would like to say something briefly about the way we see Jerusalem."
"I was born there, I studied there, my kids are there, I almost live there."
"I know and respect all the different beliefs and faiths of Jerusalem."
"I would be the last person in the world to belittle or disregard the holiness of Jerusalem for people of other faiths."
"It belongs to them with the same intensity that it belongs to me."
"I will defend till my last breath their right to worship."
"I will defend all the rights of all these people to worship equally in Jerusalem, but I also demand from others no less respect for the holiness of Jerusalem for the millions of Jews who died and prayed and waited throughout 3,000 years of Jewish history."
"A peace formula has to be founded on the respect for the holy."
"I accept your beliefs, please accept mine."
"It is beyond politics or law, it is something deeper, something spiritual."
"Only this mutual respect will enable all of us to live as ordinary, honorary citizens in God's city on Earth."
"I urge you Abu Ala, my friend, when you go back to your people tell them that Jerusalem is holy for the Muslims and Jerusalem is holy for the Christians, but it is no less holy for Jews."
"We need to find a political compromise but also a religious compromise."
"(Applause)I have a feeling that the challenge of Jerusalem is the biggest political challenge ever witnessed."
"Today I heard maybe the first ever official statement from a very high-ranking Palestinian delegate, saying that there is a possibility Jerusalem will not be the capital of the Palestinian State."
"It was a very interesting observation, as a fallback position I understand, and it is something that has to be studied."
"The late King Hussein, whose commitment to peace in the region no one would doubt, came up with a beautiful idea."
"He said that the problem of Jerusalem's sovereignty is almost insoluble; why not give the sovereignty of the city of God back to God?"
"Between us we shall find enough practical solutions."
"King Hussein's idea was presented to all our leaders and I am pleased to say that the sides have not rejected the idea. Let us explore it."
"We have a goal."
"We are going somewhere."
"I do not want peace in the Middle East to be a win-lose situation."
"Nor do I want me to win and him to lose. I do not want him to win and me to lose."
"I want it to be a win-win situation for both of us. I would like to see a Palestinian state declared on a basis of understanding and mutual acceptance and consent between the two sides, with Israel the first to recognise it in the international community."
"That is what I wanted for many years before it became the official policy, not policy, the official mood in my country."
"I have no problem with the Palestinian state or Abu Ala."
"On the contrary, as soon as we have a Palestinian state, the dialogue between us will be a dialogue between equals."
"Any issues that are not resolved now, we can deal with later on and continue the dialogue between us."
"I know that many of the issues were resolved at Camp David but there are other issues that I hope we can solve."
"You raise the issue of refugees."
"It is not a unilateral issue."
"My mother was a refugee from Hebron."
"She was born some 80 years ago in Hebron and I am a Hebronite (that is not a compliment in the Middle East, it means a very stubborn, simple individual)."
"Millions of Jews came from the Muslim countries in 1948, 1949, 1950 and up to the 1960s and there are problems."
"But I will make a compromise with my dream because my land comes to me from the biblical promise and your land comes to you from a religious commitment and a national presence in the Holy Land of Israel."
"Your first territorial compromise is with your dreams, and my first territorial compromise is with my dreams on the understanding that anyone who claims that the greater Israel is his, cannot be the partner of Abu Ala and anyone who claims that the greater Palestine is his, cannot be a partner to Avraham Burg."
"Only if you and I compromise our dreams can we seek a compromise between the two nations and if we make this emotional compromise all the rest will follow in due course."
"I would like to conclude by talking about the future."
"Yesterday we were enemies, today we are (almost) friends and tomorrow we will be partners."
"Personally, of course, I admire him, although he does not admire me and rightly so, but the two of us can play a role in the regions."
"However, we need help and mediation from the rest of the world."
"Today Europe and the rest of the world are dealing with the local impact of the global economy, narrowing the gap between the haves and the have-nots, creating opportunities for the have-nots."
"Israel has a relatively good economy."
"The Palestinians have not yet had the chance to develop their own independent economy."
"We would like to see Europe and the rest of the world helping both of us to improve the economic level of the region so that there is a balance between the two economies."
"This will prevent frustration in the relationship between the two states and the individuals within those societies will not despair and take refuge in religious fundamentalism."
"I believe that is a crucial strategic need in the region today."
"One last word as to why I am an optimist."
"Coming from here, from Strasbourg, I have to tell my people how it was, I will tell you how it was."
"Eleven years ago I and my eldest son, who was then very young, were stuck in the middle of a traffic jam in Jerusalem because there was a bomb somewhere."
"They were talking about it on the news and my son who was very young then and so had no respect for his father, turned to me and said 'Daddy, are these the people you want to make peace with?', because at that time I was one of the leaders of the 'Peace Now' movement in Israel."
"I was lost for words, because how do you explain the complexities of these things to a seven or eight-year old boy?"
"My father, who at the time was 80 years old, was in the back seat."
"In his 40 years as a member of the Knesset he served in every cabinet in Israel and he was the head of the Israeli-Egyptian team that negotiated autonomy for the Palestinians."
"My father was born in Dresden and lost his entire family in the Holocaust."
"He said to my son 'Listen, grandson, when I ran away from Germany forty years ago, I hated them."
"I could not believe that I would ever go back there."
"I could not believe that I would ever forgive them, but now I have forgiven them."
"Now Germany is different, the people are different, there is a powerful message of soul-searching, correcting the past and doing better for the future coming out of Germany'."
"Then he said to him ' If this can happen between us and our worst ever enemy, there is no reason in the world why it should not happen between you and the Palestinians in your generation because the rivalry is not that deep.'"
"My father passed away last year, but his wisdom is almost prophetic."
"It is with me day in and day out and I believe there will be peace, not in my son's generation but in the generation of Abu Ala and myself: a permanent, solid, good peace for the betterment of the world."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to make what I consider to be a very important point. Yesterday, I came to Strasbourg on Olympic Airways flight 165 from Athens to Frankfurt."
"When the plane arrived at Frankfurt airport, it was immediately surrounded by German police."
"Nobody spoke anything but German, and we were not allowed to leave the plane without showing our passports to the German police."
"I remind you that Greece, as well as Germany and France, are countries that belong to the Schengen area."
"The worst thing is that this was not an exception; this, I was told, is something that happens systematically at Frankfurt airport when planes arrive from Greece."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, where we have so often voted on Schengen, I believe that, although there is legislation for the free movement of people, the fact that, in reality, this legislation is being systematically violated by the German authorities is an insult to, and undermines, our work."
"As this concerns the free movement of Members of the European Union, I would like the President of the European Parliament to take the appropriate measures to ensure that we come to Strasbourg in a way that befits people who belong to the European Union and to Schengen."
"Mr Alavanos, I consider that our President shall forward the text of your speech to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Frankfurt airport authorities so that - and I do not know what the grounds might be for the current practice - we receive at least some sort of explanation or, alternatively, this procedure, which, I agree with you, has very little to do with the Schengen provisions, ceases to be used."
"Mr President, on Monday, in my absence and without any prior notification, Mr Murphy, the leader of the British Socialist Group, raised a question about my involvement in supporting the Danish anti-euro campaign."
"He was very careful not to accuse me of anything but has none the less contrived to give the impression that I am somehow under suspicion."
"I should like to put on record that my involvement with the Danish referendum has been entirely separate from my work in this House and that I have never infringed any parliamentary rules."
"Unlike the Danish ""yes"" campaign, the ""no"" campaign cannot rely on taxpayers' money or subsidies from the European Union."
"It is outrageous that Mr Murphy should have sought to give the impression that I am under investigation when he has failed to produce evidence or even make any allegations against me."
"It cannot be right for Members to be subjected to this kind of baseless innuendo."
"I would ask you to insist that Mr Murphy either accuse me outright or apologise."
"Mr Hannan, Mr Murphy is, of course, free to decide whether and how to respond to your speech."
"Mr President, we very frequently complain about the Council's attitude towards Parliament."
"I would like to highlight an incident of a completely opposite nature which took place yesterday during the debate on EU external action priorities."
"We had the reports from the President of the Council and the Commissioner followed by a debate took place."
"At the end of the debate, due to the presidency's total lack of flexibility, the President of the Council and Commissioner Patten were not able to respond to the numerous questions which had arisen from quite an intense debate."
"Now then, I cannot understand this Parliament for complaining about the Council's behaviour."
"Yesterday, the President of the Council was in the Chamber from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. while the number of Members of Parliament present was not great - and, in actual fact, we prevented both the Council or the Commission from replying to extremely important questions posed by Members."
"This does not seem to me to be very polite, and I would go so far as to describe it as verging on the downright rude."
"Mr Dupuis, I doubt that this situation was due to lack of flexibility on the part of the presidency on duty. It is more likely to have been a mistake, a misunderstanding between the Chair at the time and the Council and Commission representatives."
"Mr President, I am very surprised at what I heard from our British fellow MEP, Mr Hannan, for he presented himself in the Danish media as a Member of the European Parliament."
"If he were there as a private individual, he should have let this be known in the Danish campaign."
"All things considered, I think Mr Hannan should stay at home in Britain and mind his own business, and leave us to get on with it in Denmark."
"We have no use for people like that acting the fool in Denmark."
"Mr President, I do not want to detain the House too long but I think that Mr Hannan protests too much!"
"I made a very simple request to the President on Monday."
"The President agreed to my request and referred the matter to the Quaestors."
"But while Mr Hannan is here in the Chamber this morning, perhaps he could give us a guarantee that he will be making a new entry in his declaration of financial interests to say where the money has come from."
"The Danish people have a right to know in advance of the referendum on 28 September where the ""no"" campaign funds have come from."
"Now then, we cannot continue with the debate and we cannot turn this Chamber into an annex to the discussion leading up to the Danish referendum either."
"We now know the essence of the issue."
"Everyone will do what they think best."
"Right to family reunification"
"The next item is the report (A5-0201/2000) by Mr Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification [COM(1999) 638 - C50077/2000 - 1999/0258 (CNS)]"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Klamt, who was the original rapporteur designated by the committee which I have the honour to chair to look at this issue."
"Mrs Klamt did a very considerable amount of work on the proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification."
"She deserves the credit for the work that has been done. I wish to congratulate her on that."
"I have inherited this particular cornucopia as chairman of the committee because Mrs Klamt felt at the end of the votes at committee stage that she could no longer support the text as it stood and therefore I am presenting it to the House today."
"I would like to commend the European Commission on what is an extremely well argued and well presented report, drawn up in record time considering the relative lack of resources of the departments concerned and the demands laid down at the European Council in Tampere last year."
"The Commission has come forward with an excellent draft directive which will permit third-country nationals legally resident in a Member State of the Union to reside in another Member State as is required if a true area of freedom, security and justice is to be established."
"The Commission has said, quite rightly in my view, that the goal of zero immigration mentioned in past Community discussion was never realistic and sought instead to put forward realistic proposals for the protection of the rights of third-country nationals in accordance with the many international treaties that have been signed by Member States, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants of 1966 on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights."
"Very clearly, the importance of legal immigration is recognised."
"The importance of the family as a unit is also recognised and the importance of making a success of the integration of third-country nationals residing lawfully in EU Member States is the whole basis of these proposals."
"We have in my committee considered a number of contentious areas, not least the question of the right to bring in ascending relatives."
"The Commission proposal quite clearly recognises the difference of legal treatment between descending and ascending relatives."
"It is evident that, in the context of the international legal framework, mention must be made of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"This convention requires states to ensure that the child is not separated from the parents."
"There is no similar convention dealing with ascending relatives, but it is clearly the case that if we wish to live up to our humanitarian ideals we must provide the opportunity for third-country nationals to bring dependent relatives in the ascending line into their family units."
"This has been a matter of some debate within the committee."
"I am pleased to see that a number of amendments to the final report have been put forward; in particular Amendments Nos 18 to 23, which propose a compromise on this matter."
"May I briefly introduce some of the amendments that the committee's report puts forward."
"Amendment No 3 looks at the need for data and recognises that in order to have an effective evaluation of the situation in the Member States, the Commission will need more information from the Member States."
"Amendment No 5 deals with relatives from the ascending line."
"This has now been overtaken in a sense by the compromise Amendments Nos 18 to 23."
"Amendment No 6 recognises the very real problems that the administrations of the Member States currently have with the workload created by the demands of family reunification."
"Amendment No 9 allows each Member State to introduce more favourable provisions than those set down in the directives, and insists that these new rules will not lower current standards of protection."
"Amendment No 11 deals with the grounds on which a Member State may deny the right of entry to a relative, namely on grounds of public policy, domestic security and public health."
"Our amendment seeks to insist that any Member State wishing to refuse entry on those grounds provides very clear justification."
"I do not wish to comment on all of the 66 amendments put forward to my report, but I would say that this is a very complicated area."
"Parliament had relatively little time to look at it and inevitably not all of the compromises which were necessary to reach a favourable outcome were achieved in committee."
"I would therefore urge Members to look carefully at the amendments that have been tabled in plenary to reach the compromises which will allow us to go forward in an effective and humanitarian way."
"Mr President, my task as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was a relatively easy one compared with that of the honourable members in the committee responsible, and I would like to congratulate them all on the outcome, even if we do have to discuss a few compromise amendments in plenary today."
"The reason I said that my committee' s task was an easy one, is because the proposed draft directive raises few difficulties from a legal viewpoint, and nor is there a great deal of room for manoeuvre when it comes to framing policy."
"I would also like to say how impressed I am with the logistical quality of the draft directive, which certainly cannot be said of all the Commission' s draft directives."
"Pursuant to the new Article 63 of the EU Treaty, it is now the Community' s task to settle the matter of family reunification, and the Community must take these measures in accordance with the provisions of international law, in particular the European Convention of Human Rights and the other instruments of international law already mentioned by our committee chairman."
"The right to respect for family life is a universal human right."
"It is not divisible and cannot be reserved for EU citizens alone."
"This would be a dubious line to take, particularly as we are concurrently working on a European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If Community provisions are now to be put in place for family reunification, we also need to close incomprehensible and, in some cases, absurd gaps in the existing legislation."
"This particularly applies to the right of EU citizens themselves to live together in their home land with family members originating from a third country and not to be in the position where the only way they can live with them as a family is to avail themselves of freedom of movement and settle in another Member States."
"Therefore this directive is only too welcome from a legal viewpoint, and it is to be hoped that neither Parliament, nor, more importantly, the Council, will make any changes to the substance of the Commission' s original draft."
"Mr President, in principle, everyone agrees that open internal borders make a compelling case for a pan-European, harmonised immigration and asylum policy."
"The Commission has put forward the first draft of a legislative initiative in this field, which concerns the right to family reunification."
"Unfortunately, it failed to place this draft directive in an overall frame of reference."
"What point is there in knowing which family members have the right to enter and reside in the EU, when it is not known what provisions are to be made for which immigrant groups and for which reasons for immigration?"
"In addition, Parliament is expected to vote on a legislative initiative which lacks absolute fundamental principles."
"We have neither a joint evaluation of demographic trends, nor do we know what impact this legislative initiative will have on the individual Member States."
"Unfortunately, the lack of overall strategy and statistical basis are not the only weak points."
"The Commission lumps economically motivated immigration and asylum together."
"I take the view that as far as family reunification is concerned, there should be one set of arrangements for asylum seekers and refugees, and one for immigrants."
"Different rules must apply to those who have been driven out of their native land than apply to those who emigrate for economic reasons."
"We need to clearly distinguish between asylum seekers and refugees on the one hand, and immigration, i.e. economic migration, on the other."
"This will allow for provisions that do justice to the people concerned and the situations they are in."
"Many of my proposed amendments have this distinction in view."
"Another problem with the present draft directive concerns the widening of the definition of family."
"Grandparents, children over the age of majority and non-married partners should also be entitled to family reunification."
"That is where the dilemma lies: there is no overall frame of reference for immigration."
"As such, family reunification is currently the only legal channel of immigration."
"The proposed sweeping provisions on family reunification are open to uncontrollable abuse."
"Just ask yourselves this question: who will decide, according to which criteria, whether a relationship is bogus, contrived purely for the purposes of immigration?"
"That is why quite a few of my proposed amendments call for priority to be given to the core family."
"Another cardinal sin committed by the Commission is that its proposal contains no measures whatsoever for integration."
"It is not right to bring people to a foreign country without making the necessary provisions for foreign nationals and local people to live together in peace and friendship."
"A final point to be made is that a directive of this kind is paving the way for us to have an objective and constructive discussion on the whole area of immigration."
"If people feel they are being overrun by waves of immigrants, then their reaction is one of rejection."
"If we put transparent, enforceable provisions in place, then people will be more inclined to allow foreign nationals to integrate."
"By producing moderate and well-considered solutions, not only will we be able to overcome problems such as xenophobia; we will also be able to tackle the problems associated with having a disproportionate number of elderly people in the European Union."
"However, this draft directive seems to be a poor first attempt at this."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I am sorry to hear Mrs Klamt' s words."
"I wanted to begin by congratulating the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino on this proposal which seems to me to be very complete, well constructed and timely, coming almost a year after the Tampere Summit."
"We must clarify today in this Parliament whether we want the immigrants and refugees who live amongst us to do so legally with their families, giving them the opportunity to live a normal life and to integrate fully into our society, or whether we are going to continue to feed the myth that they are provisional co-citizens whose final destiny is to return to the hypothetical homes they came from."
"This issue is so important that we must make an effort to reach a consensus."
"All of our groups were in agreement in committee, apart from the PPE Group."
"I would like us today to send a message to the people who live amongst us that they can do so with their right to live as a family recognised."
"Mr President, this is the intention of my group, although I would also like to ask the Commission, on behalf of my group, to think twice about one aspect included in the current directive."
"We have also applied these rules we are debating to people who are under alternative protection."
"Unfortunately, the European Union does not have homogenous criteria. There is no harmonised asylum policy."
"Therefore, there are very different situations in many countries, and on this minor point I would agree with Mrs Klamt."
"It is not a question of rejecting these people - they have the right to live as families - but of the Commission thinking twice about it and of their being subject to a future directive which would include persons under temporary and alternative protection, while we await the future harmonisation of the Union' s asylum policy."
"Otherwise, I congratulate the Commission and I hope that it receives the full support of this House."
"Mr President, the ELDR Group is backing this report as one of the essential building blocks in constructing the area of freedom, security and justice and in following up the Tampere Summit, which rightly made it a priority to establish rights of free movement for legally resident third-country nationals."
"This is an injustice which needs remedying."
"Like Mrs Terrón i Cusí, I am surprised at the stance of the EPP Group, which normally puts a lot of emphasis on family values and yet today is undermining the family by opposing reunification, which will assist the social integration of these legally resident migrants."
"This seems to us perverse."
"To take up some specific points in the report, first of all on the inclusion of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection."
"We will wait to hear Mr Vitorino, but it is rumoured that the Commission will accept amendments to take these beneficiaries out."
"The ELDR Group would regret that because we think that, like refugees, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should be in."
"They are long-term residents, they are not analogous to beneficiaries of temporary protection."
"We will listen to the debate because our overwhelming desire is to get the bones of this proposal through."
"On ascending relatives, we consider that Amendment No 20 is superfluous because there is a general right in Article 9 of the proposal to apply a non-discriminatory means test to all entrants."
"However we are willing to look at that if it assists in saving the report."
"It is important to be absolutely clear on unmarried partners."
"The proposal will not force Member States to give legal recognition to unmarried partnerships, but if they do they must treat unmarried partners like spouses."
"There has been a lot of misinformation on this, not least stirred up by the Conservatives in the United Kingdom - tabloid headlines about outrageous plots by the EU to force the UK to accept refugees' gay lovers."
"That is stirring up homophobic prejudice and I deplore it."
"Mr President, we are going to vote on a report today that has caused a political stir in certain EU States."
"The Commission and Commissioner Vitorino have done some sterling work here, and I would like, on behalf of my group, to take the opportunity to thank them for it."
"The European Council confirmed, at its special summit in Tampere, that the European Union must ensure that third-country nationals are treated fairly."
"The Commission has taken this resolution forward."
"This directive is conclusive as it stands, and should be transposed with all haste."
"Sadly there were, and still are, reservations against including refugees benefiting from temporary protection in this directive, and against recognising same-sex relationships as the basis for family reunification."
"This debate demonstrates once again that, unfortunately, integration and migration policy is still a controversial issue in the European Union."
"There is, after all, a great deal to be considered."
"Nevertheless, we must make it possible for people who live apart from relatives who are third-country nationals, to be brought together."
"Therefore, in principle, this is an initiative that deserves everyone' s support, particularly where it concerns children, and these self-same children - irrespective of whether they are the offspring of refugees or immigrants - should have a future in the European Union."
"However, opinion is being stirred up against this directive in the political arena."
"It is to be hoped that the majority of honourable members will support the directive put forward by the Commission as it stands."
"I know that my fellow socialist members are awaiting a statement from Mr Vitorino, in the hope that refugees' interests will be sacrificed for the sake of this directive, under pressure from quite a number of EU Ministers for Home Affairs."
"I regret this decision, and the fact that Ministers for Home Affairs appear to carry more weight in this Parliament than the honourable members, who are expected to act according to their consciences."
"For this reason, I reiterate my call for us to support the Commission' s directive and at last set down a marker for an up-to-date, modern and humane policy of integration."
"I hope the Socialists will refrain from making this deal with the Conservatives."
"Mr President, I would like to commend the Commission on its serious and balanced work."
"Too often, when we broach the subject of immigration, passions, excesses and political ulterior motives prevent us from reflecting objectively and making progress."
"In dealing in depth with the issue of the right to live as a family, and in defining the precise conditions for its application, the text enables us to hold a real debate."
"Far from casting suspicion a priori, as is often the case, on those who wish to live with their spouses and children, the text recognises the legitimacy of such a right even if, in fact, this right must now apply equally to homosexual couples and to all other categories, as the honourable Member has just said, especially in the case of asylum seekers."
"The text also takes into account that nowadays there are several types of families in our society, especially certain forms of cohabitation, and that we cannot therefore discriminate against immigrants who live in the same way."
"In recognising this, the text helps to give real meaning to the term 'integration' ."
"Through harmonising legislation in Member States, this draft directive will provide protection and legal stability for immigrants and will above all prevent them from being subjected to national political fluctuations."
"I therefore hope that subsequent work by the Commission and Parliament will take its inspiration from this example."
"Perhaps we will then be able to talk further on the equality of rights and the often positive contribution made by immigration, in dealing with issues that are vital for integration and the fight against the unemployment, insecure employment, violence and discrimination, of which immigrants are often victim."
"Immigration is not a problem."
"Yet we must resolve to talk about the real problems such as the imbalances between the North and the South that often force men and women to flee from poverty."
"We must also recognise that the waves of immigrants towards the countries of the European Union have been more or less constant for a couple of decades."
"In other words, by implementing restrictive laws, Member States have not succeeded in reducing the overall number of entrants; they have simply reduced the number of legal immigrants while increasing the numbers of illegal immigrants by declaring them illegal."
"By underpinning these values, this draft directive will not only have positive consequences for immigrants and their families, but it will also be a symbol for refuge and integration."
"I sincerely hope that we will be able to follow the same line of conduct in subsequent work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text that has been presented to us, and in fact the entire immigration policy that is being pursued by European institutions, exhibits a worrying trend."
"Indeed, there would be cause to worry about a certain form of capitalism that imports workers and cuts them off from their families, with all the risks of rootlessness that could give rise to."
"But today we have gone well beyond that."
"What were initially nothing more than a temporary work contracts are tending to turn into permanent residence."
"What has become permanent for one person is tending to become permanent for that person' s family and friends."
"Initially it was just the close family, but now it is the extended family as well."
"And we are very well aware that the extended family is extensive, given the social structures of the countries of origin, in which the registration of births, marriages and deaths is sometimes only rather ad hoc."
"And then, from the extended family - brothers, cousins, nephews, parents, grand parents - we move on to the polygamous family."
"And why favour just family ties?"
"From the polygamous family, we move on to cohabitation and soon, as the preceding speaker, Mr Sylla, has just proposed, we will move on to mere homosexual association."
"These are the considerable risks resulting from this policy trend."
"We are going to end up with what we are already starting to witness; a veritable, suicidal immigration of entire populations, organised by Member States and European institutions alike."
"This is, quite manifestly, the suicide of Europe."
"The only solution worthy of the name is to organise family reunification but to organise it in the country of origin with the support of the policy of cooperation to which end these methods should be employed."
"Mr President, whilst expressing my continued dismay at the ongoing prejudice shown towards Austria by the 14 other Member States, I have this to say about the report currently under discussion."
"I regret the way in which it was handled in the committee responsible, as this has led to the rapporteur being unable, in the final analysis, to identify with the outcome, causing her to withdraw her name. A rather singular occurrence."
"As I see it, constructive and well-founded amendments proposed by the rapporteur - which she has expounded and justified again today, and which I am therefore in a position to refer to - as well as by other members of the committee, were simply swept aside and not handled properly, for reasons of political ideology."
"In assessing this improper conduct, I would refer - on behalf of Austria, among others - to the decision taken by the conference of the heads of provincial governments on 17 May 2000, whereby all the new Austrian heads of the provincial governments rejected the draft directive in this form, unanimously and in fact right across the political divide."
"I am sorry that the committee has behaved in this way, because I believe a sledgehammer approach does the cause more harm than good, particularly in an area as sensitive as this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the present document, like the report, is a labelling con."
"The wording on the outside belies the actual contents of these documents."
"We would be delighted to endorse family reunification measures, for this would be deeply humane and would also be key to an integration component, but what we have is something entirely different."
"This is about initiating sociopolitical debate on how far the circle of those entitled to family reunification can be extended beyond the core family."
"You include a proposal relating to unmarried partners, whose parents and children would be allowed to join them, according to which, testimonies from the country of origin would be enough to satisfy you as to the authenticity of a relationship, regardless as to how it appears."
"This would mean that children or parents joining members here would have the same rights as EU citizens in the educational, employment and social spheres."
"The traffickers in human beings and the document forgers will thank those of you who support this proposal, and you can rest assured that the general public' s response will be one of indignation."
"You also include a proposal relating to multiple marriages, i.e. the first wife is to be accepted along with the children and relatives in the ascending line. However, you also make the point in this document that naturally it would be possible to bring another wife and her dependants in, if this were necessary for the sake of the child' s welfare."
"This begs the question as to how much wider the door is to be opened to uncontrollable immigration?"
"As far as we are concerned, the proposal under discussion is unacceptable."
"It lacks an overall frame of reference, a statistical basis and there is no differentiation. You are also overstepping the mark in respect of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which requires the integration capacity of each of the Member States to be taken into account."
"We have no intention of voting for this document unless it includes our amendments and follows our political line."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, after the recent events in Dover, when 29 illegal Chinese immigrants suffocated to death, the tragedy of illegal immigration and the methods of responding to it have become a considerable problem, which the European Union must definitely tackle."
"This problem requires us to work on a particularly sensitive issue, that of shaping and harmonising a European immigration policy. This will be one of the major issues of the twenty-first century."
"The European Commission' s draft directive establishing the right to family reunification is perfectly timed, and I would like to congratulate the Commission particularly on this text, which was drawn up under the auspices of Commissioner Vitorino."
"The right to family reunification is crucial to normal family life."
"What is more, this right has long existed in the form of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which all persons have the right to family life."
"But this is a particularly sensitive issue in view of the different laws existing in the various Member States, as it can come into conflict with notions of sovereignty."
"But that is the gauntlet that has been thrown down to the European Parliament, which must succeed in transcending these differences."
"The draft directive we are being asked to give our opinion on today is, in my view, a text of major importance, and it must receive the firm backing of the European Parliament."
"This text holds out real prospects for legal immigration, most of which is family immigration."
"As has already been said, this directive is the first example of this type of structure resulting from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council, which is why it is so important."
"I would also like to point out that the modern world has many advantages, but for certain categories of people, including foreigners, there is a significant risk of exclusion."
"It is our duty as European democrats to be particularly diligent in this matter."
"The directive proposed by the Commission enables us to take a major step forward, under conditions that are entirely satisfactory, but with all the necessary guarantees."
"There has never been any question of authorising polygamous family groupings, contrary to what I have just heard."
"This is utterly false."
"Let us remember that this is the first text in the process of integrating the 'justice and internal affairs' pillar into community policy in the wake of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council last November."
"Let us also remember that this is no more and no less than a matter of establishing the right to family reunification and that we must stop seeing family reunification as a privilege."
"As far as we are concerned, what is at stake is the construction of a Citizens' Europe, something we are hoping and praying for in order to be able to continue to build Europe."
"It is up to us to seize this opportunity. Otherwise we will not succeed."
"Mr President, I am of the firm opinion that this draft directive is a major step forward."
"That said, restrictive conditions are still being placed on the process of family reunification."
"I believe we should be highlighting the fact that, in the final analysis, it is unemployment and insecure employment that should be banned and not the right of immigrants to live with their families only if they can provide evidence of adequate means and a roof over their head."
"For the nationals of a country, society makes progress slowly, but it does make progress, witness the PACS vote in France, but the notion of the family in the case of immigrants is inflexible."
"The laws in force provide for the right of residence to be revoked if there is a break-up in the matrimonial household, effectively outlawing divorce, and, as has just been said, homosexual couples are still not recognised."
"Under the pretext of combating polygamy, second spouses and their children are condemned to illegality and to even greater dependence."
"Family reunification must be liberated from the archaic conditions that still exist as a result of fanatical immigration control."
"In conclusion, Mr Watson' s report has fortunately made real progress following the work in committee on the initial report by Mrs Klamt."
"I am bound to say that, when I hear Mr Gollnisch' s racist, reactionary and unacceptable comments, I want to vote for this report. It is a question of dignity."
"Mr President, contrary to popular belief and notwithstanding the debate that has taken place here this morning, this directive is not about defining the concept of family, which is generally binding throughout the European Union."
"It has far more to do with establishing in precise terms, which third-country family members should be entitled to join relations who are immigrants to the European Union."
"No one would dispute the fact that families have the right to live together."
"But what really matters here is where we draw the line as regards family members."
"For example, I have a wife and two children, and they have children too. I also have siblings and aunts and uncles."
"If I were to count the number of relatives I live in close contact with, that makes 25 all told."
"Commissioner Vitorino, if I were to apply for asylum in Portugal, for example, then clearly I would be unable to assert a claim to live there with 25 relatives."
"In other words, we must be sensible and draw the line somewhere."
"That is the crucial problem we face with this directive."
"We must also distinguish between those whose stay in the European Union subject to a time limit, and those who reside here permanently."
"I should point out that this draft directive extends family reunification provisions beyond those that have been in force in the Member States to date."
"This sends out another signal to would-be immigrants, which will, of course, have major consequences."
"This directive would have very different implications for States with a high proportion of immigrants, such as Austria, Germany and the Benelux States, than it would for States such as Portugal, Finland and others, which do not see very much in the way of immigration."
"We cannot endorse this directive as matters stand, because it would lead to a dramatic increase in family reunification, which is one of the main grounds for reunification."
"Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect for your work, I cherish the hope that the Council will decline to give it the unanimous assent it requires."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly congratulating the European Commission and especially Commissioner Vitorino, on its extremely constructive legislative proposal on the issue of family reunification."
"At last, Europe is on the move, after decades of zero immigration and, more especially, after so many years of refusal by Europeans to grant third-country nationals residing lawfully in the European Union their fundamental human rights."
"Recognising the right to family life is one of the basic conditions for the integration of refugees and migrants in the social life of the country in which they reside."
"Unfortunately, those in this Parliament who extol the virtues of the family and hold it up as the highest ideal happen to be the very people who undermine it. This is exactly what is happening with this draft directive on the reunification of the families of refugees and migrants."
"Self-righteous hypocrisy is the main feature of this wing of the European Parliament, and we have experienced it again and again."
"Yet I would like to say that I understand the qualms of many governments, including my own, concerning this draft directive."
"Indeed, countries such as Germany, where millions of refugees and migrants have sought refuge, are shouldering an enormous burden."
"But at the same time I would like to point out and to highlight the enormous contribution that refugees and migrants make to the economic development of our countries, through their work and through taxation."
"The social burden that is referred to by the critics of the proposal may be reduced if refugees and their family members have the right to work, as provided for by the Commission proposal"
"Finally, I would like to point out that this directive sets out the minimum requirements, and governments retain the right to put in place better conditions for the reunification of families."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force that the European Parliament has been consulted on a Commission proposal for a Council directive on the matter of the lawful immigration of persons originating from third countries."
"It is therefore a sign of the profound institutional changes introduced by the Treaty and given top priority on the European political agenda by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere European Council."
"The Commission has decided that a proposal on family reunification should start us off on this journey, this considerable effort to construct a common European immigration policy."
"I should also like to begin by explaining why we have chosen this subject - in answer to a critical observation from Mrs Klamt, whom, regardless of our differences of opinion, I should like to congratulate on the work she has carried out as the first rapporteur for this matter."
"I believe family reunification is a concept that is thoroughly coherent with the commitments that all the Member States undertook several decades ago in the sphere of international law."
"From the reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the international convenants made under the United Nations in 1966, to the European Convention on Human Rights itself - in all these instruments of international law family protection is upheld as an essential factor for ensuring social peace."
"I do not believe anybody can deny that family reunification is also an important instrument for the integration of immigrants from third countries into their host societies."
"This has indeed been repeatedly recognised by the bodies of the European Union. That is, since 1993 the Council has been devoting constant attention to the subject of family reunification."
"It must also be recognised that family reunification is significant in numerical terms because it is today one of the main causes of immigration into the countries of Europe."
"The directive is not creating this flow of migrants; what the directive intends is to regulate a situation that already exists on the ground."
"Those who refuse to see that this directive aims at setting up legal rules to respond to a situation that already exists on the ground and try to blame the Commission for inventing a new flow of migrants are therefore being unfair in their analysis of the actual situation that we are addressing."
"That is why the Commission decided that family reunification should be given priority treatment over other forms of lawful immigration."
"It is not a matter of deciding on entry and residence for economic purposes, or the immigration of workers, or the immigration of students."
"As we see it, it is a matter of regulating a different form of admittance in response to values - that is, family protection - and a strategic political objective: the promotion of the integration of third-country nationals who are already living lawfully in the Union into their host societies."
"We are basing our approach on a principle which is debatable, but without any evidence to the contrary I believe it can be demonstrated. This is that family reunification is a factor which promotes the personal stability of the immigrant, since family life is always an important instrument for integration into the host country."
"The Heads of State and Government at Tampere in fact unanimously stressed the need to ensure equitable treatment for third-country nationals who are lawfully resident in the Member States of the Union. They also stressed that a more dynamic integration policy needs to be developed in parallel, and that this policy should aim at offering third-country nationals rights and duties comparable to those held by the citizens of the Union."
"These, then, ladies and gentlemen, are the values and political commitments upon which the Commission has based its proposal. I should also like to point out that the Commission has proposed an initiative in which family reunification is seen as a right."
"This is not, however, an absolute right of the third-country citizens who reside in the Union' s Member States, and reside there lawfully."
"Instead it is a right subject to conditions, whether procedural in nature or material conditions regarding the definition of the status of the family members in the country to which they have been admitted and regarding the rights that they enjoy."
"I am willing to discuss all the implications of this proposal, also because the French Presidency considers this subject to be central during the six-month term for which it is responsible."
"For our part, we are also willing to introduce an amended proposal as quickly as possible so that we can achieve a positive outcome during the French Presidency."
"I should like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate."
"Here as in the Commission it has been a lively, at times even passionate debate, because it deals with a sensitive issue on which, naturally, each country puts forward a very strong case for its own situation."
"It is difficult to find common ground at European level. Above all, however, this debate has one fundamental feature."
"It is no longer a debate on statements of intention: it is a debate on rules, binding legal provisions, which will have to be implemented."
"It is therefore natural that it should be a lively, even passionate debate, and one in which there are divergent views."
"The Commission considers your opinion to be of the utmost importance. And I should like to congratulate Mr Wilson on the job he has done in presenting a report under the difficult circumstances in which this debate has taken place."
"I should like to explain to you all what the Commission' s position is on the more difficult political issues in this directive."
"First, the scope of the proposal: the Commission believes that refugees should be included within its scope, because from a political viewpoint it would be incomprehensible if economic migrants were granted a right to family reunification that we did not grant to refugees recognised under the Geneva Convention."
"I accept, however, that it is necessary to exclude the beneficiaries of temporary protection or subsidiary protection."
"This is not a matter of going back on a question of principle. I am convinced that a certain kind of beneficiary of temporary or subsidiary protection should also have the right to family reunification."
"I do recognise, however, that the lack of harmonisation of this concept at European level and especially the Commission' s intention to submit a directive on temporary and subsidiary protection to Parliament and the Council next year will allow us to deal with the right to family reunification in that directive very soon."
"We therefore accept an amendment to the proposal excluding beneficiaries of temporary or subsidiary protection."
"Where issues relating to the concept of the family are concerned, I should like to make it very clear that in this proposal the Commission is not interfering in the matter of defining the concept of the family."
"This proposal fully accepts that each Member State has the competence to define what a family is, as well as the issue, for instance, of unmarried partnerships."
"This proposal does not say that all the Member States will be obliged to recognise unmarried partnerships and accept unmarried partners under all circumstances."
"We are simply saying that in those countries where unmarried partnerships are placed on an equal footing with marriage in domestic law for their own nationals, these unmarried partnerships must also be recognised for the purpose of family reunification for third-country nationals."
"I should therefore like to state clearly that there is nothing in this proposal favouring family reunification for polygamous marriages."
"I am sorry, but the text is quite clear!"
"It is not possible to apply for a second wife to come!"
"Only one exception is made: for the children of the second marriage if the interests of the child so justify."
"But how could you explain treating the children of a second polygamous marriage differently from the children of a first marriage or the children of an unmarried partnership?"
"I am not a subverter of moral values, but I think we have to keep the interests of the children in the forefront."
"Finally, Mr President, the Commission is willing to accept a number of other amendments and other modifications regarding the rights of family members, the conditions and clarification of the conditions for family reunification, the situation in which the person being reunited may acquire independent status, and concerning procedural rules."
"Full details will be given before the vote is taken."
"I should like to conclude by saying that this is, of course, an exercise that will give rise to debate."
"The debate with the Council will not be easy, just as the debate with Parliament has not been easy. I respect the opinions of all Members."
"I should like the final opinion of Parliament to have as broad a support-base as possible."
"And I hope - regardless of our differences of opinion, which are to be expected and, may I say, useful and essential for democracy - that once this directive has been adopted, we may all be able to pool our efforts to solve the essential question that we have before us. This question is how we can create a clear and transparent legal framework that will ensure the integration of lawful immigrants into their host countries and we must do so because this integration is the key to the success of a common European immigration policy."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Movement and residence of EU citizens"
"The next item is the report (A5-207/200) by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs, on the Commission report on the implementation of directives 90/364, 90/365 and 93/96 (right of residence) and on the Communication from the Commission on the special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health [COM(1999) 127 COM(1999) 372 - C5-0177/1999, C5-0178/1999 - 1999/257 (COS)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank all of you who have, through your comments, contributed to fuelling this debate."
"Before embarking on an explanation of my report, I would like to start by asking you a question that I cannot get out of my head. This is in my view the crux of the problem described in my report and will determine the way we vote."
"This question is: what in fact does European citizenship really mean?"
"Is it just a simple expression aimed at selling Europe, or do we really want to add content to this term?"
"Today, for the majority of us who live in Europe, European citizenship is still a concept that is devoid of meaning."
"If we want Europe to be more than a vast free trade area, we must take action to ensure that European citizenship goes beyond the status of a concept and takes root in the everyday life of the citizens of Europe."
"This is the context in which I wish to place this debate."
"The directives that have been examined concern Community nationals, but they must be modified in favour of third-county nationals."
"The report aims to sum up the reality of the freedom to move and reside in the European Union."
"With reference to the EC Treaty, my report was written with due regard to Article 14, concerning free movement of persons, and Articles 17 and 18 concerning European citizenship, which entails the right to move and to reside freely throughout the territory of the European Union."
"Although Member States have made great progress in ensuring the free movement of goods, services and capital, it is clear that we are no nearer to achieving the same for people."
"I will start by filling in some of the background and the content of the directives."
"Initially, freedom of movement was reserved for people who were economically active."
"In June 1990, the Council adopted three Commission draft directives to extend this right to all Member State nationals, even if they were not economically active."
"I will just give the broad guidelines of these directives."
"For retired people and other non-economically active people, the right of residence is open to those who have health insurance cover and adequate means."
"For students, the right of residence is subject to the condition that the student is enrolled at a recognised educational establishment and that he is covered by sickness insurance."
"In both cases, spouses and dependent children may accompany the holder of the right of residence and may work."
"The transposition of these directives was doubly problematic."
"On the one hand, the directives were transposed extremely slowly throughout the Union."
"What is more, the Commission had to initiate fourteen infringement procedures."
"The Commission concludes that 'for too long, EU citizens have been denied some of their rights or been faced with unjustified administrative difficulties due to the incorrect transposition of the Directives' ."
"Let us now proceed to a concrete assessment of the situation. This right to free movement and residence, which is confirmed in the Maastricht Treaty, is violated by economic considerations."
"The notion of adequate means is incorrectly interpreted by governments."
"What income is to be taken into account when evaluating means?"
"What evidence must be provided?"
"How does one take into consideration a progressive financial situation which sometimes depends on the help provided by the spouse?"
"Because the acceptance procedures are long and difficult, it is often necessary to take out a second health insurance in the host country."
"When you are not in salaried work, it is difficult to obtain a residence permit and the instability of the professional situation is added to by the short-term nature of the residence permit once it has been obtained."
"With regard to special measures justified in the name of public order, the Commission gives examples of many cases of incorrect interpretations, such as criminal convictions that justify systematic deportation and expulsion."
"Finally, administrative procedures are too long - more than six months - and become very costly when frequent renewal is necessary, as the period of validity is normally two years rather than five."
"I will now present the main measures advocated with a view to overcoming these problems."
"Our first proposal is to ask the Commission to prepare a framework directive, which would adopt a position based on the fundamental right of free movement and residence rather than on a sector-specific approach which necessarily leaves room for ambiguities."
"It will still be possible at a later date to implement a whole raft of specific measures to help citizens depending on their particular situation."
"This reworking of the existing directives must dissociate the fundamental right of movement and residence from any economic considerations."
"These measures must be concomitant with simplifying administrative procedures and providing documents free of charge."
"Until these mechanisms can be put in place, a transitional measure may be to introduce a one-year residence permit for all applicants."
"Harmonising social protection systems and pension systems is vital."
"Finally, in the case of special measures justified by the notion of public order, we can only call on Member States to narrow down their interpretation, to put an end to the double penalty and to protect certain categories of people from expulsion."
"I would like to finish by clarifying a number of points."
"Rights must be attached to the individual and the individual must take the rights with him wherever he goes."
"Third-country citizens living and working legally in a Member State must benefit from the same rights as European citizens."
"Furthermore, it is a pity that the Council has not followed up this proposal of citizenship and residence."
"In conclusion, I hope that I have persuaded you to support this resolutely citizen-centred approach of freedom of movement and residence, which is a fundamental issue for awareness of a European identity."
"At a time when discussions about the future of Europe are hitting the headlines, and when we are examining a future charter of fundamental rights, we must support any project aimed at providing an area of freedom, justice and equality, where all the residents and citizens who contribute to the construction of Europe must have the same rights."
"Perhaps it is time that people acquired the same rights as the products they consume."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"We are dealing here with a long-overdue overhaul of a number of directives relating to rights of residents of the non-economically active."
"My starting-point, as was the rapporteur's, is that we should give European Union citizenship real meaning."
"The Treaty statement that every citizen should have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States and the reality are still far apart."
"I draw on the experience of a number of language students from other Member States in my own constituency."
"They received a standard letter from our local social security office asking them to attend for a two-hour interview and to bring with them as many items as possible on a non-exhaustive list of about twenty documents such as a passport, bank statements, or household bills to ""establish their identity""."
"When I enquired further about this I was told that it was not an EU matter, because the same letter would be sent to UK residents."
"In what circumstances I cannot imagine."
"And, the two hour time-scale, even more ludicrously, was supposed to save them from a car parking fine in the local car-park!"
"I would not want to see any citizens treated in the same way as these students."
"The history of the directives that deal with the rights of residence of the non-economically active is an unhappy one: non-implementation, infringement proceedings, a patchwork of different and burdensome requirements."
"You can move a sack of potatoes around Europe more easily than a citizen can move."
"If we are to appeal to our citizens and the basic right of free movement is to be real, then simple, fast codification of this area of Community law is long overdue."
"Then, and only then, will the Treaty statement on European Union citizenship become a reality instead of mere words."
"Mr President, we are great talkers about human rights in the EU, but in practice it is often the case that citizens' rights are synonymous with money."
"Those who have work and can support themselves are protected by legislation, but there are large groups of people who do not have work of their own and who therefore do not have rights."
"This may apply to students who have to prove that they have a proper place at university or to pensioners who have to prove that they will be taking their pensions or own capital with them if they move."
"It may also apply to third-country nationals and especially to relatives who are third-country nationals and who are not allowed to accompany the breadwinner when he or she obtains work on the other side of the border."
"This means that those who are weakest economically are still discriminated against."
"The report proposes significant improvements for these groups, which in practice are larger than one might think."
"They are to be given better opportunities to move and an extended right to take up residence in other countries."
"In this connection, I would also point out that the right to move within the labour market and the right of residence are not the same thing."
"Nowadays, there are many workers who are sent on short-term contracts to work in other Member States and who do not receive any right of residence at all."
"For those who do not have a secure income or other means of support, the right of residence is almost nil."
"Freedom of movement for labour is protected by the legislation of the internal market."
"For the majority of people, it is more important, however, for their right of residence, including their right to stay on, to be protected."
"This means that people are not compelled to move even if they cannot support themselves."
"Radical improvement is needed in this area, and it would be as well to tackle this problem now, at a time when the Member States' economies are looking better than they once did."
".- (DE) Mr President, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery 's report addresses the problems that the Commission mentions in its report on how matters stand with regard to the application of provisions on residence rights."
"Yet, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery would like to see the scope of application of these residence rights extended to third-country nationals."
"The Committee on Petitions was asked to submit an opinion because it is a special committee that is directly concerned with the problems facing the general public."
"Unfortunately, there are still far too many infringements of the rights of EU citizens; I wholeheartedly agree on that score."
"Firstly, Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights."
"In particular, subordinate authorities in the Member States are unfamiliar for the most part with the relevant provisions."
"Secondly, the problems associated with the recognition of diplomas are hugely restrictive."
"What use is the right of residence to me, if I do not have the right to exercise the profession I am trained in, in the host country?"
"Thirdly, a failure to adapt the provisions on freedom of movement, and the social security rules, to the changing labour market, is causing problems."
"It is simply not acceptable that I could fail to be reimbursed for medical treatment abroad merely because I do not have the correct form."
"Mr President, we have provisions governing EU citizens' right of residence in other Member States, but even now, they are not being fully applied."
"We are constantly hearing of cases where EU citizens are unable to reside in another Member State."
"Therefore, let us urge the EU Member States to implement the existing Community law provisions without delay, before we consider extending these rights to third-country nationals at any rate."
"Mr President, in the event that the amendments we are presenting to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery ' s report are not accepted, my group will vote against it for reasons which I believe to be fundamental."
"The directives under debate today refer to the free movement and residence of students as well as people who have ceased professional activity or who are economically inactive and who, furthermore, receive disability or old-age pensions or subsidies - all of them Community citizens - as well as the exceptions laid down in another directive on expulsion for reasons of public order, security or public health."
"The problem is that Mrs Boumediene-Thiery widens the scope of these directives to include citizens of third countries."
"For example, section 20 of the resolution extends family reunification to non-Community families and their relatives in ascending and descending lines, who are not dependent on the resident, which would increase admission without restrictions."
"Furthermore, to treat unmarried couples on the same terms as married couples, which does not raise many problems in the case of Community citizens, given the diversity of the legislation, does raise problems in the case of third country citizens because there would be very real problems recognising stable cohabitation."
"It would give rise to so-called marriages of convenience or false marriages, and that amounts to fraud.."
"Furthermore, I believe that all the false logic which is used when referring to migrant workers has no place in this debate, not so much because of the subject matter but rather because it is not appropriate for the study of these directives."
"As the Commission says, the level of information needs to be improved so that European citizens are crystal clear as to what their rights are with regard to moving freely within the internal market, with clear, concise and specific rules and using communication technologies such as the Internet, the television, or local and regional media."
"Commissioner, the suggestion that replies to parliamentary questions should reach our various citizens by means of the methods of communication considered appropriate, does not seem to me to be a good procedure."
"I think that it is impractical, apart from anything else because not even MEPs always read those replies."
"It is also necessary to eliminate the absurd amount of paperwork needed to justify the nature and size of the pension."
"I believe that an identity card for pensioners and the use of computers should replace these cumbersome forms of authorising payments."
"The same would apply to students."
"In order to facilitate their mobility, we should free them of unnecessary costs and make their residence compatible with their periods of study or apprenticeship."
"Finally, I would also like to point out that it makes no sense to link public order, as section 6 of the resolution does, with the Schengen area in a proposal aimed at the citizens of the European Union, who are not governed by the Schengen legislation but by Community directives, in particular those relating to public order."
"In order to update the legislation, I believe it is necessary to revise the texts by means of a new regulation and simplify the obstacles to free movement and to the residence of Community citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by thanking the European Commission for its sustained efforts in keeping the right of residence - within the context of the free movement of persons in Europe - high on the agenda; this is once again borne out by these two communications on the right of residence."
"Secondly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"She has opted for a broad approach, Mr Hernandez Mollar, and her report covers right of residence for all citizens, including the economically active and those from third countries, topics which are, in fact, covered by proposals already submitted."
"My group supports this approach because, despite all initiatives from the Commission, despite the Veil report, despite the action programme and despite the legislative initiatives, the proposals remain on the Council table with very little happening to them."
"Within the framework of this debate, I should like to home in on four specific points."
"Firstly, it has become apparent recently that the European labour market is relying increasingly on mobility; an ever dwindling number of companies manage to fill their vacancies."
"It is therefore quite astounding that there are still that many obstacles with regard to the free movement of persons and right of residence, especially where temporary contracts, part-time jobs and the unemployed who look for jobs abroad are concerned."
"Secondly, my group keeps an open mind on European citizenship. To us, this means that the non-economically active, the retired and students should also be entitled to a right of residence, subject to certain conditions, of course."
"The obstructions which some Member States are creating at the moment do give us the strong impression that some Member States do not want to embrace the European citizenship idea at all."
"Thirdly, we aspire to create a citizenship which does not discriminate according to the type of relationship citizens choose for themselves."
"Whether they choose to live together, and whether they are single, gay or lesbian, they should also be able to claim right of residence in those countries where these types of relationship are recognised; if not, we would be denying thousands of people the right to live in families."
"And finally, we embrace a vision of citizenship which is also open to people from third countries, residents of the European Union, legal immigrants and permanent residents, without discrimination."
"We therefore give this report by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery our unconditional support."
"We hope that the Commission will continue to adopt a hard line against infringements and the pitiful transposition of EU legislation in the Member States, but above all I hope from the bottom of my heart that the Council will finally pluck up the courage to tackle the free movement of persons full-on."
"Mr President, there has thankfully been a change in European Community law over the last 30 years from freedom of movement of persons being seen as purely an economic issue - functional mobility - to it being seen as a personal right."
"This has meant a lot of rhetoric about a citizen's Europe but not much change in the mentality or administrations of the Member States, as Mrs Wallis has pointed out."
"In saying that, I am not overlooking the economic benefits of free movement."
"Mrs Boumediene-Thiery's report points out - and I congratulate her for its quality - that facilitating mobility promotes dynamism and economic competitiveness."
"So why does the Right ignore this?"
"But the real bottom line for Liberals is whether the Member States believe in and respect the notion of European citizenship, not only allowing the citizens of a Member State and their families to move around but also conferring such rights, to the greatest extent possible, on legally resident third-country nationals and their families - which unfortunately were not covered by the Commission report."
"It is very aggravating when the Council of Ministers and individual governments wring their hands about the low turnout in European elections, launch campaigns with balloons and plastic bags about people's Europe and seek to win citizens' votes in referendum campaigns, but still maintain obstructive red tape when those citizens have the cheek to assert their European legal right to move freely."
"Those rules are far too complicated anyway."
"We need a complete overhaul to streamline and make crystal clear the unimpeded exercise of free movement."
"It is not too much to ask."
"As Mrs Wallis said, it should be as easy for people to cross borders as it is for widgets or potatoes."
"We support Mrs Boumediene-Thiery ' s report."
"It is indeed time that we respected equal rights and abandoned the rationale of suspicion towards immigration."
"Member States take it upon themselves to refuse the right of residence to foreign students, even if they are enrolled at a recognised educational establishment, if they believe that they have changed direction or are not progressing quickly enough, which should be a decision left to the university authorities."
"This rationale of suspicion gives rise to obsessive references to the need for public order and the scandalous practice of double penalties."
"For the same crime, in addition to prison, foreigners are systematically and automatically expelled from a Member State."
"This banishment violates the principle of equality before the law that is enshrined in Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Finally, it is important to facilitate the granting and renewal of permanent residence permits, as a residence permit of very brief duration leads to employment of very brief duration, discrimination and exploitation."
"Finally, the time has come to promote a European citizenship that is based on residence."
"The right to vote must be extended to non-Community nationals if we want to get rid of xenophobia and racism in Europe."
"Mr President, as the rapporteurs who have just spoken said, although the right to free movement is deemed to be one of the most important aspects of the fundamental right of European citizenship, it is a right which is all too often subject to restrictions, and the large number of petitions to the European Parliament on precisely this subject are testimony to this."
"I would first of all like to focus on a point strongly emphasised in the report: the need to fight against all abusive and excessively restrictive interpretations of the concept of public policy by some Member States."
"For example, someone who has lived in a country since childhood or, at any rate, for a large number of years, and therefore has cultural, social and family ties in that country, should not be deported unless he or she is convicted of a crime which is deemed to be, in effect, a serious offence, under the criminal law of the country of residence."
"Sadly, this is very often not the case."
"Another point which I would like to focus on concerns the members of certain royal families, such as the Italian royal family, for example, which, despite the fact that it does not pose a threat to national security, cannot fully exercise its legitimate right of free movement."
"I feel that the time has truly come to make a genuine attempt to tackle these issues and remove the barriers to free movement once and for all, for the very reason that - as has already been said - potatoes and goods appear to have greater freedom of movement in Europe than the citizens."
"Freedom of movement and residence is a right enshrined in European treaties and granted to all citizens and should only be denied in exceptional cases when there is a real threat to public safety."
"It is therefore all the more extraordinary that 50 years after the signing of the Convention of Human Rights, which ironically was signed in Rome, and one year after the Treaty of Amsterdam upholding such rights, that one European family, which for a thousand years has been involved with the continent's history, is being denied the fundamental rights my colleague has mentioned."
"The Watson report demands such rights for family reunion and the Boumediene-Thiery report for freedom of movement and residence, even for third-country nationals and even for convicted criminals."
"This family, as mentioned, is the former royal house of Savoy in Italy and lesser violations are also being committed against the royal houses of Austria and Greece by their governments."
"The thirteenth transitional article of the Italian Constitution, absurdly labelled ""transitional"" but still in force after 53 years, is not only a violation of European treaties, but also sexually discriminatory in that it applies only to male royal descendants, no matter how far removed, of the constitutional monarch King Victor Emanuel, deemed guilty of signing unacceptable wartime fascist laws."
"Ironically, descendants of Mussolini are not only allowed to live in Italy but one actually sits in the Italian Parliament."
"This article is shameful and obsolete and all Members of Parliament, even those with anti-monarchist feelings, should join me in calling upon the Italian government to allow an innocent European family to return to their native land, where it poses no conceivable threat to public safety or the stability of the Italian Republic."
"We can only call for European citizens to have more rights if all their rights are upheld irrespective of origin and without discrimination."
"This issue goes far beyond individual families and goes right to the heart of the Union's respect for its own laws and treaties."
"Either we have a European Union based on law or we do not."
"I therefore commend my Amendment No 14 to this House."
"Can I congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery on her report on special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health."
"It is a very good report."
"Unfortunately, in two minutes all I can do is talk about some of its failings."
"Firstly the Commission has failed to deal with the issue of the 12 to 14 million third-country nationals living legally in the Union who currently suffer discrimination and, outside the Union's island States can move freely de facto but cannot do so legally, which of course creates situations in which they are exploited and used in illegal ways."
"With all due respect for the rapporteur, I have to say that we also have a problem with a number of areas that she has not dealt with, one of which is the issue of football hooliganism."
"I am generally in favour of free movement but I think it needs to be limited."
"I do not normally believe that persons who have not been convicted of crimes should be prevented from moving freely, but there is a European problem that is being ignored at European level."
"Europol should be used to prevent the free movement of people who have been convicted of football-related crimes to ensure that they do not cause the same kind of trouble as at previous World Cup and European championship tournaments."
"I also believe that the provisions should be invoked on the grounds of public security to prevent the free movement of German neo-Nazis who produce Holocaust denial material in Denmark with the clear intention of reimporting it into Germany, where it is illegal."
"I hope that the Danish Government will use the provisions in this instance."
"Equally, we need to make sure that the system is not abused."
"I naturally hope that the free movement of people who have the misfortune to be HIV-positive is not restricted in any way on grounds of public health."
"I agree with Mr Tannock in principle."
"Of course the royal families of Europe should be allowed to move about freely."
"However, I disagree with his priorities."
"When we ignore the rights of 12 to 14 million legal residents, then the rights of two families are comparatively insignificant."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by agreeing with all those who have pointed out that the matter we are discussing concerns the very essence of European citizenship."
"We might say that this right contributes towards a practical and concrete expression of the concept of European citizenship, in that the great challenge facing us at the moment is to turn this legally recognised right into a practical reality that is implemented in citizens' everyday lives."
"I also agree with those who have pointed out that the transposition of these directives has taken place too slowly, or even incorrectly in some cases."
"In addition, we must also face up to the difficulties arising out of implementation of the directive on special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, in that there should be guidelines not only for the Member States, which have so far interpreted the provisions of the directive in quite a variety of ways, but also for the citizens regarding the rights conferred on them."
"The Member States may impose restrictions on the right to free movement of Community citizens, particularly in matters of entry to and expulsion from their territory as well as the issuing or renewal of residence permits, where this is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health."
"Member States cannot, however, abuse such prerogatives in a European Union based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and particularly respect for the European Convention on Human Rights as well as, soon, a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is for this reason, then, that these measures of exception to free movement have been subject to restrictive interpretation."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to express my agreement with my colleague Hernández Mollar when he gave his support to the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to integrate the various texts into a single regulation. This could be implemented directly and would be a primary document on European citizenship, which would offer all the necessary information not only to citizens regarding their rights of citizenship but also to the government departments in each Member State that have the task of implementing existing legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in company with Mr Hernández Mollar - whom I would like to thank for his enthusiastic support for Amendment No 15, tabled by myself - I feel that this document must be rejected if the European People's Party's amendments are not incorporated."
"I support Amendment No 14, tabled by Mr Tannock, which upholds the free movement of the heirs to the Italian and Greek thrones and supports the monarchy."
"Personally, in tabling Amendment No 15, I support the pensioners, for although the measure facilitates the movement of non-EU citizens, it does not remove the difficulties facing its own citizens, particularly its disabled citizens, who wish to travel within Europe."
"At Bergamo Orio al Serio airport, as I was leaving to come to Strasbourg, I met a pensioner - a very old lady who is 80 years old - who told me that she wanted to go to Paris to visit her daughter but that she could not do so because she would lose her Italian State pension which is her only means of support."
"Another person, who is totally handicapped, said that they wanted to go to London but that they could not do so because they would have lost their pension."
"Yet another person, who is disabled - in a wheelchair, no less - told me that he would have liked to go and visit his brother but that in doing so he would have lost his incapacity allowance."
"Therefore, our goal must be to bring about the free movement of pensioners and disabled citizens in Europe."
"Mr Fatuzzo, you have made me think very carefully about where I shall travel to in old age."
"Commissioner Vitorino has the floor."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like first of all to congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and all those who have taken part in this debate."
"Indeed, I think that, for the Commission, the establishment of European citizenship has created a new legal and political environment and, for our part, we intend to draw all the practical lessons we can both in the legislative field and in the field of day-to-day public administration."
"The Commission is counting a great deal on the support of the European Parliament when the time comes."
"With regard to the motion for a resolution that you have just presented, I would simply like to address two or three comments directed at the Commission."
"The three directives on the right of residence of the non-economically active have, I am sure, enabled thousands of European Union citizens to benefit from this right without encountering any particular problems."
"However, there are still cases where these directives are incorrectly applied."
"I can assure you that the Commission always intervenes - and tries to do so strictly under all circumstances - even if its intervention is not always obvious."
"If agreement is not reached, the Commission does not hesitate to notify Reasoned Opinions to the Member States concerned."
"Citizens' complaints that meet with a satisfactory administrative response through extra-judicial procedures can be counted in their hundreds."
"The action of the Commission also applies to the laws of Member States. One could, in my view, cite several cases where this intervention has brought about modification of the legislation of Member States and sometimes even the examination, by the Court of Justice, of issues to which it has provided positive solutions."
"There is no shortage of examples either concerning the Member States' improper use of the notion of public order, especially that leading to the expulsion from their territory of nationals from other Member States. I can assure you, however, that the number of these cases is now very low and that, with regard to such cases, the European Commission never fails to take the necessary measures pursuant to Community law."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be claimed that the strict application of Community law is sufficient to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of European Union citizens, bearing in mind the huge number of obstacles that persist due to the shortcomings in Community law."
"These shortcomings have already been identified in the second report by the Commission on European citizenship and in the report by the High Level Group headed by Simone Veil, which was presented to the Commission in 1997."
"Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this morning we debated the directive on family reunification and that the Tampere Conclusions require the Commission to present a proposal on the recognition of entry, admission and residence conditions and on the legal status of third-country nationals within the European Union legally."
"We are currently working on this."
"For all these reasons, the Commission shares the opinion expressed by several Members of this House on the need for a global reworking of existing texts within the context of a single legal instrument, which will organise and guarantee the unimpeded exercise of the freedom of movement and residence."
"This reworking, which moreover is included in the Commission action programme for 2000, is already in preparation."
"It is based on the idea that entitlement to the right of free movement and residence must be dissociated from any prior reference to the economic situation of the beneficiaries in order to be attached henceforth to a concept and a status resulting directly from the importance of European citizenship."
"The unique status of a European Union citizen necessarily creates the need for a unique general system of movement and residence in response to the demand to enrich the content of European citizenship in accordance with the political aspirations of the Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Environmental effects of certain programmes"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0196/2000) by Mrs Schörling, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position (C5-0180/2000 - 1996/0304(COD)) for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that I have been entrusted with being rapporteur for the second reading of the SEA Directive which I believe is an important step towards a new form of behaviour in environmental policy."
"I want to thank all my fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, together with the Commission and, in particular, the Portuguese Presidency for the excellent way in which they have cooperated."
"This draft directive concerns strategic environmental assessments which, in brief, involve a systematic process for identifying, analysing and assessing the influence and likely effects of plans and programmes upon the environment."
"The assessments are to be carried out at as early a stage as possible in the planning process, partly so that alternative solutions might be found before the decision-making process is taken any further."
"Environmental reports are to be written and made available to the environmental authorities, the public and environmental organisations, which are also to be given sufficient time within which to respond to the reports."
"This is a very important directive for the whole of the Community' s environmental policy if a tool is to be obtained which makes it easier to comply with the commitments to sustainable development and compliance with the precautionary principle which have been made in the Treaty and in other agreements."
"A modern environmental policy worthy of the name must do everything to ensure that damage to the environment does not occur and that effects upon the environment are minimised."
"What often happens nowadays is that attempts are made to identify and repair damage once it has occurred."
"As early as at the planning stage, we must learn to use policy areas, plans and programmes to avoid and reduce the negative effects and influence upon the environment."
"The SEA Directive constitutes a very important step towards an approach of this kind."
"Unfortunately, this draft directive makes no mention of policy areas, in spite of the fact that they figure in the Commission' s original draft from 1991 and in spite of the fact that all researchers in this area actually take it for granted that policy areas too must be included in a strategic environmental assessment."
"It was not possible to achieve this in the Council, but the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy considered that policy areas too must be included in the review to be carried out in five years' time."
"This has been discussed in Amendments 2 and 21."
"A crucial argument when the Commission finally tabled this proposal in 1996 was that the assessment at project level enters the decision-making process much too late."
"In actual fact, this is one of the main points in the directive - that an environmental assessment should be made early on in the decision-making process."
"At first reading, the European Parliament had quite a lot of points of view."
"The proposal was thought to be heading in the right direction but in many areas, it did not go far enough."
"Parliament tabled 29 amendments, of which 15 are more or less to be found in the common position."
"If the SEA is to be a genuinely useful tool, the directive must be sufficiently broad in scope and the environmental report and the assessments must naturally be of very high quality."
"In the common position, the Council has now made the text worse in a number of areas, specifically when it comes, for example, to the scope of the directive and the definition of what it is to cover."
"The Commission too was very, very critical of the common position because it was far too limited in relation to the original text."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tried to restore something of the balance, for example by means of Amendments 6 and 7 which broaden the scope of the directive by not limiting it only to plans and programmes linked to EIA projects."
"We do not permit whole categories of plans and programmes to be exempt."
"Nor can we accept that financial plans and the whole of the defence sector are exempt from strategic environmental assessments."
"This is discussed in Amendment 10, which also proposes that structural funds must also of course be covered by strategic environmental assessments next time around."
"Other amendments which improve the directive concern greater transparency and openness to inspection and the need also to cooperate and consult with countries outside the Community."
"I personally am very surprised at Amendment 26 from Mr Nassauer and 29 other MEPs who want to reject the common position."
"This possibility was not mentioned at all in the Committee' s discussion."
"Clearly, they are fully entitled to make this proposal, but do they really think that the EU' s environmental policy is something extraneous which is not in any way binding?"
"Should the European Parliament just not bother about the text of the Treaty, the Cardiff Agreement, the Fifth Environmental Programme and so on?"
"I really do not think that the proposal is a genuinely serious one."
"Amendments 11 and 31 also worry me a little."
"Amendment 11, in particular, says that the Member States should define at what level SEAs are to be carried out if plans and programmes are part of a hierarchical system."
"In this way, the whole idea of arranging an SEA is called into question, so I hope these amendments do not go through."
"Mr President, this is a small but significant measure to extend the duties of Member States to carry out strategic environmental assessments on the planning framework as well as on the actual plans where the implementation would or could have a significant impact on the environment."
"All Member States voted for the common position, but some made it clear that they would go very little further than that."
"Our task is to clarify and to amend responsibly and on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Schörling, on the work she has done and the consultation she has had with us."
"We will however be rejecting some of her amendments, notably those that seek to extend the system to all financial plans, to defence and civil defence, to consultation beyond what is reasonable and to the general policies she has just mentioned, which become more of a wish-list than firm proposals."
"However, we agree that it makes no sense to exclude projects financed wholly or partially by the European Union, especially structural funds, and we certainly agree that it makes sense to talk to neighbouring states outside the European Union."
"We agree that there should be adequate reporting back, not only on the environmental risks identified by the assessment, but on the action it is proposed to take to mitigate or remove them."
"We also of course have to consider Amendment No 26, in the name of some of our German colleagues, which rejects the common position."
"I understand the concerns of colleagues from Germany and some parts of Italy."
"These result from the way in which some governments and regional governments have chosen to implement the assessments."
"These governments are giving environmental assessment and Europe a bad name for what are entirely excesses of their own making and they need to look carefully at their domestic policies."
"But this is a subsidiarity measure which leaves the details to Member States."
"It is not the big hand of Europe extending control to local planning matters."
"It does, however, ensure that particularly at our respective borders our planning takes account of the environment quality within and across our borders when planning frameworks are being agreed."
"We believe that to be a good thing and my PPE-DE Group will therefore not be supporting Amendment No 26 and will vote for the common position."
"We shall then vote for the amendments we supported in committee and for one further clarifying amendment which has been submitted since, but we shall oppose the amendments which we believe are a step too far in terms of what is desirable, practical and acceptable."
"Mr President, the directive we are about to vote on represents a major step forwards."
"The obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment at an extremely early stage of town and country planning activities does, in fact, make it possible to incorporate environmental concerns fully right from the conception of town and country planning plans and programmes."
"The Union has at last realised that we can no longer restrict ourselves to merely picking up the pieces following damage caused by short-sighted planning, but that the damage must be averted as early on as possible."
"The amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment substantially improve the Council's common position."
"Firstly, it was upheld that, in order to exert any real influence over national customs, the scope of the directive must be as wide as possible."
"In this context, I feel that plans and projects financed from the Structural Funds must without exception be governed by the directive, seeing that, in practice, they represent all the programmes implemented, particularly in regions whose development is lagging behind."
"Secondly, the principle of consultation and provision of information to the public and the organisations concerned throughout the assessment process, in compliance with the Aarhus Convention, has been reestablished."
"I therefore feel that this is a sound text overall."
"I understand the concerns of the Members coming from countries organised according to a Federal State model, who fear that the local authorities will be overloaded with work, but I feel that the amendments, particularly Amendments Nos 19, 29 and 31, are sufficient to avoid an overlap between the two directives and still ensure respect for the environment."
"Mr President, every day it is drawn to our attention that the environment is changing."
"Last Sunday, I was listening to a Swedish radio programme which said that, in central Sweden, people would have to adjust to the fact that rainfall would increase by 50 per cent over the next few years."
"In one way or another, environmental questions are always the subject of public opinion nowadays."
"They must therefore feature in a better way in political work, too."
"I therefore want to congratulate Mrs Schörling on a very good report which proposes that environmental aspects must be taken into consideration at an early stage."
"In principle, environmental issues must permeate all activities, economic activity above all perhaps."
"When it comes to plans, building projects etc, it is of course important, as proposed in this report, to take account of environmental aspects as early as possible so that mistakes and increased costs can be avoided and the right solution found as soon as possible."
"I think it is extremely important and commendable that Mrs Schörling should propose that the scope of the directive should be broadened."
"It is a matter of urgency that economic activity should be included in the environmental assessment."
"It is transparently obvious to the EU, which invests a very large part of its budget in the agricultural sphere, in regional policy and in the structural funds, that these areas should be examined from an environmental point of view."
"We cannot go in and do this directly but should do so as quickly as possible whenever new plans come out."
"It is unreasonable to do what is at present done with EU funds and to support such activities within these sectors as are opposed from an environmental point of view in other contexts."
"We must try to create a system in which we think in environmental terms from the very beginning, even when it comes to economic problems."
"This is a major and important issue."
"I realise that large sections of this House do not agree with me, but my group and I completely support Mrs Schörling in this connection."
"Mr President, I am going to refer briefly to four points which were fully debated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We are basically in favour of the proposal of the Environment Committee and its rapporteur."
"With regard to the inclusion of some of the sectors in the directive, in particular the extractive industry and the defence industry, we believe that they should not be left out."
"Provided, of course, that the necessary precautions are taken."
"I would also like to stress the importance of the inclusion of the management of water resources."
"An ambitious government plan will be presented soon in Spain, the National Hydrological Plan, which will have a clear impact on the places where it is put into practice."
"We feel it is essential that these assessment studies should be carried out."
"Also very important to us is the role of the public, i.e. transparency."
"There is a directive on the right to information, No 313, which has been repeatedly ignored by the Member States and by local and regional authorities."
"Likewise, we must include the quality of the studies and the issue of health amongst the significant sectors affected."
"High environmental standards and good health are very closely related."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and in so doing acknowledge the positive role of Parliament in setting the agenda for the highest standards of environmental protection."
"There is of course a cost factor in environmental management, but equally an economic return, which not easily quantified but exists none the less."
"The proposed directive, which requires an environmental assessment before the adoption of a regional or county plan, makes good environmental and economic sense."
"Far too often in the past we have seen costly development plans collapse because of environmental considerations that were not addressed at the initial planning stage."
"Finally, I would appeal to professional planners to use their common sense by taking account of the views of public representatives and community groups."
"A textbook approach of the kind seen far too often has not always served to meet citizens' requirements in this important area."
"Planning must not become the sole preserve of those who have an academic qualification."
"Elected Members must exercise greater care and concern when drawing up development policies that will ultimately affect Union citizens."
"Mr President, strategic environmental impact assessment is an instrument which allows governments to assess whether policy proposals, plans and programmes are compatible with the concept of sustainable development."
"In this way, we can ensure that environmental concerns form a more integral part of the economy. Indeed, decisions at macro-economic level too should be accompanied by a preliminary strategic environmental impact assessment."
"It is therefore important for public administrations to be very aware of the usefulness of this exercise in order to prevent environmental damage as far as possible."
"It is equally important for us to clearly outline which plans require environmental impact assessments and which do not."
"The Council has dealt with this extensively."
"I am in favour of submitting policy proposals, including environmental impact assessments, to public administrations."
"In that case, a public administration may decide to scrap a plan, programme or proposal, call these off in good time or replace them by environmentally-friendly alternatives."
"On the other hand, there is a substantial risk of too many plans and programmes being subjected to environmental impact assessments."
"If extensive studies are carried out of plans and programmes whose impact on the environment is negligible, then this is a waste of energy."
"What is more, the instrument as such is being weakened."
"So in this light, including all financial plans, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection would therefore be going too far."
"Mr President, the best way to integrate environmental issues with all areas of policy is to get the environmental perspective in the picture at the earliest possible stage."
"In this way we will avoid the problems we have at the moment with regard to harmonisation of the use of land, financial activity, and the expectations of the public."
"There is in existence a strategic evaluation of the impact on the environment that applies not only to town planning but also agricultural, transport, travel and energy sector programmes, among others."
"In order for us to be able to harmonise all these important aspects and proceed in an environmentally and socially sustainable way we need plans that are sufficiently long-term in nature: long-term inasmuch as they act as genuine guidelines for separate and independent measures."
"In this connection I have to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"It is quite natural that Structural Funds programmes, plans and measures should be included in any examination of this issue."
"It is also important that we take the proper course of action at different levels, and not act in too complicated or bureaucratic a manner, but take account of the new information we get all the time."
"In this respect there has perhaps been too much anxiety about overlap, but I hope that, after this debate, this report will be as successful as possible as far as this is concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a new instrument and it accords with Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which concerns the integration of environmental policies into other areas."
"It is a delicate flower and we all want it to be a success."
"I also want it to be well received by my electorate back home."
"Hence I sometimes ask myself the questions that they ask themselves."
"When I look at the Council' s proposal, I assume that people will ask themselves this: how can the EU introduce an assessment regime that excludes the plans and projects financed by the European Union itself?"
"This is completely unacceptable, and that is precisely how I see it."
"The scope of application must be extended to include areas that are financed by the European Union."
"Secondly, the people of Germany, in particular, may well ask themselves why the assessments are to be carried out at state level, national level, regional administration level, and at local level, which will drag the procedures out."
"This is indefensible in my view."
"It is the real issues that count, not having the same thing assessed at every level."
"Therefore we must make it clear that a duplication of effort must be avoided."
"Accordingly, Guido Sacconi' s Amendment No 31 has my unequivocal support."
"A third question the people may ask themselves is this: why is nothing happening now that an assessment has taken place which may have raised certain issues?"
"Therefore we must make it clear that the regulation is binding."
"We certainly cannot have a situation where an assessment is carried out and the findings are then filed away, never to be seen again."
"We need a binding commitment to the effect that any findings will be acted on."
"Therefore, I emphatically support Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which provide for us to make the transposition of environmental protection measures following assessment a little more binding in nature."
"With this in mind, I wish Mrs Schörling' s report every success."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for her constructive approach and for being open to dialogue with all the interested parties - including the Commission - which I hope will finally enable us all to achieve a positive result in relation to this directive."
"I would also like to highlight the quality of the report which we are debating today and I would like to talk about what I see as the most significant problems raised in the various amendments that have been tabled and the interventions of the various Members. My sincere thanks for all your comments and points of view."
"Of the key questions, I would firstly like to mention those amendments which involve broadening the scope of the future directive."
"The joint position clearly distinguishes the plans for which the strategic environmental assessment is obligatory from those for which it is necessary to make a selection, a screening."
"The Commission is inclined towards this approach, provided that the joint position is improved, because we believe that otherwise it would be insufficient."
"Firstly, there must be a balance between the plans for which the strategic environmental assessment is obligatory and those for which we have to make a selection."
"Secondly, the scope of the directive must, in any event, be sufficiently broad and systematically include those plans which have a significant impact on the environment."
"This is why the Commission enthusiastically supports some of Parliament' s amendments which broaden the scope of this directive and do so in a balanced fashion, such as, for example, the second and fifth sections of Amendment No 5, which have been mentioned by the rapporteur and also by some other speakers, such as Mrs González, which proposes also including extractive activities. We also support Amendment No 6."
"Nevertheless, we believe that some amendments go too far and propose the strategic environmental assessment for plans which will not probably have a significant impact on the environment."
"For example, section 4 of Amendment No 5 would make these assessments obligatory for all the plans for the sectors listed in the directive."
"The third section of Amendment No 10 would mean an unnecessary burden for the Member States."
"Some amendments limit the directive' s scope even further and actually contradict what I have just said."
"Certain amendments would reduce the scope, such as Amendment No 3, which limits the scope to the plans financed by the EU, or Amendments Nos 11 and 31, which allow States to choose the level or levels of planning with which these strategic environmental assessments will be carried out."
"This would exclude many plans which have an impact on the environment."
"Now, if Parliament were to adopt these amendments together with those which broaden the scope to plans with no significant impact, it seems to me that we would end up with a text which is inconsistent with itself."
"These amendments seem to be inspired by the fear of the assessment being duplicated."
"In my view, this fear is not sufficiently justified."
"Planning is usually carried out at various levels and each one has its own specific characteristics."
"The carrying out of assessments at various levels of planning is not a duplication of the assessment, especially given the safeguards contained in Articles 4, 5 and 10 of the joint position which are intended to prevent just the kind of duplication which Mr Lange, for example, referred to."
"Thirdly, I would point out the amendments which establish the procedures for planning and programming the screening and the definition of the scope of the assessment - Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 13 - and which require the screening to be carried out on a case by case basis, with the participation of the public in all cases."
"I believe that the objective of the screening and the definition of the scope of the assessment is to determine, quickly and efficiently, which plans and which environmental problems are the most relevant."
"Establishing the best way to deal with these issues will require practical experience."
"We therefore believe it is too soon to establish that all circumstances justify a screening and a broad scope."
"We therefore believe that, by incorporating the provisions on the screening and the definition of the scope into their national legislation, Member States would be liable to exceed the requirements of the directive and, for that reason, we will not accept these amendments."
"Nor will we accept the amendment which implies a rejection of the joint text - Amendment No 26 - which contradicts the other approaches."
"I do not believe it is necessary to point out that this directive on the strategic environmental assessment is a key instrument for integrating the environment into policies and for promoting sustainable development in the European Union."
"I believe that a rejection of the joint position would deal a serious blow to these principles which are at the heart of the Treaties and which must inspire all our policies."
"I understand that this may seem insufficient to some of you, but we must appreciate that sometimes it is not always best to seek perfection."
"I believe that we should seek something acceptable, which would be a step forward, rather than reach a deadlock."
"Mr President, having carefully examined all the amendments, I can tell you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 5 (sections 2 and 5), 6, 12, 28 (section 1) and 29."
"Amendments Nos 9 (the part which refers to the requirement to justify that the strategic environmental assessment is not necessary), 10 (sections 1 and 2), 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24 and 25 are acceptable in principle, providing that there is some rewording of its content."
"The Commission cannot, however, under any circumstances, accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 (sections 1, 3 and 4), 7, 8, 9 (in the part on the requirement to justify the need for a strategic environmental assessment), 10 (section 3), 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28 (section 2), 30 and 31."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues"
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for his efforts over quite a long period of time in negotiating this very satisfactory proposal which will - as all colleagues have said so far - significantly reduce the amount of pollution dumped illegally into the seas around Europe."
"Let us pause and reflect on the scale of the problem."
"Mr Bouwman quite rightly referred to Erika."
"This was indeed a tragedy of enormous proportions, with significant and perhaps enduring consequences, but the amount of deliberate spills from oil tankers along all our coasts dwarfs the amount of oil that was spilled from Erika."
"It is that problem that this particular proposal aims to tackle."
"I am delighted that it will, by ensuring that the Member States provide adequate facilities at all their ports, that their ships and masters are obliged to use them, that the fees system is fair and balanced and above all that 25% of ships are inspected to ensure these requirements are met."
"I particularly welcome the three-year review, because my only concern is that Member States should implement this legislation that they have now signed up to."
"As Mr Jarzembowski will know only too well, on port state control several Member States still do not inspect 25% of ships."
"If they cannot do it on that, what is to say they will do it on this?"
"That is our challenge to them: to make sure they adhere to the very worthy agreement that we are hopefully going to be endorsing this week."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bouwman on the publication of this text, which had been uncertain for a long time."
"This is indeed a very important date in maritime history."
"A number of our colleagues have said that this text is a precursor to the Erika package and, in many respects, it aims to solve a problem that is even more serious."
"This problem concerns acts of ecological piracy, when ships discharge waste at sea, discharging hydrocarbons and a huge amount of waste onto our shorelines."
"It is also a victory for Parliament over the Council' s reluctance to imposing a common-sense fee-paying system."
"The principle of polluter pays is not working in the case in point, because the polluter cannot be identified."
"If we want to settle this issue, we must move towards a universal fee system, which will be mandatory and not linked to the act of waste treatment."
"I am among those who, in their capacity as French Members of Parliament, have made every effort to ensure that this text is published, even acting against the sympathies of their government towards this text or against its reservations."
"I am among those who welcome this compromise."
"But this compromise cannot be allowed to become a let-out."
"It must be implemented and its implementation must be strictly monitored at the level of the Member States."
"In this connection, I would like to give you the position of a Frenchman who has worked so hard, despite the reluctance of his government."
"It is clear that this text currently favours large ports and puts small ports, which are not equipped, at a disadvantage."
"I therefore call on the Council to help Member States equip small ports, possibly in the framework of the Structural Funds, or in the form of some kind of loan, because small ports are also important elements of national and regional development and of regional and local economies."
"And I believe that, if we provide small ports with waste treatment plants, we will secure the success of this directive."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on a commendable result."
"I do not normally make a habit of doing this here in Parliament but, since there is good reason for doing so on this occasion, I would thank the rapporteur and the others who have worked on this report."
"As Mr Stenmarck said, we are familiar with this system from the cooperation that has taken place in the Baltic."
"Since March 1998, the Baltic Recommendation has taken such a system for granted."
"I should like to say, however, that the agreement is in certain respects a disappointment in the perspective of what has happened in the Baltic."
"I should also like to refer to the law we have passed in Finland which stipulates that the fee ought not to depend upon how much waste the vessel leaves at the port."
"In Finland, we have had such a system for waste oil since 1 June."
"In that respect, the agreement is a disappointment."
"In the last few days, we have learned that, even when it comes to grey water and pollution which is eutrophic in its effects, intentional and unintentional discharges from vessels are the main sources of pollution in the Baltic."
"We are used to the fact that the polluter-pays principle does not operate in the case of oil, but there are problems too when it comes to eutrophy caused in other ways."
"We are aware that everyone has been exposed to tough lobbying from the port organisation in Europe which has consistently set its face against this proposal."
"The outcome is, therefore, nonetheless a good one."
"However, it will be extremely important to follow up the proposal."
"The Commissioner is known to have a major interest in the sea and in obtaining a clean environment."
"It is important that the follow-up should be carried out seriously so that any supplementary measures can be taken, if need be."
"This is a first step, but I would observe that it is important that we should have stricter conditions for the Baltic, which is perhaps far and away the most sensitive inland sea in Europe."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Bouwman, which is the outcome of a long process, has in the interim become even more topical in France because of the shipwreck of the tanker, the Erika, on the occasion of which the Minister for the Environment did not see fit to interrupt his holiday."
"This report goes some way to preventing marine pollution because it deals with ships that discharge waste at sea."
"These acts are not covered by the media in the same way as shipwrecks, but they nevertheless make up most of the pollution of our seas."
"We must however recognise that Community legislation would not be necessary if the Member States of the European Union, who are all signatories to Marpol, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, had taken the necessary steps."
"Nor is it enough to accuse unscrupulous shipowners or captains; we must bear in mind that it is often impossible to discharge waste inside the ports, due to the lack of appropriate facilities."
"The problem of waste storage is also extremely difficult to solve, as this in turn gives rise to the problem of waste treatment."
"Nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that, in an age when agricultural installations are monitored by satellite, it is so difficult to monitor a ship discharging waste at sea."
"We will, however, vote for this report, because it seems to be moving towards better prevention of pollution and because, wishing to remain at a general level, it leaves Member States a certain latitude in their choice of implementation tools."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to be here today to participate in the debate on the approval of the directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues."
"Like previous speakers, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, on the excellent work he has done."
"During this time he has combined steadfastness with flexibility and intelligence to achieve a result which is acceptable to all the institutions and which will serve to make our seas cleaner."
"I must tell you, for example, that this summer, one of the items in the news in the country I know best, Spain, involved the southern coastlines being affected by the pollution resulting from oil tankers cleaning our their holds in international waters."
"This is one of the 100 000 cases which occur throughout the year on Europe' s coastlines."
"What we have to do is find out how we can, if not end, then at least limit as far as possible, given the capacity we have, these harmful effects on our seas. In order to end it, we would have to reconsider Maritime Law which, to a large extent, originates from the maritime situation of the 17th and 18th Centuries, which bore no relation to the current situation."
"I believe we have made a great deal of progress which will noticeably improve the marine environment in the face of the deliberate contamination by certain ships - because not all of them do this sort of thing - of our coastlines."
"The current version of this directive has the support of everybody."
"It has the support of the shipowners because it provides them with waste facilities, which already exist in some European ports but unfortunately not in all of them, particularly not in the smaller ports, where the Member States will have to make significant investments."
"This version of the directive has the support of the ports, because it means that their investments in this type of facility will not put them at a competitive disadvantage, which has unfortunately been the case at times, since some ports have made considerable efforts and others have not."
"It has the support of those sectors which are most sensitive to the problem of residues and the fight for sustainable development."
"I believe that the whole of this House and also the representatives of the Council and the Commission are included in this group, not only the ecologists, but all those who are concerned about this type of problem."
"We believe that issues such as the planning of residue management, the ships' delivery obligations, prior notification, the controls - 25% of the controls -, fees which incentivise the use of port facilities for cleaning the holds of ships, will necessarily contribute to a reduction in marine pollution."
"This directive, of course, enjoys the support of the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, because we know that it will mean something positive for our citizens."
"It would have been very sad if we had been unable to reach this agreement, which was so longed-for by everyone."
"I would like to thank the Council for its flexibility and its constructive will, and Parliament also, especially the rapporteur, for the work carried out over this period and during the conciliation procedure."
"The Commission has obtained some commitments which have helped this agreement. These commitments enable us to specify that ""significant"" means that at least 30% of the costs of the cleaning of holds in ports must be covered in a general sense, whether or not these port facilities are used."
"If over the next three years we see that the Member States' actions are not sufficient and the desired results are not obtained, the Commission reserves the right to present a new directive clearly establishing a minimum percentage which must be covered by the general fees or by an obligatory cleaning fee in the various European ports."
"It is also the Commission' s responsibility to verify that that control of 25%, another key element of this directive, is carried out by the Member States."
"I would like once again to thank Parliament for standing firm on the need for a strengthened mechanism for reviewing the fees system, which will undoubtedly allow us to move forward and make a detailed study of the current system which we have implemented and the consequences for the environment."
"Mr President, it has already been said in the debates that we have suffered from the impact of the Erika tragedy, but the cleaning out of holds is equivalent to more than one Erika each year on Europe' s coastlines."
"We are, therefore, taking a great step forward today."
"This does not mean that we are not going to move forward on issues relating to oil tankers and safety in the transport of polluting materials, such as oil and its derivatives, issues which we hope will not only make progress in this House and the Council, but which will also be supplemented by means of additional initiatives which, as the Commission has stated, will be presented shortly."
"Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon)"
"Madam President, can I impose on your goodwill and Parliament's goodwill for a moment in welcoming to the diplomatic gallery a delegation from Kazakhstan?"
"They are in Parliament today and tomorrow to raise awareness of the former Soviet empire's nuclear testing programme which impacted not just severely but hugely on their country."
"They had 607 nuclear explosions in the atmosphere between 1949 and 1990."
"This has left part of their country completely devastated and I hope Parliament will give them a sympathetic hearing in the seminar they are holding here this afternoon."
"They have a huge problem in raising world awareness of this former Soviet problem."
"We shall also be discussing the problems of the submarine that sank, another part of the nuclear legacy that has been left by the Soviet Union."
"Thank you, Mr Provan. I am very happy to welcome this delegation."
"Comments by Mr Verheugen concerning enlargement"
"The next item is the communication on Mr Verheugen' s statement on enlargement."
"I welcome President Prodi to the Chamber and I thank him for being present."
"I must warn you that President Prodi will have to leave us at 4.35 p.m. to travel to New York for the Millennium meeting."
"We are nevertheless grateful to him for having made the effort to take part in this debate and, without further ado, I shall give him the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to make a personal statement before this house, together with Commissioner Verheugen, in order to clarify the political significance of the interview with him in the Süddeutsche Zeitung of 2 September and the political significance of a number of ensuing press statements."
"Mr Verheugen will shortly explain to you exactly what he said and why he said it."
"For my part, I want to reaffirm solemnly before you, Members of Parliament, the full commitment of my Commission to the great task of enlargement."
"I have repeatedly stressed that enlargement is the Commission' s single most important task and that the Commission is committed to starting the process off along the right track."
"There is a pressing need for this new page in the history of the Union to be completed, in accordance with the objectives set by the European Council and the Commission itself and frequently presented before this House."
"As you are well aware, this is a highly complex issue from a political point of view, and with your strong, unwavering support, the Commission is conducting the negotiation process transparently and objectively, with rigorous adherence to the conditions laid down in its mandate."
"The democracies of the countries which are going to join the Union are making a huge effort, which we are in constant danger of underestimating."
"However, this effort must be matched on our side by considerable political generosity, expressed in many different ways."
"The Union' s first act of generosity, and I must stress that once again, must be to be ready to open its doors to new Members by January 2003."
"In order to put our house in order, therefore, the Union' s main concern must be to agree in Nice, at the end of the year, upon a high-quality institutional reform which will prevent our system from being watered down."
"There is another side to the political generosity which it is our duty to display: we must all make every effort to win as many citizens as possible over to supporting the enlargement process."
"For my part, I fear that the public is not yet sufficiently convinced."
"In seeking democratic support for this historic enterprise, we are certainly not attempting to delay the process but to reinforce it."
"It is clearly up to each individual Member State or candidate country to decide which ways and means to use to ensure support from its citizens."
"In particular, the national procedures for ratifying enlargement are purely national issues."
"It is certainly not the intention of the Commission or Commissioner Verheugen to interfere in this matter."
"Nevertheless - and this is a different matter - we must all play our part in making clear to our citizens what is at stake."
"I have always found Parliament, before which I sit today, to be fully committed to doing just this: explaining to our fellow citizens, over and over again, that enlargement is not a threat but a historic opportunity in all respects, and, above all, a historic step towards establishing peace in our continent."
"The loyal commitment of all the Commissioners to the Commission' s policies is a hallmark of my presidency, and, as this House is aware, I do not lack the means to enforce that if necessary."
"In this particular case, I am entirely confident that Günter Verheugen fully supports the Commission' s policy, which this House has approved on many occasions."
"I therefore have every confidence in his ability to bring the enlargement negotiations to a swift, successful conclusion."
". (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we are having this debate, because it gives me the opportunity to offer a word of explanation - and therefore have the final word, as I see it - on the interview that unleashed this furore."
"I made the point, in this interview - in a personal capacity and in a purely German context - that referenda can help to involve the public more closely in major European projects that change the constitutional nature of the State."
"I cited the Treaty of Maastricht as an example of this, and not enlargement."
"Finally, I also said that the German constitution makes no provision for this."
"No one regrets more than I do the fact that this statement was taken to mean that I was calling for a referendum on enlargement."
"I hereby declare that I did not raise such a demand, either for Germany or for any other country for that matter."
"If you read the text with complete impartiality and do not rely on second-hand reports, you will come to no other conclusion."
"But what was the real message?"
"The message was this: 'we want enlargement and we want it to be implemented as quickly as possible and as comprehensively as is necessary.'"
"A huge number of Members of this House know that for a year now, I have been trying, with a passion, to get a direct message across to the citizens of the candidate countries and the Member States, to the effect that we really do want these new Members."
"What I am trying to do, is to breathe life into a process that could easily slip into pure practicalities."
"We want to secure peace and stability throughout Europe."
"We want to give young democracies the chance to participate, on equal terms, in Europe' s political and economic development."
"We want to boost Europe' s role in international competition."
"We have no alternative."
"Since the Prodi Commission took office, the outcome of the enlargement negotiations has been positive."
"The progress reports that the Commission is due to submit in the autumn will reveal that the candidate countries have made an enormous amount of progress and are approaching the stage when they will be ready for accession."
"The Commission is intending to propose new elements for the negotiating strategy in the autumn, which should make it possible to proceed even more rapidly with negotiations and to tackle the key issues that arise at the negotiating table."
"I might point out that it will only be possible to make this kind of headway in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Parliament."
"I would expressly like to thank the European Parliament for its outstanding cooperation and for the unconditional support it has given me, so far at any rate."
"I also warmly commend the European Parliament and its Members for their positive role in the efforts being made to raise awareness of this historic project amongst the people of Europe."
"I have always advocated that we should obtain the broadest possible support amongst the public, and highlight, in a wide-ranging public debate, the major benefits that the accession of new Member States would bring."
"We must convince people that enlargement will be politically and economically advantageous to both sides from the very outset."
"We need to have a wide-ranging , democratic debate on this historic project."
"These were the basic ideas I wanted to bring out in the interview."
"(Applause) The Commission has absolutely no intention - and it was most certainly the very last thing I intended - of introducing any new political conditions into the negotiating process or the decision-making process."
"The strategy has been laid down by the European Council."
"The Commission pursues this strategy with vigour."
"And as President Prodi has already said, it makes perfect sense for the accession treaties to be ratified in the individual Member States in accordance with their respective legal systems."
"Three conclusions can be drawn from this, to my mind."
"Firstly, we must wage a broadly-based communication campaign in the Member States and the candidate countries."
"The Commission has already made the necessary preparations to this end."
"Secondly, we ought not to dismiss any fears or concerns people may have, rather we should talk openly to them and help them...."
"(Applause)... to seize the new opportunities and rise to the new challenges."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the border regions."
"The Commission is working on a programme here too."
"And thirdly, when it comes to issues beset with fears and emotions - and they are there in the enlargement process; take, for example, the issue of immigration - we must proceed with the greatest caution and keep a sense of perspective as far as we possibly can."
"But there are ways and means of solving these problems."
"And these must, and will be, decided on when the time is right, and in the appropriate manner."
"(Applause)"
"Human cloning (continuation)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that every person who is motivated by faith in man, right from the very first moment of his existence, must be guaranteed the unconditional respect which is morally due to the human person in its entirety."
"Therefore, we must state, loud and clear, our opposition to experiments which involve the destruction of human embryos."
"An embryo is already a human person with a very specific identity, and every action which is not intended to benefit the embryo is an act of violence against the right to life."
"Parliament must reiterate what it has declared many times in recent years, including last May."
"It is immoral to use human embryos for research, for those very operations to which the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, has allocated public funding, those operations which have been approved by Tony Blair' s British Government."
"Sadly, it would appear that commercial interests are driving scientists to explore types of research which involve shortcuts and disregard all consideration for the protection of human life, which we consider to start at the moment of conception."
"The human body is not a possession, it is nothing to do with 'having' , it is to do with 'being' , with being a living person, and it cannot therefore be reduced to a machine made up of components and gears, materials and functions."
"What people are trying to achieve is almost an attack on life; it is the opposite of the ethic of love of man and his body, even in that initial stage of being alive, of being in the world, the human world, with that body which is himself."
"To the extent that those who take human embryos and disembowel them, removing the mass of cells inside and extinguishing their life, contrive to say that there is no-one inside, for if there were somebody inside they would be worthy of love or, in a loveless world, they would at least have the right for their human dignity to be respected. Otherwise, the world would consist of violence, brutality and cynicism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to oppose destructive research on embryos is not just to adhere to religious principle, but to uphold a principle of civilisation as well: the absolute ban on one man being master of another which should still be at the very heart of our civilisation."
"We cannot allow man to have such great power over his fellow man."
"But this does not mean that we are against research, quite the contrary."
"Alternative research is possible: research on the stem cells present in adults and on cells removed from the umbilical cord immediately after birth, for example."
"In addition to all this, research is indeed being carried out on adult cells and looks likely to yield results."
"Many research scientists are involved in alternatives to cloning and they are about to form major national research groups to work in this specific area."
"Lastly, we propose that a temporary committee be set up to study these issues."
"We would like there to be in-depth studies of new issues thrown up by the life sciences, on the condition that it is clear that the positions adopted by Parliament cannot be renegotiated."
"It is those positions which the Commission must take as its starting point to assist us in producing well-founded recommendations."
"Mr President, Article 1 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights states that the dignity of the person must be respected and protected."
"Article 3 states that in the cases of medicine and biology, the following principles must be respected: the prohibition of eugenic practices, specifically those that are aimed at human selection; the prohibition of making the human body or any of its parts a source of profit and the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings."
"Such formal statements are not necessarily sufficient."
"Scientific advances are mind-boggling."
"The speed at which scientific research progresses is sometimes difficult for average humans, and even for politicians, to comprehend."
"This rhythm of progress in the techno-sciences, that is, in the marriage of science and technology, raises ethical questions that have major consequences."
"This applies above all to the new mastery of living mechanisms."
"In this respect, the British government' s proposal to refer legislation which seeks to authorise some scientific research into therapeutic cloning, including the human embryo, to the parliament at Westminster has led to all sorts of reactions and comments, both positive and negative."
"Certain political groups in this Parliament are proposing a vote on a supposedly 'urgent' motion for a resolution."
"The Socialists are of the view that such issues are too important for the future of medicine, biology and human society, and because they are so important, this Parliament should carry out a more thorough job than a resolution adopted at top speed."
"This is not the gunfight at the OK Corral: This is not about being the first to draw."
"This morning' s discussions on the monitoring centre for industrial change showed that this Parliament is capable of voting on everything and its opposite in the space of a few minutes."
"The Socialists are unhappy with this type of vote, which looks more like Russian roulette than serious parliamentary work."
"We would like to see a calm discussion of a vital problem, covering the opportunities opened up by genetic engineering and also the lines that cannot be crossed in this field."
"This raft of issues concerns various standing committees in this Parliament."
"This is clearly a cross-sector issue, which deserves to be dealt with by a special temporary committee, which has the task of calling in experts and of holding hearings of opposing views so that we can have an objective debate, which is not skewed in advance by deeply-embedded prejudices."
"I shall end, Mr President, by asking you, by asking all of us, to take this task seriously."
"We are prepared to withdraw our motion for a resolution if the other groups do the same and to try to work constructively together."
"I welcome the Commissioner's statement and particularly its measured and considered nature."
"The ELDR resolution that has been tabled takes the same view."
"We do not want a quick, ill-conceived reaction to events that have taken place in my country and the announcement made by the British Government."
"These are serious matters and reflect our citizens' deep concerns but we should appreciate the full context of the UK announcement, acknowledging the subsidiarity principle to which the Commissioner referred."
"It is only a proposal, not a decision, and it follows a very careful and considered report by the chief medical officer's expert group on cloning."
"The matter has been under consideration for two years - too long, say some commentators, when measured against the lives of people with cancer, Parkinson's disease or organ failure who might be aided by this research."
"The experts' group merely proposes an extension to existing UK rules on the purposes for which embryos can be used in research."
"I emphasise this is an extension to existing rules and controls in this very, very delicate area."
"We must respect the there are deep and genuine public concerns on both sides of this argument and this is what our resolution tries to do."
"The British Government has recognised that in its proposal because it will be the subject of a free vote, possibly later this year."
"I believe, although it is not my party's government, that the British Government has been measured and considered in its response."
"I ask this Parliament to be measured and considered in the way it deals with this important issue."
"Mr President, once again we face a fundamental ethical debate on developments in biotechnology as applied to humans."
"There are two opposing views in play: the first refuses to turn the human being and more specifically the embryo into a tool and is concerned at the potential risks for human society of the widespread use of certain techniques such as cloning."
"The second view considers that the right of those suffering from serious and hitherto incurable illnesses to be able to benefit from the potential of medical research takes precedence over any other consideration."
"The British Government, without any prior consultation with other countries - and I emphasise this point - has apparently opted for the second approach, by declaring itself to be in favour of therapeutic cloning."
"The idea behind this decision is that therapeutic cloning, that is, the cloning of embryonic cells that are undifferentiated from human embryos available for research and production is a promising way forward."
"Even if this idea is well-founded, it is nonetheless true that this option gives human embryos the status of stock cells for medical use and involves the production of embryos, first for research purposes, and then, probably, for production."
"I feel that it is extremely important to make two observations at this point."
"First of all, I would remind you of the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Bio-Medicine, adopted in Oviedo, in April 1997."
"It is probably fair to criticise this convention for its vagueness on a number of points, but in Article 18, it states quite clearly that the production of human embryos for research purposes is prohibited."
"There has been consensus on this point throughout Europe until quite recently, but this consensus has just been broken by the position adopted by the government of the United Kingdom."
"My second observation is that, according to several experts, and as Mr Busquin, Commissioner for Research mentioned earlier, there are other routes open to respond to the legitimate expectations of those who are suffering from serious genetic illnesses. In particular, there are routes that do not require the production of embryos by cloning, but which use adult cells."
"Why then, given this scenario, should we immediately rush into something that is ethically and socially questionable?"
"To conclude, I believe that the knowledge that has been acquired in gene therapy could be promising for humanity, but that they are also full of potential risks and are open to serious abuse."
"We therefore need a rigorous legal framework and clear legal guidelines."
"Upholding the ban on human cloning, rather than establishing it in the first place - I am talking about upholding the ban - is crucial in this respect."
"Our Parliament has the responsibility of restating this, not by rushing into anything, but simply by remaining consistent with our earlier positions."
"Mr President, two hundred years ago, Doctor Cabanis, a philosopher of the Enlightenment, proposed to dare to reconsider and improve on the work of nature."
"His idea was that, having demonstrated such great curiosity about how to make the animal races more beautiful and better, how shameful it was to completely neglect the human race, as if it were more crucial to have big, strong oxen than vigorous and healthy people and to have sweet-smelling peaches rather than wise and good citizens."
"Mr Cabanis' dream is today close to becoming reality."
"His dream has a name: eugenics."
"This dream is in fact a nightmare."
"This nightmare takes on many guises, each one more monstrous than the last, whether it involves prenatal diagnoses, for example, which serve to destroy embryos affected by Down' s syndrome to avoid the trouble of eradicating the disease itself; whether it involves the production of excessive numbers of embryos that pile up in freezers; or whether, finally, it involves the cloning of human beings."
"These embryos are human beings, whose lives are sacred."
"They are people."
"It is our duty to respect their dignity."
"What good are our grandiose declarations on human rights if we then treat human dignity with such scorn, and in the secrecy of our laboratories, at that?"
"There is no doubt at all that the cloning of human beings would mark the birth of a new form of slavery, in which test tubes take the place of chains and laboratories the place of galley-ships."
"Our bleeding hearts will, of course, reproach us for refusing to give scientific research the resources it needs in order to progress and even worse, to cure our illnesses."
"I do not accept this form of intellectual terrorism."
"Furthermore, I am almost inclined to think that in the minds of all these people, research is nothing but an excuse to conduct experiments befitting a sorcerer' s apprentice."
"As the wife of a doctor, I am extremely concerned that such research should be allowed to develop."
"In this respect, it would probably be more appropriate to ask scientists to conduct further research into the possibility of obtaining differentiated stem cells for therapeutic purposes, particularly from adult organs."
"In order to combat those whose dream is to conquer the mystery of life, we have the right to protect the dignity of all human beings by strictly prohibiting the cloning of human beings."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his speech just now, Mr Fiori made things very clear: he stated clearly that this is a matter of likening religious principles - his own - to the principles of civilisation."
"For my part, I believe that what the institutions must affirm is the principle of secularity, and they must confirm that what may seem morally unacceptable to some must not by virtue of this be legally discounted."
"We must make the difference between the law and religious principles clear."
"If we do not observe this principle, then I fear that there will be no hope for us."
"Mr President, to return to the matter in hand, we are aware that, in the face of new ideas - even new ideas which seem promising in terms of treatments for illnesses affecting millions and millions of people - the normal, conventional reaction always kicks in: to ban, to crusade, to shout 'Barbarians!' without even stopping to ask whether the ban can work, whether it would work or whether we are in a position to ensure that it is observed or to monitor it."
"It is the same reaction as that which has been aroused by normal social phenomena for a long time now, in matters of abortion, migration or even drugs."
"We declare a ban and then we wash our hands of the matter."
"It is my opinion, however, that the responsibility of policy-makers - which may be more difficult, more complex - is to regulate certain issues, set limits and avoid situations out of a western."
"This is the mandate of the institutions, independently of the religious consciences of any of their Members, where applicable."
"It is for precisely this reason that we, the Radicals of the Bonino List, feel that we can just about support the compromise of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"We want to try and reduce the gap between science and politics, to endeavour to govern new phenomena secularly together with the pragmatism of experimentation and successive approximations, without immediately launching into prohibitionist campaigns which we already know to be ineffective."
"What we are doing now, exactly as we did in the case of illegal abortion, is merely sparking off, once again, the medical tourism of millions of people who will seek treatment on the black market elsewhere."
"What I am saying is extremely serious and fills me with concern. Watch out: when applied to science and social phenomena, prohibition has never worked."
"I believe that it is our responsibility to set the limits, or take on board the risk of setting the limits, of successive approximations without trying to impose any ethical principles - in the case of those who have any - or principles of civilisation."
"The real civilisation of the institutions is the civilisation of secularity, experimentation and discussion."
"Mr President, I must apologise for my absence earlier."
"I had notified the services that I would be temporarily unavailable."
"Mr President, my group disapproves of the decision taken by the British Government on the cloning of human cells."
"In our view, it does not take account either of European legislation on this matter or of the opinion that the European Union' s ethics committee is in the process of drafting on the consequences of research in cloning."
"We wish to state our support for prohibiting any research into human cloning and we oppose any commercial exploitation of biotechnological inventions that involve cloning."
"Having stated these general positions of principle, the debate is only beginning on the attitude we should adopt towards biotechnological research, both in order to fully weigh up its ethical implications, but without running the risk of slowing down work which is likely to bring about improvements in human health."
"Given the extremely sensitive nature of these issues, which concern civilisation itself, my group does not wish to see resolutions adopted in haste."
"Instead, we have from the outset stated our support for the establishment of a temporary committee on cloning and on biotechnological research so that we can hold the hearings necessary for adopting a position with a full understanding of the issue when the time comes."
"This is why my group has not signed any of the compromise motions for resolutions that have been submitted to us today."
"At this stage, each of us will speak according to his or her conscience about the principles that I have just stated."
"Mr President, in January 1998 we held a debate on the Council of Europe' s Protocol which contained a ban on human cloning."
"I then expressed the fear that countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which refused to sign the protocol at the time, were probably not in favour of imposing an outright ban."
"This is less than two years ago."
"Meanwhile, the British Government would like to permit therapeutic cloning of embryos for research."
"I cannot help thinking that the boundaries are forever being extended."
"Initially, there was a complete ban; now cloning is allowed on a therapeutic basis but not for reproductive purposes."
"As if this would explain and justify everything."
"What then is the big difference between therapeutic and reproductive cloning of human embryos?"
"And what do we do if we are put under pressure soon to apply the research findings in the pharmaceutical field, or to clone for reproductive purposes?"
"As far as I am concerned, every new human being is a gift of God."
"Any form of human life should be treated with respect."
"This is also the only way to safeguard human dignity."
"The treatment of the human embryo as a consumer article, supposedly justified by the argument that this is in the name of research, fills me with disgust, especially because there are other ways of cloning stem cells."
"I do wonder why this option is taken, despite all the ethical concerns which exist worldwide."
"I would urgently call on the British Government to reconsider its far-reaching decision and would ask the British Parliament not to back this proposal."
"Mr President, a proud man wants to play God."
"He refuses to acknowledge that he is only a creature."
"He wants to be the creator."
"The issue before us today is a battle between creation and man's discoveries."
"There are scientists so arrogant today that they are already patenting their discoveries, as if they had stumbled upon their own creation."
"Dr William Hesseltine, the chief executive of Human Gene Sciences Inc., has already patented 100 human genes and his company has submitted applications for 8000."
"They argue that human cloning is about the promotion of health."
"I am arguing today that human cloning is about the wealth of certain scientists and their companies."
"Some scientists have taken the lunacy of Hitler's fascism from the battlefield and are prepared to validate it in the laboratory."
"Parliament needs to reject this and as a member of the British Parliament I will be voting against it in my own Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group was dismayed to hear of the British Government' s plans with regard to the cloning of human embryos."
"Hitherto, all those in positions of responsibility within the European Union were agreed that the cloning of human beings should be rejected out of hand."
"During the fifth research framework programme, the Council - inclusive of the British Government - voted unanimously in favour of a form of words that rules out cloning, as well as so-called therapeutic cloning."
"Parliament and the Council voted in favour of a text for the Directive on the patenting of biotechnological discoveries that completely rules out cloning of human beings, because this type of technology offends common decency and is an affront to law and order."
"Commissioner, over the past few days, a number of articles in the press, as well as your speech, have given rise to some confusion regarding the fifth research framework programme, and especially concerning the Patenting Directive."
"The impression has been given that only reproductive cloning is banned."
"This is completely wrong."
"I was involved in the careful drafting of both texts, and both directives rule out therapeutic as well as reproductive cloning."
"Take a close look at the documents, Commissioner, and clarify matters, or else you will have the European Parliament to deal with."
"And I do not think that is something you would want."
"Now this consensus between the States of the European Union and the institutions has been disrupted by the government of one Member State."
"We as a Parliament must withstand this attempt to shatter taboos."
"But it is not just a case of making our feelings known, we must also ensure that action be taken as a result."
"Hence the PPE-DE Group has called for a strict ban on the cloning of human beings at all stages of their development to be incorporated into the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Finally, I urge the Commission to ensure that there is strict compliance with the fifth research framework programme' s call for no support to be provided for any form of human cloning."
"This also means boycotting the cross-subsidisation provided by research institutes in Great Britain."
"The best way to achieve this would be to ensure that those institutions involved in the cloning of human beings no longer receive any financial support whatsoever from the European Union."
"Mr President, you should listen to the Commissioner!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt whatsoever that biotechnology and genetic engineering are highly significant fields these days."
"They will continue to gain in importance in research, and in terms of their many applications."
"No one doubts that either."
"But is this difficult field, with all the hopes and fears it brings, being handled in a manner that is beyond reproach?"
"I suspect not."
"Today' s debate is positive proof of this suspicion."
"As a Parliament, we are reacting too hastily to a legislative proposal in a Member State of the European Union, which caused consternation amongst the public a few days ago."
"And what form has this reaction taken?"
"A quick glance at draft resolutions on the table reveals that all Parliament has been able to do, in its haste, has been to reiterate its already frequently expressed stance on critical fields of research and the application of biotechnology and genetic engineering."
"That is all very well, but it is not enough!"
"We must make biotechnology and genetic engineering, but above all bioethics, one of the European Parliament' s key concerns."
"I am not alone in calling for this; I have the backing of my group."
"The people of Europe want to see more foresighted commitment from us in this area."
"We cannot afford to be overtaken by events any longer."
"We must no longer be in the position where - huffing and puffing to catch up - we find ourselves commenting on developments that are already at an advanced stage."
"The European Parliament must point the way, so that biotechnology and genetic engineering develop for the benefit of mankind, rather than being to its detriment owing to the transgression of ethical boundaries."
"Therefore we should vote overwhelmingly to adopt the proposed committee, which will form the basis for far-sighted legislation."
"We must be aware that biotechnology is bound up with what is presumed to be the greatest revolution in medicine and technology."
"This revolution must not be attended by irresponsibly conceived legislation."
"We must appoint the best experts to advise the Council and ensure that there is consistency in the legislation across the Member States."
"The ethical issues and the need to protect human dignity, in particular, are so important that we cannot afford to leave them at the mercy of fragmented, possibly even contradictory pieces of legislation introduced by individual Member States."
"We must get to grips with all the ethical issues raised by medicine, technology and science, as a matter of urgency."
"The appropriate parliamentary committee must therefore get down to work as quickly as possible."
"Our vote will set this in train."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, biotechnology is currently one of the most promising technologies which can bring about a breakthrough in the medical world."
"Putting an end to cloning techniques in Europe will only shift research elsewhere, for example to the United States or, in the worst case, to countries whose ethical standards are worse than those in the European Union."
"As a result, expertise, research activities and employment will drain away to overseas countries."
"Furthermore, the products will end up back on the market in the European Union anyway."
"What is this really about?"
"Who are we to deny people the right to recovery?"
"Would it not be too easy to ban promising technology with great potential on ethical grounds?"
"Is not every person entitled to health and welfare?"
"Who has the right to put the label of ethics on it?"
"I can tell you that I, along with the Liberal Group, will be giving this resolution my wholehearted support."
"Mr President, we have the awful situation where one EU Member State permits therapeutic cloning, which we have always been critical of."
"The people of the European Union are expecting the European Parliament to take a stance on this."
"I think it would be irresponsible if we were draw a veil over the issue by saying: 'just to pacify you, we will set up an interminable debating society, or a temporary committee.'"
"We must take a stance on this decision, which is to be taken in the course of the next few weeks - yes as soon as that- without further ado, and then of course we must state our position on the issues we can expect to deal with in the future."
"But on no account must we gloss over this by failing to make our feelings known and by trying to conceal things in committees, which will disconcert the public."
"I believe that what is happening now is of crucial importance."
"If we accept therapeutic cloning, then we will be opening Pandora' s box. It would bring the nightmare scenario of cloned and made-to-measure human beings that much closer."
"The arbitrary distinction between reproductive and non-reproductive cloning is semantic sleight of hand."
"The term 'therapeutic cloning' is equally problematic, because there is no question of it being a therapy."
"Cloning, including therapeutic cloning, is the first step along the way to human beings being regarded merely as biological material."
"It is indefensible to deliberately - I repeat, deliberately - create life in order to use it as research material."
"This conflicts with human rights."
"We are also dividing up the concept of human dignity when we deliberately produce embryos in order to have a ready supply of spare parts."
"That is why Parliament must use its power to act."
"Commissioner for Research, I am also expecting you to make an unequivocal statement today, on how you propose to proceed when a Member State disregards the resolutions of Parliament and the Council."
"We need a clear signal, and I feel it would be a sad day for politics if we were to cast aside all our ethical misgivings out of loyalty to Blair."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that human cloning which seeks to reproduce a human being similar to another with the sole purpose of improving it must be clearly prohibited."
"This has always been this Parliament' s position and I think it is useful to restate this."
"Today, however, we are discussing the use of cloning techniques for therapeutic purposes and this has many implications."
"These implications are, in themselves, medical."
"We must make the distinction between therapeutic cloning, which must be clearly differentiated from reproductive cloning."
"Cell therapy today represents great hope for many patients suffering from genetic or degenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s and cancer."
"There are also ethical and philosophical implications."
"What status does the embryo have?"
"In order to answer this question, we might refer to the many debates that we have had on abortion or on in-vitro fertilisation."
"What is the status of unwanted embryos, produced by in-vitro fertilisation and condemned to be destroyed?"
"Could they not provide new life?"
"There are economic and social implications."
"This debate concerns the whole of society."
"What is the American or Japanese point of view on these issues?"
"Europe must take a global view and take account of the potential for research offered by therapeutic cloning."
"There must be an in-depth debate."
"You have called for one and we agree."
"Perhaps it would be useful to define in advance what is prohibited and to produce a strict framework for acceptable practice."
"Safeguards are crucial."
"These issues are viewed differently from one country to another, according to their culture."
"This is why the European Union' s action in this field must be guided by major fundamental principles alone."
"These principles exist and are: respect for the person, respect for life and for freedom but also for progress that will benefit everyone."
"Mr President, cloning and patentability are and must remain illegal wherever human beings are concerned."
"There is no difference between cloning for therapeutic purposes and cloning for reproductive purposes."
"The end cannot justify the means when human dignity is at stake, for human dignity must be respected above all things."
"The use of human embryos to produce organs can therefore in no way be justified."
"In fact, when an embryo is used in this way a potential human being is eliminated, which clearly contradicts the value attached to the declared goal of saving other human lives."
"It would certainly be a different matter if mere stem cells were to be used rather than embryos."
"In our opinion, it is ethically wrong to attempt to alter the nature of the fundamental rules of the origins of life."
"We must stop and reflect on the possible implications of upsetting the laws of nature."
"The precautionary principle must be invoked and applied to the possibility of cloning for therapeutic purposes."
"Indeed, it is no coincidence that the 1998-2002 fifth research and technological development framework programme excludes the financing of projects which involve the cloning of embryos for reproductive purposes and does not provide for funding research into cloning for therapeutic purposes."
"In respect for the differences of opinion on the matter, we feel that it is vital to lay down ethical standards based on respect for human dignity in the biotechnology sector."
"We call upon the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies to take the risks of going beyond certain limits into due consideration, for once these limits have been passed anything appears legitimate if human dignity is not respected."
"I hope that, as President Prodi maintains, Europeans will be able to unite on the basis of common values."
"To this end, the Commission must facilitate an open debate aimed at finding the right balance between ethical inflexibility based on the refusal to exploit the human body for commercial ends and the obligation to meet the need for medical treatment."
"We call upon the Council to take up the initiative of organising an international convention on the use of live tissue to prevent human embryos being marketed and used for unnatural purposes."
"It is important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not create another species of human being in the same way that we appear to be provoking natural and environmental disasters."
"Mr President, it is a pity that none of the British delegates who support the government' s stance have taken the floor."
"It would have been interesting to hear their arguments too, because I am quite sure that they must have had a few thoughts on the matter ."
"In Great Britain, it has been permissible, since 1990, to experiment on embryos up to fourteen days old."
"I believe this is the next logical step."
"Why does Great Britain behave differently to the continent?"
"That is certainly an interesting question."
"The difference obviously does not depend on which government is in power."
"It was a Conservative Government before, and now they have a Labour Government, and yet nothing has changed."
"Why is public opinion in Great Britain unlike that on the other side of the Channel?"
"It would be entirely appropriate to discuss this kind of issue during this debate, because we have the privilege of being in the company of delegates from the four corners of the European Union."
"That was the first comment I wanted to make."
"Secondly, I wanted to say how impressed I was with Mrs Bonino' s comments."
"It really struck a chord with me."
"I too would advocate that we should allow ourselves to be guided by the laity in matters of principle."
"The State is not religious, but it has a duty to respect religion."
"I too have respect for whether someone is Catholic, Evangelical, Jewish or whatever."
"But I also want my opinion to be respected."
"However this is only possible within a lay context."
"Claims of infallibility have already done Europe untold damage."
"We should endeavour to leave this behind."
"No one has a monopoly on ethics."
"People who see things differently are ethical too."
"Incidentally, we have seen time and again how bans are watered down in practice."
"Everyone could cite examples of this."
"That is why I am firmly convinced - whatever we decide here - that in a cosmopolitan society performing research from a variety of perspectives, knowledge will out."
"At the end of the day, we will have no choice but to deal with this knowledge in a responsible manner by trying to circumscribe it."
"Mr Wurtz, a ban on any type of research may be called for, but it would be extraordinarily naïve to believe that this ban would be observed."
"In the final reckoning, we will have no choice but to lay down boundaries."
"I feel as many other people do about this issue."
"The thought of embryos being meddled with and experimented on makes my hair stand on end."
"There are certainly boundaries."
"But practical experience has shown me that at the end of the day, it will probably not be possible to do a great deal more than simply circumscribe everything."
"There is no need for us to take action at present."
"We still have time."
"We need to think very carefully about how we are going to proceed in this matter."
"We have committees for this purpose, and sometimes reading a good book has its uses."
"An important European value that we all, whether lay or religious, purport to share is that any experimentation on a human being should only be for their exclusive and direct benefit."
"We depart from that principle at our peril and here we clearly have departed from it."
"We cannot experiment on human beings at any stage of their development and we certainly cannot mass-produce embryos for experimentation."
"The next stage will be commercial exploitation, which our own bio-patenting directive allows for."
"The UK authorities argue that in spite of ethical doubts the cloning of human embryos is necessary because it is the only way to help patients suffering from various diseases."
"Many scientists dispute this and recommend more research with adult stem cells to achieve the same results in curing diseases."
"Can we not get together and find a way of dealing with stem research without experimenting directly on human beings?"
"I hope this House agrees that this is a value that Europe was built on."
"This is an emotive subject, not least because of the title 'Human cloning'."
"Stem cell research would be a less tendentious title. But my purpose is to ask for calm reflection and consideration of the facts and the implications for us the human race, for our health and well-being, for the future of science and the health industry in Europe and, by no means least, for our spiritual well-being."
"So let us get some facts straight."
"Fact: human reproductive cloning is banned in the UK."
"There is no intention to change this and the UK industry has no intention of carrying out human reproductive cloning now or in the future."
"The research use of embryonic stem cells is a short-term response to a scientific need to discover ways of reprogramming adult cells."
"Fact: stem cell research is tightly regulated under a stringent act of Parliament by the highly respected and rigorous Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority."
"It would perhaps be a good idea if other Member States were to have something similar."
"Fact: there have recently been interesting advances in adult stem cell research, but there still remain significant disadvantages compared with the unique characteristics of embryonic stem cells."
"The aim of research in embryonic stem cells is to find ways of using adult stem cells which overcome these disadvantages."
"So we come down to the basic dilemma. Is an embryo up to 14 days old a living being with the full rights of a living person or of a foetus?"
"Rightly or wrongly, the UK and the US legislation have permitted this type of research for ten years and many benefits have resulted."
"And after consulting world-wide for many months the Donaldson report recommends extending such research for therapeutic purposes."
"The choice is yours, colleagues."
"You have to be true to your conscience and your faith but also consider the future well-being of your neighbour."
"Caring for your neighbour is also a Christian enjoinder."
"He may have Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or diabetes."
"Mr President, this is a serious and complex subject, which has been brought to the fore by the British decision."
"It should also be pointed out that national legislation on this issue varies enormously, which can lead to uncontrolled practices, but these practices, as Mrs Grossetête said just now, may make us question the value some countries place on the reality of the principle of respect for human life from the embryonic stage, stated in Article 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which forbids the production of embryos for human purposes."
"The difference between provisions shows how complex the debate is and raises several questions that merge into one another."
"What does respect for life mean?"
"What does the pre-embryo mean in relation to the embryo?"
"Do we have the right to authorise research into the embryo for therapeutic purposes?"
"Where do the stem cells come from?"
"Should embryos be cloned?"
"Do stem cells come from foetal tissue as well as from adult tissue?"
"Do we have the right to create embryos for any purposes other than for life itself?"
"In the face of serious illnesses, which are currently incurable, do we have the right to prevent research being carried out, which we are told may bring hope?"
"All of these questions are laden with consequences and concern the meaning of life itself."
"This is why we must have dialogue, especially within the European bodies, and I regret the fact, Commissioner, that President Prodi gave a sneak preview of his interventions on Monday to the press before he shared them with the European Parliament."
"I must say that his comments were very cautious and carefully measured on this issue."
"Secondly, I think that in order to hold this debate, Parliament should create an ad hoc Parliamentary committee which, could, in the first instance, quickly take the initiative of hearing experts from all disciplines, both from Europe and from across the Atlantic."
"This debate must also, however, be held in the public domain."
"That is why I propose that European 'assises' for bioethics be launched and there should finally be a provision which allows us to frame practices in this area at a time when we are pointlessly establishing monitoring centres."
"I propose that a European Agency for reproductive and biotechnological medicine be created."
". (FR) Mr President, I feel that I should respond, because Mr Liese asked a specific question during the debate."
"His question concerned the fifth framework-programme."
"On this issue, it is quite clear, as Mr Liese surely knows, as it is clearly stated in the fifth framework-programme, since it is subject to a codecision procedure, that research involving cloning techniques for reproductive and therapeutic purposes are quite explicitly excluded."
"As a result, in the framework-programme, this is clearly completely excluded at the moment."
"I simply wanted to clarify this point, Mr Liese, since you asked the question."
"With regard to the debate, on the other hand, as I said in my introductory speech, the Commission would like to enter into a debate with Parliament on these issues which are, as we have seen, very complex and very interesting."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0535/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.First part"
"Question No 41 by (H-0613/00):"
"Subject: Cooperation with drug counselling networks Cooperation between the Commission and the networks it promotes has deteriorated significantly since 1998: contracts between the networks and the Commission are often not concluded until the projects have already been under way for months."
"The Commission nevertheless insists that the projects should begin on the strength of nothing more than a provisional written notification."
"Payment of instalments by the Commission is sometimes delayed for years."
"All the networks are affected by the ever-growing bureaucratic burden and, above all, by the Commission's failure to make repayments, and are very much hampered in their work."
"Some associations have even had to close down because of delays in payment by the Commission."
"Why has the Commission not succeeded in recent years in providing the networks it supports with contracts and instalment payments rapidly and in parallel with projects?"
"The Commission shares the concerns of the honourable Member about the problems relating to contracts and payments for the drug prevention networks subsidised by the Community action programme on prevention of drug dependence."
"These problems have several causes."
"Firstly, it is clear that there has been a human resources problem in the Public Health Directorate in Luxembourg, which deals with this work."
"In short, the staff complement has been insufficient to deal with complex procedures and often inexperienced beneficiaries proposing too many small projects."
"This situation was aggravated last summer when a decision was taken in the light of the report of the Committee of Independent Experts to end the contract with the technical assistance office which helped in the implementation of this programme."
"Secondly, a large number of small projects are implemented under the anti-drugs programme, placing additional strain on the already limited human resources at our disposal."
"During the last five years, the average size of projects in terms of co-financing granted by the Commission has been EUR 180,000."
"Thirdly, experience shows that participants in the network have had little understanding of the Commission's contract and payment procedures."
"In many cases, therefore, the Commission has had to make repeated requests to the drug prevention networks for missing documentation needed to finalise contracts or produce payments."
"Fourthly, in the light of experience with subsidies from the Community budget and the criticisms of the Court of Auditors, greater rigour may have been brought to bear on the documentation relating to contract costs, resulting in knock-on effects on the timing of payments."
"In responding to these problems, I am taking a number of steps."
"The Commission's proposal for a new public health framework and strategy highlights the need for clearer objectives and more efficient management with a greater impact on key priorities."
"Therefore, fewer but bigger projects will be co-financed in future, making for more efficient use of the human resources needed to manage implementation of the programme."
"As the budgetary authority repeatedly stresses, we must match resources and priorities more realistically in the future."
"In addition, as you are aware, following the Commission's recent review of its staffing needs, a request for additional posts is being put forward to the budgetary authority, including a significant increase in posts for the health and consumer protection DG."
"If the budgetary authority agrees, a number of these posts could be allocated to tackle the kind of problems which we are discussing today."
"The inexperience of contractors regarding financial control requirements will continue to necessitate significant advice and other inputs from already limited staff resources."
"The Public Health Directorate intends to carry out an information campaign to help contractors to understand the Commission's procedures and requirements more clearly."
"On the issue of red tape, the departments concerned are currently reviewing their documentary requirements with the aim of simplifying and speeding up payment procedures without neglecting the necessary financial control measures."
"As a result of the measures already taken, the situation has been improving, and I expect it to improve further so that contracts can be agreed more quickly and payments made in accordance with the Commission's 60-day rule."
"Should you have any specific points to make, perhaps you could provide me with the relevant information in writing, and I will certainly raise them with my staff."
"Commissioner, I am pleased to hear that certain measures are to be taken."
"Nevertheless, I call into question the fact that when the Commission encounters problems with the partners participating in particular projects, it attributes at least half of these problems to the partners themselves."
"I have information to the effect that even small project partners are in full possession of the facts about the contracts and know exactly what they have to submit."
"I have had a case described to me where the same paperwork was submitted on three separate occasions, but the Commission still maintained that it had never received this paperwork."
"I therefore wish to put in another request for the application procedure to be attended by extremely clear guidelines laid down in advance."
"I have encountered problems of this kind before, not just in the drugs sphere, but with many other partners that work with the Commission and seek co-financing."
"It is not only in the drugs sphere where the application procedure takes such a long time and is so complex, and I believe the problem does not lie wholly with incompetent, small project partners, but can also be put down to the fact that the requirements set by the Commission are not clearly formulated."
"The question remains as to whether we really want to cut back on the small organisations within the European Union, when it is important to support drugs projects - including those in the regions - using a whole range of approaches, specifically in this area, but also in general."
"I believe it would not be in our interests to only give large organisations a chance to move things forward in this sphere, rather our aim must continue to be that of promoting a variety of organisational structures."
"That would be a wholly misguided attempt at a solution to my mind."
". In relation to the first issue raised, I do not suggest that the problem lies wholly with, as you say, incompetent project partners."
"What I am saying is that is the reason for some of the problems that have arisen."
"It is something I am concerned about and am seeking to address by making sure that there are clear guidelines, as you suggest, so you and I are fully in agreement on that point."
"With regard to the size of projects, since 1996 a total of 149 projects have been selected for over EUR 25 million, with an average amount of EUR 180 000 per project."
"Under the new health strategy we will reduce the number of projects and increase their value and impact, thereby using our limited human resources more effectively."
"It does not always follow that smaller projects are better than bigger projects, but if human resources are applied efficiently it will be for the betterment of the projects concerned."
"Question No 42 by (H-0629/00):"
"Subject: Scientific advice concerning phthalates Will the Commission now release the statement agreed on 25 November 1999 by the CSTEE (Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment) on that committee' s view of the misinterpretation by the Commission of the scientific advice on the subject of phthalates, the statement being referred to in the minutes of the Scientific Steering Committee' s meeting of 10 December 1999?"
"Will it indicate who in the Commission is responsible for this failure to follow accepted practice on the publication of all minutes, reports and agreed statements by scientific committees, and will it indicate who was responsible for delaying the publication of the main minutes of the CSTEE meeting of 25 November 1999 until April 2000?"
"Thank you for giving the opportunity to clarify the issue that is the subject of your question."
"As referred to in the minutes of the plenary meeting of the Scientific Steering Committee of 10 December 1999 the chairman of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment informed the SSC about the SCTEE's intention at its plenary meeting of 25 November 1999 to attach a statement to the minutes of the meeting, clarifying the interpretation of its opinion on phthalates in toys."
"The minutes of the meeting under discussion would normally have been adopted at the occasion of the next SCTEE plenary meeting which took place on 4 February 2000."
"However, at that plenary meeting several committee members considered that the minutes were in general too long and requested the secretariat to follow the format of other scientific committees."
"Following this request the committee decided to postpone the adoption of the minutes to the next plenary when the draft of a more succinct version would be available."
"This inevitably delayed the process of adoption until the subsequent plenary meeting held on 11 April 2000."
"Once approved its content was immediately made public on the Internet - in the course of that very week in fact, as is the usual Commission practice."
"There has accordingly been no failure in publishing the minutes."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for his reply although I have to say that five months is a long time to wait for minutes."
"What I say now is no reflection at all on the Commissioner himself, but I hope that he would accept with me that science must inform our decisions on risk and how to manage it."
"In this case the science was less than adequate."
"It was not validated by peer review and so on. So when it came to the Science Committee and the chairman's views it was significant that his advice - in his words - did not justify a banning action."
"The resulting ban on other phthalates had nothing whatsoever to do with children's toys or teething rings."
"This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle."
"That principle only holds good if the decisions are scientifically irreproachable."
"It was not a happy experience and I hope the Commission would agree that both the Commission and Parliament have a lot to learn from this experience."
"I fully agree with the honourable Member when he says that science must inform our decisions and that is what happened in this instance."
"The relevant committee produced its report, as it is required to do in its area of responsibility which is of course risk assessment."
"That information was passed on to the Commission, since it is one of the EU institutions responsible for risk management."
"The Commission took the view, having regard to the advice contained in the documents sent by the relevant committee, that phthalates or toys designed to be placed in the mouth posed an immediate and significant risk to babies under the age of three."
"The Commission made a clear assessment of this issue."
"I submitted emergency proposals to the Commission as I am entitled to do under the General Product Safety Directive and my colleagues agreed that this was the appropriate to action to take in the circumstances."
"My colleague, Commissioner Liikanen, has adopted a more long-term approach to the whole issue of phthalates and placticisers in toys and so on. I wish to say once again that I agree that science must inform our decisions, and that, in my view, is what happened in this instance."
"As the author is not present, Question No 43 lapses."
"Question No 44 by (H-0688/00):"
"Subject: Water needs in the Middle East The constantly increasing demand for water in the Middle East is set to play a significant part in relation to the outlook for cooperation and understanding among the peoples of the region."
"After a three-year break, the Steering Committee of the Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources (MWGWR) for the region began work again in 1999 and adopted specific programmes on the saving and use of water resources in the Middle East, with EU funding."
"The issue of water in the Middle East was also discussed in the context of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and the Israeli side has also raised the subject of further funding for such programmes."
"What policy will the Commission pursue on this matter, with a view to promoting cooperation among the peoples of the region and averting conflicts arising from water needs?"
"Water will be a crucial issue for the Middle East in the coming decades."
"The region has the lowest per capita availability of water anywhere in the world and it is steadily decreasing."
"Water is indeed one of the main issues of the Middle East peace process, not only in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians but also between Israel and Syria."
"The Commission's policy focuses on the various dimensions of the water question in the Middle East, the security as well as the economic, environmental and social dimensions."
"Just and comprehensive water agreements between Israel and its neighbours, sustained by effective regional cooperation, are necessary for lasting peace in the region."
"The Commission is an active participant in, and a main donor to, the multilateral water working group of the MEPP."
"As a concrete contribution we have committed another EUR 4 million in 1999 for the completion of the regional water data banks."
"We also promote the concept of a regional cooperation structure."
"The Council's special taskforce on water in the Middle East has met with the Israeli, Jordanian and the Palestinian water commissioners and is actively coordinating EU water policy."
"The Commission's policy aims at helping the region to achieve a sustainable management of the scarce water resources in combination with assistance to explore new resources."
"Current water management and consumption in the Middle East cannot be sustained."
"Estimates suggest that in the overall Mediterranean region agriculture absorbs over two thirds of total national water consumption, while accounting for only one third of GNP and labour."
"This discrepancy is even sharper in the Middle East."
"Therefore assisting reform of domestic water policies in the countries of the Middle East is a priority."
"Indeed the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Stuttgart in 1999 decided to make water a priority for the partnership."
"As a first result the EUR 40 million action plan adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference on local water management in Turin in October 1999 would provide a further opportunity for cooperation in this sector."
"A call for proposals will be published soon."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer."
"In addition to highlighting the seriousness of the problem and its effect on the Middle East peace process, my question was aimed at regarding the lack of water resources as a serious political issue."
"We all talk about the impending crises over water shortages."
"Something must be done."
"Commissioner, what initiatives are you going to take to formulate rules of international law in the management of water resources so as to eliminate any hotbeds of local and regional political antagonism, seeds of crises and a peculiar type of imperialism?"
"Your answer to the Israel - Syria question should go somewhat beyond; to the Tigris and to the Euphrates, to Turkey and to Syria and elsewhere."
"I believe that rules of international law must be established to manage water resources. These rules must contain clear conditions for all the countries involved, through which rivers that cross more than one country flow."
"This must also apply to lakes that belong to more than one country."
"The Commission is supporting crucial water projects in the Palestinian authority and in Jordan through MEDA."
"The most recent example is Community support of EUR 5 million in grants for the project management of the Greater Amman water sector improvement programme, plus a substantial loan from the European Investment Bank."
"Apart from the support we give to the multilateral water working group, I can mention the Euro-Mediterranean water information system three-year action programme."
"The European Commission contributed EUR 1.2 million towards its implementation."
"The Euro-Mediterranean conference on water management in Marseilles on 25 and 26 of November 1996 was organised on the initiative of the European Commission and the French Government, with the support of the city of Marseilles."
"The International Office for Water took charge of the secretariat."
"So the Commission is constantly involved in this project, has been for some time and continues to be."
"Question No 45 by (H-0689/00):"
"Subject: Transport of animals In the year 2000 television documentaries are still being broadcast in the Member States which clearly show that live animals are being transported on EU territory in breach of the provisions of the directive on animal transport and in disregard of all ethical principles."
"How does the Commission intend to ensure that the Member State authorities monitor shipments of animals and scrutinise routes between Member States?"
"When will the Commission put forward revised proposals for directives to govern the transport of live animals?"
"What view does the Commission take of the fact that in those Member States in which shipments are carried out properly costs are higher than in those which repeatedly breach the relevant rules, even though the EU has a single market in foodstuffs?"
"What steps is the Commission taking to halt shipments over long distances as a general rule and replace them with shipments of frozen and processed products?"
"Second part"
"I agree that it is a matter for concern that rules on the transport of animals are not being sufficiently enforced in certain areas."
"While Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation, the Food and Veterinary Office of my Directorate-General undertakes specific control and inspection missions to check that Member States apply Community legislation in an effective and a uniform manner."
"These checks have revealed certain shortcomings in the compliance of some Member States with the Community legislation."
"As a result, infringement proceedings based on Article 226 of the Treaty have been opened against certain Member States and others are under evaluation."
"I will shortly present a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during the last quarter of this year."
"The report will show that Member States currently have difficulties in fully implementing Community legislation."
"As the conclusion to the report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals, address the difficulties I have referred to, ensure inspection by the FVO and provide for infringement proceedings if appropriate."
"As soon as possible, several basic issues of the directive should be evaluated on a scientific basis, notably data concerning travelling times, stress related to loading and unloading operations and loading densities."
"In this framework, measures to encourage the slaughter of animals closer to the places where they are raised also merit examination."
"I conclude by assuring you that animal welfare is very high on the agenda of the Commission."
"I look forward to further discussion when I present the report on transport in the next few weeks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply, but I would like to say very briefly that, now, as the EU is enlarging to the east in accordance with a very tight timetable, and they have been transporting horses from the Baltic countries, among others, into the EU area on journeys of up to a hundred hours long, I think it is quite odd that at the same time we are calling on applicant countries to adhere very closely to the guidelines and legal provisions."
"In our own territory, however, we allow such violations that - as has been seen in public - are simply inhumane, considering we are supposed to be a civilised western Europe."
"I would like to highlight this and ask what sort of timetable is now in place for real action, taking into account the fact that we have to put our own house in order before new Member States join the EU?"
"Although I cannot give you a specific timetable, I do assure you that infringement proceedings have already been opened and others are now being evaluated."
"The situation is under constant review, I have had a number of discussions with the Director-General of my DG, who is an expert on transport, and I am drawing on his expertise."
"You also draw attention to our relationship with the applicant countries."
"The Commission believes that the most effective way to achieve a widespread improvement in animal welfare standards is to work towards an international consensus."
"The long-distance transport of horses has been discussed with heads of veterinary services in the central and east European countries currently negotiating accession to the Union."
"A protocol of action to improve the protection of the horses and donkeys transported over long distances was agreed in April."
"The first results of the implementation of the protocol will be discussed at a specific meeting with all the competent authorities of the accession countries at the end of September this year."
"So I can give an assurance that this issue is high on the list of priorities in my service and we will be monitoring it closely and pursuing it actively."
"Mr President, it would be interesting to know if the Commission is intending to have research carried out in this field, based on the best practice model."
"Are you intending to create incentives, with a view to ensuring that live transport is carried out in such a way that is actually tolerable for the animals concerned?"
"I am satisfied from the advice that I get from my service and the other information that is made available to me that any measures that are necessary are being taken."
"On that basis, the directive is being amended to improve the protection of animals during transport, providing in particular for additional measures to protect the horses with a mandatory unloading and fixed resting period for commercial consignments of horses passing through a border inspection post of the Union."
"I should like to ask a related question regarding the banning of Staffordshire terriers in Germany under their dangerous dogs law."
"Many of my constituents in the United Kingdom are writing to protest against this German law banning certain breeds of dogs which appear to pose no threat to public safety."
"Given the pets' passport project at European level and a right for pets now to move freely within the European Union as a result, does the Commission have any legal competence to intervene and protect animal welfare and, in particular, these domestic pets in Germany, of which there will be a needless slaughter potentially and possibly even extinction of a fine breed of British dogs?"
"Commissioner, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, this is not a supplementary question."
"We could invite Mr Tannock to ask this question during the next part-session, but if you wish to reply to it, you may do so."
"As a matter of courtesy to the honourable Member I would say that had you given me notice of this question I would probably have been in a better position to give you a comprehensive answer to it."
"I am the Commissioner responsible for animal welfare. There is a competence to deal with these issues relating to animal welfare."
"If such issues are brought to my attention and come within the relevant directive, then action can be taken."
"The only practical suggestion that I can make to you is that if you would like to write to me and give me specific details of the issue that you have raised I will have my services examine it and deal with it."
"Mr Tannock, you may express your opinion in writing on a bilateral basis or you may do it in public in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, and the Commissioner will reply."
"Thank you very much, Mr Byrne, for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon."
"Questions to Mr Vitorino"
"Question No 46 by (H-0600/00):"
"Subject: Communication on children's rights Following the Commission's statement to Parliament to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in November 1999 when it indicated that it would be publishing a Communication on children's rights, can the Commission now give Parliament a definite timetable for the publication of the Communication?"
"Given that the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session (UNGASS) on children will take place in September 2000, what is the Commission's plan for coordinating EU and Member State input to the Special Session?"
"Is the Commission prepared to acknowledge that, in view of the special session, a Communication on children's rights is of the utmost importance?"
"I would refer the honourable Member to the letter dated 20 June which she and a number of her colleagues received from President Prodi on this very subject."
"In his letter the President made absolutely clear the Commission's commitment to all measures which safeguard children's rights and mention a number of areas both external and internal where the Commission was active on these highly important matters."
"However, the President also sought to situate the Commission's action in these areas, as in others, in the context of the Treaties' revision."
"He acknowledged that competence for action concerning children remains primarily with the Member States given the lack of a clear legal basis in the Treaty for the Community to safeguard children's rights in terms that go beyond the existing framework."
"In the current framework the European Commission has already undertaken a considerable number of initiatives to protect children's rights as in the Daphne and Stop programmes which fall under my competence."
"The Commission is also pursuing action in the social and educational field with a view to improving the situation of children."
"Further evidence of the importance we attach to this subject can be found in the fact that it was the Commission which undertook the initiative to include a specific article on children's rights into the charter of fundamental rights."
"The draft article concerning the protection of children incorporates the main principles of the New York Convention as the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being and consideration."
"We will continue to insist that the charter foresees the prohibition of the employment of children."
"In his letter the President also expressed the view that it could indeed be useful for the Commission to evaluate if all Member States have pursued the content of UN Convention on the rights of the child."
"Although all the Member States have ratified the Convention, its implementation varies widely and the views of the Member States on how to best protect children's rights diverge to a considerable extent."
"It is my conviction that such an evaluation might represent a useful contribution for the participation of the Union in the special session of the United Nations general assembly in September 2001."
"The Commission believes that its ongoing actions in favour of children, its active advocacy for an appropriate inclusion in the charter of fundamental rights and its support for this idea of having an evaluation as described represents evidence of its commitment to this important subject."
"As you know, I am a great admirer of yours and I am sure that you were as uncomfortable repeating your answer today as I was hearing it."
"I know of your own personal commitment but actually you have not given me any clear indication of what the Commission is actually going to do in the UN conference which is taking place in a couple of weeks time."
"Having listened to the extent of plans that the Commission has in relation to animal welfare, I can only wish that they had similar plans in relation to the welfare of children."
"Accepting the legal limits within which you have to work, could you in fact give me any indication that anybody from the Commission for example is going to be present at this United Nations conference in September?"
"In what context and are they proposing to make any input into the conference?"
"I will answer with pleasure."
"As a matter of fact, we are both talking about the same thing, which is the United Nations Special Meeting of the General Assembly on Children's Rights in September 2001 next year."
"Since we are talking about that my approach is that we should have a study to evaluate how the United Nations Convention on Children's Rights has been implemented in our Member States."
"This study should be completed in time to be used as basis for the Union's participation in the United Nations Special General Assembly next year."
"I am sure that we can count on the support of the incoming Swedish Presidency in the first six months of next year."
"It has already made it clear, that it will be making children's rights a top priority."
"So I think I have explained what action we propose to take and when we propose to take it."
"Mr President, does the Commissioner agree with me that there seems to be a new and growing abuse of children which is within the competence of the European Union?"
"Children are being used by mothers from eastern and central Europe on the streets of our cities for begging."
"They are mostly coming into the Union as refugees."
"Either they should be taken into care or the begging is unjustified because they should be receiving social benefits from the state."
"This is something perhaps which should be added to the list of child abuse which we as a Community ought to be looking into very carefully."
"I share the concern of the honourable Member in the sense that begging is an activity where children are forced, sometimes by their own family, to act against their dignity."
"As you know, the responsibility for protecting the dignity of children falls, above all, within the competence of the Member States."
"Nevertheless we are now launching a debate on a specific legislative initiative to define the list of crimes against children."
"I will consider your suggestions with an open mind."
"Question No 47 by (H-0606/00):"
"Subject: Absence of passport controls in the Schengen area In the Commission's view, how has the absence of passport controls under the Schengen Agreement worked during the European football championship in the light of the mass arrests made in Brussels and Charleroi?"
"First of all, it should be pointed out that many of those involved in the incidents that occurred in Brussels and Charleroi, come from one of the European Union' s Member States, the United Kingdom, which is not a member of the Schengen area."
"These are therefore people who, when travelling to see football matches at Euro 2000, were subject to checks carried out at the external borders of the Schengen area."
"It should also be borne in mind that for the duration of Euro 2000, the Belgian and Dutch Governments made use of a safeguard clause in Article 2(2) of the Schengen Agreement, which lays down that, when public order or national security are threatened - and in my view, the fear generated by these cases of 'hooliganism' certainly meets these criteria - a Member State may decide that, for a limited period, national border controls, adapted specially for the situation, can be implemented, even at internal borders within the Schengen area."
"The Belgian and Dutch Governments adhered to the prior consultation procedure laid down by the Schengen Agreement."
"The controls that are envisaged therein were temporarily reintroduced at internal borders, but this was not carried out in a systematic way."
"These were targeted checks, specifically based on information supplied by the Member States in the framework of police cooperation, concerning supporters likely to pose a threat to public order."
"Establishing controls at the external borders and, temporarily, at the internal borders of the Schengen area is not the same as closing a border or systematically turning away people who wish to enter the territory in order to attend a football match."
"In accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Union' s citizens have the right to move freely through the territory of Member States."
"Restrictions may be imposed, however, for reasons of public order and in individual cases only, i.e. when the person concerned represents a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to society' s fundamental wellbeing."
"This is why I say that Community law does not allow for a collective restriction to be imposed."
"Having the nationality of a given Member State and wanting to attend a football match are not sufficient grounds for being turned back at the border."
"This is why an assessment of the measures for cooperation between the authorities of the Member States concerned is already underway and why this joint exercise aims to learn the lessons of Euro 2000, in order to see how police and judicial cooperation can in the future be improved in terms of combating hooliganism."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his answer."
"I supported Portugal as well as I could there at King Baudouin' s Stadium in Brussels, but France won in the end in a match in which it has to be said that France had the better team."
"I was gunning for Portugal for as long as I possibly could, though."
"As I say, thank you for your answer, but I should still like to ask a follow-up question."
"A lot of people find it appalling that, here in Europe, there are riots, hooliganism, aggressive language and violence such as are unknown in connection with sporting events in, for example, the United States."
"I know that Great Britain is not a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, but that day may come."
"Do you think that the measures we are now taking are adequate, and what lessons can be drawn for the future?"
"Perhaps next time, Portugal will also be in the final."
"I do not consider there to be any link, whether direct or indirect, between Portugal' s defeat and the outbreaks of hooliganism."
"It is a fact of the game that sometimes luck is not on your side."
"In any event, Portugal will be hosting Euro 2004, and that is why, for Euro 2000, the Commission supported several practical initiatives for police cooperation in order to try out new methods of cooperation and to learn lessons from them."
"We are now in the process of assessing those measures."
"As soon as the report is available, it will be discussed and legislative measures will be adopted at European level, which is our objective - to adopt measures at European level that are capable of supporting this police cooperation in the fight against hooliganism."
"I am currently awaiting this report."
"As soon as it is ready, it will certainly be made public and the debate on what initiatives need to be taken will begin."
"I have a follow-up question also concerning the Schengen Agreement and exemption from the requirement to carry a passport."
"As the Commissioner surely knows, the Nordic countries are to become signatories of the Schengen Agreement in March of next year."
"It has emerged that, in future too, Swedish citizens who are to travel within the Schengen area will have to carry their Swedish passports with them because Swedish ID documents do not state the country of which they are citizens, as required under the Schengen Agreement."
"What was promised as a union with exemption from the requirement to carry passports still makes the latter compulsory for Swedish citizens."
"I wonder if the Commissioner can confirm that, once Sweden has entered into the Schengen Agreement, the latter' s regulations will, in the future too, require Swedes to have their passports with them when they travel to other countries within the Schengen area."
"What are your views on this?"
"Mr Sjöstedt, I would say that this matter should be seen from a different angle: that of creating common standards for travel documents, whether they are passports or identity cards."
"That these common standards should exist is laid down in the Treaty, and the Commission has a proposal at an advanced stage of preparation for the adoption of common standards for the instruments in question."
"I cannot give you a fixed timetable, that is, I cannot guarantee that these documents will be adopted before the expected date for the integration of the Nordic Passport Union into the Schengen free movement area."
"What I can guarantee is that we are working hard at formulating uniform standard models of documents that will solve problems such as the one the honourable Member has just indicated."
"Question No 48 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 49 by (H-0692/00):"
"Subject: European police academy What stage has been reached in the plans for a European police academy, with regard to virtual networks linking existing bodies and the creation of an actual academy at a particular location?"
"The European Council of Tampere of October 1999 called for the establishment of a European police college for the training of senior law enforcement officials which should start as a network of existing national training institutes."
"Considerable progress has been achieved so far."
"The Portuguese Presidency submitted a draft Council regulation at the end of June 2000."
"The French Presidency aims at adding a Council decision adopted by the end of this year."
"This would make it possible to meet the deadline of having the European police college in place by 2001, as mentioned in the Commission's scoreboard on justice and home affairs."
"A number of Member States are in favour of creating the European police college as a permanent network of national training institutes."
"Other Member States regard the current presidency proposal for a network as a temporary stage on the road to an institution at a fixed location."
"The Commission has, from the beginning, insisted that the European police college will become a fixed institution after having functioned as a network for an initial period in line with the Tampere conclusion."
"This has led to the draft regulation now containing the following approach."
"From January 2001 the European police college is set up as a network of national training institutes, a virtual academy."
"It will function in this form for three years."
"After that period a decision will be taken on the form in which to continue with the European police college."
"The Commission continues to take the position, however, that the draft regulation should contain a clear obligation for the European police college to become a fixed institution after having functioned for a few years as a network."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his precise answer and substantial input in this matter."
"In the meantime, I have been appointed rapporteur for the subject and I am sure that we will work closely together with a view to moving matters on."
"But the question I have is this: is the Commission still planning to conduct a study into the feasibility of making this college a fixed institution?"
"Because as you know, the European Parliament has called for this to be a fixed institution and not a virtual academy."
"Are you proposing to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect?"
"You can rely on receiving our full backing for this."
"There is a first study on feasibility by the General Secretariat of the Council which was the basis of this current draft resolution of the Council."
"But we intend to promote our own initiative in the area just to make sure that we will have all the necessary information to take a further step ahead as soon as possible."
"It is urgent to have that second step in order to make the European police college a fixed institution."
"The Commission will not drop that idea."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your replies this afternoon."
"Question No 50 will be replied to in writing."
"Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou"
"Question No 51 by (H-0647/00):"
"Subject: Social security in a stronger European economy One of the European Union' s main tasks in the 21st century will doubtless be to ensure that due importance is attached to the social dimension by comparison with the economic and political dimension."
"Common social policy objectives must be defined and attained in order to ensure that the process of increasing integration and the forthcoming enlargement is supported by the European public."
"Can the Commission say whether it will take action with a view to the increased harmonisation of social security systems, which still differ widely, and the harmonisation of professional qualifications in all areas?"
"Is it correct to assume that the EU' s extremely sparse powers in the fields of social policy and employment will be expanded in the future?"
"Mr President, the two basic issues are whether we intend to harmonise social policy and whether the power of the Commission will be extended to cover social policy issues."
"I will start with the Lisbon Council resolution, which made clear reference to the need to combine the policies of competitiveness and social cohesion, the need to update the social model, to invest in people and to combat social exclusion."
"Under the Treaties, it is naturally impossible for the Commission to put forward policy on issues relating to social policy But we feel that, in the wake of Lisbon, there is agreement within the Council, and the Council has unanimously decided to cooperate in the field of social policy and to extend the method of open cooperation to issues such as social exclusion and social protection."
"I am bound to say that the agenda that was tabled in June, in relation to which there was special cooperation with Parliament and with the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Van Lancker, accurately describes the measures and actions relating to social policy under the Treaty, but it also categorically states that the harmonisation of social polices is not on the cards."
"Harmonisation is deemed to be impossible."
"But our objectives can be achieved using methods such as social dialogue, the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund, which has a large budget, mainstreaming, political analysis, research and, finally, legislation."
"In July 1999, the Commission presented a communication entitled 'A Concerted Strategy for Modernising Social Protection' ."
"This put forward a two-pronged approach."
"The first is to combat social exclusion and the second concerns future cooperation on issues of social protection and pension systems."
"To achieve these goals, the Commission is giving priority to the enactment and implementation of social indicators, which are necessary to assess polices, to specify objectives relating to poverty and culture, which will be discussed during the course of the French Presidency, and to reach agreement on axes concerning the viability of pensions."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for providing these clarifications."
"Allow me to express the wish that is dearest to my heart in the form of an additional question: what special measures will the Commission endeavour to take in the future, with a view to working towards the harmonisation of the social security systems, professional qualifications and the social dimension in all areas?"
"It was extremely interesting to hear how matters stand in this respect, and to learn that the trend is more positive than it has been hitherto."
"However, I believe we must convince the people of the European Union that freedom of establishment is not a hollow expression which ultimately applies in full to tourists, rather, they must understand that for people who work, or have worked - firstly in terms of the insurance system and then in terms of the pensions system - freedom of establishment is a reality, and not a hollow expression."
"I believe we must join forces to this end, in order to try and persuade the Council to frame policy in this area that is more transparent, progressive and forward-looking."
"Mr President, I would agree with the general approach taken by the honourable Member, but I would like to remind him of the margin for manoeuvre of these policies at a European level, especially since they are national policies. Secondly, according to our studies, there are such major discrepancies in the structure and organisation of pension and social security systems that it is impossible to talk about harmonising them."
"In July, the Council of Employment Ministers held an in-depth debate on changing the regulations for workers living in one country and working in another. But I must emphasise that these systems are so different that the difficulties in bringing about the harmonisation you propose are virtually insurmountable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the harmonisation of social security systems would require harmonisation of the financing of social security, or, in practice, the harmonisation of taxation, not just with regard to its technical framework, but also its levels of taxation."
"We all know that consensus has still not been reached on this as far as policy is concerned, and that that is not going to come about quickly."
"For that reason I believe that a policy like this of taking small steps at a time is quite in order in this matter, and I would also ask how one aspect of this one-step-at-a-time policy is going, in other words the directive on a single market for additional pensions."
"The directive was supposed to have come from the Commission for a reading in the European Parliament in July, and now we have heard that it is probably being postponed until September."
"It may also be that it will not get discussed throughout the whole of the French presidential term."
"Could you give an update on this directive on a single market for additional pensions?"
"Mr President, I would like to say that this directive, which is being prepared in collaboration with other departments and other Commissioners, such as the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Competition, is still being developed. I will be able to give you a more complete text at a future sitting."
"We are currently at the debating stage."
"Question No 52 by (H-0649/00):"
"Subject: European social non-governmental organisations The role of European social NGOs as an important link between Europe' s citizens and the Commission, Parliament and Council is increasingly recognised in areas such as social policy, trade, development and the environment."
"What plans does the Commission have to propose a legal basis for civil dialogue between the EU' s institutions and organised civil society?"
"It is clear that, during the preparation of the White Paper on a new form of government within Europe entitled 'Spreading Democracy within Europe' , one of the basic issues is the role of civil society in the new forms of democracy that will be operating in Europe and in all Member States."
"The level of cooperation and the forms of collaboration between the Commission and NGOs are of particular concern to all Ministers without portfolio whose programmes are implemented through NGOs and who have, I would say, a special burden to bear in the social field."
"As you know, a dialogue is taking place today based on the working document submitted by the Commission on the Commission and NGOs and the construction of a stronger partnership."
"This dialogue aims to enable us to come up with new proposals on issues such as the representativeness of these organisations and issues of a procedural nature such as their funding and operation. Within the framework of this dialogue, on 30 March 2000 I met members of the platform of European NGOs and a dialogue took place, which focused on two categories of issues."
"The first category covered the proposals they put forward, which were invaluable for the social agenda."
"The second focused on issues concerning the representativeness and the organisation of NGOs in the social arena at a European level, the financial problems they are faced with and the special procedural difficulties they have in obtaining funds. Related issues included the quality and the specifications of the services they offer."
"I am bound to say that their contribution to this dialogue was extremely significant."
"Just a short time ago, in June, a meeting took place between the official group of the Secretariat-General and the platforms of European social and developmental NGOs, and we believe this dialogue will soon come to an end. After assessing the current level of cooperation and the institutional framework within which the NGOs operate, the Commission will be in a position to put forward a new, integrated proposal, consolidating their statutory role and their ability to function."
"Thank you, Commissioner and I certainly agree with the substance, particularly of the early part of your answer."
"I welcome the fact that NGOs are funded through the exclusion and anti-discrimination action programmes."
"But I have one specific question: why are only eight or nine NGOs, as far as my information is concerned, funded through these two lines?"
"Secondly, NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding."
"My information is that they are being pushed into project funding and 18 environmental NGOs, for instance, are receiving from the Commission funding towards their running costs."
"It occurs to me that two years after the 1998 budget freeze, it might be time now for the Commission to respond to what are very clear needs from the European-based social NGOs for core funding to cover their running costs."
"As you know, concerning particularly social issues and NGOs, there were some rules concerning the size, the representativeness and the results of these NGOs."
"We know that in this social field there is a huge number of NGOs and it is very difficult for the Commission DG to know with which of them they can cooperate. Sometimes there is confusion at national level."
"So we have decided to establish the criteria and to agree with NGOs the criteria on the basis of which we can select the NGOs we can work with. This is why we must solve the problem of the issue of representativeness, and the issue of the network to be established at European level."
"Question No 53 by (H-0675/00):"
"Subject: Employment in Greece In its answer to my Oral Question H-0778/99 on the Greek action plan for employment, the Commission stated that the Greek Government recognised the problem concerning the difficulty of recording fluctuations in employment and unemployment and had therefore undertaken, first, to reorganise the country' s public employment services, second, to establish effective centres to promote employment and, third, to introduce a system of computerised employment cards and to employ appropriate computerised systems to monitor all these policies."
"To what extent is the Greek Government meeting the undertakings it gave regarding the above-mentioned matters? Can the Commission provide statistics concerning the number of jobs created as a result of the implementation of the employment programmes, in other words how many of the unemployed have found work?"
"According to statistics provided by Eurostat, the unemployment rate in Greece in 1998 was 10.7%, whilst the European average during the same period was 9.9%."
"For the moment, Eurostat does not have statistics on Greece for 1999 and forecasts for 1999 were 10.4%."
"It is clear therefore that there are no appropriate statistics recording fluctuations in employment, which makes it difficult to assess the policies and measures being implemented. The new action plan for employment and the new measures announced by the Greek government based on this new action plan for employment are a move in the right direction."
"There are significant undertakings concerning, firstly, the organisation and coordination of statistical services in Greece with those in other European countries and of Eurostat. It is clear that, without a statistical base, it is difficult for us to put in place specific policies."
"Secondly, there is an undertaking to speed up the reorganisation of public employment and statistical services. This reorganisation will be completed by the end of 2001."
"The Commission does not have any information on the number of unemployed who have found work through the various employment programmes in Greece. That is why there is also an undertaking to continuously assess the existing training programmes, together with the Commission, to ensure that those who pass through these programmes are adequately monitored."
"The most fundamental recommendations concerning Greece are, firstly, to make changes to the statistics, the indicators, the studies and the employment services. Secondly, tax disincentives and other disincentives militating against the provision of community subsidies for entering the labour market will be examined in detail."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have more or less the same statistics as you. Indeed, I am this very moment holding in my hands the latest Eurostat report of 5 September 2000."
"The figures are more or less as you gave them."
"What I would really like to highlight is the following: for many years now, Commissioner, long before you were appointed to your post, I have been trying to find out - even a rough estimate will do - how many people have found work as a result of these employment actions, and I still have not succeeded."
"What prospects do we have of finding out at some point, albeit from one action if not more generally?"
"Secondly, you said we would have the results by the end of 2001."
"But I think it is totally unacceptable that there can be a debate using these figures, which have been collated throughout the European Union, month by month, category by category, and only the column referring to Greece is empty."
"I just wonder what we can discuss on this basis."
"I apologise for having to say this, but I have run out of patience."
"Greece is going through a period of transition which, I would say, equates with the first period of the policies concerning its accession to EMU."
"It is clear that certain areas that have been mentioned have suffered delays in relation to other countries."
"I agree with you that especially the part about statistics is extremely important, not only for the assessment but also for the implementation of policies. The undertaking in the employment action plan is a clear undertaking."
"The recommendations make specific reference to this. The Employment Guidelines for 2000 give priority to the action plan."
"It is one of the issues to which the Greek Government has made a commitment. I hope that this time next year we will be in a better position."
"Madam President, personally I like you, but I have to say that I do not like the Greek Government, especially concerning its stance on employment."
"The results speak for themselves. And I think that what you have said thus far also speaks for itself."
"How can anybody shape employment policy when they do not know what employment is, when they do not know how many people have found work thanks to training programmes?"
"I want to focus on one thing. I want to ask you a specific question so as not to have a long discussion about this."
"Specifically on training, what do you believe and what do you propose asking the Greek Government to change in the 2000-2006 period by comparison with the previous period, during which we all have the impression that things were not going well, despite the fact that the statistics were not accurate?"
"The information that does exist even shows that things are getting worse."
"So what will change in the 2000-2006 period?"
"Before I start, I would like to point out that, for historical and political reasons, every country has a different starting point and that, in the framework of the Third Community Support Framework, the next five years will be a great opportunity for all countries to assess strategies and funds alike."
"With specific regard to training, to which you made reference, as you know, in Greece there is the EKEPIS [National Certification Centre for Vocational Training], a certification centre set up with the approval of the Council, which has had very satisfactory results and has made some positive assessments. Over the next period it will complete its certification procedures."
"In other words, it will certify trainers and programmes, which has hitherto not been carried out."
"Secondly, training must be geared towards the choices made by a country in a service and information society. In other words, the fields covered by training must be linked to the choices made by the country."
"Thirdly, the establishment of centres to promote employment must be completed."
"So far, 24 have been established."
"We must have at least 100, according to the plan that was drawn up at national level."
"These centres must distance themselves from the classical provision of services for the unemployed and must come into line with the models that we already have in the European Union. These models relate to the individualised provision of services for the unemployed."
"And of course the system of computerised employment cards must be implemented for monitoring to be successful."
"The action plan for employment for 2000 contains these undertakings."
"The funding is available for these programmes and my opinion is that, during the 2000-2006 period, training programmes must be geared towards the specific points I have mentioned."
"As the author is not present, Question No 54 lapses."
"Questions Nos 55, 56 and 57 will be replied to in writing."
"Questions to Mr Fischler"
"Question No 58 by (H-0602/00):"
"Subject: Delay in issuing a 'certificate of specific character for foodstuffs' In 1994, after a long process of preparation, research and discussion in the Italian sector concerned, an application was drawn up in respect of whole virgin honey in accordance with Regulation 2082/1992/EC."
"The file, accompanied by a request for a `certificate of specific character´, was submitted by the whole virgin honey association and forwarded to the Commission by the Italian Ministry for the Environment on 8 September 1995."
"It was not until August 1999 that the Commission's approval was obtained, and then only thanks to various approaches by the Italian Government and the Minister, Mr De Castro, in particular."
"Since then, however, the association in question has heard nothing more."
"In view of the fact that eleven months have gone by since the Commission expressed its favourable opinion, and the regulation in question lays down specific time limits for issuing the certificate, could the Commission explain the problems that have prevented the official award of the certificate and what action it intends to take to resolve them?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the registration application in respect of whole virgin honey, which is at issue here, is not in accordance with the requirements of the legal provisions currently in force in the Community."
"In particular, the application of this designation is contrary to 1974 Directive 409, which is presently in force."
"Therefore, it has not been possible to date, to grant the Italian application for protection by means of a 'certificate of specific character' within the meaning of Regulation 2082."
"However, as you are aware, there is a proposal to amend this directive."
"As soon as the Council and Parliament have amended the directive, and a designation of this kind is permissible, it will at last be possible to bring the assessment of the application for the aforesaid honey to a successful conclusion."
"I am very grateful for your precision, Commissioner but I have to say that I am not satisfied."
"If I am not mistaken, as I said in my question, the Commission expressed a favourable opinion."
"I am aware that, since then, the common position on the directive has been redefined and that Parliament is expecting to hold a debate on the subject."
"However, it would appear that the reference to regulation 2082/90 may be a departure from the directive and that the directive and the regulation could be considered to be separate channels."
"I would therefore ask you to clarify this point, or I will not be a bearer of good news for the Italian farmers."
"Mr President, Mr Sacconi, that is easy enough to explain."
"We cannot introduce protection of origin for a product, when to do so would be contrary to Community law provisions."
"Therefore, it is absolutely essential for this amended Community regulation to come into force first, because this will rule out any conflict."
"It will then no longer be a problem for us to grant the protection sought by the Italian Government, or the region concerned."
"Question No 59 by (H-0609/00):"
"Subject: EU funding to Coillte According to a European Court of Justice ruling of August 1999, Coillte has illegitimately received EU loss of income forestry grants under forestry funding Regulation 2080/92 amounting to £6.5 million from 1993 to 1999."
"The European Court ruled that as Coillte, the Irish semi-state company responsible for forestry development, was a 'public entity' , it was not entitled to such payments."
"In light of this judgment, is it the view of the Commission that Coillte is not entitled to further payments of £30.5 million of funds as part of the next round of forestry funding under Regulation 2080/92?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Mckenna' s question boils down to whether Coillte is entitled to receive co-financed grants from the agricultural fund, specifically the guarantee section, in order to offset loss of income in forestry developments, under Regulation 2080/92."
"I would like to point out that there has been no judgement from the Court of Justice on this specific issue."
"However, it is true that the Commission classifies this company called Coillte as a state enterprise, because it is owned by the Irish State."
"It is therefore not entitled to loss of income grants."
"According to Article 2, paragraph 2, letter b of the Regulation on Forestry, these grants are reserved for farmers and other natural or legal persons under private law."
"The Commission will therefore refuse to co-finance grants paid out, backdated to 1 August 1996."
"A total of some EUR 4.8 million was paid out in 1997 and 1998."
"The Irish Government contested this financial rectification in so-called mediation negotiations."
"The arbitration body is still working on this and has not resolved the issue conclusively as yet."
"The Commission has taken the stance during these negotiations that, to date the Irish Government has failed to provide any evidence that Coillte should be classified as a private company."
"The Commission is unable either to confirm the sum of GBP 6.5 million quoted by Mrs Mckenna, or that of 30.5 million, which obviously relates to future payments."
"However, the Commission will adopt the same stance it has adopted to date with any future applications."
"I am very glad to hear the Commission's reply because the funding that Coillte has was set up by the state, it was the state that set Coillte up."
"It is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development."
"Now it actually used the money it was getting from these interest payments on land that they were purchasing."
"What is interesting as well as that the chairman, Ray MacSharry is a former European Commissioner for Agriculture and he is still refusing to acknowledge the fact that Coillte is a public entity and that it is not entitled to such payments."
"At a recent meeting with Coillte I was told that the government is gong to challenge this decision."
"I believe it is actually a waste of taxpayers' money to challenge it because I think it is quite clear to anybody with an ounce of common sense that they are not entitled to this money."
"What is really devastating is that they have actually prevented the people who should have got the money from rural depopulation for ensuring that people who did lose income actually got the money and I would like to see the Commission ensure that Coillte get no more money because they were not entitled to it in the first place and that they have to pay it back."
"They are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either."
"Mr President, there is really nothing I can add to that."
"What Mrs McKenna has just had to say describes and elucidates precisely the Commission' s position."
"There can be no question of a State as an entity, and in this case, as the 100% owner of a company, being a drawer of income, and therefore it cannot suffer loss of income either."
"It is therefore evident that this money must be paid back, and that this company must not receive any fresh funding."
"In addition, I would point out that this mediation procedure is not equivalent to an arbitration procedure, instead it merely represents the opinion of an institution that was set up by the Community."
"However, the findings are not binding on the Commission, as we have already mentioned on more than one occasion here in Parliament."
"On the other hand, each party is, of course, at liberty to go to the European Court of Justice, but we have no authority to decide on the matter."
"As the author is not present, Question No 60 lapses."
"Question No 61 by (H-0618/00):"
"Subject: Cost of enlargement and Mediterranean agriculture In view of the forecasts and the most recent legislative proposals for Mediterranean agriculture covering products such as cotton, rice, fruit and vegetables, tomatoes, shell nuts and olive oil, which will have a highly adverse impact on employment and social progress in these poor areas of Europe, and bearing in mind the budgetary plans with a view to EU enlargement, will the Commission say how it intends to ensure that Mediterranean agriculture does not in fact end up footing the bill for future enlargement?"
"Commissioner, perhaps you could give me a clearer reply to the following question, which is extremely important for enlargement:"
"Does the Community legislation applicable to candidate countries from the moment they join, the so-called acquis communitaire, include, in your view, the aid and financial support of the CAP?"
"Mr President, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I assume that when you talk about support, you are referring primarily to the direct payments provided for in the market organisation, and which constitute a major theme in the enlargement debate."
"You are right in principle."
"All Member States will have to respect the same acquis communitaire in the long run."
"Therefore, there can only be one common agricultural policy and not two different ones."
"But you yourself know only too well - and this has been the case hitherto for any country acceding to the EU, be it Spain or Portugal, or any other State - that the accession treaty, which does in fact constitute a primary right, contains transitional arrangements, which of course allow for departure from the acquis in some cases."
"That is, after all, the point of having transitional arrangements."
"As such, it will not be possible to answer the question as to when the Member States-to-be will actually receive their full quota of direct payments - as provided for in the common market organisation - until the enlargement negotiations have been concluded."
"After all, it is precisely this issue that the enlargement negotiations are focussing on."
"Question No 62 by (H-0633/00):"
"Subject: Subsidies for growing tobacco Tobacco growing in the European Union is subsidised to the tune of millions of euros per year while at the same time over half a million EU citizens die each year of diseases caused by tobacco."
"The subsidies paid for tobacco growing should be redirected so that they encourage current tobacco farmers to go over to growing healthier crops."
"How does the Commission propose in future to amend the basis for the allocation of structural fund aid so that large-scale tobacco growing can be halted in the EU?"
"What does the Commission consider would be a realistic timetable for carrying out the necessary changes?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström' s question covers old ground as I see it."
"I would remind the House that the Commission presented Parliament and the Council with a report on the common market organisation of tobacco as early as 1996."
"The report pointed out that this sector makes a decisive contribution to maintaining the viability of certain regions within the Community, some of which are highly disadvantaged, and where there are few alternatives."
"In the light of an inquiry at the time into the social and economic consequences of abolishing Community subsidies for tobacco cultivation, the decision was taken not to go down this path."
"However, this was also because there was evidence to show that subsidising tobacco cultivation has practically no effect on tobacco consumption, and thus on the risk to EU citizens ' health."
"This led to radical reform of the tobacco sector in 1998."
"The key aspects of this reform were as follows: firstly, there was an improvement in quality, in particular, tobacco growers switched over to low-nicotine and low-tar varieties."
"Secondly, research activities have been stepped up, financed by the Community tobacco fund."
"The appropriations for said fund were doubled."
"One of the main objectives of this research is to investigate the possibility of switching from tobacco cultivation to alternative activities."
"Thirdly, with a view to encouraging farmers to go over to other crops, the reform measures also made provision for a mechanism whereby quotas are repurchased from farmers who are willing to give up tobacco cultivation."
"In this way, these farmers are offered money, as it were, in order to facilitate conversion to other crops."
"The provisions laid down in the tobacco market organisation can also be supplemented within the framework of the support measures for rural development."
"On a final note, I would just like to say that the Commission will of course assess the reform measures taken."
"We will provide the European Parliament with a report on the functioning of the amended market organisation by 1 April 2002."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your replies."
"This is a question of redirecting aid in support of other products."
"I have made these comments on many an occasion, as nothing rocks mankind so much as tobacco, which kills so many."
"Regarding the analyses you refer to, I would like to know on what sort of objective analyses they are based, as I am concerned about the health of all of us and, similarly, the livelihoods of tobacco farmers."
"We should be able to change their means of livelihood and keep them at that economic level where they can produce health products for all of us."
"Mr President, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, I am sorry that there was no interpretation at the beginning."
"To be brief: naturally I would be only too pleased to send you the analysis that was carried out at the time."
"The social implications, and the effect on income were also assessed during this analysis."
"I will gladly make the documents you have requested available to you."
"Is the Commissioner aware of research at the Scottish Crop Research Institute in Invergowrie near Dundee that shows that tobacco plants can be genetically modified to accept the implanting for multiplication of potential anti-cancer vaccines?"
"It is quite ironic really."
"Would it not be desirable to redirect the European tobacco-growing industry towards such benign purposes and to further promote this type of research?"
"Mr President, Mr Purvis, I have to be quite honest with you, and tell you that I have not been informed about the results of this research; perhaps because it was conducted primarily for health reasons, and therefore falls within the remit of the Commissioner responsible for health."
"But I am keen to acquaint myself with them."
"Only, irrespective of whether these results are positive or less than positive, as I see it, it is imperative that we - and we must never forget this - convince smokers of their importance, with a view to encouraging them to buy cigarettes that meet these requirements."
"It is not the tobacco growers' problem, because they will inevitably grow the kind of tobacco the market demands."
"Perhaps the best all-round solution is to carry on as I have been doing for the past 15 years - I too was a smoker in the past - and not smoke at all."
"Then the problem will only exist on a very small scale."
"Mr President, preventive health care is a major priority for everyone here in this House."
"We know that tobacco growers in the Member States have different priorities."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question, although I have always been, and still am, a non-smoker: does the Commission not think that if tobacco cultivation were to be completely discontinued within the European Union with immediate effect - as called for by a fair number of people - people would just carry on smoking regardless because tobacco products would be imported into the EU?"
"Commission. (DE) Mrs Schierhuber, when you look at the balance of trade in the tobacco sector, you notice that the vast majority of products - and especially tobacco - used in the manufacture of cigarettes, are already imported."
"The only difference is that, we are trying, as it were, with the aid of the common market organisation, to produce some of the tobacco that people consume anyway, ourselves, so that we do not have to import everything."
"In so doing, we are giving some families the opportunity to draw an income from this type of cultivation."
"I am absolutely convinced that the health problem, which undoubtedly exists as a result of tobacco consumption, can only be brought under control if we alert consumers as to the effect smoking can have on their health."
"There will be no decline in tobacco consumption until we have succeeded in driving this message home to consumers."
"We are deluding ourselves if we think we can control the problem from the supply side."
"In economic terms, the only way to achieve this is to alter patterns in demand."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler, for your replies."
"Questions Nos 63 to 109 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Water policy"
"The next item is the report (A5-0214/00) by Mrs Lienemann, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on the Council directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy [C5-347/2000 - 1997/0067 (COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that together we have produced a useful piece of work in this water framework directive."
"We have produced a useful piece of work; it may be a collective compromise, but it is a compromise which incorporates stringent requirements, which I think will clear the way for a qualitative and quantitative leap in water management."
"In the long term, our fellow European citizens must enjoy high quality water everywhere, whether surface or groundwater."
"This compromise was made possible by active commitment, by the balance of power that the European Parliament was able to create, by the participation of all the groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs who assisted me, and by Mr Provan, the chairman of our delegation in this difficult conciliation procedure."
"I would, however, also like to thank the other participants who are, of course, the Commission, which had to play the role of intermediary and technical innovator, and did so extremely rigorously and effectively, the Commissioner and also all the staff of the Commission."
"I would also like to thank the Council, especially the Portuguese Presidency and their Minister of State, Mr Pedro Silva Perreira, who made this agreement possible."
"I have all the more reason for saying this, because this directive certainly requires a greater effort on the part of the southern European countries than it does from other Community countries with easier access to water."
"In which areas has significant progress been made?"
"Firstly, the directive is strictly binding in legislative terms."
"Second, the implementation of measures concerning the issue that we in Parliament considered absolutely crucial, that is the elimination of priority hazardous substances and a complete end to discharges of such substances."
"You are aware that this House wanted our directive to be compatible with the commitments given under international conventions, in particular OSPAR, as stated in the directive."
"The arrangements introduced will clear the way for a list of priority substances to be gradually drawn up every 4 years, that is, priority substances which must be reduced in quantity, and priority hazardous substances, which must purely and simply be eliminated."
"Third, there was the important and sensitive matter of groundwater."
"We were faced with the problem of producing a rigorous definition of what we called good groundwater status."
"In order for this good status to be specified, it was decided that a 'daughter' directive should be drawn up, that is, a directive that will implement the framework directive."
"Parliament was rather afraid that the new directive would provide an opportunity to delay requirements to combat pollution and immediate measures to prevent the pollution of groundwater."
"This is why we wanted, and secured, the stipulation, first of all, that if the directive were not approved by the Members of the European Parliament, the Member States would draw up rules guaranteeing good groundwater status."
"If the Member States did not do this - it is a kind of Sword of Damocles - if 75% of the level laid down in the applicable pollution standards governing good groundwater status is reached, then the Member States will have to reverse the trend."
"In general, the directive takes account of Parliament's determination to ensure that action by the Member States enables any upward trends in the pollution of groundwater to be reversed."
"So you see, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that in this way we have come up with a system that enables us to make significant progress, and not just in terms of the main principles, but also in the overall effectiveness of the decisions that have been made."
"Nonetheless, we shall all have to be vigilant."
"Firstly with regard to all the daughter directives, which will implement the framework directive."
"We shall be involved in the codecision procedure to determine the list of priority substances and priority hazardous substances."
"A first report has already been examined by the Commission and a rapporteur has been appointed."
"The second major task for this House will be the substance of the framework directive on groundwater."
"In short, I think we have done the bulk of the work."
"We will continue to work together, but I have a feeling that at the dawn of the 21st century, with this framework directive, Europe is entering a new age where the protection of water, that most fundamental resource, will become a priority in terms of policy and the behaviour of all those involved, whether they be farmers, industrialists or consumers."
"In any event, this is the intention of our directive and I have no doubt that the Commission and the Member States will ensure that it is implemented."
"Mr President, with the outcome of the conciliation concerning the Water Framework Directive, we are completing what, for the European Parliament, has been a tough but successful piece of work lasting ten years. At the same time, however, we are, as a result, standing on the threshold of new tasks that are at least as important."
"Since the end of the 1980s, a range of Commission proposals had been submitted to the House, aimed at revising existing directives and made necessary by scientific and technical developments."
"When those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy initially examined the proposals, we found that no effort had been made to coordinate their provisions or the concepts behind them."
"In June 1995, and at our group' s insistence, the European Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held a hearing of experts on the European Union' s water policy."
"The experts' statements confirmed our concerns."
"The Council and the Commission complied with the call for comprehensive European water protection legislation to be drawn up."
"The idea of the current Water Framework Directive was born at that time."
"In February 1996, the European Commission tabled its proposals in the form of a communication."
"In a very comprehensive report, our fellow PPE-DE Group member, Mr Florenz, has clarified the European Parliament' s aims and identified the current shortcomings."
"In the light of the discussions between the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission proposal of December 1996, which had been produced under great pressure of time, was supplemented in two stages in 1997."
"The definitive, official Commission proposal was finally ready in February 1998."
"By working together closely in this way, Parliament and the European Commission gradually moved towards a consensus, a process also helped by the intensive discussions during the first and second readings in the European Parliament and the conciliation procedure."
"I should particularly like to thank the Commissioners responsible, Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wallström, and especially the Commission officials involved, for this constructive cooperation."
"In Parliament' s view, the result we now have before us is a great success of a kind which would still have been unthinkable two years ago."
"This success is reflected in the removal from the statute books of the hitherto fragmented EU legislation in the field of water protection, the coherence of the relevant water directives at EU level, the legally binding nature of the measures taken pursuant to Article 4, the shortening of the deadline for complying with the aims of the directive, the satisfactory way in which the issue of costs has been settled, also in accordance with Ireland' s wishes, the introduction of the combined approach whereby limit values and quality objectives are established with a view to reducing the levels of pollutants, significant improvements over the common position regarding the requirements for groundwater protection and, finally, the inclusion of the goal and the definition of the OSPAR Convention with no stipulations in terms of time."
"I should like once again to make explicitly clear in this connection the particular importance we attach to reconciling Community law and international conventions, albeit in such a way that the substance of international conventions does not automatically become legally binding in Community law."
"Finally, mention should be made of the guarantee that codecision will apply in connection with future procedures."
"Welcome as this result is, we cannot, however, rest on our laurels."
"The Water Framework Directive now needs to be put into effect."
"I should also, of course, particularly like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and, finally and most especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann."
"Our shared success has only been made possible by her incredible commitment and the huge amount of time and energy she put into her work."
"It was a pleasure for me to cooperate with a colleague in this way."
"My own special thanks go to you, Mrs Lienemann, and our own staff here in Parliament."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, very much indeed, as we can all see how committed she was to this work."
"In addition, Parliament got its own point of view across quite well, especially with regard to the important issue that, at last, we have the prospect of attaining a situation in which hazardous substances can no longer get into groundwater supplies."
"In my opinion, it should be as clear as day that when we know a substance is dangerous, in no case should it be able to get into groundwater, as water, apart from anything else, is a very important resource for people in terms of health."
"Obviously it is just regrettable that the deadlines for implementation are an unreasonably long way off."
"All in all it has to be said that in certain fields of industry in the European Union we have made progress."
"In many areas, for example, the community and industry have played their part relatively well."
"Agriculture and forestry, however, are still problems, with their diffuse discharges."
"More needs to be done about this."
"Regarding consumers it is naturally important how consumption is controlled, and here charges and taxation are of prime importance."
"For that reason, it is a bit hard for me to understand how people can even begin to think that water could be a commodity paid for out of general taxes, as it is only through charges that consumption can be controlled really sensibly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the Edinburgh Summit nearly ten years ago, Mr Kohl and Mr Major assured one another that there was no need for a European water policy."
"If the Spanish wish to pollute their water, they should do just that."
"But the tide of deregulation has turned."
"In 1996, the Commission proposed the ecological water directive, which did not amount to more than five pages, however."
"We now have a substantial legislative document of 60 pages, with 90 pages of appendix."
"This is thanks to cross-party cooperation, between the groups within the European Parliament. I would especially like to thank Mrs Lienemann, but also Chris Davies from the liberal group and Mrs Schleicher from the Christian-Democrats."
"The Greens feel that 80% of this document has been a success."
"What was disappointing was the water price policy."
"What is successful is the fact that we have a new principle for chemical substances."
"Chemical substances are no longer banned because they are also harmful to human health, but in line with a new principle that harmful substances do not belong in the water."
"I think we can be proud of this."
"Mr President, the conciliation has been quite difficult."
"This has to do with the fact that the subject is itself both extensive and technically very complicated."
"It also has to do with the fact that the positions of Parliament and the Council were far apart when the conciliation began."
"The fact that the result has turned out as well as it has is largely due to the tireless and committed work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, whom we wish to thank."
"The directive could, of course, have been still better and beefed up even more, for example as far as the timetables are concerned."
"That would have been desirable."
"Yet, it is obvious that the European Parliament has gained most and that the Council has had to give most ground in the negociations that have taken place."
"The clearest proof of this is that the rules are binding, something which Parliament had demanded."
"In certain respects the directive forms a framework whose contents are still unclear."
"This is especially true in the case of the phasing-out of dangerous substances."
"This is an issue upon which further work will be done in the daughter directives."
"Crucial to how the directive will operate is the question of how it will be implemented and monitored."
"All in all, the foundations have been laid for a coherent water policy and for long-term improvements in water quality."
"We shall therefore be happy to vote in favour of the proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say that I am making this speech on behalf of Mrs García Orcoyen, who was unable to attend this sitting."
"Tomorrow's approval of this framework directive will represent a great step forward on the road to the cohesion and harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States with regard to the quantity and quality of their water."
"In this last stage of the long parliamentary process undergone by this directive, in particular during conciliation, the European Parliament has been able to present a united front in defending its arguments before the Council."
"The rapporteur's superb coordination and the will to reach an understanding shown by all the political groups have made this final text possible, and it has been improved in basic aspects such as the legally binding nature of the objectives without omitting to take account of the various problems in the Member States."
"I must also congratulate the Council on its flexibility in the face of the criticisms put forward by Parliament, and the Commission for its effective mediation."
"Tomorrow, a new and equally important stage in the directive' s development will begin, in which the European Parliament must continue to participate extremely actively in monitoring and controlling the fulfilment of objectives and deadlines and the drawing-up of reports or legislative acts derived from the directive."
"One of the weakest points to have become apparent during the drawing-up stage must be strengthened: the incontestable need for more and better means of technical advice for subjects which, like this, require highly specific knowledge, and in which the social and economic cost of a small calculation error can be great."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise what makes this directive a real tool for sustainable development: the balance achieved in the consideration of water as an extremely valuable economic resource and as an essential element in the conservation of European ecosystems."
"The development of this directive may provide an important meeting point in the much-reviled relationship between economy and ecology."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Water Framework Directive contains many positive initiatives in favour of comprehensive and integrated water protection."
"Yet the objectives are timid, vague and extremely long term."
"We cannot wait 30 years for the European Court of Justice to decide whether or not the environmental objectives are in fact legally binding."
"The Member States have been called upon to improve the quality of our water quickly in order to achieve the objectives in 15 years' time."
"Where groundwater protection is concerned, Parliament has unfortunately bowed to the interests of industrial agriculture and recognised its right to go on polluting the environment to the same degree."
"It is now also the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that existing standards are not undermined, the yardstick by which the success of the Water Framework Directive will be measured."
"Any more kow-towing to industrial agriculture would lead in the longer term to our most important drinking water resources being destroyed once and for all."
"We are pleased, however, that the Greens have achieved a great breakthrough when it comes to emissions of dangerous substances, which now have to be identified on the list of priority substances."
"In this area, we must make genuine efforts to meet the OSPAR objectives as well and to avoid what is an incalculably serious risk to health and the environment."
"Mr President, the forthcoming Water Framework Directive is based on the justified principle that citizens of the European Community are entitled to use drinking water on a daily basis."
"This should be provided for by law."
"A simple, uniform and coordinated Community law on the protection of water and groundwater is to be welcomed."
"Important directives such as those on protecting the food we eat, on municipal sewage disposal, on plant protection and on nitrates are being revised and redefined on the basis both of ecological criteria and criteria of origin."
"The tasks are therefore broadly defined."
"As a farmer, I advocate the closer involvement of those who represent the interests of professional groups and serious consideration of their criticisms."
"Farming, forestry, fisheries and, in particular, the horticultural industry should also be involved in the decision-making process so that the required combination of voluntary restraint and state regulation is achieved."
"The calls for zero limit values can hardly be met by means of legislation alone."
"Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community."
"I agree with the rapporteur: it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was a very turbulent night sitting in which Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed upon a common water policy for all Member States."
"Parliament' s really quite significant victory consists in the fact that this directive is to be binding."
"Let us remember, however, that until the very end a number of Member States vehemently resisted any requirement that they should manage their own water resources more carefully and in an environmentally more conscious way in future."
"However, it was splendid to see the way in which the Members of the European Parliament transcended all party differences and quite clearly agreed that there should be no common position without a legal requirement."
"A further important victory for MEPs involved the protection of groundwater."
"Dangerous substances must completely have disappeared from groundwater within 20 years of the Directive' s publication."
"Will we achieve this objective?"
"It now remains for whatever dangerous substances are meant here to be listed in an annex to the Directive, and it is already clear to me that there will certainly be further heated discussions on this matter."
"I believe, however, that the great objective of protecting Europe' s groundwater for future generations is not in dispute."
"The process of re-thinking has taken place: a considerable victory for the political process and a considerable victory on behalf of our children."
"I am pleased that there has been a satisfactory outcome to the conciliation procedure with regard to the important report dealing with numerous technical issues on water policy, an outcome which we owe to the persistence, competence and motivation of our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann."
"Over the next quarter-century, we will make more progress in this field in the protection, good management and renewal of this resource than in the discovery and exploitation of new deposits."
"I would like to make two points to emphasise the importance of integrated water management:"
"firstly, I would like studies to be carried out on the establishment of a federal ""water and environment"" management system in the various countries at European Union level,"
"second, we must ensure that the proposals of the directive are implemented and encourage them, not only at European Union level, but also in the aid that we give to third countries in the form of ""water"" projects, the impact of which lies in a hydrographic ecosystem affecting the countries of the European Union, but also those that are part of the MEDA agreements, for example, which must be taken account of in the MAP projects and even in others, like the Upper Nile basin or Switzerland."
"Mr President, the commitment that has been obtained on the text of the new Water Framework Directive is generally positive, even though it contains certain controversial aspects, worthy of criticism, which can nevertheless be ironed out when the various studies, action plans and draft regulations provided for in the text we have just approved are drafted."
"It is a positive development that water management requirements are to be integrated into a single system - hydrological basin management, which is based more on geographical and hydrological areas than on administrative and national borders. This is a particularly important issue for Portugal, whose main rivers are shared with our neighbour, Spain."
"Equally positive is the statement that water is not a commodity that should be bought and sold like any other. This means, of course, that special measures must be put in place to protect a commodity that is publicly owned, whilst safeguarding the interests of the population, in particular, domestic water supply and agricultural activity, especially small farms and family-based holdings."
"The final text does state that Member States can attend to the social and economic effects on the affected area as well as the geographic and climatic conditions. This will enable Member States to deal with their different situations by means of established exceptions, which may nevertheless prove to be insufficient to cope with agricultural situations in the South, particularly where Portugal is concerned."
"We shall nevertheless pay close attention to the way this policy is implemented in practice in the years to come."
"Mr President, this is a framework directive with ambitious targets for the protection and improvement of water quality, taking account of the polluter-pays principle."
"We will not have the entire picture until the relevant daughter directives are in place over the next few years."
"Water pricing policies by the year 2010 will have to provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently."
"The new paragraph 4 of Article 9 will allow for the continuation of the established practice in Ireland of not applying water charges to the domestic water sector."
"You can only govern with the consent of the people and by 2010 domestic water charges could well be acceptable to the Irish electorate."
"At the moment, it is a hugely politically-charged issue."
"I thank my colleagues for their understanding, particularly Mrs Schleicher, who represented our case with understanding through all stages, especially at conciliation."
"The principle of subsidiarity in relation to water pricing policy is jealously guarded in Ireland, but public opinion will probably change by 2010."
"If we do not apply household or domestic water charges by then we will have to explain our action to the Commission."
"There is growing appreciation in Ireland that clean drinking water is a scarce resource and that all services, particularly the cost of distributing clean water to all households, have to be paid for."
"At the moment the central exchequer or the taxpayer, is paying for this, yet many do not benefit."
"Many have to pay to sink their own pump in Ireland and pay the electricity charges."
"Many are on group water schemes which are not part of the public water supply and have to pay dearly each year for the privilege of rather questionable quality water being distributed to their houses."
"So we are talking about a question of equity and changing public opinion and we appreciate the matter being left to the Irish Government to decide and to influence public opinion."
"Mr President, I believe that today we are witnessing an important act."
"We are coming to the end of a long road on which there has been a long battle, long discussions, but in the end, some positive agreements and constructive positions on the part of the three institutions, the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which have made this agreement possible."
"As with any agreement, some will think it too little, others too much, but there is a middle point, a balance that is acceptable for the diverging points of view of those who have worked all this time."
"Furthermore, they have carried out serious work on a highly complex subject."
"On behalf of my colleague, Mrs Wallström, I would like thank Mrs Lienemann for her kind words. As rapporteur for all this work, she has played a leading part and carried out a colossal task, with the persistence and tenacity of her principles which, combined with a dose of realism, have enabled this agreement to be reached."
"As she herself points out, and this is no minor issue, a subject such as water demonstrates the diversity of Europe, with its radically differing characteristics between countries."
"In some countries, vast expanses have under 400 millimetres per year, that is, semi-arid zones, while in others the average far exceeds 2 500 or 3 000 millimetres."
"The focal point of this directive, in which water is considered as a whole, a total flow, with no distinction between surface and groundwater, which is the mistake that was made for a long time, is the right focal point and implies a step forward."
"The effort to keep our aquifers in the European Union as clean as possible, or as unpolluted as possible, is a key effort if we want to guarantee balanced development, sustainable development and a habitable Europe for future generations."
"On this subject, I have to say that a moment ago one of the Members referred to conversations between two European leaders."
"Yes, some may still pollute their aquifers, but some have been polluting them for some time, for example with huge pig farms."
"I do not want to go into detail, but people in glass houses should not throw stones."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that monitoring and follow-up are essential to this directive."
"Monitoring and follow-up that, subsequent to the flexibility and realistic approach that abound in all the articles of the directive, will undoubtedly allow us to guarantee the cleanliness of our water."
"This is absolutely essential as, in short, there is no life without clean water."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission what is happening with the 1991 Directive on ecological water quality which has so far not officially been withdrawn by the European Commission."
"One further request, both to Parliament' s President and to the Council and the Commission: the texts are still deficient in so far as the specialist terminology in the specific languages is not correct."
"I would ask for this to be re-examined, for the terminology in each country is quite distinct."
"It is a problem which the translators could not solve because the text is so specialised."
"It would be a poor show if the legal texts did not contain the correct and necessary terminology."
"I would therefore ask for this matter to be looked into again."
"In the German version alone, I have found more than twenty mistakes."
"I happily leave it to you to examine this matter."
"Mr President, with regard to the directive on ecological water quality, to which I believe Mrs Schleicher is referring, this framework directive incorporates all the essential elements of the proposal on the ecological quality of water and I understand that the latter has already been withdrawn."
"If this is not the case, it will be withdrawn in the near future."
"With regard to the translation problem, what Mrs Schleicher is referring to is a very important factor as the terminology is indeed highly technical in this field and a suitable translation is essential."
"I shall simply pass on these observations to the competent departments and the translation departments in particular so that, if appropriate, a more detailed revision of the specific terminology and definitions contained in the directive may be carried out."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"End-of-life vehicles"
"The next item is the report (A5-0212/2000) by Mr Florenz, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a Council directive on end-of-life vehicles [C5-258/2000 - 1997/0194 (COD)]."
"Mr President, to begin with, I should like to take the opportunity of thanking my colleagues for bravely cooperating in the intensive way they did."
"It was, of course, not always as simple as that. With me, it never is."
"However, I am very grateful to you that we have got through all this."
"A number of years ago, the European institutions made the right decision to attend to private motoring."
"We began with cars and oil and are now faced with the question of what to do with the nine million cars which end up on the scrap heap every year."
"Tonight, we shall also be discussing tyres, and we shall certainly one day also have to discuss how roads need to look in the future, given that they are much too noisy."
"In view of the nine million cars withdrawn from circulation every year and the 45 million litres or so of waste oil, I think something needed to be done about this issue."
"I believe the Commission has undoubtedly submitted a somewhat overly prescriptive proposal with, in my opinion, some outmoded initiatives in terms of environmental policy."
"Fortunately, more work has, however, been done upon the proposal in the course of the three readings, and we now have a proposal which is along the right lines."
"Let us bear in mind that, where motoring as a whole is concerned, 80% of damage to the environment is due to driving, 19% to car manufacture and only 1% to the disposal of vehicles."
"We must therefore set the correct priorities where this issue too is concerned."
"I therefore believe that, by setting exhaust values and quality standards for fuel, we have begun in the right way, and today we closed with the question: how do we deal with the issue of end-of-life vehicles?"
"We have introduced rigid quotas, without which no progress can be made."
"This Parliament ought also, however, to have had the courage to make a really bold decision in favour of a really new type of car for the future, one which will not weigh 1 500 kg but perhaps only 1 000 kg and which, with its lifetime 'mileage' of 300 000 km, may be seen to have genuine advantages in terms of environmental policy."
"On the basis of the Commission' s proposal, we have unfortunately allowed ourselves to be persuaded to adopt old quotas which frankly promote cars made of steel rather than modern, versatile cars which are made of other materials and which are much lighter."
"Cars of this kind, made out of plastic or fibreglass or whatever, do not, however, have the advantage of being able to be recycled."
"How, for example, can you seriously expect to recycle an airbag, which is there as a safety feature and not for recycling purposes?"
"A bold move towards a special quota for really light cars would therefore have been appropriate in this case."
"Unfortunately, we have missed that opportunity, something I particularly regret."
"One general point - and also a disputed one in this House - was the question of costs."
"The Commission has been quick to say that, in the future, all costs are to be borne by the manufacturer."
"At first glance, that is a brilliant idea."
"The only thing is that, in the end, this would harm the consumer by eliminating competition."
"And that is my overall objection to this Directive."
"Certainly, we would now be clearly transferring the costs to the manufacturer, but to one who no longer had any competition and who would in future dictate the cost of recycling cars. And it is precisely this which is anti the consumer."
"We need more, not less, input from the market in this area."
"This is a wrong decision, which I very much regret because it will have consequences."
"We see this already where computers are concerned. The Directive concerned is, in fact, on the table."
"Before long, it will be lawnmowers, then mopeds and then furniture which will be subject to such directives. I wonder to whom, one day, we shall return our old roads when they are too noisy, and who is to pay for the transaction."
"Cost allocation is therefore not as simple as all that."
"I should really have liked things to have worked out differently, but I accept the majority decision."
"The bans on metals are quite in order because we need, in the longer term, to come up with a ban, and not only because of the scientific results."
"We have made exceptions which will be reviewed by the Commission in three years' time for, together with the scientific advisory board, the Commission has overall responsibility for making the relevant decisions in this area in three years' time."
"I believe it will do so."
"All in all, I believe that, apart from the issue of cost, this Directive is a great success and marks a step forward."
"I would thank the Commission and the Council and, once again, my fellow MEPs."
"It has been a pleasure to work with you."
"Mr President, I too have reason to thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz."
"I also found that the Parliamentary delegation very much got its act together during the conciliation and has finished by submitting a very good proposal."
"Two aspects are of particular importance for me."
"First of all, we have succeeded in clarifying the fact that, from the end of next year, end-of-life vehicles will have to be properly disposed of throughout the European Union."
"In other words, it will no longer be possible to dispose of cars illegally or to abandon them somewhere in the woods. Nor will there be the impulse to export them in one way or another to Eastern Europe."
"Instead, they will have to be properly disposed of on the spot by authorised companies."
"For me, that is one of the great, fundamental successes of this directive."
"These are problems we argued a bit about and finally solved quite reasonably by means of a compromise which all sides find workable. Instead, the second important point is the fact that, by means of this Directive, we have established that new cars must demonstrate in their type verification and test that they are easy to recycle."
"In this Directive, we are calling upon the Commission to alter the directive on type licensing so that, in the future, new cars have to be built in such a way that they can easily be recycled."
"That is the crucial thing."
"In that way, we are moving away from the end-of-pipe technology whereby we always have to consider what to do with the remains of cars."
"Instead, we need to bear in mind, right from the time that vehicles are built, that cars, like other products, have to be re-used and disposed of."
"That is precisely the right way of going about matters, and I am therefore very pleased that we have got the directive up and running in this way."
"Mr President, the compromise that has been reached is a great success for environmental and consumer protection."
"It is the first time that manufacturers' liability for waste has been up for debate at all, and the fact that manufacturers' liability is soon to become a reality is to be welcomed."
"The compromise reached on heavy metals is also a giant step towards an environmentally friendly strategy for dealing with the flow of materials."
"I believe that this outcome, which is also excellent from a green point of view, will help encourage the motor industry to be more innovative and to begin to develop cars which can be recycled more easily."
"However, the compromise is also a slap in the face for our Chancellor and, more precisely, for the German car industry, particularly Volkswagen which has unfortunately tried to stand in the way of this Motor Directive."
"I also hope that the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, will draw the relevant lessons from this debate and, when it comes to the Directive on Electronic Waste - which is again concerned with manufacturers' liability - will also, in actual fact, try to act in the interests of the consumer. I hope too that we do not allow ourselves to be put under pressure by individual industrial interests."
"Mr President, our group is quite satisfied with the result of the conciliation, even if there is always, of course, room for a little further progress."
"Our objective has always been to obtain as soon as possible a comprehensive system for recovering end-of-life vehicles, with stringent demands in terms of recycling and a ban on dangerous substances."
"We also wanted manufacturers to be held completely liable, so that it is the manufacturers who take financial responsibility for recovery."
"Once this decision has been made, the position in a few years' time will be quite close to what we had wanted to achieve."
"What is worth noting, as far as the conciliation process is concerned, is the fact that Parliament has unfortunately slowed down this development towards manufacturer' s liability instead of speeding it up."
"It would be quite alarming if Parliament were to exchange roles and, instead of making the running, hand over that role to its opponents."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur and Mr Lange have already said, the positive outcome of this legislative procedure is useful, not just in terms of what the directive lays down but also because it marks the start of a process and there is the prospect of a gradual change across the entire manufacturing process in a sector as important as the automotive industry, and a review of the entire process, from vehicle design through to the choice of new materials and components to make proper recycling possible."
"Not only is manufacturing reconciled with environmental protection, but we are taking the first steps along the road which has been defined as the environmental conversion of the economy, in what is, I repeat, such an important industry."
"Of course, we have only achieved this result after complex negotiations with car manufacturers, who have at last agreed to bear the financial burden of scrapping cars as from 2007."
"Lastly, it is important to highlight another point too, which is of a more specific political-institutional nature."
"Let us be honest, we are all aware that we started the conciliation procedure from very opposed positions - there was even a certain amount of interinstitutional tension between Parliament and the Council - with many national differences in terms of both experience and interests."
"And yet, thanks to the commitment and sense of responsibility of all concerned, we reached a consensus in a difficult, major and highly controversial field, and in doing so we have added another building block in the construction of Europe."
"At this point in time, in terms of the more general debate currently underway, this is a significant result."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to end-of-life vehicles, we have reached a sound compromise."
"For the first time, European legislation defines manufacturer' s liability in no uncertain terms."
"In 1994, the packaging directive provided for liability to be shared between the government and manufacturers."
"This has proved ineffective in practice."
"We are now dealing with manufacturer' s liability in the case of end-of-life vehicles."
"I welcome this for it will be in the interests of manufacturers to produce their cars in such a way that they can be recycled more easily."
"Unfortunately, the text stipulates that the manufacturer will be wholly or mainly responsible."
"This means that systems will be set up which differ from country to country, which is unfortunate, as this runs counter to the internal market idea."
"In the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive, this must be regulated more effectively."
"We need to move towards individual manufacturer' s liability."
"My own country, the Netherlands, has a great deal to learn in this respect."
"Mr President, it is true that the legislative procedure has been long and difficult, and I have said so."
"It should be noted that the Commission's initial proposal was presented in July 1997."
"During this prolonged procedure and in spite of the complexity of the legislation, it has been possible to solve a series of problems thanks to the colegislators and, once again, to the three institutions' will to come to an agreement."
"I am therefore pleased with the agreement on a joint text, reached on 23 May this year at the Conciliation Committee."
"I would particularly like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, and to the members of the said committee."
"I am sure that the joint text represents a good balance between the need to guarantee a high level of environmental protection and the legitimate concerns of the various participants."
"I would, however, like to emphasise three statements that the Commission will make when it adopts the directive."
"The aim of these three is to make some clarifications which the Commission considers to be essential."
"Firstly, the provision laid down in Article 5(1) does not oblige the Member States to establish separate collection systems with special funding requirements, but allows them to use the existing waste collection systems."
"Second, with regard to Article 5(3), it is the responsibility of the Member States to decide which producers, concessionaries and collectors must be registered in accordance with the framework directive on waste or in a new register created specifically."
"Third, I would like to clarify that Article 7(1) does not lay down requirements, conditions or additional criteria in relation to the technical inspection of vehicles."
"Generally speaking, this text constitutes a significant step towards sustainable production and consumption, a model for future Community initiatives in the field of specific waste management such as, for example, the directive on electrical and electronic waste, to which reference has been made."
"Many thanks, Mr President. Once again, I congratulate all the speakers and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, on the work carried out."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Air transport and the environment"
"The next item is the report (A5-0187/2000) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Air Transport and the Environment [COM(1999) 640 - C5-0086/2000 - 2000/2054 (COS)]."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on a very timely and far-reaching communication which explicitly acknowledges the rapidly growing environmental impact of air transport and clearly recognises that this growth is unsustainable."
"Before coming to the proposals contained in my report, it would be helpful to remind ourselves of some of the key issues in this debate."
"Essentially, the problem can be expressed very simply: aviation is growing at an unsustainable rate."
"It is a serious environmental threat and not only is it a problem, but we are actually subsidising that sector, which is making the situation very much worse."
"In terms of aviation growth, air traffic is forecast to almost double in the next 15 years."
"When you think what that means in terms of congestion and environmental impact, then clearly that is a nightmare."
"To take a case that I know well in the UK, the government's own air traffic forecasts which were published in June this year show total passenger numbers at UK airports rising from 160 million in 1998 to 400 million in just over 20 years' time."
"That increase of 240 million is equivalent to four new airports the size of London Heathrow or eight new airports the size of London Gatwick."
"Obviously the environmental consequences of such expansion would be totally unacceptable and these projections only serve to show the nonsense of assuming the possibility of continuous exponential growth."
"What are the environmental impacts of this growth?"
"On the noise side, we know that as far as ordinary people on the ground are concerned those changes that have been introduced to make individual aircraft quieter are actually in danger of being cancelled out by the increasing frequency of each noise incident."
"On the emission side, air travel is the world's fastest growing sources of greenhouse gases which cause climate change."
"That may only count for 3% of total emissions today, but by 2050 it is projected it could account for up to 15% of total global emissions or even more."
"You would think that litany of environmental problems, coupled with a projected growth that is clearly unsustainable, might have produced some measures to discourage the exponential growth of this sector, but not a bit of it."
"On the contrary, global aviation policies are actually encouraging the unrestrained growth of this sector."
"Aviation is massively subsidised."
"Unlike motor vehicles or trains, airlines pay no tax on their fuel."
"Indeed it has been calculated that the European aviation sector receives about EUR 30 billion in subsidies every year."
"To mention some of the key points of my report very briefly: on noise, current noise standards for new aircraft have actually been in existence since 1977 and there is therefore an urgent need for more stringent standards."
"I am recommending that the EU uses the World Health Organisation's own guidelines for Community noise to develop new guidelines for daytime and night-time exposure by 2003."
"On emissions, a perfectly feasible target for the developed countries would be to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 5% on 1992 levels by 2012, which is the first budget period according to the Kyoto Protocol."
"This would be a first step to reverse the current exemption of international aviation from responsibilities."
"On subsidies, the report makes it clear that in principle we support the taxing of aircraft fuel at an international level, but we recognise that there are political difficulties with this because of the need to get international agreements at ICAO."
"In the light of those political difficulties, we are proposing instead an environmental charge based on the polluter-pays principle."
"In fact, such a charge would be a more subtle instrument since it could actually be calculated to reflect both the amount of fuel used and also, by factoring in the efficiency of the aircraft's engine, the amount of pollutants generated."
"Indeed the political difficulties of introducing such a measure would disappear since it is perfectly within the rights of the EU to introduce a levy on all flights starting from airports in the EU."
"One final but very important point, you will hear the airlines say that all this is very well but it should be undertaken by ICAO, the international body."
"The fact that it is an international body means that it moves at a very slow pace and what the Commission communication proposes - and what I endorse in my report - is the principle that some of the more industrialised regions like the EU should be able to move more swiftly towards more stringent standards than other regions like the developing countries."
"This does not spell the end of ICAO."
"What it does is to introduce some flexibility into ICAO which is perfectly consistent with other international organisations. Others do just the same thing."
"The reaction of the airlines is to ask why we are picking on them."
"In fact, clearly the opposite is the case."
"The airlines have been getting away with not paying their way for over 50 years."
"Meanwhile, other Members of this House are quick to claim that the measures I propose will have devastating effects on the European aviation sector."
"That is nonsense."
"An environmental charge along the lines I have described would not have adverse effects on competition because it is levied on all airlines using EU airports regardless of their origin."
"They claim it will have crippling effects on the European economy and that too is nonsense."
"The aviation sector is responsible for some jobs but it should not be forgotten that making aviation pay its way in terms of taxation will create thousands of jobs in other sectors."
"So I commend this report to you."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that all Members of this House care deeply about the environment despite the fact that the rapporteur and members of the Greens would have you believe otherwise."
"Environmental concerns must, however, be balanced against the needs of the aviation industry to ensure its success in the future."
"I was disappointed with the report from the Commission, not least because it was so negative towards aviation."
"Unfortunately this has been built upon by the rapporteur."
"I would like to assist honourable Members by pointing out the following information: air transport is responsible for generating 25 million direct jobs world-wide."
"In the United Kingdom alone aviation is responsible for supporting nearly 500 000 jobs."
"The United Kingdom transports GBP 35 billion worth of exports, maintaining unrivalled access to global markets and contributes around GBP 3 billion per annum to the exchequer."
"If multiplied by the number of countries in the European Union one can see and understand just how important this industry is to our economies."
"In terms of environmental impact, aviation uses less than 8% of the land required for rail and less than 1% required for road use."
"In practical terms, aside from maritime transport, aviation is the only form of international transport now transporting a third of all goods world-wide."
"Over the past 15 years CO2 emissions have declined by 70% and unburned hydrocarbons by 85%."
"Aviation is responsible for just 2.5% of CO2 emissions."
"Short-term measures are available, such as tackling the 44% air traffic flow management delays and 30 bottlenecks which take place over France, Italy, Spain and parts of Germany."
"National governments must take action now."
"They should also tackle land planning around existing airports and take responsibility for their decisions in the past."
"To suggest that either a tax on kerosene, which is internationally exempt from tax for the aviation industry, or VAT on tickets or aircraft purchases is the answer is incorrect."
"The industry already pays all its infrastructure charges, some of which go towards environmental improvements."
"It is not subsidised."
"Finally, if Mrs Lucas' proposals were passed, they would decimate the aviation industry: aviation, tourism, businesses and the aerospace industry."
"Their supporters would love to abolish cheap flights."
"In short, they would make Europe uncompetitive and give Americans and overseas carriers an unfair advantage."
"I would hope in future the proposals from the Commission are thought through more carefully."
"Otherwise its members may find that flying to or from Brussels or Strasbourg or on holiday, for that matter, with a European carrier may not be an option."
"Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas."
"My group has not proposed any further amendments for this plenary discussion."
"This means that we agree with the thrust of the report, and I would like to dissociate myself somewhat from the comments made by Mrs Foster, suggesting that the Commission proposals or those included in the report would spell disaster for aviation."
"I do not think you should try to block a sound environmental policy by making this type of threat."
"The Commission statement on aviation and the environment is a first step towards better European legislation."
"This is needed given the growth in aviation and, along with it, the growth in environmental pollution caused by it."
"We therefore endorse the key points of the Commission proposals."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is all for imposing European rules on the aviation industry and making it pay for the environmental pollution which it causes."
"As Mrs Lucas has already stated, we do not want aviation to be given preferential treatment."
"But today we are merely tracing an outline."
"What conditions must European legislation meet?"
"We will then look forward to the further regulatory and legislative proposals which will also contain the details and specific standards."
"So what are the guiding principles of the Group of the Party of European Socialists?"
"We are at any rate of the opinion that rapid growth in aviation leads to the creation of more and better train alternatives, to give an example in terms of short-distance travel."
"I believe that the shift from one mode of transport to another which is more environmentally-friendly is of great importance."
"We do not think that capacity growth in aviation is unlimited."
"Secondly, we would like European noise standards: in the interests of the public and to discourage competition between certain airports."
"Noise at night should, in our opinion, be given more attention and we share Mrs Lucas' view that, in the development of standards and more detailed rules, the standards of the World Health Organisation should come first."
"Accordingly, we are expecting ambitious proposals from the European Commission."
"The third point naturally relates to emissions, the emission of pollution to be precise, which, in our view, should be tackled as well."
"This is also why we support the principle of a tax on kerosene."
"However, the viability of these ideas and proposals is questionable."
"As stated in the report, we would like international consultation and further research."
"Since the outcome of this research is uncertain, we support the fall-back position, as formulated in Paragraph 20 of the report, in the form of a European environmental levy."
"In the final analysis, what matters is for us to follow the Kyoto agreements, and aviation should contribute substantially in this respect."
"We prefer to have effective agreements on noise and emission worldwide, but should these not materialise, we certainly will not rule out a European policy."
"I believe that that is also an important element in the report, and it has been formulated clearly in our view."
"We hope that international consultation will bear some fruit."
"Should this not be the case, we feel that we should be able to table European rules in a few years' time."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report."
"It is indeed the case that aviation is growing rapidly."
"I share Mrs Foster' s view that aviation is a major economic sector, a sector which provides services which are irreplaceable up to a point."
"At the same time, however, it is abundantly clear that such a sector also brings with it a number of adverse environmental effects, such as noise and air pollution, and that we need to invite the sector to take a pro-active approach in dealing with this issue as quickly as possible, more so than is the case at present."
"Both the Commission statement and Mrs Lucas' report provide guidelines as to how this can and must be done."
"I would like to highlight a few points."
"It is clear, as Mr Wiersma has already stated, that the different modes of transport - road, train, etc. and also aviation - must be treated the same way as much as possible, which is not the case at the moment."
"There are specific reasons for this, but something must be done about the matter."
"I believe that it is clear that, in tackling the problems of noise, standards, tax on kerosene, etc, we should certainly at the present time opt for a worldwide approach."
"A regional approach is premature at the moment, and I am pleased that the rapporteur has amended a number of her points in the original text to this effect."
"In my opinion, the European Union does not need to take any unilateral measures at the moment, if I can put it that way."
"There are important negotiations under way, Commissioner, which will have a positive outcome, or at least we can still be hopeful of this."
"I believe that this is a factor of importance."
"Another important point is that noise must be tackled by means of a package of measures."
"Hence my amendment to provide details of these measures."
"I have also tabled an amendment to develop a common method of measurement which will enable us to curb competition between different airports, as referred to by Mr Wiersma."
"It is, of course, important for competition between airports not to have any adverse effects on the people who live in the vicinity and on the environment."
"I believe that this is a factor of importance and that is why we need European regulations in order to prevent competition between the different airports."
"Mr President, at the present time the United Kingdom has rates of fuel duty which are spectacularly higher than in other parts of the European Union."
"One of the effects of this is particularly detrimental to the peripheral parts of the country."
"It has a disproportionately distorting effect on competition, affecting local firms in the periphery competing against large multinationals in the UK."
"That is an important caveat to put down about ways in which fuel taxes can distort local economies."
"I do not think there is a good environmental argument for trying to drive most of the population of the United Kingdom into the bottom south-east corner."
"I did not enter politics to repeat the Highland clearances."
"That said, it is also clearly absurd to exempt aviation from the duty to diminish greenhouse gases and ozone depletion and it is also a good thing to look towards an equality of taxation across the European Union, as Mrs Lucas has done, rather than grossly distorting differentials between different parts."
"I have considerable reservations about how this will work in practice, but we should welcome the principle that Mrs Lucas has put forward."
"Mr President, the fight against noise pollution and gaseous emissions is a just fight, which we support, as it pursues the objectives of citizens' well-being and environmental quality."
"Nonetheless, the reduction of these noise or gaseous emissions must be limited to the commendable search for technical solutions that are to everyone's advantage."
"It must not serve as a pretext for other objectives in the field of tax or for extending the competence of the Commission."
"The latter should instead concentrate on correctly carrying out its already vast range of tasks."
"In these circumstances, we cannot accept the instigation of this eco-tax."
"This first step towards a European tax will only affect passengers, once again, without achieving any of this report' s objectives."
"Our citizens are already squeezed hard by taxes and, at a time when the Member States are trying to reduce taxation, a European tax could put our businesses in a difficult position in relation to their competitors, in particular American businesses or others, with numerous disastrous consequences for employment."
"We cannot accept this."
"Furthermore, we demand that tax subsidiarity in favour of the Member States be observed."
"Europe, rather than artificially swelling its budget by means of this tax, should use this budget more effectively, with respect for the freedom of the individual."
"The political dependency of the Member States depends in large part on their freedom in terms of tax."
"The eco-tax will solve nothing."
"This is a purely ideological measure, with no direct effect on the environment."
"We would prefer a rational measure that respects the interests of the individual and favours economic development while fully respecting the environment."
"Mr President, where air traffic too is concerned, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats supports the initiative of the European Commission and of the responsible Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, to reconcile causing as little damage as possible to the environment with citizens' and companies' interest in being able to travel."
"The Committee too has made a decision along the same lines, although we ought in all honesty to say that we had completely to re-write Mrs Lucas' report, since it was based upon totally unrealistic premisses."
"However, we finally reached a majority agreement."
"The summer has again shown how important air travel is for people heading for their holiday destinations."
"Particularly where families with children are concerned, air travel offers the quickest means of getting away to the sun, and the one which puts least strain on the nerves."
"At the same time, it provides the basis for jobs and businesses in many parts of the European Union."
"Business travel and freight forwarding on international air routes are also vital to trade and commerce."
"On the other hand, air travel has an obvious detrimental effect upon the environment due to exhaust emissions and noise pollution."
"We must make sure that we limit these forms of damage to the environment, at the same time, however, as distinguishing between the damage caused to health around airports and the ways in which people' s ordinary well-being is prejudiced."
"I fear that, if we were to adopt the WHO' s regulations, none of us here this evening would be allowed to go on working, since more than ten hours spent in this Chamber is scarcely compatible with these regulations."
"So let us be realistic, please."
"The Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats in any case calls for a significant reduction in permitted levels of noise pollution - which, in view of the international character of air travel, ought more sensibly to be regulated within the framework of the ICAO - and for noisier aircraft to be excluded from using European airports following brief transitionary periods."
"We hope, and are campaigning for, a situation in which the Member States of the European Commission will provide a clear mandate."
"If, however, we were not to obtain success at ICAO level, then we should have to take action ourselves, for Europe is densely populated and we do not have the luxury of the large distances between population centres that are to be found in America or Africa."
"We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise."
"Mr President, we know that traffic emissions are one of the greatest environmental problems we have and they have also proved to be one of the hardest to get rid of."
"That is because the volume of traffic is growing even faster than the economy."
"In this sense the problems of air traffic are still greater because we have to find global solutions for them."
"On the other hand, we have heard that the Kyoto Protocol does not contain provisions concerning air traffic emissions."
"Furthermore, air traffic problems are not discussed in the directive on ceilings for emissions which is under consideration."
"Being in this situation we really have to channel greater efforts into the work that is done in ICAO and its environmental protection committee, which drafts international environmental norms."
"This is a regrettably slow process, but we have to be able to set objectives that are sufficiently ambitious in scope and create negotiating mandates to be able to make progress accordingly."
"In my opinion it would not be a bad idea if the developed, industrialised countries, including the European Union, were to set an example in this matter."
"It is important to develop engine technology, as a decline in the volume of traffic is not foreseeable."
"We will have to have recourse to different acts, environmental taxes, charges and administrative measures, for example regulation of departure and arrival times, taking account of the fact that rail traffic exists alongside air traffic in areas where long distances are not a hindrance, and that must be developed."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise the importance of the aim to use efficient, alternative transport, in place of short flights, which was mentioned in this report."
"For example, high speed trains, and, in some cases, short sea crossings offer a more environment-friendly alternative to short flights."
"This will be vital to ease congestion at airports and for environmental reasons too."
"Replacing short flights with alternative forms of transport will make room for long haul flights, for which there is no alternative."
"In Parliament we discussed several reports before the summer recess that aimed at improving the competitiveness of railways and sea transport."
"In addition to improving rail and sea transport competitiveness, we also need to take other action."
"One possibility is an environmental charge specially designed for air traffic."
"It should be introduced in such a way that the charge would be less for the unavoidable long haul journeys than it would for short flights for which there is a more environment-friendly alternative."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is the third in a series which deals with the air transport situation."
"Whilst the previous two focused on the freedom and growth potential within aviation, this one highlights the downside, justifiably so, in my opinion."
"As I have already indicated when we discussed the Atkins report, the measures which are currently being drafted for aviation only provide short-term answers."
"They cannot provide a lasting solution for the problems of congestion and environmental pollution."
"This report looks beyond the near future, which is why I would like to congratulate Mrs Lucas."
"It is not an unnecessary exercise to indicate the pre-conditions within which aviation should function, both in terms of space and the environment."
"This, however, does require sufficient expertise and alternatives."
"At present, there is room for considerable improvement with regard to both of these aspects."
"This should not deter us, however, from sketching the outlines for the future and to expect this to be done internationally."
"This report sets the right tone for this, especially for the benefit of the Commission."
"Despite our positive attitude to this report, there are a number of elements which, in my opinion, do not belong in a report such as this one."
"I am referring to the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens and the regionalists."
"They may seem like a kind gesture, but these matters are better dealt with by the Member States."
"Mr President, this Parliament would not be able to function without aviation, which according to some might not be such a bad thing."
"But we need to focus all our efforts on how we can minimise the effects of the rapid growth within this sector on the environment."
"I would like to highlight a number of points."
"In my opinion, the European Union should support the ICAO process."
"Only within the context of this international body is it possible to discuss tighter rules for noise generated by aircraft."
"We should however urge caution."
"Proposing new standards has a huge impact on the European aviation industry as a whole."
"In concrete terms, a standard considerably stricter than the current one would mean that out of the present European fleet of 3,300 aircraft, 1,067 would need to be replaced."
"Such a rapid and forced decommissioning would make it practically impossible to replace these aircraft with new ones, due to, among other things, the small production capacity for new aircraft."
"We only have two manufacturers."
"The consequences for European aviation are not hard to imagine."
"It would need to surrender part of the market to its competitors, and it is very questionable whether this would benefit our safety."
"Furthermore, it would lead to a considerable reduction in employment, with all the problems that this entails."
"Air fares would go up."
"I am very aware that this would be a bonus for some, but do remember that, for airline passengers who need to travel short distances, there is still no real alternative, contrary to what one of my fellow MEPs just stated, to the effect that we would all much prefer to see such passengers travel by train.."
"Member States and my country in particular, the Netherlands, are extremely slow in introducing high-speed trains which could form a viable alternative for short-distance travel."
"Aircraft manufacturers should be put under considerable pressure to build cleaner and quieter aircraft."
"That is why the new standards cannot be put on hold forever."
"We will try to exert this pressure at international level but we will run out of patience at some stage."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words on noise-sensitive airports."
"In my opinion, measurements should be taken in a truly objective manner and complaints from those living in the vicinity should not be the only point of reference."
"An international standard needs to be established, but some airports, which do not cause any pollution whatsoever to those living in the vicinity, should be exempt so that they are not hindered in their development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think we are all convinced that we have an obligation and a duty to protect the environment and contribute to sustainable development with an environmental policy that has seen its importance increased subsequent to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I agree with the Commission on drawing up more stringent standards on noise and also on establishing transitional provisions to satisfy the needs of the regions that are confronted with noise pollution problems."
"We also believe that it is essential for us to participate as one in the 33rd assembly of the ICAO in autumn 2001, speaking with one voice because, without a doubt, there is strength in unity and on subjects as important as the tightening of standards against noise it is vital."
"It would also be important to ask the Commission to present proposals for the introduction of economic incentives aimed at achieving a reduction of the negative effects on the environment."
"Naturally, what we do not agree on is the unilateral establishment of tax on kerosene, as a unilateral decision without the backing of the ICAO would have a minimal impact on the environment, would create legal problems, would damage competition among European airlines and would consequently affect users, who would see their tariffs rise."
"It would also be essential that, before taking any measures with regard to the adoption of taxes on the aviation industry, a study should be carried out on the costs and benefits that these measures would imply."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the importance of efficient management in the aviation industry in reducing pollutants, placing the emphasis on improving airport management and clearly supporting the creation of a single European sky, by means of which we would also undoubtedly contribute to reducing environmental pollution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give Mrs Lucas credit for her report."
"I mean her original version."
"She is right when she points out that if the volume of air traffic continues its rapid growth it will be absolutely necessary to take measures to control the problems it causes."
"It is part of sustainable development to reduce emissions and bring noise levels down."
"The report gained the support of everyone in the committee."
"The amendments made to it, however, throw the baby out with the bath water."
"The original report was a natural extension of previous EU legislation, but if the amendments are adopted it will mean enormous financial losses for European companies that have taken investment decisions on the basis of EU acts."
"For example, the time span for noise reduction is very long."
"The time that passes between the decisions taken and implementation can be up to two years."
"But now some excellent aircraft which have just been modified in accordance with Chapter 3 would have to be scrapped in four years' time."
"The citizens and companies of the Community must be able to have confidence in legislation, as continual shifting of the goalposts undermines long-term plans."
"The resultant costs weaken the area' s air transport competitiveness as compared with airlines outside the EU, and, at the same time, in fact, makes it harder to adopt environment-friendly technology in the airlines based within the EU."
"What is economically realistic about demands for new technology in the name of environmental protection to replace aircraft which are still serviceable and in good condition?"
"On the contrary, this sort of action will constitute a burden on the environment, as materials will have to be produced and aircraft built before the economic lifetime of existent equipment is up."
"In addition, scrapping serviceable aircraft will mean an additional burden on the environment."
"Drafting radically new regulations on aircraft noise has to happen globally and under the auspices of ICAO, and careful, long-term community and town planning consequently has a key role in this."
"Finally, I would like to remind everyone that increasing fuel tax in the air transport industry would bring with it an added burden for those who live in sparsely populated countries."
"A long journey is a long way to go."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Lucas on the report that is the basis for our debate today."
"As we are all aware, the environmental consequences of air transport have recently attracted a great deal of interest."
"At local level, the debates surrounding airport development are increasingly determined by environmental considerations relating to noise abatement and air quality improvement in areas surrounding airports."
"Many citizens living in these areas believe that much more could be done to improve their situation and that is what they are demanding."
"Furthermore, the long-term impact of gases from air transport on climate change is undoubtedly a cause of concern in the world today, as is the impact of other types of emissions."
"The air transport system must therefore be handled globally and coherently, from an environmental point of view, that is, we must also take account of aspects relating to the activity of air transport."
"We must try to reconcile interests that are not always easy to reconcile as air transport undoubtedly involves economic interests that are characterised by high investment costs which require a long life span before they are paid off."
"For example, an aircraft requires a much longer life span than other types of investment in order to be adequately paid off."
"This requires a stable operating environment with no ups and downs or modifications that change the rules of the game and may have disastrous economic consequences for the functioning of aviation companies."
"A sector based on extremely expensive technology, with a rapid rate of growth, has an immediate effect on employment in ancillary sectors, such as research, industry and tourism."
"In my opinion, trying to safeguard the environment by simply slowing down growth in the aeronautical sector and the air industry is not a valid option."
"But there is no doubt that the public, not only people in the surrounding area who suffer most directly from certain types of pollution such as noise or even emissions, but the public in general, who want sustainable development and quality of life, has a right to demand action from us to guarantee this type of growth that should be the European model."
"In its communication on air transport and the environment, the Commission maintains that the aviation industry needs to increase its efforts to improve the environmental quality of new aircraft being built."
"If the current rate of growth is maintained, the improvements needed to compensate for the anticipated environmental impact of the increase in air traffic will not be made."
"I know this message is not well received in many parts of the sector but, without a doubt, in the medium and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want air transport to become a victim of its own success."
"The Commission, however, is aware that the air transport sector is correct in saying that before carrying out environmental measures, a serious in-depth study must be done on the economic and social repercussions that these measures will have."
"I have the impression that today, those most concerned by the environment are accepting, little by little, but more and more, the fact that in order to develop a definite environmental policy, account must be taken of the balance between the cost and effectiveness of the measures proposed."
"The report we have before us considers these fundamental issues and takes account of both the need to reinforce environmental protection beyond routine efforts and the profitability analysis factor."
"I would like to thank Mrs Lucas for the efforts made to achieve flexibility, as it is clear from her amendments that this is not exactly what she would like as a report, but she is looking for a compromise that makes parliamentary approval possible."
"For example, what she says on kerosene seems to me to be a reasonable way of presenting this problem, which undoubtedly cannot be solved at European level, but at world-wide level and by the ICAO."
"For it is in aviation, ladies and gentlemen, the industry in which globalisation is more evident than in any other, that these issues must be resolved."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the support she gives the Commission in the report, and say that we find ourselves at a difficult stage of the debate on new noise standards and on legislation which gradually eliminates the noisiest aircraft, within the framework of the ICAO."
"On many occasions, we have indicated our preference for an international solution to these problems, and the Commission has noted with satisfaction the positive development of the United States' stance in relation to the standardisation process that is taking place in the ICAO."
"I have to say that the legislation on the so-called ""hushkits"" , with regard to the noisiest aircraft, adopted in its day by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, was based precisely on the fact that the United States had adopted unilateral measures outside the ICAO."
"There is no doubt that it is within the ICAO that this work needs to be done."
"We shall coordinate the actions of the various Member States within the CAEP, given that it is the Member States that are the signatories of the ICAO, and I hope that Parliament will support initiatives such as the single sky, to which Mr Ojeda referred, which, naturally, will also have consequences for kerosene saving, if it can be implemented, and the improvement in the allocation and general management of slots."
"Mr President, once again I thank everyone for the work carried out in trying to obtain a realistic and flexible text that is acceptable to the various parties."
"We await Parliament's vote, to which the Commission will pay great attention."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Tyres for motor vehicles and trailers"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0218/00), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting [C5-0220/2000 - 1997/0348(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr De Roo)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to talk about noise generated by car tyres."
"Noise is an environmental and health problem which is underestimated."
"Tyres cause a nuisance to one third of the citizens in Europe who complain about it, compared to one quarter of the citizens ten years ago."
"The problem of noise is therefore escalating, especially road and aircraft noise."
"At first reading, the European Parliament was wrong not to react to the feeble proposals from the European Commission."
"For example, the European Commission' s proposal did not contain a review clause."
"All environmental proposals made by the European Commission contain a review clause, but not this one."
"This is hardly surprising given the fact that this proposal was drafted by the DG for Industry."
"In the Council, this environmental matter was wrongly dealt with by the Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Internal Market."
"It should have been dealt with in the Council of Ministers for the Environment."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has tabled 4 amendments with 32 votes against 10 votes."
"With regard to ordinary passenger cars, we suggest that the limit is reduced by 2 decibels."
"The German independent inspection body, TÜV, has tested numerous existing car tyres."
"They all meet the ineffective noise limits proposed by the Council."
"A reduction of 2 decibels is technically possible without jeopardising safety."
"This has also been confirmed by experts of the Swedish institute for roads and traffic."
"With regard to vans and lorries, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection also suggests reducing the noise level by 2 decibels."
"Vans and lorries produce more noise than ordinary cars. This is why it is important to make the necessary changes here too, and I hope that a number of the Christian-Democrat MEPs will be able to vote in favour of this."
"The tyre industry has been given until October 2005 to meet stricter noise limits."
"This seems ample time to me."
"More is required, of course, in order to reduce the noise from road traffic."
"The noise level from 'fluisterasfalt' [silent asphalt], as it is termed by our Flemish friends, or 'ZOAB, zeer open asfaltbeton' [very open asphalt concrete], as we like to refer to it in the Netherlands, is probably 20 decibels lower than that from cobblestone roads."
"Our motorways are no longer paved with cobblestones, but a reduction of 3 to 5 decibels is possible by introducing this type of asphalt everywhere."
"We will be returning to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise."
"Silent asphalt and a change of tyre could help reduce the noise level by 6 decibels, which may not seem a great deal, but one should remember that decibels are a logarithmic table."
"This means that the noise level can be cut by more than half without reducing the volume of traffic."
"Cars inherently cause a large number of environmental problems."
"More than 10 years ago, the European Parliament introduced the first generation of catalytic converters and, two years ago, the second generation of catalytic converters appeared in the Langen/Hautala report on the motor oil programme."
"As a result, air pollution caused by cars and lorries will drop by 70% to 90% in 2005 and 2007."
"Similarly, we found a sound solution to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles in the Florenz report."
"There are now two major environmental issues left to tackle at European level."
"The first one is noise, which I have dealt with extensively, and the second one is the CO2 or the greenhouse problem."
"With regard to CO2, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has suggested that the European Commission submit a legislative proposal to reduce the rolling resistance of tyres by 5%."
"This means that 5% less fuel will be used and that the emission of CO2 will also fall by the same amount."
"I would welcome a positive reaction from the European Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the general lines along which this Directive is discussed are of little concern to me."
"I am no lawyer and am not in a position to judge."
"What is true is that insufficient account has so far been taken of environmental interests."
"Just in the last three days, the car and tyre industries have indicated in this Chamber that their options may well be open when it comes specifically to car tyres."
"My group is not at present overly concerned about whether the figure is to be 1, 3 or 4 decibels, but we should like to make it clear that we want positively to force the tyre industry to act and do more of what is required of them in this area."
"The motor oil, car and recycling industries have made a lot of things possible where road use by individuals is concerned."
"In contrast, the tyre industry has largely refrained from taking action."
"It is in this area that we want them to do some catching up."
"We shall doubtless at some stage also have to talk about alternative road surfaces in Europe."
"I believe that this is a positive way of forcing the tyre industry to act."
"I should therefore like straight away to forestall some of my fellow MEPs who now and again stand up jokingly and say that Mr Florenz wants a reduction of two decibels where possible but is accepting a 10 metres longer braking distance in return."
"Obviously, we want to maintain standards."
"We expect innovation."
"We expect the tyre industry to employ young engineers of both sexes and finally to go some way towards meeting people' s justified demands to be exposed to less noise in their homes."
"That is a task we have set ourselves, and I hope that the Commission will be prepared to cooperate."
"It is possible, as we shall see in one or two years' time, that the industry will be able to achieve these objectives of ours by the year 2005."
"If that were not possible, I am the very first to concede that we need to broaden our field of operations somewhat."
"But the industry must be forced to act, and that is what we shall be campaigning for at the present time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is a well-known fact that you are not entirely averse to cars yourselves and also enjoy driving."
"It would therefore be a jolly good idea if, merely by being fitted with new tyres, our own cars were to cause 40% less noise and, at the same time, use 5% less fuel and also emit less CO2."
"This is the road we should be going down."
"There are already tyres whose specifications are well below the values proposed in the common position when it comes both to tyre noise and to the rolling resistance which is responsible for petrol consumption and CO2 emissions."
"There are even tyres to which the Federal Republic of Germany awards a Blue Angel as a sign of environmental friendliness because they are a model of quiet operation and give rise to low petrol consumption."
"Now, these tyres are not particularly unsafe."
"On the contrary."
"Michelin and Dunlop tyres even make for shorter braking distances while remaining quiet and preserving fuel economy."
"I am therefore wondering why this Parliament cannot summon up the courage to say that whatever is now already state of the art technology is what we demand by 2005 for all tyres, particularly those fitted to private cars."
"I should therefore like strongly to request that we adopt Amendment No 1, through which we call for limit values not only for tyre noise but also for rolling resistance, and that we adopt, in particular, Amendment No 2 in connection with quieter tyres."
"I would ask you to consider that this does not yet mean the end of the negotiations."
"We are entering into the negotiations in the Conciliation Committee with the Council, and we shall then see what emerges."
"However, we must also have room for manoeuvre."
"Mr President, before I start on the subject of tyre noise, may I make a more general point to the Commission."
"They are bringing forward far too much legislation and, with legislation, quality is usually in inverse proportion to quantity."
"We talk of doing less and doing it better."
"In fact we do more, and we do it worse."
"Now turning to tyres."
"I little thought when I came to this House that I would end up defending the Commission's position - and yet the Commission has done its homework."
"It has consulted with the industry."
"It has come up with a proposal that sets challenging, but achievable, targets which protect the environment whilst also recognising the interests of road users and tyre makers."
"Some of our colleagues are seeking to sabotage this careful work by demanding arbitrary and ill-considered decibel reductions."
"In some cases their figures are achievable, in others not."
"But they have forgotten that changes in the production specifications of tyres affect not only noise, but also grip, safety, fuel economy, cost and durability."
"They may end up with quieter tyres that are expensive, that wear out quickly and that allow cars to slide off the road and crash into trees!"
"Let me speak plainly."
"More road users will die if Mr de Roo's amendments are passed."
"The electors I represent will not thank us."
"We are being far too prescriptive."
"It is our job to set a broad legislative framework in the public interest."
"Instead, we seek to micro-manage a highly technical and complex industrial development programme, a task for which we have neither the time nor the skills."
"I call on colleagues to reject the amendments and support the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, I welcome this proposal."
"It is long overdue."
"Certainly the amendments to it by my colleagues Mr de Roo and Mr Lange are moving in the right direction."
"Since the first publication of this directive back in 1997 the manufacturers have moved to meet the Commission standards."
"I understand the desire of my colleague, Mr de Roo, to take the standards further."
"However, I have to sound a note of caution."
"Firstly, tyre standards are not the only problem."
"The nature of the road surface is just as important and in particular circumstances like noise hotspots in urban areas perhaps more important than trying to change the tyre standards."
"In many cases a better solution is to change the road surface and not the tyre standards."
"Secondly - and in my opinion of paramount importance - is the need to balance the problem of tyre noise and tyre safety."
"Whilst we are tonight seeking to adopt new tyre standards to reduce tyre noise we are not making any progress at all on tyre standards for the grip or adhesion of tyres on the road."
"Despite good and serious proposals being put on the table some considerable time ago by the UK, they have not yet been agreed or seriously considered."
"Our failure to agree tyre safety standards creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty with regard to this vital question."
"For that reason I am particularly concerned about the potential effects of Amendments Nos 3 and 4 and their impact upon tyre safety, especially for vehicles such as buses and trucks."
"In the circumstances I feel bound to say that I personally cannot give my support to Mr de Roo's Amendments Nos 3 and 4."
"I suggest to him that they are premature and I would ask the Commission to reject them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to Mr de Roo for the work he has done."
"The reduction of any kind of noise is important both for people' s health and their comfort."
"For that reason, I feel very positive about the Council' s common position with regard to tyre noise."
"I am by no means acting as spokesman here for the tyre industry, but, having watched that industry very closely, I nevertheless wish to express my concern about the effect the amendments will have."
"The tyre industry is a very fiercely competitive industry, and one that is competitive on a global scale. It is responsible for some very thorough development work and, owing to the nature of tyre technology, it is progressing slowly but surely."
"The situation will become untenable, however, if there is an attempt to bring in changes too fast, as would seem to be the case on this occasion."
"If things move too quickly it will mean immense technical problems for the industry, with unnecessary extra costs, which will be reflected in the prices of the products."
"The consumer is always the one that has to pay."
"An adequate transition period, however, will guarantee that the new requirements are taken account of at the development stage."
"Any other course of action would be a waste of resources, because it would take on average three to four years to develop a new tyre model."
"The issue becomes especially problematic when we consider that a tyre is a very delicate product in terms of balancing its individual properties."
"It is not really just black and round, as the layman thinks."
"When one property of the tyre is improved, it affects the others adversely, so tyre design is really a question of optimising compromises."
"For example, a broad tyre holds well on asphalt, but tends to start skimming over water easily."
"On the other hand, a narrow tyre works well on snow."
"If a tyre' s noise properties were to be essentially improved it would above all impair its ability to hold the road in wet conditions."
"I want my fellowmen to drive on safe tyres, above all."
"I wish the tyre industry and the EU legislators would get together and draw up a realistic timetable for the excellent objectives outlined in this report."
"Mr President, the aim of this proposal for a directive is to limit tyre/road noise without sacrificing grip and therefore road-holding and braking safety."
"In preparing the proposal, the Commission consulted several bodies independent from the manufacturers, who worked with experts from the Member States for a long time in order to find the appropriate level of strictness on decibels for the various categories of tyres for cars, vans and lorries."
"As a result of this extensive prior consultation of experts, the Member States have unanimously approved the level of strictness chosen in the proposal as a common position."
"The European Parliament itself showed its satisfaction with the level of strictness of the proposal and did not table any amendments."
"First of all, it should be noted that the quality of the road surface is, to a great extent, up to 6 decibels, responsible for the noise generated by tyre contact."
"It should also be made clear that the Commission is continuing with the measures launched two years ago to combat the various sources of noise, covering every sector of activity of the European Union."
"Now, at the second reading, 4 amendments have been tabled."
"Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4 propose the reduction of noise thresholds by 2 decibels."
"If this reduction of 2 decibels were implemented today, more than 70% of tyres currently on the market would not pass the test."
"Manufacturers would therefore be obliged to urgently modify the structure of the tyre and the hardness of the rubber by reducing the grip."
"Until grip requirements are applied, these three amendments are therefore unacceptable."
"This correlation between noise and rolling, tyre grip and fuel consumption is rightly at the centre of the concern expressed in Amendment No 1."
"This concern is currently the subject of the search for a consensus in a working party for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, a working party monitored by the staff of the European Commission."
"This matter is also the subject of discussion in the Transatlantic Business Dialogue to promote the emergence of a Global Type Standard GTS 2000."
"The European Commission is following this work with the intention of transposing the results into Directive 92/23/EEC in order to determine the correct balance between safety, noise and resistance."
"Unfortunately, however, the proposed timetable is too strict."
"The wide range of products covered and the problem in all its complexity must be considered."
"It is for these reasons that Article 3, as worded in the common position, stipulates that the requirements on grip and on rolling resistance shall be integrated with the noise requirements in the extended timetable of 24 and 36 months respectively, following the entry into force of this directive."
"Amendment No 1, which proposes to legislate again on two occasions within a period of one year after the entry into force of this directive, is not acceptable."
"Due to the complexity of the methods of measuring grip on dry and wet surfaces and rolling resistance and due to the wide range of products, the results of the experts' work will not be available before 2002."
"The Commission will then be able to amend this directive in order to include grip on dry and wet surfaces and rolling resistance for all categories of tyre."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0168/2000) by Mr Bakopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the nineteenth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)[COM(1999) 620 - C5-0312/1999 - 1999/0269(COD)]."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive which we are debating today is designed to restrict the marketing and use of azocolourants used in fabric dyes and leather goods."
"The reason for the restriction is that there is good cause to believe that these substances are carcinogenic."
"The annex to the directive contains a list of fabric and leather products in which the use of these suspect substances is banned."
"Several countries have already introduced similar bans in their legislation and most companies established in the European Union fall into precisely this category."
"However, we need a directive in order to harmonise the internal market and prevent such unilateral regulations."
"Finally, as is only to be expected, the directive also contains an analytical method for detecting banned azocolourants."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy accepts the principle on which this directive is based."
"The amendments, which were adopted unanimously, therefore represent an improvement."
"I should like to refer to just two of them."
"The Committee on the Environment takes the view that the list of products in which the use of azocolourants is banned, as contained in the annex to the directive, should not be open."
"It should be a complete, closed, precise list of named products."
"This will avoid arbitrary interpretation of the directive and, as a result, a wide variety of applications, which would run counter to the principle of the single market, which this directive has been introduced to protect."
"That is the purpose of Amendment No 3."
"The second amendment to which I should like to refer is Amendment No 2, which introduces recital 7a, exempting hand-made oriental carpets from the directive."
"The reason for the exemption is that, because these carpets are hand-made, spot checks are, by definition, impossible, while separate testing of each carpet would seriously damage the product."
"Especially in cases - and they are not infrequent - of hand-made artefacts and/or works of art."
"Importers are, however, advised to develop a quality mark."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Müller tabled Amendment No 6, on time, rewording the previous recital 7a and proposing that the exemption from the scope of the directive for oriental carpets should expire on 1 January 2006."
"I think this proposal is sensible and propose that it be accepted."
"Finally, Mr Ferrer tabled Amendment No 7, again on time, proposing that the list of 21 azocolourants in the annex should include another substance, in addition to the two inserted in Amendment No 4."
"However, the substance which Mr Ferrer proposes is already included in the annex."
"Obviously, this is an oversight and I do not therefore propose that it be accepted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is a small and modest report, an amendment to a directive that I, however, believe is an important and significant example of the great success of the awareness and information policies and of the fact that the regulation often comes after society has sorted itself out."
"The fact that practically all manufacturers and producers in all the Member States have removed the products we are now trying to remove indicates that there are now many mature areas in which ideally we would not have to establish legislation, and would not find ourselves in situations like this."
"I would therefore like to emphasise, so that it may be taken down in the Minutes, that we must work to this formula where possible in a mature society and a mature industry."
"I think the exclusion of oriental carpets is marvellous, as I believe it is good that flexibility in favour of art and beauty is entering into the spirit of a legislative machine that often forgets small details."
"Furthermore, as far as I know, people do not normally tend to eat carpets, and therefore this level of risk could be avoided."
"I repeat, I believe it is positive for us to work towards progress, for society to be one step ahead of us and that all we have to do is ratify what has already been recognised."
"Mr President, in response to the rapporteur' s intervention, I should like to clear up one small point. The amendments to this report were tabled by myself."
"I just want to straighten that out because Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s name was mentioned."
"Azocolourants are dyes which release cancer-causing aromatic amines if they come into contact with human skin or with the mouth cavity."
"That was also the reason why a number of Member States issued interim regulations to protect consumers, as well as the reason for the Commission' s initiative, which we are discussing this evening, whereby azocolourants are now to be prohibited throughout the EU and a ban placed on imports of these substances from third countries."
"The draft we have from the Commission nonetheless has some gaps in it which compromise safety and which, in my opinion, need to be closed."
"That is the purpose of my amendments, to which a large majority of the committee agreed."
"We are mainly concerned with adding two further amines to the banned list because they have since been categorised as carcinogenic."
"Moreover, the general description of the area of application that has been given is too vague."
"We want an exhaustive, clearly defined list for the purpose of creating clarity and legal certainty."
"By means of the voluntary stamp of quality and the interim deadline of 1 January 2006, we have also succeeded in taking account of the special problems presented by the oriental carpets industry and, in spite of these problems, in also including hand-made oriental carpets in the directive in the medium term."
"We have also provided for an option whereby, until such time as new testing methods have been validated, two methods can be applied which take account of the differing demands which materials make upon the testing method."
"With the adoption of these amendments, which have been decided upon by a large majority of the committee, any vagueness and lack of clarity in the directive would, all in all, be removed."
"In this way, the directive would do justice to the demands which will have to be made upon it in view of the risk of actual damage to public health."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their interest in this subject and especially Mr Bakopoulos, the rapporteur, for his constructive work."
"Certain azocolourants used in textile and leather pose the risk of cancer for consumers and workers, as has been said."
"Following an opinion of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment confirming such risks, the Commission proposed in December of last year a directive restricting marketing and use of certain azocolourants which could pose a risk of cancer if they come into close contact with the skin."
"The Commission proposal for a directive would introduce a ban on the use of certain azocolourants in textile and leather articles that come into close contact with the skin."
"The colourants concerned are xylidines which may release any of the 21 cancer-causing amines listed in the proposed directive."
"Furthermore, textile or leather articles dyed with these same xylidines may not be placed on the market."
"The test methods to be used to show compliance with the provisions are specified in the proposed directive."
"The proposal provides not only for the protection of consumers' and workers' health."
"It also addresses an internal market issue."
"At the present time, the internal market is fragmented, as some Member States are already applying national bans."
"The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States."
"I would stress that the proposal is based on the results of independent studies on the risks of azocolourants and of the costs, benefits and trade effects of the proposed restrictions."
"It also takes account of the opinion of the competent Scientific Committee on Risks."
"I believe it is a proportionate measure."
"The Commission is unable to accept those Parliament amendments which would extend this ban by replacing the proposed list of examples of product categories covered by an exhaustive list by covering articles other than those made of textiles and leather and by including other amides."
"Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 7 of the Committee on the Environment are the ones I refer to."
"The Commission feels this could not be justified on the basis of the current knowledge about the risks."
"Nor is the Commission able to accept amendments that would introduce a second testing method to show compliance with the provisions."
"This applies to Amendment No 5 of the Committee on the Environment."
"These would make it more difficult for suppliers, especially in the Third World, to show compliance as the method proposed by the Commission is the method most widely accepted and used."
"However, the Commission can accept that when available a more reliable standardised testing method could be introduced."
"The Commission can accept in principle an exemption for handmade oriental carpets from the example list of product categories covered by the proposed directive as the risk from such carpets is likely to be low."
"However, the Commission cannot accept that the exemption is only temporary."
"To summarise our point of view, we can accept Amendment No 1 of the Committee on the Environment."
"We must reject six amendments, namely Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Committee on the Environment. However, the Commission can in principle support parts of Amendment No 3."
"We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament."
"I am convinced that we can reach a constructive solution."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Undeclared work"
"The next item is the report (A5-0220/2000) by Mrs Glase, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on undeclared work [COM(1998) 219 - C4-0566/1998 - 1998/2082(COD)]."
"Mr President, the report before us is a position adopted by Parliament in response to a communication from the Commission on the problems associated with undeclared or illicit work."
"This problem is being dealt with at European level because it relates not just to one particular country but to all Member States."
"What is the heart of the problem?"
"Major economic and socio-political damage is being caused in the Member States through work not being declared."
"Health insurances, pensions systems and the Treasury together lose billions every year."
"Workers are in no way insured or otherwise safeguarded."
"Thoughts of a modern slave trade with fatal consequences for those involved spring clearly and inevitably to mind."
"Those who are rewarded in some way for undeclared work have no right to claim compensation at all and no other consumer rights."
"The people concerned believe that they are at an advantage but are in fact harming only themselves and society."
"The fact is that, by definition and by its very nature, undeclared work is difficult to get to grips with in any country."
"On the basis of estimates and long-term investigations, it may be assumed that a total of 28 million people engage in undeclared work."
"The volume of undeclared work now corresponds to 15% of gross domestic product in the EU."
"The sector as a whole is growing three times as fast as the official economy."
"In the communication before this House, the Commission has problems with the analysis, as well as with the steps that need to be taken to stem the tide of undeclared work."
"Parliament has been working flat out on these problems for a long time and produced a list of causes which produce combined and many-sided effects."
"Almost all investigations list unduly high taxes and social security contributions as a cause."
"However, the Committee lists further causes such as poverty, frivolous bidding procedures, giveaway prices for subcontractors, inflexible employment legislation and poor administrative practice, as well as a clear decline in the perception of undeclared work as something illegal and illicit."
"In drawing its conclusions, the Committee has, however, come up with a variety of positions derived from the very different evaluations of the various causes."
"I nonetheless believe that we are united as to our goal. It is only the path about which we disagree."
"The conclusions adopted by the Committee at its last sitting call for as precise as possible an assessment to be made of the sectors affected and of the most significant groups of people involved, as well as for the social partners to be involved in active measures to combat undeclared work and for the issue to be tackled in national employment programmes. They also call for surveillance and for sanctions to be imposed when undeclared work is detected."
"However, a majority of the Committee considers a reduction in tax and social security contributions to be crucial as a preventive measure, as well as a reduction in value added tax in the case of labour-intensive services, as already provided for by the Council' s decision of 28 February of this year and as also already practised in new countries."
"It is also important to find solutions in hitherto unsatisfactory areas, for example in connection with the directive on the posting of workers and with the paid domestic work largely performed by women."
"In the five minutes granted to me, I can present only a number of important points in the report."
"The problem is complex and needs to be tackled at a variety of levels."
"The Committee therefore calls upon the Commission and the individual Member States, each according to its powers but above all with firm determination, to take up Parliament' s proposals and to become active in this matter."
"I hope that we can demonstrate to you our substantial agreement with the report, together with Parliament' s active resolve."
"I would thank all my fellow MEPs for their splendid cooperation but, above all, the shadow rapporteur, Karin Jöns, for her constant readiness to engage in discussion."
"Finally, I would draw your attention to a printing error."
"In Article 25 of the conclusions, the Committee has clearly formulated the right to a class action."
"This needs to be revised in the latest text we have before us."
"The words 'appeals to the courts' must therefore be deleted and replaced with the words 'a class action' ."
"The words then correctly correspond to the will of the Committee, as agreed."
"Many thanks for your attention."
"Mr President, this is a most useful report on a very important issue."
"There are some parts I do not like, such as for instance paragraph 13 which promotes tax coordination."
"I am proposing to table an amendment on that because, as the rapporteur knows, this is a subject particularly dear to the heart of UK Conservatives."
"But the overall thrust of the report is very good."
"There is another report out today which was an annual report from the Commission, referred to in today's Financial Times under the wonderful heading ""Brussels demands labour reform""."
"To quote briefly from the article, ""In its assessment of countries, the Commission will tell France that, like Germany, it must reduce 'fiscal pressure' on labour and reduce the 'administrative burden on companies'."""
"Certainly anything that promotes labour flexibility, liberates enterprise and reduces burdens on business must be good for the economies of those countries and for employment."
"But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work."
"The higher the tax, the more the red tape, the greater the incentive not to declare work."
"I should like to make one further suggestion."
"Countries with the highest undeclared work may well be recording the highest official unemployment figures, thereby attracting the highest offsetting regional funds."
"This is perverse and it is in all our interests to address the problem."
"Reducing tax and red tape would be a splendid start."
"I urge Member States to follow the Commission advice and also to note the Glase report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a clear need for action on the issue of undeclared work in all the Member States, for there have not so far been many successes in combating it."
"All the more reason, then, for me to welcome the Commission' s communication on undeclared work because it gets the discussion going at European level."
"In this way, I now come to a core demand of this really excellent report by Mrs Glase."
"We must unreservedly include the fight against undeclared work in European employment strategy."
"With problems of this complexity, we need to exchange views, learn from each other and, in accordance with the tried and tested motto for our employment strategy, always seek best practice."
"We must take a close look at the issue of undeclared work in order to be able to combat its various causes efficiently."
"I would warn against over-simplification, three forms of which I would also at this point immediately oppose on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The first point concerns the repeatedly made assertion according to which undeclared work is in the first place traceable to unduly high taxes and social security contributions."
"I would say to my fellow MEPs in the conservative camp that things are really not that simple."
"Let us take Austria and Italy, for example."
"In Austria, taxes are significantly higher than in Italy."
"In spite of that, there is very much more undeclared work in Italy."
"High taxes and social charges are therefore only one reason among many."
"Or look at Scandinavia."
"There, taxes and social charges are somewhat higher still."
"On the other hand, the amount of undeclared work is comparatively small."
"This no doubt also means that the quantity of undeclared work also has something to do with social acceptability, that is to say with a society' s social coherence."
"Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo."
"Secondly, I should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work."
"This would-be panacea does not in fact work."
"The Thatcher era in Britain taught us that."
"The amount of undeclared work rose then, despite the fact that the labour market was made more flexible and social charges were reduced."
"Making the labour market more flexible is something which no doubt only works if correspondingly high social standards can be maintained."
"Thirdly, undeclared work is not primarily the result of illegal immigration from third countries."
"On the contrary, the majority of those who engage in undeclared work are our own citizens."
"As Mrs Glase' s report shows, we need a sensible policy mix at national and European levels."
"As a part of this, public authorities throughout the EU must also be jointly liable for ensuring that no contracts at all are awarded to companies whose quotations can quite clearly be traced back to the existence of undeclared work."
"In the same way, companies need to be jointly and severally liable towards their sub-contractors."
"However, we also want a right of class action which could help the trade unions, in particular, to take proceedings against those suspected of not declaring their employees or only partially declaring them."
"Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Mrs Glase for her report, which is extremely efficient."
"It is a very complex report which I described in committee as cautious in parts: cautious for reasons of necessity, if we consider that employment policy concerns the Member States, and therefore does not afford the European Parliament, or, by extension, Europe, genuine, practical competence in this matter."
"So we are faced with a real, substantial difficulty to overcome."
"As Mrs Jöns has just said, what we now need to do is develop a new strategy which looks at the entire question of work and employment from a global viewpoint, and calls upon the Member States first of all to make their situation public with regard to employment and undeclared work."
"So far, we do not have detailed documentation for all the States; that is, we do not know the extent of the problem in all the Member States."
"We do not know the extent of the problem in the States which are hoping to join the European Union either."
"It is a complex issue: the percentage is increasing every year in line with the gross domestic product; we have a remarkably high average of 15% across the countries of the European Union."
"In any case, for all of us, illegal and undeclared work constitutes, by definition, an abuse of those who need to work, not least in terms of the tax burden which should ensure solidarity."
"This is, therefore, a crime against society, which we as legislators must address, within the limits of our direct competence in this field."
"However, there are specific recommendations in the report, for example specific procedures which could be implemented in order to fight the scourge of illegal or undeclared work."
"I tabled some amendments, which have already been accepted by the rapporteur, and I will therefore not dwell on them."
"I would just like to use the rest of the time available to mention an amendment which is particularly important to me and which I believe people found difficult to assess objectively: the amendment on illegal child labour, which I will summarise now."
"It is claimed that child labour does not exist in Europe, but that it might exist - as has been stated - in Italy and southern countries."
"This is not true!"
"Child labour exists everywhere: among immigrants or third-country nationals, among all those young people who drop out of education before they reach the age of majority, who are exploited, underpaid and untrained, thereby constituting a serious problem of exploitation and undeclared work because they do not have a qualification which can be used to ensure that they are adequately paid."
"Lastly, the issue of illegal work also concerns children under 15 years old!"
"So let us not pretend that this problem does not exist in Europe, because it does exist, and Parliament should speak out resolutely on this matter too, in order to confirm the social, democratic and political maturity of this House."
"Mr President, when we talk about undeclared work, let us not forget that we are talking about construction workers, who more exposed than anyone to bad weather and accidents at work, and that our discussions concern the outcasts working in sweatshops, deprived of any social status, often including the right to residence."
"To these people we must also add workers in the new economy, whose working hours, time between shifts, and salaries are subject to the hazards of excessive insecurity and flexibility."
"In short, we are talking about a form of exploitation in the workplace, which admittedly is detrimental to public finances due to lost revenue from tax and social contributions, but we must never forget that we are talking about the exclusion to which, according to the Commission, between 10 and 28 million citizens of the European Union are reduced."
"Far from stigmatising these victims, we should be concerning ourselves with a specific type of employer criminality."
"Lumping together those offering this type of work and those accepting it is inappropriate, even shocking."
"The report that has been submitted to us is not entirely free from reproach in this respect, and nor, what is more, is the Commission's communication."
"What should we do?"
"Integrate undeclared work into the labour market or adapt the job market to the existence of these excessively flexible types of work?"
"I fear that proposals consisting of reducing taxes and contributions and increasing the flexibility of the job market will only lead to even greater deregulation of the labour market, at the risk of these precursors of excessive flexibility eventually becoming legitimate."
"As the report that has been submitted to us indicates, poverty fosters the prosperity of the black economy, obliging employees and the self-employed to accept it."
"Staunchly fighting for the creation of quality activities and jobs, paying attention to working conditions and limiting insecurity are the surest methods of reducing the attractiveness of undeclared work in all sectors."
"Measures also need to be taken to prevent certain conditions for sub-contracting and the award of public contracts from leading small businesses or the self-employed to seek illegal ways of achieving the profit margins forbidden to them by contractors."
"We do not need to regulate less, but rather to give greater resources to the authorities responsible for monitoring work."
"In some States, the Labour Code stipulates that every illegal contract must be re-classed as a full-time, permanent contract."
"That would certainly be a very active policy and a strong incentive for the employers concerned to regularise the situation."
"Mr President, there are different types of undeclared work."
"It can be difficult drawing the line between undeclared and properly declared work."
"Sometimes, the blame has to be placed upon individuals who do undeclared work in order to dodge paying tax."
"The serious cases of undeclared work are those that are organised as such."
"More often than not, many workers are involved, and the reason is that there are employers who organise, lead and distribute work that will go undeclared in order to keep wage costs down and reduce taxes for themselves."
"That is the heart of the matter."
"In many quarters, organised undeclared work is well-known, both among the local population and the authorities."
"In those cases where no action is taken against such work, this may be because unemployment is high and poor people have no alternative to being exploited by employers who do not declare their employees."
"There is also a tax argument which plays a big part in Mrs Glase' s thinking."
"This subject has already been taken up in the debate."
"Mrs Jöns observed quite correctly that in those regions and countries where the level of tax is fairly - or even very - high, where the labour market is well organised and where workers have strong unions, there is almost no undeclared work at all, at least not in any organised form."
"If Mrs Glase and her group want to reduce tax in order to make undeclared work less profitable, this is as good as saying that they want to legalise the economic calculations behind undeclared work and make them the general rule."
"It is like increasing the speed limit on the roads to reduce the number of drivers who break the law by driving too fast, or like legalising the drugs trade to reduce the amount of illegal drug dealing."
"I was quite shocked to read the rapporteur' s original report in which she proposed that all employees in European workplaces should be forced to carry electronic cards so as constantly to be monitored by the authorities."
"I believe it is the employers who organise production and take on workers."
"If anyone is to be compelled to carry electronic cards, it is therefore these employers, who are responsible for the work that is done."
"My group and I believe that fighting unemployment and poverty is the best, and in fact the only, way of properly combating organised undeclared work."
"Improved wages are a much better remedy than lower taxes and other concessions to irresponsible employers."
"Mr President, I think we should begin by congratulating ourselves not only on the quality of Mrs Glase's work, but also on the fact that this subject has come before Parliament."
"We are living in a Europe that is increasingly closer to its citizens and therefore we cannot omit to concern ourselves with employment, as employment, together with health, is one of the main concerns of the citizens and, I dare say, especially of those who are unemployed because they have lost their job or perhaps never had one."
"We should ask the question whether those who are working in the hidden economy, working on the black market or, to use the most common term, carrying out undeclared work, really have an adequate job?"
"I do not think this is the right time to detail the harm done by undeclared work to the public funds and those carrying it out, due to their own position of insecurity, and to other employers, competitors or otherwise, and society in general."
"The economic causes of undeclared work, increased income for workers, the opportunity to save on tax and social contributions or the reduction in costs for the company, are not unrelated to its existence and a significantly higher rate of growth than that of the legal or official economy."
"To refer briefly to the sectors or groups in which undeclared work has the most scope for expansion, we need to include multi-job situations where the income obtained from this illegal work is supplementary; economically inactive people who have greater flexibility in terms of time and the case of the unemployed who want an additional income, often turning down offers of legal work."
"We must also consider the situation of illegal immigrants who cannot carry out other forms of work."
"In addition to these easily visible situations, it is assumed that there are also many cases of production decentralisation, outsourcing or subcontracting which, in a less direct, less visible way, can lead to undeclared work."
"A situation which must be prevented and which I would like to consider is that of the new type of work via the Internet, teleworking, part-time work, which can be an easy breeding-ground for undeclared work."
"Mr President, we must anticipate this, as Europe must opt for secure, stable, quality work, and undeclared work is neither stable nor secure and nor, of course, does it demonstrate solidarity."
"Mr President, we must welcome the Commission' s decision to address the problem of undeclared work and I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on managing to clarify certain aspects of such a complex issue."
"It is precisely because this is such a crucial issue that I should like to make two comments."
"It is true that this is not just some sub-issue; it is a central issue which impacts on the efficiency of individual policies in the taxation, insurance and employment sectors."
"With the rapid spread of undeclared work in industrialised countries, this phenomenon has ceased to be a typical feature of third world countries, for which the International Labour Organisation several decades ago coined the term ""informal sector"" , which is not the same as ""black"" or illicit work."
"That is a mistake which I would ask the Commission to take into account."
"What we are witnessing, in fact, is the emergence of two productive systems and two social models."
"One in which producers operate by analysing the responsibilities and costs imposed by the system and another in which they operate to the detriment of the former and society as a whole."
"What we must understand is that the future success of European initiatives in the employment, insurance and tax sectors depends on the way in which this issue is resolved; in other words, this issue is of equal importance to employers, workers and the rest of society."
"Secondly, I think that the general reference to undeclared work or to certain general categories is the weak link in the approach to the problem: we all know that undeclared work cannot be dealt with as a single phenomenon and needs a policy which is differentiated by sector and sub-sector, depending on the people supplying it and the nature of the individual problem."
"The various categories of people which supply it, such as immigrants, minorities, children, women, moonlighters etc. cannot all be dealt with in the same way."
"There is a thriving undeclared sector and there are instances which only partially constitute undeclared work."
"Then there is the matter of bogus self-employment and certain new forms of employment."
"All these problems require innovative solutions; bans are not enough."
"Mr President, the good news is that Europe has not run out of work."
"The bad news is that, more and more often, work goes undeclared."
"Failing to declare work is no mere peccadillo."
"The wide-boy in the local pub who brags about ripping off the State should no longer be indulged."
"In Germany, for example, work is being lost due to illegal employment and, for every ten thousand jobs, DM 240 million is lost in taxes and social security contributions."
"In her splendid and balanced report, Anne Glase estimates the volume of undeclared work in the EU at between 10 and 20 per cent of GNP."
"People who engage in undeclared work are to be found not only among the unemployed and among those who have entered the country illegally and have to suffer at the hands of those who profiteer from unemployment."
"They are also to be found among part-time workers who, in addition, are working at night and in the evenings on their computers, as well as among the self-employed who do additional work they do not declare."
"Those affected by this are small and medium-sized businesses which, unlike competitors who operate illegally, obey the law."
"Jobs cannot be safeguarded in this way. Nor can new ones be created."
"What is to be done?"
"Firstly, abuse of the rules governing work must be punished, with fines for those who engage in undeclared work and for those who employ others to do such work."
"Those who hire workers who do not have work permits should be excluded from being awarded public contracts."
"Moreover, they should expect to receive custodial sentences."
"Secondly, thorough checks, including cross-border checks, by the relevant authorities are necessary."
"Town clerks' offices must cooperate with factory inspectorates, and tax offices with immigration authorities, preferably in task forces."
"Thirdly, incentives to abuse the system must be reduced."
"Taxes and social charges payable by companies must be significantly reduced, as must VAT on labour-intensive services."
"Fourthly, it is particularly important that there should be more awareness-raising campaigns in order to convince all relevant target groups that undeclared work needs to be combated."
"It is extremely damaging both socially and economically."
"Acting illegally is anti-social."
"I should like to thank Mrs Glase for her excellent report."
"The Commission has opened the debate with its communication on undeclared work in the spring of 1998."
"We are pleased to say that it has stimulated debate both with the European institutions and within Member States."
"The time has come to bring together the fruits of this debate."
"Therefore I especially welcome Parliament's initiative in taking up this issue now."
"The Commission's communication focused on the policy strategy to tackle this important problem."
"It has highlighted the need for an integrated approach to combating undeclared work, involving both preventive measures and sanctions."
"These deal with the two dimensions of undeclared work: it can be viewed as an issue of individuals taking advantage of the system and undermining solidarity in the process or as the outcome of greater flexibility in the labour market and slow adaptation of existing legislation."
"I am pleased to see that Parliament has agreed with the Commission's analysis."
"Parliament also seems to share the view that the main action has to be taken at the level of Member States."
"Indeed it is the mix of the situation in the labour market, the tax and social security mix, as well as the social acceptance, that determine the level of undeclared work."
"For that reason, the action that can be taken at Community level can only be minimal and has to be clearly targeted in those fields where the Community can have an impact."
"The Commission is also convinced that undeclared work should be dealt with within the framework of the Luxembourg process."
"We believe that undeclared work should be actively taken into account in the national action plans for employment."
"We are working with the Member States to ensure that this is so."
"We welcome Parliament's support in this."
"However, the Commission can have an impact in developing a standard methodology to describe and record the extent of undeclared work and to assess its impact on the economy and on social solidarity."
"This we have done with the Communication in 1998 and we will continue to do so. Indeed the Commission is now carrying out a study on different measures used to combat undeclared work in selected Member States in order to identify good policy mixes."
"Results of this study will be presented in a conference at the end of the year."
"However, to have annual monitoring and reporting on this problem would be heavy procedurally while not adding much new."
"We must not forget that undeclared work is a deeply rooted phenomenon."
"Changes take time."
"To keep this item on the agenda and to ensure that progress is reported we would suggest a triennial reporting exercise."
"The Commission agrees with the analysis of Parliament that women, while not the majority of undeclared workers, often operate in situations of greater insecurity and exploitation."
"Within its possibilities the Commission will continue to monitor the situation and report on it within the framework of existing reports on the principle of equal treatment."
"That is very important to the need to maintain momentum in introducing and reinforcing equal opportunities for women and men."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Mr President, on a point of order. Questions to the Council are no longer being answered in the time stipulated."
"Despite being warned on two occasions, the Council has not answered European Parliament questions."
"Would you please ensure that the Council fulfils its obligations in this area as well?"
"Thank you, Mr Rübig."
"Your request and your comment will be dealt with appropriately."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Regarding the questions that will shortly be put to the Commission and the Council, you will be aware that the French Government, confronted by the fuel crisis that has gripped France along with the rest of Europe, took a number of measures yesterday which will drastically alter the conditions of competition and the basis of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and which will, therefore, have an immediate and serious impact on Europe."
"Mrs Loyola de Palacio had an extremely interesting article published in the French press this morning on this European crisis."
"Would it be possible for her and/or the Commissioner for Competition to speak during this part-sitting in order to tell us how the Commission intends to react to the fuel crisis, and how the Commission and the Council intend to prevent an outbreak of fiscal dumping in Europe and prepare Europe to deal with this crisis?"
"Of course, Mr Lipietz, the point that you have raised is very topical and very urgent, but the agenda has already been fixed, and therefore, I think it will be quite difficult to satisfy your request, although the President will do everything possible to deal with it."
"Mr President, the honourable Member's request concerns a matter of importance."
"The President has very clearly ruled out the possibility of a debate this morning."
"I shall tell Mrs de Palacio and Mr Monti that Parliament would like to hear them and, together with the Presidency, we shall decide on a suitable time."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for making yourself available."
"Sport"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Council statement on doping in sport and sport in society;"
"the Commission statement on football player transfers;"
"the report (A5-0203/2000) by Mrs Zabell, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Community support plan to combat doping in sport [COM(1999) 643 - C5-0087/2000 - 2000/2056(COS)]];"
"the report (A5-0208/2000) by Mr Mennea, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the report from the Commission to the European Council: With a view to safeguarding current sports structures and maintaining the social function of sport within the Community framework - The Helsinki report on sport [COM(1999) 644 - C5-0088/2000 - 2000/2055(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you for devoting this morning to sport."
"In eight days' time, the Olympic Games will be opening in Sydney. Athletes will be gathered there from all over the planet."
"The results of the various competitions are not yet known; they are not predestined; in sport, anything can happen."
"The champions who are preparing to enter this field of dreams have their own schedules."
"Many are familiar with the world of professional sport, but, as you well know, all of them have at least two things in common."
"Firstly, their selection is the climax of several years of effort and of meticulous training, with volunteers, coaches and public and private resources all mobilised on their behalf. Secondly, and most importantly, they all began their sporting careers in an amateur club or at a school."
"In order to promote sport, we must also - at the same time and as part of the same effort - promote local amateur clubs alongside top-level amateur and professional sport."
"Sport at the highest level is the stuff of dreams; it contributes to the development of mass sports and, through them, to social education."
"Elite sport, be it amateur or professional, receives global media coverage today."
"More and more men and women, whatever their age and their circumstances, are taking part in a sport."
"Sport has permeated the whole of society."
"So, nobody here will be surprised to see how this human activity can sometimes be perverted by acts of violence or racism, or engender greed."
"Far be it for me to demonise the economic aspect of sport."
"Sport needs resources, and the public purse cannot provide all the necessary funding."
"It is not a matter of distinguishing between a pure form of sport which is untainted by money and a sponsored form of sport which is corrupt."
"No, the real question is a different one and may be expressed as follows: will the sporting community have the means to preserve the ethics of sport by harnessing the funds that flow into sport and ensuring that money does not rule sport?"
"Let us not beat about the bush."
"This problem is not one that will arise in twenty years' time; it is already a problem today."
"Sporting events have become so attractive that financial interests seek to use them as a source of profits, even if it means sacrificing the ethics of sport and treating sportspeople as marketable commodities."
"Who has not witnessed the sale and purchase of sportsmen, some of whom are still very young?"
"Who has not been shocked by the amounts that are paid for broadcasting rights or by the size of certain transfer fees?"
"Who has not been alarmed at the sight of increasingly overcrowded sporting calendars?"
"Who has not been concerned at the plans of certain private groups to create their own sports competitions, outside the jurisdiction of the national and international federations and on the basis of a single criterion, namely the size of the participating clubs' budgets, as we have recently seen in association football and, subsequently, in basketball too?"
"What kind of sport do we want for the twenty-first century?"
"The reply to this all-embracing, fundamental question depends on our response to the present situation."
"There are two options: having identified these excesses, we could consider that sport no longer depends on anything but the market or sportspeople on anything but their added value."
"In that case, we must apply the rules of competition and compound the present follies with a dose of deregulation, accepting, in the name of freedom of movement, the sale and purchase of youngsters aged between 18 and 20."
"The other option is to decide, on the basis of the European sporting tradition that has been developed in modern times, with its humanist values and voluntary structures, and in the light of the present situation, with all its economic and social implications, that we should re-equip the sporting community with the legal and political instruments it requires to protect the entire range of sporting activities within the framework of their respective federations."
"This second option, which is supported by the French Presidency, does not mean adhering to the status quo, but actually requires innovative proposals from the sporting community itself - and I am gratified to see that these have been forthcoming on the question of transfers - and from governments with a view to combating the excesses that are affecting the sporting world and to developing practices designed to protect the associations and, hence, the cohesion of each sport."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has already devoted a huge volume of work to this option, and we are starting to move forward within the Council too."
"In June 1997, the sports ministers met at the Stade de France in Paris, and this was followed by meetings in Germany, Finland and Portugal."
"There have been the annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the conclusions of the Vienna Council and, last December, the Helsinki report on the subject of sport."
"Then, at Feira in Portugal, on the occasion of the Council meeting in June 2000, a clear call was made for the specific characteristics of sport to be taken into account in the application of Community policies."
"It is the wish of the French Presidency that we should succeed in defining precisely what these specific characteristics are and what their recognition implies."
"To be absolutely precise, it is a matter of recognising that sport is rooted in the everyday practice of millions of men, women and children, in the commitment of hundreds of thousands of volunteers; that it is an irreplaceable instrument of informal education, of social inclusion, of access to citizenship; that sport is, above all, a means by which the individual can grow and flourish and can encounter other people in a spirit of mutual respect."
"Sport forms a whole."
"We need cohesion throughout the Union. I am delighted that this is emphasised in the report prepared by Mr Mennea and adopted by the Commission."
"This approach is the basis on which my counterparts in the other fourteen Member States and I have been working, in close collaboration with Commissioner Viviane Reding."
"After two meetings of the working parties established by the Portuguese Presidency, a meeting of the Troika, and a great many bilateral contacts with my counterparts from the other Member States, here are some of the objectives that seem to have attracted the broadest consensus within the Council."
"The first question concerns the protection of under-age sportspeople."
"We must be able to put an end to commercial transactions involving minors."
"Specific measures should be taken to protect the health of young athletes, especially to prevent any recourse to performance-enhancing drugs, and to ensure that they complete their education and vocational training."
"To that end, the subject has been placed on the agenda of the Council of Youth Ministers for its meeting on 9 November."
"I am very hopeful that, having regard to the 1994 Directive on the protection of young people at work, we shall be able to offer the prospect of precise recommendations on this point."
"Secondly, I also wish to see measures taken to maintain the development policies of sports clubs."
"Sports federations and governments should be able, if they so wish, to take appropriate measures to protect the clubs that develop young talent."
"It must be possible to insert provisions such as a clause requiring young players to sign their first professional contract with the club where they have received youth training, perhaps with compensation proportionate to the cost of their training to indemnify the latter club if such a player is transferred."
"At the same time, the international sports authorities have a responsibility to take action to control club management in order to avoid excesses, especially in relation to transfers."
"Thirdly, in the wider context, it seems to me that there is an urgent need to recognise the unique central role played by the federations."
"I believe it is necessary to acknowledge the key role of the sports federations in organising sports competitions, in formulating the rules of their respective sports and in awarding titles."
"This does not mean that I advocate vesting these rights in the federations without demanding anything from them in return."
"That is why I envisage that the recognition of these exclusive rights should be accompanied by the imposition on sports federations of precise duties and responsibilities relating to their obligation to serve the public interest and to redistribute their commercial revenue equitably."
"Identifying the specific features of sport is an enormously complex undertaking."
"Significant progress in this direction is a matter of urgency."
"I believe we are caught up in a race against the clock. France has decided to make this a priority of its presidency."
"I have great faith in the contribution that will come from your Parliament."
"I have taken note, by the way, of your call for the inclusion of an article in the Treaty and see it as a manifestation of your will to ensure that due consideration is given to these concerns."
"Let me turn now to the fight against doping, which is an absolute priority issue."
"I am also aware that the European Parliament shares this concern, as your reports and resolutions show."
"You know that it is a long and arduous struggle, one which has to be waged relentlessly for the sake of public health and the sporting ethic."
"Recent events show that we still have a long way to go."
"Be that as it may, I refuse to join the defeatists who want us to throw in the towel on the grounds that drugs are endemic in sport today."
"We need to enlist the support of the sporting community, but there is an equal need to enlist the support of governments and the European Union."
"The World Anti-Doping Agency that has now been created owes its existence to the will of the European Union."
"The International Olympic Committee has established the objectives of its fight against the use of drugs at the Olympic Games in Sydney."
"Nevertheless, as you know, a debate is raging across the Member States of the European Union on the expediency of direct EU membership of the organs of the World Anti-Doping Agency and, hence, on whether the EU should help to fund the agency."
"I wish to lay particular emphasis on this point, because it has emerged from our exchanges with the European Commission that the latter will not commit itself to the participation of the European Union as such unless it receives a strong and unanimous political signal in favour of participation."
"I, for my part, believe that we have the legal basis for participation."
"Doping is unquestionably a matter of public health."
"One need only consider the increase in the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs by young amateur sportspeople."
"It also has to do with the fight against trafficking and, thus, with police and customs cooperation."
"Lastly, the struggle against doping also relates to the development of research."
"As is proposed in the report prepared by Mrs Zabell and adopted by the parliamentary committee, the aim would be for the European Union to be able to speak positively, with one voice, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Agency."
"While we await the resolution of the legal questions regarding the involvement of the European Union in the Agency, my Troika colleagues and I have established a liaison committee, which will be very useful."
"There will also be a need to ensure that the Agency grows in stature so that it has the power to act in every country."
"Public opinion, sportswomen, sportsmen and everyone who is interested in these Games expect these decisions to be taken."
"The credibility of the anti-doping effort depends on it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, European sport is at the crossroads."
"I hope it will continue to be a field of dreams, just as I hope that it will keep giving young people the educational and integrative framework they need - in short, that it will remain a school of life for our children."
"But the greed that it arouses and the threat that emanates from such greed must be taken seriously."
"I am convinced that the clear positions you are preparing to adopt through these two reports will be a great asset in this debate."
"I wish to thank you for that and to tell you how fervently I hope that we shall be able to continue this work together."
"Mr President, Parliament has asked me to make a statement on the transfer system and on the whole panic which has gripped the world of sport and which the press has been echoing."
"I have naturally taken note of Mrs Buffet's statements."
"Let me also convey to her my sincere thanks for the work that the French Presidency has been doing in the interests of sport and for the solidarity it has demonstrated with the Commission and with Parliament."
"It is my fervent hope that these efforts by the French Presidency will be rewarded with a very favourable outcome for sport at the European level."
"Mr President, I shall respond to the report on doping in sport and sport in society at the end of the debate, if I may."
"For the moment I shall confine myself to a statement on the transfer issue."
"The approach that the Commission has adopted with regard to sport is defined in its Helsinki report."
"We want sport to have a social function."
"This report invites the sporting community, the Member States and the European Union to pool their efforts in order to ensure that sport, in its new economic environment, will continue to act as an instrument of education and integration on the basis of its values of fair play, equal opportunities and the pursuit of merit."
"It goes without saying that the provisions of Community law, especially those based on the principles of non-discrimination and free movement of persons, as well as the rules of competition, are applicable to sport."
"It is equally self-evident that, as the declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises, the European Community recognises the social impact of sport and the importance of dialogue with the sporting community."
"This is the context, ladies and gentlemen, in which the Commission, under the direct responsibility of my colleague Mario Monti, has been examining several aspects of competition as they relate to sport."
"The Commission recognises that the sporting community is free to determine the rules that will ensure the proper administration of their respective sports."
"The Commission recognises the specific nature of sport in the sense that some degree of equality is needed in competition between players and clubs so as to guarantee the uncertainty of results, which is the very essence of sport, as the Minister has just emphasised."
"The Commission is investigating only those aspects of sport with a Community dimension and an economic dimension."
"Regarding the matter of current FIFA rules governing transfers, I must remind you that, back in 1998, following a number of complaints, the Commission questioned the compatibility of the FIFA transfer rules with the rules of competition and sent FIFA a list of grievances."
"The Commission believes that the FIFA rules on transfers unfairly obstruct freedom of movement."
"This is especially true of the rules which lay down conditions of transfer on expiry of a player's contract, even though the contract has been duly terminated in accordance with national employment legislation and with its own terms and the contractually agreed financial indemnity has been determined and paid."
"Contrary to what some press articles have been suggesting, the Commission has no intention of simply abolishing the transfer system or of creating a situation in which players would be able to terminate their contracts on a sudden impulse."
"The Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, wishes FIFA to apply a transfer system which complies with the principles of Community law as well as respecting the unique nature of sport."
"The present system, however, satisfies neither of these criteria."
"It obstructs competition between clubs as well as players' freedom of movement, it has done nothing to prevent the over-commercialisation of sport or the widening of the gulf between the rich clubs and those with limited financial resources, nor has it prevented players - especially the youngest players - from becoming targets of financial speculation."
"For many years, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been waiting 'patiently' for FIFA to present a formula that could replace the present system, to offer a basis on which we could work together in search of a universally satisfactory and equitable solution."
"Mario Monti and I have established contacts with the footballing world."
"We have made the point that, under national codes of employment legislation, some form of compensation is warranted when a player breaks his contract with one club in order to join another."
"We have emphasised that, in order to avoid distorting championship competitions, we are naturally disposed to accept rules limiting transfers to particular fixed periods and, above all, we have stressed that efforts made to develop young talent must be encouraged, which means that we can accept a compensation mechanism designed to reflect the expense incurred by a club in the development of young players, provided that such a mechanism does not put young players in a position of undue dependence on their clubs."
"For a number of years, and until a few days ago, we had received no reply."
"The Commission certainly cannot wait indefinitely, which is why Mario Monti and I have been declaring very plainly over the past few months that FIFA must propose other solutions or run the risk of having its rules banned in the EU - something that no one would wish to happen."
"Mario Monti and I are pleased to learn that our plea seems to have been heeded this time."
"Last week FIFA admitted that its transfer rules do not conform to Community legislation, and it announced its intention of establishing a new system."
"Since the details of that system have yet to be finalised, I cannot comment on them at the present time."
"We have, however, received an initial outline of the proposals. This afternoon I shall be meeting with FIFA officials and a delegation from the national leagues."
"They too will be making proposals. Mario Monti's departments are ready to examine these, within the shortest possible time, with the aid of my departments and those of Anna Diamantopoulou."
"Our doors are always open to any debate or any negotiations that will help us to arrive at a consensus."
"Allow me to conclude by underlining the commitment of the Commission to the European model of sport and its values."
"The European Parliament has affirmed on many occasions - for which I am deeply grateful to it - that it shares this commitment."
"I believe you will reaffirm this by adopting the parliamentary report devoted to the Helsinki report."
"The French Presidency, as I said at the start of my speech, has testified to this same attachment to sport and its values on behalf of the Council."
"So, if I am not mistaken, we are all on the same wavelength."
"The Commission is acting in the interests of sport to preserve the beautiful game, and I am convinced that, if we all pull our weight, a satisfactory solution will soon be in sight for the good of sport, for the good of football and for the good of Europe."
"Mr President, doping is not a new problem. It did not even start this century, but comes from the last century."
"In fact, the first death from doping took place in 1896, when a cyclist took drugs."
"The first measures against doping, however, began to be taken after the first Helsinki Olympic games in 1952, but it was in the Tour de France of 1998 that the problem became too big and the serious fight against it began."
"In fact, we have already heard this morning that it is a priority for the French Presidency, the Council and also for the Commission."
"We have to assess why this problem exists and why doping has increased so much in recent years."
"On the one hand, it is worth mentioning the over-commercialisation that is affecting sport, as well as the saturation of sporting calendars and greater demands on sportsmen and women, both physical and mental."
"Before, the motto of sport was that of Pierre de Coubertin, 'the important thing is taking part' ."
"Now, however, it seems that whoever comes first wins, whoever comes second loses, and the rest just take part."
"On the other hand, we should not forget that, these days, an increasing number of tests are being done, many of them outside competitions, and this also means that, logically, more cases of doping are being discovered."
"However, it is very important to distinguish between the two types of doping: on the one hand, there is intentional or planned doping, that is, a team plans which substances the sportsman or woman needs to take, and when, in order to improve his or her physical performance."
"Logically, this is more common in sports with greater financial resources."
"On the other hand, there is accidental doping, which often does not even improve the sportsman or woman' s physical performance."
"This tends to be more common in sports which have few resources, so that often public opinion does not even realise what has happened."
"Obviously, we have to fight both types of doping, although each one should be approached in a very different manner."
"Combating intentional or planned doping is much more difficult."
"Police cooperation plays a very important role, because we should not forget that the trafficking of doping substances is worth EUR 1 billion per year."
"It is also important to listen to sportsmen and women when drawing up sporting calendars or planning a competition or trial. Sometimes, we ask them to do more than is physically possible without turning to external help."
"Overall, we need to fight doping globally."
"It is not an isolated problem for one Member State and therefore the presence of the European Union in the World Anti-Doping Agency is absolutely essential."
"Combating accidental doping is much easier."
"It is mainly due to the lack of information among sportsmen and women, and the report therefore proposes that there should be an indicator on the boxes of pharmaceutical products, consisting of five Olympic rings and a traffic light."
"Thus, when buying a drug, sportsmen and women will be able to clearly see the red traffic light indicating the risk of testing positive, or the green light which indicates that there is no risk, or the amber light indicating that there may be a risk and that they should contact their doctor or a specialist for advice."
"This is very important, because we now have fifteen Member States with fifteen lists of prohibited substances, and in each country there can be a different brand name for the same drug."
"For this purpose, we ask for the intervention of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency."
"However, even though the types of doping are different, sportsmen and women receive the same treatment and from the moment that they have a positive result they are considered to be guilty, with no right to prove their innocence and without an assessment of whether the doping was intentional or not, as occurs with other things in life."
"We also call on the European Commission to request that the Fifth Framework Programme carry out research into doping substances and their impact on the health of sportsmen and women, detection methods and the natural limits of hormones that can be produced by the human body."
"With regard to laboratories, it is very important that they comply with ISO standards on uniform methods for collecting and analysing samples, and also that there should be protection and confidentiality, both in collection and in dealing with the case, in order to preserve sportsmen and women' s right to honour and privacy."
"Finally, I will mention penalties."
"When a person other than the sportsman or woman has taken part, such as a club, an association, a federation, a doctor, a coach, etc., that person should also be subject to a penalty, exactly equal to that given to the sportsman or woman, because we should not forget that the person with the shortest working life will always be the sportsman or woman."
"Mr President, the European Union must act to ensure that sport is given its rightful place and due attention and that it is regulated by clear, precise rules."
"The system of sport which the European Union must aspire to must make the right to sport for all citizens a practical reality and aim to preserve the social function and traditional values of sport, while taking into account its economic and legal development."
"This is why the declaration on sport in the Treaty of Amsterdam annex is no longer sufficient to ensure that the predetermined objectives are met."
"Sport needs a new definition: indeed, it should be considered as an activity that is an integral part of the education and training of young people, free time and the integration of socially excluded and disabled people."
"In short, sport must be an essential factor in promoting the education and integration of all social classes."
"Moreover, it must be able to adapt to the new business context, within which it must evolve without losing its autonomy."
"Some changes are needed so that the European Union can help with the developments in the world of sport."
"The central committee has stated several times that it can no longer guarantee the pyramid structure on the basis of which sporting organisations and the social function of sport are currently organised."
"A legal basis is therefore essential since, without one, there is a danger that the objectives that have been reached so far will come to nothing."
"Europe must be more forceful in the fight against doping, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is growing very rapidly and is no longer confined to the world of sport: the spread of this scourge has led to an increase in highly lucrative illegal activities, in which many criminal organisations have been involved, and we need to recognise that entrusting the fight against doping solely to sporting organisations has been a complete failure."
"Europe should therefore look into the possibility of promulgating Community criminal legislation which would be valid in all the Member States, and should consider setting up an independent, transparent, European anti-doping agency."
"Moreover, all sports-related economic activities must be subject to the rules of the EC Treaty."
"The monopolistic activity of sporting organisations has caused numerous problems and must therefore be subject to strict checks and possibly reduced."
"We need to encourage sporting associations, provided that aims are established to support amateur sport and to show solidarity with less-advantaged people, particularly the disabled."
"We need to try to improve the role played by sport and the role of the teaching of physical education in the curricula of schools."
"Furthermore, the work and status of sportspersons should be properly appreciated and safeguarded by the Member States."
"I feel that it is the European Union' s duty to help reintegrate into the labour market athletes who have made no provision for their futures once their sporting activity comes to an end."
"Europe must also call for sportspersons' professional qualifications to be recognised at European level and for their vocational training to be promoted."
"There must be a firm, determined fight against the trade in young sportspersons, calling for the entry of young people into professional sport and their membership to take place as late as possible."
"Moreover, we need to ensure that the statutes of national and international sporting federations lay down mission statements and contain clear, precise rules."
"We need to combat the violence which takes place at sporting events and ensure that our citizens are protected."
"Furthermore, we need to eliminate the permanent sporting contract currently used in many sporting federations, as this violates the most basic principles of the Member States' constitutions."
"In conclusion, until a legal basis is established for 'sport' , Europe will not be able to do much in this area and will therefore have to consider the possibility of taking on a certain amount of autonomy in the sector, not in order to take it away from other bodies, but so that it can make an essential contribution to safeguarding the values and functions of sport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was first and foremost concerned that the treaty provisions put into concrete terms by the Bosman judgment should also be observed in future European Union policy."
"We are therefore grateful to the committee responsible that it has incorporated the requests to this effect into its report."
"We also unreservedly support the Commission's position on this issue."
"This is necessary because of competition law and freedom of movement for workers."
"Mrs Reding has already made this point very well."
"I therefore regret all the more that it has become evident over the last few days that many people in positions of authority in football and other sporting associations are unable to learn lessons and enter into a dialogue."
"Judging by the statements made over the last few days, you cannot help feeling that the assumption that a lot of footballers' talents lie more in their legs than between their ears is quite justified."
"So, when we now hear calls for Heads of Government to get involved and turn European law on its head, as it were, then I feel bound to say that this demonstrates that people clearly have no idea what the legal position is."
"This has got nothing to do with Heads of State and Government at all."
"It is the European Commission that is responsible for ensuring that the Treaties are respected. And the Commission is exercising precisely that remit."
"I would like to say, once again, that I unreservedly support the position being taken by the Commission on this issue."
"Mr President, ten days before the start of the Olympic Games, the spectre of doping is hovering over Sidney."
"The International Olympic Committee cannot be serious with its talk of 'clean' Olympic Games when we all know that 1,000 syringes of erythropoietin were stolen from a Sidney hospital a month ago and when one legend of the Olympic spirit after another now openly maintains that there are anti-doping tests for every banned substance only the International Olympic Committee prefers to bow to pressure from big business than to apply them."
"Minister Buffet, who has addressed us so eloquently here today, stated in Le Monde on 4 August that the basic ingredient missing in the fight against doping was strong political will."
"But it would appear to be difficult to exercise this will when there is the pressure of commercialisation and the pressure, encapsulated in the thoughtless and superficial motto of the Olympic Games, to be 'faster, higher, stronger' ."
"It is even more difficult to exercise this political will when the supply of banned substances is much more in demand, with a turnover, as we have heard, of a billion euros, although this turnover is much higher - much, much higher - if we include the mild doping which is spreading through gyms, beauty centres and God knows where else."
"We need to bring our political clout to bear as quickly as possible, we need to harmonise lists of dangerous substances, methods of testing for the new substances which industry is constantly producing, we need to apply sanctions, we need to find out who is responsible and apply sanctions."
"Of course, the European Union needs to take a more active role in the World Anti-Doping Agency, precisely as the President of the Council described, and I agree with him."
"I should like to finish by saying that this World Anti-Doping Agency is quite simply an observer in Sidney today."
"And, as long as we are just observers, nothing will be done in the fight against doping."
"Mr President, sport is a popular activity."
"We have just had Euro 2000, the Olympic Games are about to start, and, what is more, there are an increasing number of people who enjoy sports as a leisure activity."
"It is healthy and brings people together from all walks of life, irrespective of age or race."
"This is, of course, extremely important in a society which increasingly focuses on the individual."
"At the same time, as has already been pointed out, there is also a downside to sport, namely violence around the pitches, the use of doping, an increase in the use of performance-enhancing substances - also increasingly so in amateur sport - and the huge pressure on sportsmen and women due to the major economic interests involved."
"This is why we welcome with open arms the fact that the European Commission has taken it upon itself to highlight the social aspect of sport and to examine how the economic dimension of sport can be reconciled with the educational and other roles that sport fulfils. The PPE-DE is entirely behind this objective and has tabled amendments to give this initiative a boost."
"It has, more specifically, submitted proposals to step up the support given to sports organisations, in order to invest in people, in team spirit and to improve the legal framework underpinning sport, as all we have at the moment is the declaration to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"With regard to a few specific problems which sport is having to contend with, I would like to say the following on the issue of transfers. The Bosman ruling has mainly hit the smaller clubs, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, especially in the smaller countries, such as the Netherlands where I am from."
"These clubs invariably need to make major investments in training and education without sufficient backing or compensation."
"We therefore hope that the Commission, in tandem with the sports organisations, will produce proposals which will make amends in the short term."
"The sports federations, such as UEFA and FIFA, have also submitted proposals to this effect."
"Doping is a huge, international problem, as already pointed out by the rapporteur, who has drafted an excellent report, and it is therefore vital for there to be international cooperation in this respect."
"We will need to agree internationally on what we take doping to mean and will need to refer to the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"It would be useful if pharmaceutical products could be labelled with a 'doping-safe' logo and a warning, and we would also welcome a more pro-active preventive policy."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the Group of the Party of European Socialists asked the Commission to make a statement on the topical subject of football transfers and for it to be added to this joint debate."
"I welcome the statement made by the Commissioner, which has our support."
"I recommend that, in future, she should come to Parliament before so many leaks occur from the Commission administration, which forced the Commissioner to face the press with great courage and determination, not afraid to tell them the truth."
"It would be better if they came to Parliament first and had our support."
"The subject of transfers is perhaps an example that sums up the current situation of sport."
"There are two reports, the Zabell report and the Mennea report, drawn up by Olympic champions."
"On the eve of the Sydney Olympics, I would like to recall that the first, and perhaps the best, contribution to peace made by Europe, that is, by ancient Greece, was precisely the Olympic Games."
"They talk of sport as a citizen' s right, with a social and cultural function."
"There is a component of transfer fees that is justified in terms of the contribution that is made to training and preparing sportsmen."
"This makes sense and needs to be regulated, and we need to support young people and small clubs so that they can promote themselves."
"Another dimension is the big business involved, which in many countries is becoming the second largest sector in the economy."
"We are dealing with uncontrolled, unsustainable long-term speculation."
"A major club in my native city made the biggest transfer in football history - EUR 70 million."
"The person involved has said that it is absurd, and the chairman of the club has said that it is in a very grave economic situation."
"If we were applying the rules of economics, we would have to act differently."
"Therefore, I think that the Commission should act."
"It has managed to make FIFA begin to see sense."
"My group and I would like to show our support for the Commission and we maintain that action has to continue that will really express and guarantee this right of Europeans."
"Finally, I would like to point out that there has been talk of the collapse of the world of football."
"In the United States in the 1940s, under anti-trust legislation, the same measures were applied in Hollywood as those that the Commission is proposing."
"But Hollywood did not go under. Quite the opposite."
"We now have a considerable economic problem in coping with the clout of the American film industry."
"Therefore, keep going, Commissioner."
"I welcome the fact that the Zabell report tries to address the problem of intentional doping and proceeds from the presumption of innocence based on the charter of human rights."
"Unfortunately, UK athletes - Linford Christie, Dougie Walker and Gary Cadogan - were not presumed to be innocent by the International Athletics Association."
"Despite evidence, based on research by Aberdeen University, that nandrolene could be produced by a combination of dietary supplements and vigorous training, Mark Richardson is still waiting, eight days before the Olympics, in the Olympic village not knowing whether he is going to compete or not."
"Linford Christie has campaigned throughout his career against doping in sport."
"He would not do anything now to jeopardise that."
"These cases demonstrate the need for the World Anti-Doping Agency to harmonise disciplinary procedure that would safeguard the rights of athletes but, at the same time, swiftly punish those who knowingly take drugs and are guilty of taking drugs."
"Mr President, I would first like to support what Mr Mennea has said, and then to ask this question: do we see the social significance of sport as the old 'bread and circuses' or 'bread and sport' , or do we see it as a means of improving health and building moral fibre?"
"It has never been clear what social significance we should attribute to it."
"By and large, I have to say that the top-level sport we are generally talking about here is not necessarily a healthy pursuit, any more than the extreme sports that I go in for, or used to do."
"Only the gods on Mount Olympus can say whether top-level sport is healthy or not - we certainly cannot."
"Let me turn to the facts now."
"Because of globalisation, our consumer society has become ever more hungry for stars, sensations and records."
"So, officials and businessmen have turned 'bread and sport' into a branch of show business that is now one of the biggest in the world, and the process of commercialisation, is of course, continuing."
"And the systematic doping that this commercialisation encourages is simply intensifying this process.Those are the facts of the matter."
"There is no way we can change those facts unless we create greater transparency, and unless we set up an independent anti-doping agency which is accessible to everyone and which everyone understands."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one point that I should like to emphasise, a point which is perhaps common to both reports. It revolves around the legitimacy of the specific status of sport, which I should like us to stress today."
"The specific status of sport derives primarily from the sports system, from the social pyramid which is reflected in the structure of small clubs in our towns and rural areas as well as in major sporting events."
"This pyramid must be respected in a number of ways. It must be respected by recognising the sole right of federations to govern their respective sports and by promoting the role that the sports federations can and do play in bonding communities and society at large."
"In so doing, we must, of course, ensure that money is distributed fairly throughout the entire pyramid formed by the clubs and their federations and that what we might call the sporting ethic is applied to all sporting events."
"Let us not forget that it is possible to confuse those who stage events with those who provide the spectacle."
"I believe that an effort has to be made there in the way sport is structured, a point that was raised in Mr Mennea's report, so that there can be no possible confusion between those who stage the event and those who provide us with the information, the spectacle, the entertainment, the pleasure and the dreams."
"There is the system, and then there is the individual too."
"And, of course, there is the issue of doping - and I thank Mrs Zabell here for her magnificent report; all of these are relevant to the health aspect of sport."
"There is the training of sportspeople."
"But what happens to the individual outside the arena?"
"We have been reminded that sportsmen and sportswomen are not commodities, that they are not goods and chattels."
"They must be able to move freely in Europe, but they are not products. They are individuals."
"So what happens when the competition is over?"
"As far as the system and its focal point, the sportsperson, are concerned, what the reports are calling for is the rationalisation of the specific nature of sport in our European Union."
"Considerations of time - the calendar of events and the course of sportspeople's lives - have been highlighted in both reports, and I thank the two rapporteurs for emphasising the need to live before, during and after sport and throughout the whole year."
"So you will understand why we in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are asking for sport to be enshrined in Article 151 of the Treaty in such a way that its specific character is legitimised and that we no longer have to dip into the provisions on health, on education and on employment in order to assemble a case for the preservation of this specific character of sporting activity."
"Mr President, doping is symptomatic of the inverted values of our societies, in which the end has come to justify the means."
"It is primarily a form of cheating, with individuals cheating themselves as well as cheating others."
"That is why there is a need to establish a vast education programme to reinstate the true values of sport and to make it,once again, a school of life and an example for our youngest generations."
"At every level, including the very highest, sport should be an opportunity to teach the virtues of endeavour, courage, team spirit and respect for others."
"The Commission was right to remind us that one of the first causes of the increased prevalence of doping lies in the commercial implications of modern sport."
"That is why our reflections should focus more sharply on the possibility of imposing stiffer penalties on the various economic operators who encourage doping or profit from it."
"Finally, the reason why sport has assumed an important and indeed a central place in our contemporary societies is perhaps because it has become the only means open to a nation to demonstrate its greatness."
"Perhaps the nations ought to rediscover other ways of projecting their greatness and their pride on the world stage, and I cannot help thinking at this moment of national currencies, which are an essential attribute of a country's sovereignty and grandeur."
"Today, as the euro, the currency of the Euro-optimists, plummets, it is an urgent necessity that all nations should be able to keep their own currency, just as they keep their national sports teams, of which they are so proud, with no need of artificial stimulants."
"Mr President, on the eve of the Sydney Games, what remains of the Olympic ideal and the exalted principles of Pierre de Coubertin?"
"Not much, apparently, since some athletes - a minority, I am glad to say - are refusing to stay in the Olympic village, considering it to be below their station."
"Others, especially the sprinters, are proclaiming loud and long that they are only running to promote their particular brand of footwear."
"While it is worrying that top athletes are more motivated by the lure of financial gain than by the sporting ethic, mass sport, by contrast, is a guarantor of good physical and mental health and constitutes a veritable school of life, developing team spirit, tolerance and solidarity and presenting young people with exemplary role models."
"An instrument of education and of social integration and cohesion, sport helps to combat racism, exclusion and violence, but sport, sadly, is being increasingly contaminated by doping, all in the name of business."
"Professional sport has undoubtedly become a business in its own right, subject to the dictates of profitability."
"Some football clubs are already listed on the stock market."
"But as more and more money is invested in sport, the financial rewards gradually come to take precedence over the game itself."
"This creates pressure to win by fair means or foul and particularly by means of doping, which is becoming ever harder to detect."
"How can the sporting ethic be restored?"
"First of all, the fight against doping must be globalised."
"Doping seriously damages athletes' health as well as the essential virtues of sport, namely honesty, fair play, respect for one's opponent, friendship, etc. In that respect, the creation of a World Anti-Doping Agency by the International Olympic Committee in 1999 has to be welcomed."
"Let us hope that it remains independent and that it will become operational very soon."
"It is our job to give it the tools it needs to accomplish its mission."
"Doping is not only a European problem; it is indubitably a problem of global dimensions."
"As far as regulation is concerned, it is not up to Europe to make the rules."
"Europe must show its trust in the voluntary bodies by accepting the proposals from the federations and from other Olympic committees."
"The Bosman decision, for example, which was taken in the name of high principles, has destabilised professional clubs and has exacerbated the impact of money on European football."
"The latest transfer record, set when Figo moved to Real Madrid, is a case in point."
"Clubs in certain countries now build their teams almost exclusively with foreign players."
"This is particularly true of Barcelona, where they are able to field a team without a single Spanish player, which effectively makes it impossible for young nationals to play at the highest level in their country."
"The plundering of young players from the clubs that have developed their skills is another consequence."
"Transfer targets are becoming younger and younger: a player becomes transferable at the age of 15."
"Europe is now trying to legislate on the rules governing transfers, as you, Commissioner, have told us."
"If the scheme under consideration is implemented, which I hope it will not be, the result will be total deregulation of the system, which will benefit the richest clubs still further and despoil the clubs that develop young talent, condemning them to eventual closure."
"The cure is worse than the disease."
"It is therefore essential that we do our utmost to develop mass sport, village clubs, so that everyone can take part in sport and so that every sportsperson who enjoys competing can progress and strive for a place among the elite in healthy and fair competition."
"This is an important debate, and I want to endorse the ideas coming out of the two reports, particularly those of Mrs Zabell on doping and also Mrs Lynne's remarks about the presumption of innocence, because that is important."
"We all recognise nowadays that sport is big business."
"This is particularly clear in football with its enormous transfer fees, often ridiculously high salary levels, and stock market deals, but it is not just football."
"Other sports have a lot of money sloshing around."
"Formula 1 is a good example."
"In, the UK they even had a million pounds to spare for the Labour Party."
"Sport has a lot of money and it cannot expect to be exempt from free market rules."
"I do, however, disagree with the reports when they call for a Treaty clause on sport."
"Jacques Santer was absolutely right when he said Europe must do less but do it better."
"So let us try to operate within our means."
"Let us try to operate within the powers that we already have."
"What is needed regarding transfer fees is a healthy dose of pragmatism and common sense."
"I endorse the Commissioner's remarks this morning."
"I have absolute confidence in her abilities and attitude and wish her well in her forthcoming discussions."
"I would, however, say that there is no rush."
"FIFA has certainly been very slow to act and should be criticised for that, but the Commissioner must also be prepared to listen to the small clubs, the players' organisations, and spectators."
"Let us work for a good solution that we can defend rather than working for a solution this afternoon, or this week, or this month."
"It is something that needs to be sorted out so that the people of Europe will understand."
"Europe needs friends, not enemies."
"Let us not add football spectators to those people who do not understand what Europe is about."
"Come up with a good solution and you will have the backing of this House and the backing of football supporters across Europe."
"Mr President, I also thank Mr Mennea and Mrs Zabell for highlighting the crucial role that sport is now playing in all of our lives, I have to start by saying that sport's importance as an industry is well known, but for sport to become just another industry would be a mistake and a great loss to our society."
"We are all living longer, and sport is occupying a greater part of our time."
"It is there not just to revitalise our bodies but also our minds and our souls, and we have to recognise the importance of that fact in European legislation."
"I therefore support the call for a legal basis that will put our powers on a par with those of the very important international sports organisations."
"Europeans share a love of watching and participating in football, from Newcastle through Dortmund to Barcelona, but it is important that local people should be inspired to join their clubs."
"I would therefore say that the most enduring teams should be built up from scratch and not simply bought up."
"The system needs well-run machinery consisting of clubs of all shapes and sizes and degrees of professionalism and we need to take the opportunity to reform it."
"I support, therefore, Commission statements and the Commissioner's action on this matter."
"Sport has a huge potential."
"It has shown that it can build understanding and fight racism."
"Let us do more work in sport to bring our communities together."
"It has shown that it has the power to encourage disabled athletes to succeed."
"Let us show that we share their pride and build joint events for them and able-bodied people."
"Violence on the field has been the bad side of sport."
"Let us work to ensure that sport is violence-free."
"Doping, finally, is a symptom of the over-commercialisation of sport."
"As our teams head off to Sydney they are under more pressure than ever."
"We have to set up facilities that fight doping on an international basis because, as we have seen, one false accusation can ruin a career or cast a shadow over an exemplary career, such as that of Linford Christie."
"Therefore, we support these reports and hope that they will provide the foundation for us to move forward into the next phase of European sport, a community spirit to build the industry and the potential of sport in Europe."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mennea, for this extremely valuable report."
"Sport fulfils a major social role in our society; that much is clear."
"Professional sport fulfils this role too and has great social significance."
"I have tabled an amendment to Mr Mennea' s report, naturally with his consent, proposing a possible alternative to the transfer system."
"I happen to believe that the performance on the pitch which we are discussing, in other words the job performance, is no longer proportionate to current remuneration levels."
"For this reason, I believe it is merely a commercial activity which should be distributed evenly."
"I would like to know whether you have a response to this."
"Secondly, on behalf of a large number of fellow MEPs, I have requested the final decision with regard to reforming the transfer system to be postponed."
"You commented on it yourself a moment ago. The reason being that UEFA, together with a large number of national football federations, is organising a meeting during the next part-session in October and I would ask you to attend, together with Mr Monti."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no sportsman or woman takes drugs unless he or she has a financial interest in doing so."
"There is no doubt that doping is changing sport and that sport will be changed due to doping, which means it will become absolutely ludicrous if we do nothing to prevent it."
"The combination of enormous and disproportionate financial, media and sponsoring interests surrounding sportsmen and women puts so much pressure on them, and the intensity of sport is so great, that in order to maintain their level of competitiveness and the pace imposed on them by sporting calendars, sportsmen and women tend to use prohibited substances."
"Without limiting the length of competitions and without having obligatory rest time, it will be very difficult to eradicate doping."
"However, we should not forget that sportsmen and women are also human beings who can fall ill or injure themselves, and will therefore need drugs and additional help to combat the stress under which they place their bodies, which is why false positive tests are the order of the day and will brand the sportsman or woman concerned forever."
"What we need to do is to harmonise criteria, have a single list of prohibited substances, homogenise tests, have warnings on drugs and do more research."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to reinvent sport, because as it is at the moment there is a battle for glory, but also for money and sponsorship."
"In order for it not to disappear, we need to go back to the traditional values of sport, in which people compete for one reward only - a medal."
"NGL). (EL) Mr President, we live in an era in which Europe is moving towards federalisation."
"We might say that sport has got there first, that sport built structures before we were able to do so at political, economic or other levels."
"Why?"
"Because sport had its roots in ancient Greek Olympia, sport had prophets such as de Coubertin, and sport allowed peoples to meet in peace."
"Europe was at war but, at the same time, it had common sporting structures and common sporting rules."
"Today the tables have turned: we are preparing to review the Treaty, we are increasing the number of common rules and common principles and our works and structures, while sport is falling apart."
"Why?"
"Because big business calls the shots, because major financiers are involved, because the mass media are backed by strong centres of power and because, in my view, intervention by the European Union is inadequate and misguided."
"By intervening in sporting issues solely from the point of view of competition, the European Union has, in essence, strengthened this trend and this attitude."
"I think we are at a turning point."
"Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which, I think, has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures."
"I think that Mrs Reding also has a positive part to play on behalf of the Commission in changing the way in which the Commission intervenes."
"In this sense, I think that we can avert what is happening in the basketball federation today and what we can see will happen in all the other sports tomorrow, and maintain the unity of sport and its contact with society."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work, which I fully support."
"I think we all agree on the role and importance of sport which, at both competitive and amateur level, is an excellent tool for the education and social integration of both players and spectators."
"Of course, sport is also an extremely important economic phenomenon and, as such, it must follow and comply with certain market rules, as indicated in the famous Bosman judgment."
"However, as has already been pointed out this morning, sport must preserve its unique features, which are primarily of a social and cultural nature."
"Precisely to avoid sport being reduced to nothing more than a business, we must call, loud and clear, upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference at Nice to expressly insert a significant reference to the institutional recognition of sport into Article 151 of the Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have three closely connected items on our agenda today."
"But the problem is that media interest will focus not so much on the Mennea and Zabell reports as on the Commissioner's announcement."
"I think that is a pity."
"We are now more worried about the apple of Germany's eye, football, than about what is really at stake today."
"I have no hesitation in supporting the two Commissioners whose task it is to implement the Bosman judgment."
"If FIFA had done its job, the Commission would not have needed to get involved in this."
"I hope that FIFA recognises that and will now finally come up with something that the Commission can include in its proposals, as long as they do not run counter to the Bosman judgment."
"So I think that everyone has a job to do here."
"As regards the reports, I would like to say that, in view of the big business sport has become, the social and educational importance of popular sport needs to be highlighted."
"There is a danger that sport as a whole will sooner or later be badly hit by rules on competition."
"We would like to prevent that, which is why the Mennea report quite rightly calls for a reference to sport in Article 151 of the Treaty as an aspect of culture."
"I, myself, called for this in my report back in 1996."
"That resulted in a declaration at Amsterdam, which was by no means enough."
"That is why I am supporting the fact that this is finally being introduced now."
"That report also called for the Commission to declare a European Year of Sport."
"A European Year of Sport would be an important stimulus, and I hope that the new Commissioner will now take this up."
"I am delighted that Mrs Zabell has covered some broader ground in her report on doping and that she has also stressed the abuse of young sportsmen and women, and has given an impetus to jointly tackling doping."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on having joined this Anti-Doping Agency now, so that it can genuinely give an impetus to a harmonised approach towards combating doping on behalf of the Community of Fifteen."
"I wish it every luck."
"Mr President, Commissioner, sport is, of course, being discussed by a wide range of people and social groups right now, as the Olympic Games begin in Sydney."
"The reports we have before us also provide a basis for debate."
"The question that inevitably comes to mind is this: what has happened to the idealistic image of sport which is still being portrayed?"
"It is all too easy to be complacent and attribute a very important social and unifying role to sport, where fair play is held up as a model for our interaction with each other, be it at work, in politics or whatever."
"However, both reports show very clearly that sport has become a powerful and extremely tough economic force, and sportsmen and women are its tools."
"They are programmed to achieve peak performances on particular days and during particular weeks, with ever shorter gaps in between, and they have to function like machines."
"In order to overcome human weaknesses, which cannot always be calculated, and to achieve perfect functioning, people resort to doping substances, and it is now becoming harder and harder to detect their use."
"In this way, young sportsmen and women cause damage to themselves, to their health, to their personal development and, last but not least, to sport as an ideal."
"Top sportsmen and women are a role model for thousands of young people and thus have a very strong impact on popular sport, which, as I see it, is the level of sport that most needs to be encouraged."
"A sense of fair play and social interaction are still easy to find at this level. But bad examples such as violent incidents, doping scandals, million-dollar contracts and bankruptcies are also destructive at this level."
"We need to create legal bases to stem these negative trends."
"I welcome the fact that the WADA is now active, and that it is there to combat the worldwide problem of doping."
"Measures are needed against violence and racism in sport, in order to guarantee that sportsmen and women and sports fans are protected against rampaging hordes of hooligans and racists."
"There is also scope for top sportsmen and women to do more on their part and to make it clearer than they have until now that they want nothing to do with 'fans' like these."
"It should be our job to give sport a new role in a changed society, with new and modern technical and medical facilities, and in this way to preserve its values."
"I believe that a European Year of Sport could stimulate this debate and make a substantial contribution here."
"Mr President, after congratulating our colleagues Mrs Zabell and Mr Mennea on their reports and the suggestions they contain, of which I very largely approve, I shall make do with two observations."
"Firstly, I should like to stress the need for Community participation in the World Anti-Doping Agency, which would enable the European Union to make a vigorous and coherent contribution to the struggle against doping."
"Secondly, as I did yesterday, I plead again today for the inclusion in the Treaty of a legal basis relating specifically to sport."
"I am thinking here of a compatibility clause of the sort that exists in the cultural and environmental domains, a clause that would make it possible to take due account - and I stress the word 'due' - of the specific nature of sport in the formulation of the general policy or specific policies of the Community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why the Commission submitted its proposal is to stop players being treated like a commodity, which can be bought by clubs because they are good players and, more to the point, because they can be sold on to other clubs for a great deal more money. I welcome this proposal with open arms."
"Needless to say, this will cause problems, certainly in the short term, for smaller clubs in smaller footballing nations, such as the Netherlands."
"But holding on to the current system would not solve the problem either."
"A more structural solution would be if the media millions were better distributed."
"I therefore hope with all my heart that the large clubs will realise that ultimately, without the small clubs, their future will be bleak too."
"I would like to say the following on the transfer system. I back the Commission proposal but I do hope that it will make provision for recovering training expenses for players between the ages of 18 and 24, as, for example, is being proposed at the moment by FIFA, the international football association, and FIFPRO, the organisation for players."
"I very much hope that UEFA, the European football union, will go along with this request and will stop being the last, self-appointed defender of a system which has created such absurd situations in the first place."
"Mr President, sport, like culture, education and health, is gradually being hijacked by commercialisation and the so-called law of the market."
"Three million people dancing attendance at major sporting events and huge profits for business have eclipsed the athletic ideal."
"Fitness training and sport as a daily exercise and popular sport are in dire straits."
"As long as the winners see 'sport plc' thriving, doping will increase, transfer fees will increase - another form of human trafficking in a modern capitalist society - and the problem of violence at football stadiums and various other signs of degeneration will increase."
"Despite acknowledging that the main reason for the increase in doping is excessive commercialisation, the Commission is doing nothing to combat it."
"How could it, when the entire structure of the European Union is built on the principle of 'there is nothing which cannot be bought or sold' ?"
"It confines itself to half measures. Studies, codes of conduct with passing references to controls."
"If they intended, and really wanted, to combat doping, they would have already done so."
"But it is not in the interests of the International Olympic Committee, the international federations, the sponsors who invest in sport or the pharmaceutical industry."
"The two reports do contain positive elements, but they go so far, in the Zabell report, as to state that the pharmaceutical industry cares about the health of athletes and, in the Mennea report, as to suggest that Member States adopt practical measures in their legislation to encourage private investment in sport."
"Unless we crack down on commercialisation, unless we erect barriers to speculation by big business, unless we introduce basic and efficient controls, nothing will change in sport."
"We do not expect the European Union to take any such action, so we are struggling to develop a popular movement which will fight for modern sport to rediscover the principle of 'a healthy mind in a healthy body' ."
"Mr President, the over-commercialisation of sport has clearly led to the exploitation of many young athletes."
"Proven cases of doping in sporting competitions have diminished the reputation of many sports in the eyes of the public."
"At last, the International Olympic Committee has faced up to its obligations to combat the widespread use of drugs in sport."
"Up to 2500 drug tests will be carried out during the Sydney games."
"I welcome the IOC's announcement that heavy penalties will be imposed on sportsmen and women caught using drugs in Sydney this month and in the future."
"The way to stop the use of drugs in sport should be coordinated on a worldwide basis."
"The Union must continue to work through the World Anti-Doping Agency to ensure that uniform and structured guidelines are implemented for all sporting activities."
"In conclusion, we should recall that the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises the social significance of sport, but the European Union has no powers under the Treaty to take action on sport."
"That is an issue that should be addressed in the ongoing discussions on the reform of Union policies and initiatives."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this debate and the reports are both a step in the right direction."
"Our 700 000 sports clubs are pillars of Europe's civil society."
"The Council Presidency has said that sport is education for life."
"Sport is a part of youth work, a part of education policy, a part of leisure activity, a part of health policy, a part of international understanding, a part of the information industry, and a part of economic affairs and of competition."
"Let me stress that I am saying a part."
"To reduce sport to an economic and competitive level is to deny its wider social significance."
"It has to be said that, up to now, Community law has been applied to sport in a very indiscriminate way, because it primarily treats sport as an economic activity."
"This means that insufficient account has been taken of the special hallmarks of sport and its 700 000 clubs, and of voluntary work done in areas like youth work and training for children and young people."
"Unless we can work successfully with children and young people, and unless Europe has an effective system of sports clubs, we cannot make our aspirations for popular sport a reality."
"Doris Pack has already referred several times to the consequent need to root sport in the EU Treaties and have it influence the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The importance of sport was also mentioned in the conclusions of the Feira Summit."
"It is therefore both a logical and desirable consequence of all this that sport should be given a legal basis in the Treaty."
"We do not want to interfere in the affairs of Member States."
"Sport comes under the principle of subsidiarity."
"We simply want the overall social importance of sport to be recognised by the Commission and in European law, perhaps giving it its own budget heading so that it does not just have to be promoted through pilot projects."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone acknowledges that sport is a means of personal development and a special opportunity to meet other people."
"But does everyone see and recognise the different purposes of participation in sport?"
"For some, it may be a question of keeping fit."
"For others, it may be part of their personal education process, while for others it is the presentation of a spectacle or a quest for victory at all costs."
"We all know that sport is a tremendous instrument of national cohesion and of social integration."
"However, we are also aware that sport can sometimes be accompanied by horrific acts of violence, abominable racist outbursts and unacceptable strident nationalism."
"And for all of these reasons, we cannot accept the idea that sport should be considered in its economic dimension alone."
"Voluntary organisations and individual volunteers are every bit a part of the sporting world, and it is surely thanks to them that sport is alive in our countries and that mass sport will be able to survive in future."
"Not every human act can be priced with a pocket calculator."
"The effect of that approach on human relations is too dangerous for us to remain silent."
"Where there is no money to be won and no obligation to show a profit, there may quite simply be the desire to share these special opportunities, and sport undoubtedly has its place - indeed its foremost place - in such encounters."
"This quest for human bonds in an increasingly commercial society contains the seeds of resistance to the commercialisation of the world and of human relations."
"We cannot accept this excessive striving for profits to the detriment of human development."
"The protection of young sportspeople is a priority of the French Presidency."
"It is our priority, and we must demand the prohibition of commercial transactions relating to these young people."
"We must also, of course, provide for the introduction of sport into the Treaty - if not in the short term, then at least in the medium term."
"It is certainly a challenge, but we must accept it for the sake of coming generations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs speak from experience, as is evident from their first-rate reports."
"As far as Mr Mennea' s report is concerned, I have attempted to highlight three points in the amendments which I tabled, and which have fortunately been adopted in the final motion for a resolution."
"One is the importance of sport as a mental activity in order to learn a number of social skills."
"Secondly, sport helps us appreciate activities in forma pauperis which involve minority groups that deserve more support, also at European level."
"My third point serves as a warning against the yawning gap which can arise between top sport and smaller sports associations on the one hand and professional and amateur sport on the other."
"In both cases, one very much relies on the other."
"As to the question of whether sport should be dealt with at European level, I certainly believe it should."
"Therefore, this report does not mark the end of the game, quite the reverse."
"The role and impact sport has in society have become so enormous, and the entire sports scene is undergoing such change, that as far as the social debate is concerned, we are only just in the first heats, if at all."
"The European Parliament needs to ensure that it is not left on the sidelines in this debate, but plays an active part so that we can help decide the shape of the game."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, action has to be taken in three directions."
"First and foremost, we must wage a relentless fight against doping."
"The financial and political commitment of all the countries of the European Union to the World Anti-Doping Agency is imperative, but it is not enough."
"The most important thing is that governments should arm themselves with proper structures to combat doping."
"France has marked out the path, and I should be interested to know how the President of the Council sees the interaction between the Agency and national initiatives."
"We must also combat the excesses of the transfer system, especially the trade in young professional sportsmen."
"Finally, we must strengthen the real driving forces of sport, namely the federations and sport at school."
"I support the efforts to secure recognition of the key role of sports federations and to protect them from the depredations of financial and media giants."
"Young people must be the main target in the rehabilitation of sport."
"I support the call made by Mr Mennea in his report for sport to be accorded a higher status in the school curriculum as well as his plea that the specific nature of sport be enshrined in the Treaties, otherwise we shall tend to see sport as little more than another domain of free economic competition."
"Is humanity regressing towards the decadence of ancient Rome?"
"Is competitive sport once again becoming a gladiatorial conflict, waged now by robotic humans armed with the latest bio- and cybertechnology and funded by politico-financial interests?"
"The time has come for politicians and sporting authorities to exercise their responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, I am speaking on the Zabell and Mennea reports today in my dual role as a Member of the European Parliament and as president of a professional basketball club which takes part in the major European competitions."
"I wish, first of all, to express my thanks and congratulations to the two rapporteurs for their excellent work, and I should also like to highlight the action of our colleague Doris Pack, who paved the way for the negotiation of the protocol on sport which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Doping is a scourge from which sport has to protect itself."
"It undermines both fair play and genuine competition, and endangers the sportspeople who indulge in it."
"I am personally shocked by the ease with which young sportsmen and women can supply themselves with performance-enhancing drugs, without being checked at all, through the Internet or in certain countries of the European Union."
"Mrs Buffet has been tackling this issue in France, and I congratulate her for it."
"Nevertheless, this evil can only be rooted out if it is combated at European and global levels, and I encourage the Union to work with the World Agency to that end."
"The European Union must also rise to the challenge of the modernisation of sport."
"The European Commission is questioning the system of transfers between clubs, believing it to be contrary to players' freedom of movement."
"But the Commission is totally ignoring the distortion of competition between Member States, the social and fiscal disparity among professional sportsmen, which encourages the best of them to migrate to certain countries."
"We in France should know, because out of our pool of 22 players for Euro 2000, no fewer than 20 have gone off to play in other countries of the Union."
"This phenomenon falls under the heading of social and fiscal dumping, but the Commission, for all its high principles, does nothing to combat it."
"Professional sportspeople are also preyed upon by numerous agents who have exclusive rights to negotiate their employment contracts."
"Not only do the agents charge the players; they are also paid by the clubs, from which they extract commission, and I have first-hand knowledge of this."
"These agents hand over their protégés to the highest bidder, like common merchandise, after having whipped up competition for the players' signatures in order to raise the bidding."
"The abolition of transfers will induce agents to break their clients' contracts several times in the course of a year in order to earn new commission each time a new contract is signed."
"The system of agents must be brought under control by the Union, or perhaps even scrapped."
"I shall conclude by adding that sport must be brought within the scope of the Treaty Establishing the European Community."
"I therefore appeal to all those who govern us, particularly to the French Government, which is currently guiding the work of the European Union, to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held at Nice in December confers a share of responsibility for this matter upon the European Union and involves Parliament in the implementation of this initiative through the codecision procedure."
"Mr President, sport has become a magnificent form of international entertainment."
"It is a source of inspiration for millions and huge sums of money are involved in it."
"Thousands of Finnish people travel to Hungary to see Mika Häkkinen drive, while a Vietnamese hotel receptionist asks the right way to pronounce the name Jari Litmanen."
"The importance of sport and exercise both for societies and for individuals must not, however, get buried under professionalism and commercialism."
"Exercise is educationally important and vital for health."
"Sports societies bring people together to do self-sacrificing voluntary work."
"Along with the positive aspects, we have to remember the flip side of the coin - drugs, violence at sports events and the negative elements associated with player transfers."
"To prevent these we need joint action on the part of the Union and a legal base for sport."
"As we shape sports policy we have to take account of sport' s various structures."
"For that reason, we must ensure that we continue to listen to sport' s NGOs at the Olympics in the wake of the sports conference held in 1999."
"Finally, I would like to turn your attention to the need to improve levels of gender equality in sport and exercise."
"The European Woman and Sport network conference held in June in Helsinki made recommendations which I hope will be taken into consideration at both national and Union level."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their exhaustive work, and I want to express my heartfelt thanks, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council and the Member of the Commission for their excellent speeches at the start of this sitting."
"Mr President, the powerful role of sport in economic, social, and cultural terms and in terms of health cannot be denied."
"It is incomprehensible why sport lacks a legal base in the European Union."
"The European Parliament must frankly force the Commission and the Council to look at themselves in the mirror."
"The status of sport must have a watertight definition produced for it at the next intergovernmental conference so that sports organisations can participate in decision-making on sport themselves."
"As huge sums of money are involved in major sports, common rules and regulations should be drawn up to take account of the system' s basic pillars, sportsmen and the organisers of sporting events."
"The interests of team-game players must be safeguarded, all the while honouring the principle of the free movement of labour, not forgetting financial reward for the so-called trainer associations."
"We have to find a balance in the question of televising the most important sports events, one between the economic power of the organisers on the one hand, and the so-called public service principle on the other."
"When we talk about drugs we have to make a clear distinction, as we do when it comes to any other discussion on sport, between keep-fit exercise and major sporting events."
"The ethical problems associated with the latter are known to all."
"Too little attention has been paid to the spread of the use of drugs among ordinary people who do sports, proof of which lies, for example, in the trade in banned substances which is rife in gyms generally."
"The problem can be considered on a par with the narcotics problem, especially the use of synthetic drugs, so, simply out of concern for public health, the EU must do its bit to beat the problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this very fruitful debate, I shall simply make a few observations."
"Because we are all concerned about the excesses that occur in sport, it is very understandable that we have been focusing on those excesses, but it must also be stressed that the vast majority of the men and women who are involved in sport - participants and voluntary officials in local sports clubs and in sports associations - are men and women with a high regard for the values of sport, advocates of the sporting ethic who want sport to be a means of individual and collective development."
"I refute the charges of universal drug-taking, I refute the idea put forward a moment ago that footballers' brains are all in their feet and that they are incapable of thinking."
"Sportswomen and sportsmen are citizens of our countries."
"Perhaps we should give them more of a hearing so that they themselves can express their hopes and their fears."
"Setting aside the excesses, we should also be aware that, in the world of association football for example, only one per cent of all players registered with the International Federation of Football Associations are professionals."
"So what we must try to defend is the whole of sporting activity, not just one aspect of it."
"I believe that this is extremely important."
"With regard to doping, I entirely agree with the idea that its underlying causes have to be tackled."
"We have heard talk of sporting calendars. Let me also mention the dependence of some sportspeople on results and on sponsorship."
"Similarly, there is a need to speak about the pressures from the media giants, which invariably try to raise the stakes in any competition."
"So, the underlying causes have to be tackled, and without delay;"
"I believe the accent must be placed on controls, on sporting sanctions and on action against the supply chains."
"Not enough action is being taken at the level of the European Union to dismantle the chains through which these stimulants are made available within sporting circles."
"Concerning the specific question that was asked, I believe it is absolutely essential that each Member State and the European Union as a whole should work on a sort of convention which would be signed between the States and WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, to facilitate the work of WADA in all countries, whatever their current legislation."
"On the question of transfers, allow me to give my position and the position of the French Presidency."
"I am not in favour of maintaining the status quo, because we are familiar with the huge excesses which it has created and which have no economic, social or sporting justification."
"Nor do I wish the transfer system to disappear completely, because that would bring about an even more anarchic free-for-all than the one we are experiencing today, and the essential focus of inter-club rivalry would be the ability to offer the fattest pay packets."
"In the past 48 hours, FIFA has made some extremely constructive and interesting proposals, which, if adopted, would serve to protect the youth-development system and individual rights, as well as satisfying the clubs' need to build and train teams."
"This should be an interesting basis for discussion with the Commission, as Mrs Reding was explaining a short while ago."
"So there is the possibility of innovative proposals in this domain."
"It is vital, however, that some of the major clubs which seek complete deregulation, so that they can organise private competitions, do not try to sabotage the discussion process on which FIFA and the Commission are about to embark."
"Someone spoke of the 'social role of sport' and asked whether it meant that sport was the opium of the people."
"No, I believe that the social role of sport simply consists of enabling individuals to find themselves through an activity, to blossom, to meet other individuals and to engage together in something of benefit to them in their lives."
"Finally, you may rest assured that the French Presidency, having listened to you, will proceed with great determination towards the establishment of a solid basis for the recognition of the specific status of sport and in the fight against doping."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"With regard to what has just happened, I am sorry, but, as you could see, it is very hard to make a speech when the Members are in the Chamber to vote."
"I am sorry, but many Members did, however, listen attentively to you."
"Some of them even gestured to me to resort to an Olympic sport - gavel-throwing - in order to silence certain other Members who were making too much noise."
"Unfortunately though, I only have one gavel: I would have needed 80 or 100 to throw at all the Members who were not listening to your speech."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Mr President, in West Timor, or rather the Indonesian part of the island of Timor, at least three United Nations officials from the UNHCR were violently beaten and killed yesterday."
"The European Parliament must denounce this barbarous and despicable act, which according to some eyewitness reports took place with the complicity or connivance of the Indonesian military authorities."
"Secondly, this act occurred on the same day that the majority of Heads of State and Government were meeting in New York at the Millennium Summit organised by the United Nations itself, which demonstrates the weakness of this organisation and of the instruments at its disposal to protect men and women far from their own countries who were simply endeavouring to defend human rights and the rights of refugees."
"Mr President, I would like you to convey a message of solidarity to the United Nations. I would also like you to inform the Indonesian authorities of the outrage felt by the Members of the European Parliament and to stress our wish that people whose sole objective is to defend peace, human rights and the dignity of the Timorese people, be they in Indonesia or in Timor Lorosae, should be respected."
"I am sure the President would be prepared to convey her views to the appropriate authorities in the manner which you indicated."
"The Heads of State and Government, meeting in the UN, observed a minute of silence in honour of the peacekeepers who died and I think it would be appropriate if this House did the same."
"(The house rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Mr President, I wish to support the sentiments expressed by Mr Seguro and to draw the Commission's attention to this issue."
"On various occasions throughout this year I have emphasised the potentially premature nature of the new policy being adopted by the European Union towards Indonesia, given that it is particularly clear that there is a degree of uncertainty."
"This has unfortunately become clear in recent weeks."
"I have addressed various questions to the Commission on this subject, and the seriousness of yesterday's events, together with other facts such as the infiltration of militias into East Timor, clearly demonstrate that the situation is not yet safe."
"The European Union must, once more, make its views known to the Indonesian Government as forcefully as possible, in particular through the channel of the European Commission."
"We understand the difficulty of the situation in Indonesia, but it is essential to demand that the Indonesian Government should exercise its authority on its own territory."
"We will only be able to change our attitude towards that country once democracy is effectively ensured in Indonesia and self-determination and peace are guaranteed on Timor."
"Mr President, I very rarely rise on a point of order and particularly now when we have extremely important votes to conduct, I only do so on what I consider to be an extremely important point."
"Your predecessor in the chair has just apologised to Commissioner Reding and I think that the whole House would wish to endorse that verbal apology."
"This week we have demonstrated here in Parliament that when we want to call the Commission to order, we can do so and the Commission responds in the appropriate manner."
"But when a Commissioner is making an extremely important speech which demonstrates the amount of work and effort that she has put into a subject, which perhaps generates as much interest in the people we represent as anything else, there is complete chaos and a shambles in the Chamber."
"I do not accept what your predecessor said, that it was difficult to call the house to order; that can always be done and it should be done."
"My request is that an apology to Commissioner Reding be now made in writing on behalf of Parliament and I hope this is not an experience we see repeated."
"I know that Viviane Reding is a very robust parliamentarian, as well as now a Commissioner and I am sure she managed to cope with it, but I take the point."
"It is perfectly appropriate to make her an apology in writing."
"Vote"
"Mr President, normal practice would have been that I should have led the debate last night, but unfortunately due to a scheduling problem that was not possible."
"I would like to commend this result of the conciliation to the House."
"It was probably the most difficult conciliation and overall framework directive that this House has had to handle."
"The way in which Mrs Lienemann conducted the whole matter of taking all the political groups the whole way through was really something to be admired."
"I congratulate her most comprehensively for the way she did it."
"We now have before us a legally binding directive which Parliament can be fully proud of."
"That was not the position with the original directive."
"We now have a legally enforceable directive which means that the environment of the Community over the next twenty years really has the opportunity of improving."
"My only complaint, and this is why I took the floor, was that during the conciliation process non-governmental organisations were trying to influence Parliament beyond the stage that Parliament had agreed in its second reading."
"Documents were very often available to those organisations before they were available to members of the Conciliation Committee."
"This is not tolerable."
"In conciliation, where we need to build trust between the Council of Ministers and Parliament, we need confidentiality."
"This is something that we have to address seriously in the future."
"I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency for the way they conducted the conciliation, but I hope that Parliament will be able to improve this situation internally for the future."
"(Applause)"

"Report (A5-0212/2000) by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the European Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on end-of-life vehicles (C5-0258/2000 - 1997/0194(COD))"
"(Parliament approved the joint text)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0218/00) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting (5347/2/00 - C5-0220/2000 - 1997/0348(COD))"
"This report has some positive aspects, in particular the restatement of the binding nature of the proposed measures to protect water quality."
"But by granting deadlines, in particular a 20-year time-limit for banning discharges of hazardous substances, the report makes a nonsense of its own resolution."
"That time-limit is equivalent to authorising undertakings to discharge their toxic substances for another 20 years."
"Moreover, it is not made sufficiently clear that it is up to polluting undertakings to pay for any damage they have caused."
"As for charging for water, the only decision that would be in the interests of the public would be a ban on all private profit-making from the supply and distribution of water, but that is not even mentioned in this report, which, in pillorying Ireland for its practice of publicly financing water provision, is instead at pains to stress the commercial nature of this vital substance."
"That is why we abstained."
"Although I support the report, I wish to make known certain reservations pertaining to same."
"Ireland's derogation for domestic water charges is not as strong as I would want it to be."
"The key provisions - Art. 9, paragraph 4 - state that a Member State ""shall not be in breach of this Directive"" if a decision not to introduce domestic water charges based on ""established practice does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive""."
"It follows from this paragraph that a decision not to impose water charges would be in breach of the Directive if it can be linked to the Irish Government's failure to meet the new standards."
"I have no confidence, given the Irish Government's failure to date, that they will reach the standards set."
". I support the Conciliation Agreement which has been agreed by the European Parliament and the European Council on the Framework Directive on Water."
"This Directive provides a framework for consolidating legislation which has been in existence at national and European level concerning the whole area of the safety of surface water and ground water."
"The core elements of this Directive ensure the protection of surface water, coastal water, internal waste and ground water now and into the future."
"The European Council, which represents the fifteen Governments of the EU, originally did not include any provisions relating to the elimination of hazardous substances in this new Water Directive."
"I am supporting this Conciliation Agreement, which guarantees that the elimination of hazardous substances will now feature in this Directive and addresses this imbalance."
"From an Irish perspective, we make the working assumption that the elimination of hazardous substances includes the prohibition on discharging radioactive substances as well."
"Water pricing was always going to be a sensitive aspect to this Directive."
"This Directive now calls on Member States to take account of the principle of the recovery of the cost of water services, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter-pays principle."
"Member States must ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies will provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently."
"Member States will be allowed on an exceptional basis to opt out of the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on established national practices."
"Water pricing policy is also a taxation issue."
"Under existing EU Treaties such tax changes require the unanimous support of all EU Governments."
"It is only right and proper that this matter of taxation is left in the domain of Member States, which must have the final say as to what taxation policies, at local or national level, it wishes to pursue."
"As a result of the implementation of this Directive, the safety of water quality standards in Europe will substantially improve."
". (DE) With its communication ""Pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources"", the European Commission is seeking to harmonise and give practical form to the economic provisions of the EC framework directive on water resources."
"The Commission's proposal to monitor observance of the break-even principle by means of price surveillance is aimed at those EU Member States that still heavily subsidise their water industries."
"In contrast, in Germany the break-even principle is already being implemented, as is monitoring of unfair practices by the cartel office and by local authorities."
"Against this background, the framework directive on water resources and the Commission proposal on water pricing should not be used to create further layers of bureaucratic supervision in Germany."
"Furthermore, the provisions on the charging of environmental and resource costs associated with water use are aimed at those Member States that still make excessive use of and pollute their water resources, and therefore not at Germany, where exceptional efforts are already being made in this respect."
"The provisions of the framework directive on this point do not, therefore, provide any grounds for introducing a universal water or sewage tax in Germany, for example."
"In view of the non-binding nature of the economic provisions of the framework directive on water resources and the Commission communication, there is a danger that there will be a considerable delay in implementing these provisions in the countries actually being targeted, if they are, in fact, implemented there at all."
"If, as has already been the case with the transposition of other directives, Germany, the 'model pupil' , goes its own way, this would heighten the distortions in competition between the national water industries in the EU still further, thus running counter to the aim of the directive, which is to create a uniform framework for Europe's water industry."
"Germany has to learn to implement EU provisions in accordance with the objectives of the directive, not as individual Länder would like."
"With the EU framework directive on water resources we will once again see individual countries going their own way."
"The framework directive on water has finally been adopted - very welcome news."
"Ever since 1997 the European Parliament has been calling for the piecemeal nature of water legislation in Europe to be brought to an end."
"After nearly four years, these rationalisation attempts have finally borne fruit."
"The conciliation between Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the final stage in the legislative procedure, has enabled what I consider a balanced and satisfactory compromise to be reached."
"The discussions were difficult, but I am happy that the Council finally agreed to make the main objectives of these new rules binding."
"Our Parliament could not have endorsed a text which was nothing more than a statement of intent."
"The PPE/DE Group has always taken an ambitious and realistic stance."
"In my view, it was essential for this new framework directive to guarantee, in the future and for the sake of future generations, improvements in European water quality."
"Henceforth, water management in Europe will be based on the principle of a hydrographical district, a body that goes beyond the administrative boundaries of Member States and takes account of the real water situation in Europe."
"The objective is gradually to eliminate discharges of hazardous substances, within 20 years of their identification."
"That is a realistic compromise between, on the one hand, Mrs Lienemann' s initial position in favour of a zero level of discharges into water and, on the other, the position of the Council, which was opposed to any binding objective."
"A list of what are called 'priority' substances will be submitted to the European Parliament in the near future."
"That will be a vital step and I hope our Parliament will be able to follow the same line as today."
"Under the polluter-pays principle, the Member States will have to incorporate environmental costs in water pricing."
"That is real progress."
"Water is a vulnerable and invaluable natural resource."
"Public health and long-term supplies are at stake just as much as biological diversity and landscape conservation."
"For all these reasons, I voted for this text."
"Nevertheless, I am sorry that we could not keep the article allowing Member States to transfer water in the form in which we had adopted it at second reading."
"That kind of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always upheld."
"In that sense, it deserves strong EU support, in the context of promoting trans-European networks and regional policy."
"All proposals aimed at improving the environment in Europe are to be welcomed."
"Trying to incorporate piecemeal water policies in one framework directive represents a considerable challenge."
"The binding commitment the European Union has made to its Member States to eliminate discharges of hazardous substances into water within 20 years is certainly a step forward, even if 3 years are enough for certain chemical products."
"Although we welcome the introduction of water management plans based on hydrographic basins, we must remain vigilant when applying these policies; here I am thinking particularly of the project to divert water from the Rhone basin towards Spain."
"In that specific case, priority should be given to water management and the water savings that can be made, before massive projects to transfer water from one hydrographic basin to another are proposed."
"The European Union now also needs to consider water pricing."
"It is unacceptable for multinationals alone to fix water prices, on the pretext that they are providing a technical water management service."
"This directive represents a step in the right direction, but there will have to be more precise rules to reduce water pollution upstream."
"Florenz report (A5-0212/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the Conciliation Committee' s definitive decision on the directive on end-of-life vehicles."
"I voted in favour, not just because pensioners and elderly people who have reached a certain age feel that their fate is similar to that of cars, but, above all, because it is right and proper that, at last, thanks to Europe' s initiative, a solution has been found to the problem of where to put cars when they do not work any more."
"I would, however, suggest improving on our decision, by providing for the payment of a deposit when a new car is purchased, to be returned when the old car is brought back."
"I welcome the agreement which has been secured between the European Parliament and the European Council which represents the fifteen Governments of the European Union on this specific directive."
"We know that each year within the EU there are up to nine million vehicles that are scrapped on an annual basis."
"This directive, which will now be enacted uniformly across the European Union, will ensure that cars will be disposed of in the future in a more environmentally friendly manner."
"All vehicles within the European Union must now be fully recyclable by the year 2015."
"This is only right and proper because the European Union has both national and international obligations to implement more environmentally friendly legislation."
"Up to 75% of all metallic components in new vehicles can be recycled as metal scrap."
"This process should and must continue in an effort to promote higher environmental standards."
"This directive aims to increase the scope for vehicle recycling and to encourage the re-use of car components."
"This can be achieved by improving the construction of various commercial motor vehicles and by setting up dismantling facilities throughout the European Union."
"The common position established the right for the last owner to return a vehicle to a treatment facility free of charge."
"There is an obligation on manufacturers to bear the whole or a large part of the cost of implementing these measures and for them to take back end-of-life vehicles at no charge to the last owner."
"It was agreed at conciliation between the European Parliament and the fifteen Governments of the EU that this provision should now apply from 1 January 2007."
"However, any Member State within the EU is free to implement this specific provision of this directive earlier than this date."
"Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances."
"We must all ensure that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars at the design stage."
"The European Parliament and the European Council at conciliation have also agreed that all vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 should not contain any heavy metals such as cadmium or lead."
"Car manufacturers must also provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved within the coming years."
"In conclusion, I have had much representation in Ireland on the need to take cognisance of the special vintage car industry in Europe."
"At the request of the European Parliament, collector's vehicles will now be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive."
"This is very important in light of the key social and economic role the vintage car sector plays in promoting tourism across the length and breadth of Europe."
"We conservatives seldom vote against conciliations."
"We cannot, however, support the compromise reached in the conciliation group concerning the way in which end-of-life vehicles are to be dealt with."
"The compromise contains retroactive measures, and we cannot back a legislative text which alters the rules retrospectively."
"Retroactive legislation affects competition and is unacceptable from a legal point of view."
". (FR) I have spoken several times previously on this complex subject involving quite considerable economic interests, but also, and above all, the protection of the environment."
"The proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles, submitted in 1997, is aimed at preventing the creation of scrap from vehicles and promoting the re-use, recycling and recovery of vehicles and their components, so as to reduce the amount of scrap produced by end-of-life vehicles that are dumped or incinerated without any energy recovery."
"The European Commission' s strategy is based on measures such as increasing the percentage of re-usable components, ensuring an adequate number of collection points for end-of-life vehicles, achieving a number of objectives regarding the re-use and recovery of end-of-life vehicles, checks on the use of certain heavy metals in vehicle manufacture and ensuring that the cost of disposing of end-of-life vehicles is not borne by the last owner."
"The negotiations came up against stumbling blocks on several points. The difficulties focused on producer liability and the treatment of heavy metals."
"After several hours of conciliation, the negotiators managed to reach agreement."
"On the question of producer liability, the directive stipulated that the last owner would be able to return an end-of-life vehicle free of charge and required producers to bear a substantial part of the cost of treating end-of-life vehicles."
"The compromise provides that for new vehicles, i.e. for those put on the market after 1 July 2002, producers should be liable from that date."
"For existing vehicles, i.e. vehicles put on the market before 1 July 2002, producer liability would begin in 2007 rather than 2006."
"The directive would also allow Member States to introduce these provisions before the dates specified."
"On the question of heavy metals, the Council and Parliament have agreed that vehicles put on the market after 1 July 2003 should no longer contain heavy metals such as cadmium, lead or hexavalent chromium."
"The two delegations reached agreement on the exceptions set out in Annex 2 of the directive."
"Apart from that, I am glad that Parliament' s call for vintage cars to be excluded from the scope of the directive was favourably received."
". (FR) The compromise that came out of the conciliation procedure, the final legislative stage, is the result of hard negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"Far from being satisfactory, I see it merely as a first step, although it does, in some respects, go in the right direction."
"While I welcome the figured objectives that have been set (by 2006, 85% of the weight of vehicles produced after 1980 is to be recycled, re-used or recovered, and 95% by 2015) I regret the hypocrisy of some of the provisions advocated by the PSE and supported by the Socialist and Social-democratic Governments."
"The Council of Ministers has, in fact, remained inflexible about allowing the owner to return his end-of-life vehicle free of charge."
"That is a demagogic provision."
"It may well be based on goodwill towards the consumer, but it is totally unrealistic."
"In fact, the directive stipulates that the cost of treatment will be borne entirely by the producers."
"The latter are bound to pass on at least part of these costs to the purchase price of new vehicles."
"So, far from encouraging the purchase of a new generation of less polluting vehicles, this measure is a hidden bonus for those who own the most polluting old vehicles."
"The Council of Ministers finally responded to the wishes of the MEPs, who had been calling since the first reading, for vintage vehicles to be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive."
"The amendment I tabled and supported has, in fact, been fully incorporated into the final text."
"In wider terms, this directive is not ambitious enough."
"For example, it says nothing at all about the problem of the dumped cars that disfigure the landscape."
"Despite the polluter-pays principle, it is the taxpayers who bear the cost of removing them."
"It is a pity that neither this directive nor the directive on the disposal of waste has concerned itself with this problem, which, after all, has disastrous environmental effects in much of Europe."
"De Roo report (A5-0218/2000)"
"Mr President, following this directive, tyres will be quieter: cars, lorries and road trains will make less noise as they drive along roads and motorways."
"That is good news, because pensioners like peace and quiet."
"Nevertheless, four weeks ago, Mr President, I was crossing the road near the Gare du Nord in Brussels, and a shiver went down my spine because it was night, you could have heard a pin drop, and I saw a tram pass behind me in complete silence."
"Thankfully, God wanted me to be here so I could give my explanations of votes and I was not hurt."
"But are we really sure that less noisy tyres are really in everyone' s best interests?"
"We can only congratulate our colleague, Mr de Roo, and support him in his efforts to include noise pollution in the context of protecting the environment."
"Unfortunately, the impact of the increase in road traffic density is not limited to pollution from end-of-life vehicles and their recycling, something that has not yet been resolved in spite of its worldwide nature, or to the damage and harm this does to the air we breathe, or even to the serious resultant global warming."
"Road traffic also produces considerable, incessant noise pollution, which millions of people living beside roads and motorways as well as the humble pedestrian have to suffer on a daily basis."
"So, the purpose of Mr de Roo' s proposals is to highlight a form of pollution that is generally overshadowed by others, and here we support him fully."
"But let us not forget that we must also set out more general requirements in relation to pollution from cars, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in developed societies and in our towns, and let us put pressure on the Commission to introduce policies to shift traffic off the roads and onto the railways and public transport."
"The Strasbourg tram is a clear illustration of this."
". (NL) For a long time now, the use of cars for transporting people and goods has been such a matter of course that we have given little thought to the effect this has had on many people and the environment."
"We only saw the economic gain and how convenient it was for the car driver, not the drawbacks."
"Exhaust fumes and the lack of traffic safety were accepted as part of the deal, as well as the noise cars generate."
"Fortunately, over the past few years, this attitude has started to change."
"Many cities give bicycles and trains more space and restrict the freedom of cars."
"This does not end the problems caused by cars and lorries."
"The number of cars is still on the increase, as is the proportion of freight transport by road, and with it, noise pollution."
"Looking at it through the eyes of the car industry, it is evident that manufacturers will pass the buck."
"They will look to the road owner - in general the Government - to increase safety and to reduce environmental pollution."
"As long as the car industry succeeds in doing this, they, themselves, do not have to look into reducing pollution caused by cars, or incur any additional costs as a result."
"In their opinion, noise pollution should be countered by using 'very open asphalt concrete' , a road surface which, however, can turn unexpectedly slippery overnight when frosty."
"What matters now is that a choice should be made between the interests of the car and the car-tyre industries on the one hand, and the interests of the public and the environment on the other."
"Far too often, we see that the short-term interests of powerful industrial groups are given priority, whilst the majority of our electorate increasingly sets different requirements for political decision-making."
"Protecting the quality of our life, rather than making a fast buck, is gaining in importance all the time."
"This contrast was highlighted once again during the debate on car tyres."
"Mr De Roo was right in demonstrating that the regulation proposed by the Commission will not sufficiently improve matters, and that it is technically possible to reduce pollution by a few decibels."
"This simply requires the political will to put sufficient regulations in place, to monitor compliance with the regulations and not to allow too much leeway."
"The Group of the European United Left has constantly backed Mr De Roo in this."
"We regret that his reasonable and self-evident proposals cannot count on the general approval they deserve."
"Mankind moves, and moves other objects."
"Movement creates noise."
"Our amazing age of movement, to which we also owe our sense of freedom, is a noisy one."
"It is our freedom that creates noise."
"The states, and also industry, are working to combat this noise pollution, which can cause illness."
"The industry endorses the legislator' s resolve to make transport, the movement of people and goods, which is a cornerstone of free movement, safer and less polluting."
"We are aware of the progress made in road holding, in resistance to wear and tear, in reducing fuel consumption, but for known technical reasons the investments in research and technology do not yet allow all the rapporteur' s demands to be reconciled."
"Global performance is estimated according to a range of often conflicting criteria that are well-known to tyre-manufacturers."
"Yet we chose not to support the rapporteur because the amendments he has proposed will adversely affect safety, our safety, the life span of tyres and their road-holding properties."
"We condemn these amendments, which would lead to what I would also call a nonsense in industrial terms."
"Yet again, the Union is putting the devil in the detail."
"And I will never cease to be surprised at the areas the Commission pokes around in and finds reason to legislate on."
"Noise in all its forms may well be a scourge in our town centres, around our airports, on our roads, yet surely we should put road safety first."
"Anyway, what do we find most annoying on a day-to-day basis?"
"Is it the muffled sound of tyres in contact with the road, or the sudden acceleration of vehicles and the roar of powerful motorcycles?"
"It would be better to do some in-depth research on road surface noise and dangers."
"Let us not lose our sense of priorities and, what I would term, legislative efficiency."
"Bakopoulos report (A5-0168/2000)"
"Mr President, I also voted for the Bakopoulos report because it is certainly right to exercise a certain amount of caution when placing products on the market which could be harmful to us all."
"But I would suggest that we are going too far with these directives, and that we are taking up too much of Parliament' s time discussing such technical subjects, such technically important subjects."
"Would it not be preferable to authorise the Commission to decide in a single directive which new harmful elements should be marketed, thereby avoiding spending so much time on each occasion that this comes up, going through the procedures to ban the placing on the market of new products yet again?"
"AIDS:"
"We voted for the joint resolution on AIDS, because if it produced any effects, and there is no guarantee of this, it would mean progress."
"Yet we do not always agree with the wording, in particular of the recital that implicates only the African Governments or cultural and religious traditions that obstruct the effective implementation of anti-AIDS measures."
"That may be true, but at the same time it is a way of concealing the responsibility of an entire health system dominated by pharmaceutical trusts and the race for profit."
"The reason people die in Africa, as in many poor countries, of malaria, bilharzia, tuberculosis or even just measles is not because of religious obstacles but because the people who are ill can afford neither medicines or care."
"Telecommunications:"
"We voted against the joint resolution on mergers in the telecommunications sector."
"This resolution, in fact, does away with any idea of public service in considering that this sector, like others, should be based on 'an open market economy with competition' ."
"Moreover, the vague reference to the 'guarantee of growth and employment' will certainly not protect workers against the likelihood of redundancies as a result of future mergers."
"No binding rules are being envisaged to prevent companies from laying off workers on the pretext of restructuring, whereas the truth is that they are seeking to boost their profits."
"Furthermore, obviously we do not propose to join in the ode to 'effective competition' contained in this resolution."
"Once again communication is being regarded purely as a commodity from which to derive the highest possible profit."
"We reject that approach, which disregards people' s social needs."
"The ever-increasing influx of private capital into public operators that have become multinationals is now encouraging these operators to wage a ruthless economic war."
"This means a way of sharing out the world markets that gives priority to the more profitable areas and leads to unfair pricing, quite apart from job losses and job insecurity for hundreds of thousands of workers."
"The national and European political authorities must therefore impose public service constraints on all these operators, whatever their origin, for example:"
"for fixed telecommunications: lower charges for local calls, which in France make up 83% of the average bill of private individuals;"
"for mobile communications: in addition to lower charges, total coverage of the territory, even if it means using satellite links in inaccessible places;"
"for rapid Internet access: in addition to a radical reduction in charges, a timetable for the complete coverage of the territory."
"At a time of indecent, record profits, that is how to include communication among the fundamental rights respected by a quality public service."
"Human cloning:"
"Mr President, the majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has voted in favour of this resolution."
"In the debate in the Chamber yesterday on cloning, I heard a number of people more or less clearly defending cloning for the purposes of medical treatment, on the grounds that this would be quite different from cloning for reproductive purposes."
"Unfortunately, there is a tendency now to engage in a new semantic debate or strategy of this kind which would lead to a watering down of the moral implications of cloning human beings."
"Those who do not wish to permit any form of cloning would be viewed as immoral in the sense that we would be allowing people to suffer from diseases such as Parkinson' s which would be curable if only the ban on gene technology were lifted."
"This is a completely absurd assertion which I think ought to be withdrawn."
"Researchers throughout the world have said that Parkinson' s disease and other serious illnesses can perfectly well be cured by other methods."
"We also heard Emma Bonino say that politicians must take risks, but we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that it is our absolute duty as elected representatives to identify the risks and to be careful."
"In this connection, I should also like to ask the Group of the Party of European Socialists why they have not called on Tony Blair to withdraw the whole proposal, but are content to request that a committee on biotechnology be set up."
"We must observe the precautionary principle, in this case more so than ever."
"We must ask ourselves the most important question of all. For what purpose should we clone human beings?"
"I believe we must realise that there is a race going on in the field of genetic technology, which means that there is a great risk of overstepping the limits in a quite horrifying way."
"The technology is developing incredibly fast now."
"We cannot just content ourselves with this debate. Rather, we must push the debate further and speed it up, whilst also observing the precautionary principle."
"I was one of the 237 MEPs who voted for the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats on human cloning."
"Science has always had two sides to it: it has always been the case that discoveries can be used for our benefit or against us: the wheel can be used to move us around more quickly or to kill people; revolvers can be used to defend or murder people; atomic energy can improve our lives or make atomic bombs."
"In the case of cloning research, I wonder whether, in actual fact, a decision has already been made to do something to harm humanity rather than waiting for unbiased research to generate scientific results and only then deciding how to use them."
"It would have been better if Europe were able to decide and not just one Head of State."
"Mr President, given the conflicting viewpoints on the therapeutic cloning of humans, we can imagine that a great deal of restraint will be needed when applying this new technique."
"Commercial and industrial cloning, or cloning in order to create people with certain characteristics is unacceptable in everyone' s book, and rightly so."
"Nevertheless, we are today dealing with two conflicting points of view."
"Within the GUE/NGL Group, it has been left up to the conscience of the individual members as to how they wish to vote."
"In my opinion, the difference between the views of the Christian Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Social Democrats and Liberals on the other hand is that the former emphasise the penal implications for the medical profession, whilst the latter focus on the need for further research into the effects."
"I myself endorse the latter."
"A solution needs to be found for people who need a new heart, a new kidney or liver, as well as for people suffering from Parkinson' s disease."
"This too is a question of ethics."
"My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, exercises utmost reserve with regard to cloning and genetic manipulation."
"From this perspective, I have been able to support the alternative put forward by the Social Democrats and Liberals rather than that put forward by the Christian Democrats and Greens which goes for all-out rejection."
"Moreover, it appears as though it will be possible, within the next couple of years, to use the recipients own brain stem cells to grow organs which are not rejected by their bodies."
"I very much prefer this technique over and above the circuitous route developed in Great Britain, which is based on the reproductive technique."
"Mr President, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities and the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I voted in favour of all parts of the resolution from the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats."
"I am extremely pleased about the decision taken."
"At the same time, I am concerned about the narrow majority by which the resolution was adopted: 237 votes in favour, 230 votes against and 43 abstentions."
"I presented a text concerning the unique, equal and inviolable dignity of human life when the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was adopted almost unanimously by this Parliament, was referred to us for consideration."
"It is important that we be guided by the view of human life which has characterised this Europe of ours for more than a thousand years."
"Civilisation and humanity show their character most clearly in the way in which they treat life when it is defenceless."
"We must say no to the cloning of human beings."
"Human beings are subjects, not objects."
"Mr President, I think it is a great achievement in human rights terms that we have succeeded in giving a signal with this resolution - a signal that it is not acceptable for embryos to be deliberately created for research purposes."
"And I think that this resolution makes it clear that human life must not become a kind of consumer item."
"But I, too, am unhappy about the small majority in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"I hope that this is just because of tactical games on the part of the Socialist Group."
"I have to say that I think their behaviour here has been shameful."
"There have been calls for a temporary committee without it being made clear that Tony Blair is delaying his decision until this committee comes to a conclusion."
"This smacks of contradiction."
"It is shameful, to say the least, to ditch all your principles out of loyalty to Blair."
"I would like to stress once again that we have always said that this is about 'therapeutic cloning' ."
"We have the alternative of using human stem cells to achieve the same result."
"But I also hope that the Commission will now have the courage to act on the demands we have made in this resolution, by refusing to grant research funding to establishments which use these means directly or indirectly."
"Mr President, this morning our group discussed our attitude to paragraph 5 of the motion for a resolution on cloning, which states that there can be no difference made between cloning for reproductive purposes and any other sort."
"The matter is a controversial one and depends very much on one' s chosen perspective."
"There are two points of view, with no real great difference between them."
"In the first place, technically speaking it is a question of the same sort of procedure."
"Secondly, philosophically speaking, if the action is examined from the point of view of the foetus, there is no difference at all."
"In either case it is being used as a tool, as something to use, and not as a living being with intrinsic value."
"Everyone is touchingly unanimous in their opinion that cloning for purposes of reproduction is unethical."
"My own profound concern relates to what grounds we have for preventing it, and I am someone who has studied philosophy."
"Are our arguments later to be abandoned on the basis of the fact that we actually already clone anyway, technically speaking?"
"Does our purpose matter in the end, if the deed is the same?"
"I voted against Amendment No 5 today only because, in my opinion, it would have required justification."
"However, I do not think that there are any grounds for making a distinction from the point of view of technical methods or the foetus."
"For that reason, discrimination such as this cannot be approved without the proper kind of thorough discussion."
". (EL) My group, the European United Left, did not support either of the two motions."
"We disagree with the proposal by the European People' s Party because, behind its total opposition to human cloning, it is merely taking up its familiar stand against abortion."
"On the other hand, we are not covered by the Socialists' position because it does not take a stand against the decision by the British Government, which has paved the way for cloning for medical purposes, thus giving the American administration the green light to take similar action, as demanded by the biotechnological industry."
"We believe that, without wasting any time, what we can do today on such a complicated and difficult issue is to set up a temporary parliamentary committee on bioethics to give us the basis for a substantiated, in-depth discussion of the problem of medical embryonic research resulting from human cloning."
"Therapeutic cloning entails creating an embryo by cloning only to destroy it afterwards, in order to remove cells for medical research purposes and, later perhaps, with a view to curing currently fatal diseases."
"So the intention cannot be said to be a bad one. The method, however, is highly questionable, for at least two reasons."
"First, a life is created (either by using a surplus embryo originally destined to create a new human being, or by using a cloned embryo), and then it is destroyed to save another one."
"Do we have the right to create in this way categories of sub-humans that can be manipulated at will?"
"Quite obviously, I think not."
"Secondly, although everyone agrees that human cloning must be condemned in general, some people are trying to draw a distinction between 'reproductive cloning' (aimed at reproducing a complete human being), which would be banned, and 'therapeutic cloning' , which could be authorised under supervision, subject to certain limits, and provided it is not carried out for commercial purposes."
"But that is an artificial distinction, since it is based on the intention behind the cloning, whereas the act itself is identical in both cases: therapeutic cloning also essentially involves the reproduction of embryos by cloning."
"All cloning is by definition reproductive."
"The cloning of embryos for research purposes, or even the mere use of surplus embryos for these purposes, would amount to crossing an invisible boundary beyond which the exploitation of human life would become acceptable."
"We would be entering a different society, one contrary to our values."
"One solution to this dilemma would be to speed up research into the possibility of obtaining stem cells from adult organs, which could be clearly earmarked for therapeutic purposes, as called for in the resolution tabled by our fellow Members, Elisabeth Montfort and Nicole Thomas-Mauro."
"That kind of procedure would be acceptable, since it is comparable to organ donation."
"Looking ahead, that suggests that perhaps our current questions concern only a transitional stage in the research."
"At any rate, we hope so."
"Unfortunately, the working party, which has dubbed itself a 'Convention' , responsible for preparing the first draft of a Charter of Fundamental Human Rights is about to take a wrong turning here."
"Article 3 of the draft, as it stands, confines itself to prohibiting 'the reproductive cloning of human beings' , i.e. it perpetuates the false distinction that we reject."
"I tabled an amendment on this point, together with a few other Members, but although it was worded in very moderate terms, it has not, to date, been accepted."
"Really, from whatever angle we look at this Charter, it is impossible to find any virtue in it whatsoever."
"Throughout the ages, mankind has had to consider how to guide scientific developments so as to bring them in line with ethical and social choices."
"This issue is all the more sensitive when it concerns human beings and genetic foundations."
"We must, therefore, be extremely cautious, without going so far as to be obscurantist."
"Given the present state of our knowledge and of the ethical debate, and in view of the UK Government' s unacceptable authorisation of human cloning, the first thing we must seek is a total and absolute moratorium on all experiments in human cloning."
"The second, after hearing the opinion of the European Committee on Ethics, is to define clear guidelines that guarantee human dignity."
"As they stand at present, I do not like any of the resolutions submitted by the groups."
"The Socialist Group is not calling strongly enough for an immediate stop to all human cloning."
"The PPE Group seems to be making a final judgment on such sensitive points of discussion as the distinction between reproductive and other cloning."
"In my opinion, however, I think it would be useful to obtain an analysis from the European Committee on Ethics on these points, in order to clarify the issues."
"The urgent nature of the subject should have demanded an effective approach:"
"an immediate and absolute moratorium;"
"in-depth reflection and a very wide-ranging basic debate prior to a directive laying down the rules to be adopted."
"That is not the case with the resolutions put to the vote today."
"I will therefore abstain on these motions for resolution."
"There are some issues on which political differences should be set aside, not to make it appear as though a consensus could be reached but because they face everyone right across the board."
"And if there were to be only one such issue, without doubt it would be the defence and promotion of human life and dignity."
"Over the past few decades, scientific research has made enormous strides and given hope to those suffering from illness or disabilities and to their families."
"Yet at the same time, some of this research and some of the scientists involved in it seem to have lost sight of what I would call a just and sound scale of values."
"It is therefore up to those responsible for the common good, especially in the moral and political field, to put right certain abuses."
"This applies to the British and American decisions to permit, respectively, cloning and the use of what are called unplanned 'supernumerary' embryos, in both cases for therapeutic purposes."
"This raises a great many, closely related, problems."
"There are not two kinds of cloning, reproductive and therapeutic. We must continue to prohibit the creation of human embryos endowed with the same genetic make-up as another human being, for whatever purpose."
"Indeed, no human law that is not criminal can ever deny the fact that the embryo represents the beginning of life."
"So it is unjustifiable to destroy an embryo under any circumstances, even to cure someone who is ill, for how could anyone decently justify destroying one human being in order to cure another?"
"Similarly, and more generally, life is an indivisible whole, it is present from the moment of conception and as such, is no longer subject to any human wishes."
"Does the recognition of life depend on whether it is planned?"
"Certainly, as responsible individuals, the potential parents have to give some thought, before conception, to having a child; but once conceived, that child exists and any manipulation of it, let alone planning its destruction for whatever reason, is an infringement of its fundamental rights and, in the worst case, a crime."
"It was a good thing that our Parliament took a clear stance on these abuses and thus, even if against the wishes of some of its Members, opted for life."
"- (DE) I abstained in the vote on the PPE/Greens/EFA motion for a resolution on human cloning."
"I think it is right to take a stand against the decision taken by the British Parliament."
"It has been stressed that the European Parliament is standing by its decision to ban cloning, and consequently also to withhold all funding for clone research."
"However, I regard paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular as very dangerous, because the medical claims being made for biotechnology are taken at face value here, although the results so far have at best been contradictory."
"By calling for further research into gene therapy and other forms of genetic engineering, the European Parliament is treading on very thin ice, particularly as there is not a word about the risks or about unsuccessful experiments, nor are they subjected to any kind of political assessment, all of which would cast some doubt on the unreservedly positive claims being made."
"This expression of the European Parliament' s views on the cloning of embryos may represent a success in the short term."
"However, I fear that totally uncritical calls for more medical genetic engineering could in the long term completely undermine this success and even reverse the situation completely."
"They could open the door wider for technology whose implications are completely unknown."
"The recent decision by the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to allow the cloning of human embryos, in order to create 'spare part stores' for bones and vital organs, raises huge questions and problems."
"This decision was taken before giving due consideration to numerous crucial medical, moral and social issues."
"No one disputes the fact that rapid developments in genetic and molecular biology have opened up new paths for science, reduced the gulf between the impossible and the feasible and given us hope that we can combat the diseases and illnesses which are the scourge of mankind."
"At the same time, however, and precisely because biomedical science has incalculable potential and a tremendous ability to penetrate every aspect of human life and development, turning dreams to nightmares, both the scientific community and society as a whole at all levels need to address the urgent and vital question of who should have control of this new, highly powerful scientific 'weapon' and why?"
"Where capitalism in its most unadulterated and depressing form and the unbridled market economy rule, there is a fine, indiscernible line between the scientific motives and speculative madness of the multinational pharmaceutical monopolies."
"It is criminal for issues which impinge on human existence itself, on life and death, to be commercialised beyond the bounds of any social or political control."
"The rapid rate of advance in this area, with crucial questions unanswered and matters of capital importance pending, is fraught with danger, given the huge economic interests hiding behind this endeavour."
"The 'therapeutic cloning' plan will be the spark that kindles the fire since no one can guarantee that limited and specific use will be made of cloning."
"The cloning of embryos could become the 'Trojan horse' which rekindles attempts to clone or 'counterfeit' human beings, with unpredictable and possibly dramatic consequences for the human race, and it must be averted."
"The biggest risk is not inherent in the power of science but in the erroneous and uncontrolled exploitation and application of science."
"And when these activities are conducted in the context of the profit motive and its obscure interests, then we must be especially attentive and constantly vigilant."
"Lucas report (A5-0187/2000)"
"Mr President, this is the second time today that we have talked about a report which will help us all to sleep, particularly the elderly."
"How could we not support this report which aims to reduce the noise of aeroplanes which come and go from airports surrounded by the homes of many people, who are certainly disturbed at night but also during the day?"
"However, allow me to put forward a proposal pertaining to this: that, in future, we try to build lots of small airports in isolated, uninhabited areas instead of a few enormous ones in state capitals."
"I welcome the communication from the Commission, which underlines the fact that air transport is rapidly having an increasing impact on the environment at local, regional and global level."
"Clearly we cannot allow this trend to continue and must rapidly adopt measures to reverse it."
"What is at stake, indeed, is the protection of the environment, the quality of life and the health of Europeans."
"We could make serious progress if we implemented the Commission' s proposal to apply the principle of 'reward the best and punish the worst' to air transport in Europe, drawing a clearer line of demarcation between the various activities on the basis of their quality in environmental terms."
"Although the Commission' s communication describes a number of possible instruments, such as economic incentives and more stringent standards, it does not set out any measurable objectives or timetables."
"Nor are there enough practical measures to encourage aviation to pay more respect to the environment."
"So it is essential to set objectives and to respect timetables, so that the aviation industry, the airlines and the users can adapt to the legislative measures in good time."
"That is the exercise on which the European Parliament has embarked."
"Its report tackles several of the problems caused by air transport."
"In particular, it looks at the problem of noise, which is an increasing source of concern to the people of Europe."
"According to a study conducted under the EU' s fifth environmental action programme, 80 million people in Europe are exposed to noise levels that scientists regard as intolerable, while another 170 million are exposed to disturbing noise levels."
"Recent studies also show that there is a link between aircraft noise and sleep disturbance, health and learning ability."
"People who live close to airports are particularly affected by the noise of night flights."
"The ICAO has initiated a process of revising noise levels."
"The European Union must support that process and, if necessary, the Commission will have to take additional measures if the ICAO does not reach a satisfactory agreement."
"There are two ways to reduce aircraft noise: at source, thanks to more stringent certification standards and plans for phasing out aircraft that do not comply with them, and by land-use planning measures near airports."
"Then there is the problem of gas emissions."
"It has been admitted that emissions from aviation account for about 3.5% of the global warming produced by human activity."
"According to forecasts, these emissions will rise by 3% a year over the period 1992 to 2015."
"So it is both urgent and vital to take measures to reduce aircraft emissions."
"The list of pollutants from air transport is a long one."
"This alarming fact should encourage us to take measures very quickly."
"That means the Member States must give the Commission a clear negotiating mandate so that at the time of the 33rd session of the ICAO Assembly in 2001, it can vigorously pursue the environmental and transport policy objectives."
"At a time when France has entered a conflict with the main users of diesel oil (truckers, farmers, ambulance drivers), which risks spreading around Europe with the escalation in fuel prices, at a time when negotiations have begun in Lyon on implementing the Kyoto Protocol, with all its provisions that need to be adopted in The Hague to combat emissions of greenhouse gases, we can see how far we still have to go at all levels to shift away from modes of transport that pollute and damage the environment towards environmentally sustainable ones that make a real contribution to the fight against greenhouse gas emissions."
"In that sense, Mrs Lucas' report sets out the positive measures that will help reduce pollution in air transport including, in particular, the phasing out of the loudest aircraft."
"At the same time, it raises practical and political problems, namely the obstacles of air transport policies and their adverse environmental impact."
"Europe' s measures to reduce greenhouse gases are being blocked by the fact that it has excluded air transport, a major CO2 producer, from the Kyoto Protocol and the plans to reduce pollutants."
"A tax on kerosene, environmental charges, zero VAT rating of air tickets: these are all points that need to be considered in order to establish fair competition between the different modes of transport."
"My group has just voted in favour of the Lucas report, because of the following considerations. A massive warming of the earth's atmosphere in coming years because of emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases was recently forecast, once again by the World Wide Fund For Nature."
"This calls for an immediate response in the form of a rational policy and an economic system that is not solely geared towards short-term profit."
"With an estimated share of 15%, air transport is, of course, not the only cause of air pollution and by no means the most important. However, bearing in mind the forecast doubling of air traffic by 2015 within the EU alone, it is positively essential for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to take joint measures to limit the environmentally harmful impact of air traffic."
"These measures need to cover the whole range of harmful impacts, including emissions, noise, and poor air traffic management and town and country planning, and to take account of the economic interests of airlines in a balanced way."
"We support setting rigid limit values for emissions and noise pollution and the EU initiative being called for at the forthcoming 33rd ICAO Assembly."
"And should the outcome of the ICAO Assembly be unsatisfactory, we are therefore also calling for the EU to set its own limits."
"Measures of this kind can and must encourage the air transport industry to develop new technological solutions, and more efficient, cleaner and quieter jet turbines."
"The twentieth century has witnessed some tremendous technological progress, especially in the field of transport and other long-distance communication."
"This has created two holy cows: the car and the aircraft."
"Those who seek material gain from cars or aircraft are prepared to subordinate everything to their freedom to use these modes of transport, and overlook the adverse effects on their fellow human beings and the environment."
"Aviation and airports have now become a privileged sector."
"They are largely exempt from taxes and environmental rules."
"This is why they can offer their services comparatively cheaply, even if the airfares are high on journeys governed by a near-monopoly."
"For this reason alone, aviation can win the unfair competitive battle against the railways, which have lost a large part of their share of international passenger transport to other modes of long-distance travel, especially aviation."
"As a result, cross-border railways are having to rely increasingly on privatisation plans and major investments in the high-speed network."
"These measures, however, have a number of detrimental effects on the public and the environment, effects which would not have emerged without the competition from aviation."
"It is high time that aviation met normal environmental requirements of the kind that are in place for all other sectors, in order to protect the public and the environment against noise, emission of harmful substances and risks of accidents."
"Should this render aviation companies less profitable or hinder the enormous growth in air transport, this would not be a disaster, but rather a necessity."
"Mrs Lucas has made a few modest steps in the right direction and these are largely in line with what my party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, endorses."
"- (SV) We abstained from voting in the final vote on Mrs Lucas' report."
"We share most of the points of view presented in this about the need for a more vigorous policy to combat the negative effects of aircraft upon the environment. We cannot, however, support paragraphs 20 and 23 of the text."
"These propose a direct right of taxation for the EU in this area, together with the standardisation of national legislation on country planning."
"We are firm opponents of these proposals."
"Immediate, radical measures are urgently needed in order to protect the environment from the adverse impact of the ever increasing use of air transport."
"However, the Commission proposal approaches the problem from the angle of competition and the profits of the aviation industry and the airlines."
"As a result, it fails to deal with immediate priorities and, more importantly, only addresses in vague and general terms the problem of permissible limits on emissions of greenhouse gases and the definition of new, or at least improved, standards and rules which need to be applied at local and regional level and promoted at international level."
"Similarly, it only contains vague, unsatisfactory proposals on reducing permissible noise levels, especially in the vicinity of airports during the day and, more importantly, at night."
"A whole series of basic issues, such as land use around airports, improving air traffic etc. has been ignored, issues which are important factors in dealing with the environmental impact of air transport."
"The Commission proposal is mainly money-driven."
"Instead of forcing aerospace companies to develop research and apply newer, more environmentally-friendly technologies, it backs measures to boost revenue by introducing new taxes on aircraft purchases or changing the VAT arrangements for airline companies or the tax on kerosene, all of which can easily be passed on to the final consumer."
"Attempts to reduce the number and times of flights by increasing the price of tickets, in conjunction with constant efforts to erode labour costs and safety specifications, are merely ways of maintaining, if not increasing the profits of the aviation industry, not measures to reduce the adverse environmental impact of air transport."
"Typically, no mention is made of liberalising the air transport market, which is exacerbating not only the environmental impact, due to restricted controls on old, inadequately maintained aeroplanes, but the very safety of flights and passengers."
"Zabell report (A5-0203/2000)"
"Mr President, this report refers to the fight against doping in sport."
"Unfortunately, the international sporting authorities have not been able to halt or even combat this extremely serious scourge."
"Doping in sport is like a priest who sins or a tone-deaf musician."
"It is unthinkable that in sport, which stands for honesty and competitiveness, there are athletes who win because they use drugs."
"I therefore voted against this report because it does not go far enough in calling for a genuine change in the fight against doping."
"We should set up a European anti-doping agency instead of waiting for a world-wide agency to do what an individual state cannot achieve."
"How can so many countries be persuaded to agree?"
"Mr President, with regard to the Zabell report, I would like to make it clear that I only voted for the amendments which require a legal basis, while I voted against the report as a whole."
"Indeed, current events show that the policy adopted by the World Anti-Doping Agency is a failure, and Europe should not have associated itself with it since it is a policy made by others and for which we should not have to bear any responsibility."
"It is a shame that Europe has not understood this, and that today and over the coming years it will find itself involved in a very tough fight, where it will have to use much more incisive, firm and hard-hitting means."
"I have tried, drawing on my wealth of experience, to make the Members of the European Parliament understand this."
"I am sorry that many of them have not fully grasped what I have been trying to make them understand throughout this part-session."
". (NL) Playing sports is good for us."
"After all, playing is in our make-up and benefits our health and sense of well-being."
"But unfortunately, the enjoyment we derive from sport has come under pressure over the past decades and has been marred by a persistent and one-sided focus on performance and ever greater commercial interests."
"The use of doping in sport must be seen against this background."
"In my opinion, the phenomenon of doping cannot be considered in isolation but forms part of the commercialisation of a leisure activity."
"As a result, the discrepancy between amateur and professional sport has become far too pronounced."
"Sport is high on the agenda in the Commission' s Helsinki report."
"In the resolution too, sport is commended as fulfilling a social and integrating role which brings people closer together."
"It is regrettable that many major sports events show signs of the opposite."
"Not for nothing did the Dutch chef de mission, Andre Bolhuis, nickname the Olympic Games in Atlanta the Olympic War, probably because these games involved thousands of police and because of the hostile atmosphere which the American public and their media created with regard to overseas sportspeople."
"If we are to counter these expressions of hostility, which we also encounter during international sports events in our countries, sportsmanship needs to be placed at the top of the bill once again."
"The focus on performance and commercial interests should disappear very much into the background."
"This would at the same time create a much better climate for fighting the use of doping in the most effective way possible."
"In the area of sport, the Treaty does not accord any direct powers to EU institutions."
"Accordingly, the involvement of the Community in fighting the use of doping should be low-key."
"The sports sector is organised in its own unique way and national federations and unions still play a key role in this."
"Consequently, I do not agree with the request to include a reference to sport in Article 151 of the EU Treaty."
"After all, pressing for a Community-wide sports policy runs counter to the subsidiarity principle."
"Although the resolution we voted on a moment ago does contain positive elements, I cannot support it mainly for the aforementioned institutional reason."
"I am very glad we were able to hold a discussion in this Chamber on the serious public health problem of doping in sport."
"I must congratulate the European Commission on the action plan it has proposed, together with the rapporteur and Mrs Buffet, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Under the terms of the Olympic Charter, sport must embody ""a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play"" ."
"Doping in sport runs totally counter to that ideal."
"Yet doping products are widely used by professional sportsmen and women, but also by amateurs."
"This scourge, whose true scale is difficult to measure, is a complex phenomenon that poses a serious risk to the physical and psychological health of the sportsmen and women."
"It is also a form of cheating that is contrary to the sporting ethic."
"Because of that, we must take stronger European Union action to combat this phenomenon."
"I therefore support the inclusion of a legal basis in the Treaty that would allow for Community action in the field of sport."
"I know that this issue is giving rise to much discussion, which will in fact help fuel the debate to be held in the European Sports Forum in Lille on 26 and 27 October."
"I will, of course, take part in it and give my views."
"Apart from that, I endorse the call for the Commission to step up research into the causes of doping in the various sports disciplines, even though we know that one of the main reasons for the spread of doping lies in the commercial profits that are now linked to sport."
"Under the Fifth Framework Research Programme, the European Union will have to conduct more research on doping substances, on methods of detection and on the health impact of using doping products."
"I think it is also vital to launch information campaigns on the risks associated with doping products."
"These campaigns should be aimed primarily at young people and be conducted with the help of athletes with an established reputation."
"Since doping must be combated at international level, the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is without doubt a vital step forward."
"This agency, set up in 1999, is currently operating under transitional procedures that leave something to be desired in terms of transparency and independence."
"I am glad to say that the French Presidency has undertaken to improve the way it operates."
"Let us restore the true value of sport."
"Above all, sport must be regarded as an educational and social activity that encourages team spirit, solidarity and loyalty and helps combat racism and xenophobia."
"We are voting against recitals I, J and K and are abstaining from voting on paragraph 2."
"In different ways, these three recitals and this paragraph are urging the Commission to integrate sports policy into the texts of the Treaties."
"Sports policy is a policy area characterised by its cultural context and framework and ought not therefore to be covered by the texts of the Treaties."
"Sports policy is an area in which the Commission clearly ought not to have powers."
"In our opinion, such powers are covered by the subsidiarity principle and ought to be exercised at national or lower levels of political decision-making."
"We are abstaining from voting in the final vote."
"Mr President, I voted for the Mennea report on sport because it contains a large number of positive elements and, in particular, because it highlights the importance of continuing the current practice of organising sporting events for disabled people."
"I hope that this report will lead to the introduction of subsidised sporting events for the elderly."
"If competitors were grouped according to age, in the same way that boxers are grouped according to weight, we could organise sporting events for people over 30, 40, 50 or 60 years of age."
"Mr Mennea would certainly win another Olympic medal if we held events on the basis of age."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who voted for my report."
"In my opinion, Europe has today taken a step forward in its approach to the world of sport."
"Our task is still far from complete, for sport is continually changing and Europe cannot afford not to follow these changes."
"I hope that the work which we have begun today, here in the European Parliament, will soon be completed."
"I would like to make it clear that some of the points I had proposed were not approved, such as the status of sportspersons and the sporting contract etc. I hope that Europe will soon become more mature from this point of view and take into consideration those points which were not included."
"Mr President, I voted against Mr Mennea' s report, which is no reflection upon Mr Mennea."
"I remember his time as a great sprinter, and I was delighted that someone from a European country was able to end American dominance of the sport."
"I voted against Mr Mennea' s report because I am quite adamant that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, sport is not a matter for the European Parliament."
"By turning sports issues into political issues, we do a disservice both to sport and to the idea of drawing the peoples of Europe closer together."
"I believe it is downright harmful, as well as wrong, to try to create a legal basis in this area."
"On the basis of the subsidiarity principle and given the sort of society I want to work for, I believe in sport' s own ability to deal with these issues in national and international associations."
"Let us unite behind this idea."
"I also believe that the Bosman judgment has done very great harm to football and that the sporting community has every reason in the future to ask the European Parliament and the European Union to keep away from this area."
"Let these issues be handled at national level and by the sporting community itself."
"At a summit in Davos, Zbigniev Brzezinski, President Carter' s adviser, spoke about the need to use sport, show business and entertainment as a pressure valve for the millions of marginalised people that unrestrained free trade produces every year in a general free market economy."
"A word was even coined for this new version of 'bread and circus' ."
"It is 'tittytainment' , formed from the American slang for breasts and the word entertainment."
"The lesson was learned and the idea of sport as an entertainment, as an industry and as the opium of the impoverished masses of the world, took off."
"There is an endless succession of world cups, European cup finals, Grand Prix competitions, the Olympics of Helsinki and Sydney, football, tennis, races, car rallies and horse races."
"All this is done in the name of the social function of sport, which produces healthy minds in healthy bodies, to the point that the Treaty of Amsterdam now includes a declaration on sport emphasising ""its role in forging identity and bringing people together"" ."
"Indeed, we all know that, thanks to sport and to the Olympic Games, the Peloponnesian War never happened, that Athens and Sparta truly loved one another and that the circus brought the gladiators together. From the evidence of the Heysel stadium, with its death toll, to the British hooligans at the UEFA Cup in Copenhagen and elsewhere, not forgetting the case of Nivel, the French policeman murdered by German supporters, let alone the Turkish 'tourists' , the French PSG and others, it is quite obvious that sport makes people more sociable, tolerant and cooperative and fosters all those other qualities which have been promoted so well by the French suburbs and inner cities, since the World Cup, through the festive bonfires created by setting fire to cars."
"Nor did high-level sport produce dozens of cases of rape and sexual attacks in the Olympic village in Atlanta; and French tennis champion, Nathalie Tauziat, who wrote a book criticising the very emotionally charged atmosphere behind the scenes of the tennis courts, was obviously eliminated from the French team selection in Sydney in the name of the team spirit and significant social values fostered by sport, according to Mr Mennea, the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Once this balm and these nice sentiments have been applied to the galling wounds of real life, our rapporteur becomes well aware that sport is not a cultural phenomenon but a political and strategic instrument used to enslave the citizen, who is made to forget the loss of his civic powers through a form of televisual training developing age-old instincts."
"Share-capital companies, sports-club factories, from Manchester United to AC Milan, not to mention the US basketball and golf circuits, doping, the industry of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, which have left Pankov' s Germany and the Soviet Union to spread throughout the world, Adidas, Nike and other sponsors who want to see results, transfers to the tune of dollars beyond our wildest dreams, the EU Court of Justice' s judgments, including the famous 1995 Bosman judgment that everyone criticised but that ensures the free movement of young sportsmen and women and sports merchandise, the huge commercialisation, the alleged re-broadcasting rights and the collusion between sport and business - that is the real face of the industrialised world of sport that comes under our Community legislation."
"It is from that manipulated world that we must protect real sport, the amateur sport practised in thousands of clubs, which have limited resources and survive thanks only to the devotion, ability and generosity of a huge number of voluntary workers."
"That is where we must put our public funding, instead of investing it for the benefit of the tin gods of world stadiums."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.36 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I wanted to express my concern as some facts are liable to be misinterpreted."
"With regard to the urgent debates, we argued in favour of the inclusion of the Temelín nuclear reactor because this is a topic which is very much in the spotlight at the moment."
"However, I would ask you if we could move on to the debate on Iran as soon as possible."
"This remains necessary due to the relentless violation of human rights - the execution of the death penalty by stoning springs to mind, as well as the constant disruption of international television programmes."
"We voted in favour of Temelín but we believe that a debate on Iran is just as imperative."
"Mrs Maes, Iran is to be covered in the debate on human rights, as is the Temelín nuclear power station."
"I hope that this will meet your concerns."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Nuclear submarine accidents"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5­0704/2000 by Mr Sakellariou and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on nuclear submarines;"
"B5­0707/2000 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Europe of Democracies and Diversities Group, on the sinking of the Kursk submarine and the danger of nuclear pollution in the former Soviet Union;"
"B5­0709/2000 by Mrs Thors and Mr Väyrynen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the sinking of the Kursk submarine and the danger of nuclear pollution in the former Soviet Union;"
"B5­0717/2000 by Mr Posselt and Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on the sinking of the Kursk submarine;"
"B5­0725/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the danger of nuclear submarines;"
"B5­0736/2000 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on accidents involving nuclear submarines;"
"B5­0738/2000 by Mr Sjöstedt and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the sinking of nuclear submarines."
"Mr President, together with those who submitted the joint resolution, I, too, would like to express my deepest sympathy to the relatives of the Kursk nuclear submarine crew who died."
"May they find comfort and strength in God, who can only truly gauge their sorrow and will gladly relieve their suffering."
"The dreadful humanitarian disaster involving the Kursk once again brought home to the Russian population and to us how dangerous the consequences of accidents involving nuclear-powered installations and craft can be, and how important it is to comply with nuclear safety regulations."
"This awareness-raising process has been set in motion, not least thanks to - and I would like to stress this here - those directly involved: Russian citizens and social organisations with a sense of responsibility."
"Their names are no secret."
"Not only do they deserve our respect, but also all the European support we can provide."
"How irresponsible, on the other hand, is the way the Russian authorities, fronted by the country' s military apparatus, deal with atomic energy?"
"And that for as long as we can remember."
"The nuclear contamination of the village Muslyumovo, in the southern Ural, with plutonium - and this is as long ago as 1949 - is a poignant example of this utterly reprehensible behaviour."
"According to a lady in the village, in the old days, mothers would contract leukaemia at the age of fifty."
"The same fate would befall their daughters at the tender age of twenty; nowadays, their grandchildren suffer from this deadly disease as young as two."
"The joint resolution is absolutely right in highlighting the considerable nuclear risks which the dozens of scrapped nuclear submarines of the Russian northern fleet constitute."
"For the city of Murmansk and direct surroundings, I would like to add one major danger to this huge, potential risk to both the public and the environment, namely the cargo ship Lepse."
"Since the early sixties, this ship has served as a warehouse for atomic waste originating from nuclear-powered ice breakers."
"Due to the Lepse' s bad condition, its nuclear cargo should be transferred to and made safe in special containers ashore."
"At least, that has been the plan for years."
"Why has nothing been done about it?"
"The answer is simple."
"It is down to the irresponsible attitude of the authorities, which refuse to meet the financier of the project, i.e. the European Union, halfway on two essential points: signing the agreement whereby Russia shoulders the responsibility for the activities, and the tax-free import of the required equipment for the operation."
"This is a striking example of Russia' s official stance in urgent matters of nuclear safety."
"The nuclear scandal in Moscow, which dates back to 1995, is also salient in this respect."
"At the time, the director of the scientific institute which developed nuclear, Chernobyl-like reactors, came up with an 'enlightened' plan to increase the budget of his institute by providing heating for the houses in the vicinity by means of the institute' s research reactor."
"The neighbourhood was tipped off in time and the whole plan was called off."
"In fact, the reactor was closed down."
"And how did the director Jevgeni Adamov fare?"
"He made it to Russia' s Minister for Atomic Energy and is dreaming of another, far more profitable project, a real money-spinner: Russia as collection and processing point for foreign radioactive waste."
"May this serve as a warning to Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is deeply touched by the recent disaster involving the Kursk submarine and shares in the grief of those left behind and the Russian people."
"In addition, we are greatly concerned about the nuclear time bomb and ecological disaster waiting to happen in the Barents Sea, involving the Kursk, but also other ship wrecks which are still located there."
"It is therefore of utmost importance for Russia to join forces with international organisations for nuclear safety, and I would ask the Commissioner to press Russia to take responsibility and inspect the still active nuclear submarines, adapting them to better safety requirements if necessary."
"There are plenty of international experts who could help Russia take stock of the problems and dismantle the nuclear waste present in the submarines in the Barents Sea."
"Needless to say, Russia must exercise complete openness and cooperate fully."
"Russia is also financially responsible."
"Could the Commission or Commissioner explain to me in what way the European Union can help Russia in the dismantling of shipwrecks and how it can stave off the nuclear radiation risk for our EU citizens?"
"Mr President, our prayers and sympathy go to the 118 sailors and their families."
"They deserve our solidarity."
"But it must also be considered that we have a major concern in connection with the Kursk disaster, namely the situation in Russia."
"We need to be quite clear that President Putin and the Russian authorities covered up a lot of the circumstances surrounding this accident."
"Facts were suppressed, falsified or hushed up."
"But in one interview he spoke the truth when he said that the Kursk accident was symptomatic of Russia's condition as a whole."
"This is a situation that we finally have to face up to."
"We have to see the reality for what it is."
"This is not just about nuclear safety and the nuclear submarine fleet, it is also about a mass of highly developed arms technologies for which there are no appropriate control and safety measures."
"That is why it is of the utmost importance that we should do everything to ensure transparency finally reaches Russia."
"It is only because of Mr Nikitin, and the independent media, which face increased repression, that we heard about the disaster at all, four days after the event.Thanks to international support, it was at least possible to avoid the very worst and I hope that it will also be possible to find a solution."
"But that is not a satisfactory state of affairs."
"That is why they need not only our help, but also frank talking."
"What is called for is some plain speaking and an offer of cooperation that does not just mean reaching for our cheque book, but also includes developing the rule of law, democratic processes and independent media in Russia."
"The most important point is to educate and support all democratic forces, all the independent media, the administration, the judiciary, and young politicians, especially those in local government, so that Russia becomes a partner with whom we can safely live together in Eurasia."
"I do not want to go into other issues such as Chechnya and a host of others at this point."
"Kursk by itself is symptomatic of how disasters in Russia can have a direct environmental and political impact on our part of Europe."
"That is why it is very much in our interest to make sure that Russia gradually becomes a democratic state where the rule of law prevails."
"What we are witnessing at present under President Putin is instead a retrograde trend which is a matter of great concern to us."
"So we have an enormous responsibility here."
"Mr President, as other Members have already said, the Kursk accident demonstrates that even ten years after the end of the Cold War, military objectives are still considered more important than human life."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy for the families who have been bereaved of their fathers and sons."
"We know that it is not impossible that more people will yet be affected by this accident."
"Everyone is aware of the dangers posed by two nuclear reactors lying on the sea bed."
"However, no one knows how great the danger and the insidious impact on people's health will be."
"I therefore believe that we can only draw one conclusion from this accident: we have to finally admit that despite the end of the Cold War we - in both the East and the West - are still arming and rearming ourselves, and this is incredibly dangerous and will lead to people being killed."
"So we must finally put an end to this."
"There can only be one response to this accident, and that response is 'disarmament now' ."
"This disarmament will only work if it is applied equally by the East and the West."
"That also means that it has to be pursued jointly, in cooperation. It must not mean that people like Alexander Nikitin, who take part in this and thus help to fight the continuing dangers to humanity of the Cold War and of armament, are eliminated."
"I call on the Commission to make it crystal clear to the Russian Government that we will not accept further legal judgments against Nikitin or tolerate his being put on trial again."
"Mr President, our Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left entirely shares all the considerations and proposals regarding nuclear submarine accidents, which are a sad legacy from the Cold War."
"In order to show that it is not all one-sided, I am bound to refer to the situation of the British submarine which broke down on 12 May in Sicily and has been in Gibraltar, the only British colony in the Mediterranean, since 19 May."
"The situation is causing a great deal of alarm among the population, because, according to the Royal Navy' s own regulations, within a radius of 10 kilometres there is danger, within 100 kilometres there is still potential danger, and the submarine may only be repaired in category 'X' docks."
"The docks in Gibraltar are type 'Z' ."
"I find the neo-colonial behaviour on the part of the United Kingdom, which solved the problem by replacing a 'Z' with an 'X' on a piece of paper using correction fluid or an eraser, very strange."
"I think that it is important that the Commission and the Council demand that this submarine goes back to the United Kingdom and that they ensure that safety standards are complied with."
"Mr President, the sinking of the Kursk has - mainly as a result of Russia' s inadequate response - brought home to us the disastrous heritage of 70 years of Soviet power."
"The golden era of Communist nomenclature has generated a climate of such contempt towards people in the old Soviet Union, with so few standing a chance of survival in the present day, that this is why we are now facing this terrible disaster."
"This is at the heart of our resolution."
"In my opinion, the fact that the GUE Group is now tabling amendments which attempt to divert the attention away from this disaster by introducing a regional problem of a completely different nature displays very little taste indeed. It is, in fact, downright impudent."
"The European Union and European Parliament will need to put their foot down when it comes to the Kursk salvage operation."
"We will need to be involved in these operations, partly on humanitarian grounds."
"The recovery of the Kursk also highlights another problem, namely that of a large number of obsolete nuclear submarines in Russia, as well as the nuclear waste in the same northern region."
"The European Union and European Parliament will need to make it clear that it is in Europe' s general interest, and as such in that of Russia, to lay this matter to rest sooner rather than later, firstly on behalf of the relatives, whom we offer our deepest sympathy, and secondly for the benefit of the nuclear situation in Europe."
"This is what our resolution is about."
"Mr President, we are talking about the tragedy involving the Russian submarine Kursk and we do of course share all the considerations of this joint resolution on the subject."
"However, we must add immediately that, in order to gain credibility, the European Parliament and the European Union in general cannot ignore the fact that within its own territory there is a situation of serious nuclear risk as the result of a submarine accident, even though it is not, of course, of the tragic nature of the case of the Kursk."
"I am referring to the case mentioned previously by my colleague Mr Marset, the British submarine Tireless, which has been anchored in the port of Gibraltar since May, where the intention is to repair it."
"It is a port which, has been pointed out, does not have the technical conditions or the location for repairing this type of vessel."
"The port is only equipped for repairing merchant ships, not warships and much less nuclear submarines."
"The problem cannot be solved by simply reclassifying it, because that reclassification could affect the technical conditions."
"But the problem is that the safety standards include emergency plans and special action for the population within a radius of ten kilometres, which in this case means around 200 000 people."
"That is something that cannot be improvised overnight, among other things because the population cannot be moved."
"We must criticise the deplorable attitude of the British Government, but even more so the attitude of the Spanish Government, which maintained a deplorable and shameful silence on this issue until they were forced into a timid reaction by the protests from the inhabitants of the area."
"I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that I am not in the habit of raising issues of domestic policy in this Parliament."
"But this is not a matter of domestic policy, but one of European security, it is a matter of European decency and I am raising it here in order to provoke a reaction from this Parliament and from the authorities of the Union in general in order to remedy this intolerable situation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and along with my colleague Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, we join others in offering our condolences to the victims of the Russian nuclear submarine, and in asking for greater cooperation between the European Union and the Russian authorities in order to prevent a further disaster."
"Obviously, we believe that the European Union has sufficient arguments to ensure such cooperation."
"We would also like to express our concern - as other speakers have done - because, unfortunately, the matter that we were to discuss, that of the very serious, terrible and fatal accident of the submarine Kursk has led us to deal with the problem of a nuclear submarine in Mediterranean waters, in European Union territory, in a British colony."
"This is causing very serious and justified alarm, due to a serious breakdown in the nuclear reactor, and because, among other things, European Union directives are not being complied with."
"We think that there is a need to take urgent action."
"The European Union must intervene, and this nuclear submarine needs to be urgently transported to a British base to be repaired under the proper conditions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said, a British nuclear submarine has been moored at its Gibraltar base since 19 May."
"The smallest breakdown in the cooling system of a nuclear reactor can never be considered as insignificant, as it contains heavy water with radioactive isotopes."
"Moreover, the United Kingdom has knowingly failed to comply with Community regulations in terms of radiation protection, exposing its citizens in Gibraltar and those in Algeciras Bay to a very high probability of contamination, as it is now, and not last May, that it is recognising the extent of the breakdown."
"In this case, there has been a violation of Community law."
"We complained that Russia took four days to inform the European Community about its accident."
"We took two months."
"I suppose that the booing that we received from some British Members when we criticised the situation in this House was also directed at the citizens of Gibraltar."
"In this House we criticised the lack of information for the population in the area and of reliable and official news from the United Kingdom."
"In the same way, we criticise something which is a reality: the United Kingdom, faced with considerable social pressures in the country, has decided to transfer its base for nuclear submarine operations and repairs to Algeciras Bay, without respecting its own standards, which do not allow it to have this type of base in highly populated areas."
"Equally, we deplore the contemplative attitude of the Spanish Government, which only reacted when the pressure and concern reached a maximum."
"For the above reasons, those of us from Andalusia ask this Parliament, and its President, far beyond the bilateral diplomatic interests of the Member States, to carry out the appropriate consultations and negotiations to make it possible to immediately transfer this submarine to bases that have sufficient security conditions to repair it and thus to put an end to the public alarm that has been created."
"The Commission shares the deep regrets expressed in the resolutions on the accident involving the Russian submarine the Kursk in the Arctic Bering Sea on 12 August and the loss of the lives of 118 seamen."
"We were particularly concerned about the policy of the Russian authorities in the first days after the accident on foreign assistance and information provided to the Russian population and the wider public."
"Russia is ultimately responsible for devising and implementing a plan to manage its nuclear waste and spent fuel, and the resolutions, therefore, quite rightly call upon Russia to use all available resources, including its own specialists."
"The Commission considers that the international community should offer the necessary assistance to Russia."
"It has already launched a number of assistance projects under various Community programmes."
"Improved radioactive waste management in north-west Russia is one of the explicit priorities included in the new TACIS regulation covering the next seven years."
"The Commission welcomes any action that would increase the budget funding to be used to reduce the ideological threat in north-west Russia and in particular to enable laid-up nuclear submarines to be dismantled more quickly than 10 of the North Fleet's 100 disused nuclear submarines moored at various based in north-west Russia have been dismantled so far."
"Besides the submarines, spent fuel from a number of nuclear-powered icebreakers also adds to the ecological risk."
"The lack of storage capacity for spent nuclear fuel remains one of the major bottlenecks in dismantling operations as a whole."
"Community-backed activities are studies to design and cost a storage facility in north-west Russia or in the southern Urals."
"In the light of these studies, the international community, perhaps including the European Community, might later finance the construction of such a storage facility."
"To speed up dismantling, the Community is supporting the design, construction, and licensing of a transport and storage tank for damaged spent fuel produced in the operation of nuclear submarines and icebreakers and currently stored under primitive conditions."
"The Commission is also involved in a number of studies aiming to improve radioactive-waste management in north-west Russia."
"Before concluding, I would like to stress the importance of international coordination in this immense task."
"To give two examples, the Commission is serving in the IAEA-sponsored contact expert group."
"The group's work might eventually make it possible to draw up a comprehensive strategy and key investment projects that should be supported by the international community and, together with a number of donor countries, the Commission is currently negotiating an agreement with the Russians."
"This agreement, known as the 'Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme', is intended to overcome obstacles to international aid stemming, for instance, from tax exemptions and nuclear liability."
"The Commission hopes that the Kursk accident will bring about real progress in these negotiations and, in particular, strengthen the resolve of the Russian authorities to conclude the agreement."
"Mr President, I would like to know whether the Commissioner has anything to say on the issue, which also relates to nuclear submarines, of the Tireless in Gibraltar."
"It has been raised by five Members in this House and he has not said anything about it."
"I am concerned: is it that he is deaf?"
"Is it that he does not know what to do?"
"Mr President, we are talking about nuclear safety, and I repeat what was said by my colleague, Mr Marset Campos: we hope that the Commissioner will say something about our problem, a problem in the European Union that is affecting citizens from two Member States."
". I took the liberty, on behalf of the Commission, of responding to the issue that we have on the agenda."
"I find that quite natural."
"Discussion of other subjects would have to be covered by other means and under a different agenda item."
"I will be suggesting to my colleagues that we answer your questions in writing."
"Mr President, the subject for today is 'Nuclear submarine accidents' ."
"The Conference of Presidents decided to also include the subject of the submarine in Gibraltar in the agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 5.30 p.m."
"Burundi"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5­0660/2000 by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Burundi;"
"B5­0711/2000 by Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the agreement on peace in Burundi signed in Arusha, Tanzania;"
"B5­0718/2000 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on the situation in Burundi;"
"B5­0726/2000 by Mrs Maes and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Burundi;"
"B5­0734/2000 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on Burundi;"
"B5­0739/2000 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the Arusha agreement and the transition to democracy in Burundi."
"Mr President, why do so many Africans struggle when it comes to sharing power?"
"If the principle 'the survival of the fittest' applies, leaving the weakest with nothing, then there is something fundamentally wrong."
"If, on top of this, the fittest constitute the minority, then conflicts are bound to ensue."
"As long as ethnic groups exclude each other and refuse to cooperate, there is precious little hope."
"Only national reconciliation can offer some hope and this is certainly true of Burundi."
"Following Mandela' s remarkable efforts, peace seemed to be on its way at last."
"Unfortunately, the fighting has not stopped and some parties have refused to sign the peace accord."
"Every effort must be made in order to ensure that the new negotiations are a success."
"Maximum pressure must be brought to bear on Hutu rebels to take part in the peace process instead of following the destructive instructions issued by the likes of Mr Kaliba and Mr Mugabe."
"In order to ensure that all parties are involved, it is of utmost importance for the political leaders to receive personal protection, and it is high time that the violence against innocent citizens, both on the part of the government and of the opposition, came to an end."
"If the fight continues, human rights continue to be violated and parties fail to get involved, there can be no talk of fully resuming European aid."
"Greater willingness on their part to make peace will lead to greater willingness on our part to help."
"The mediators must bring about initiatives to demobilise the parties so that they can ultimately unite in one army."
"As soon as the cease-fire is achieved, the Burundi refugees must be able to count on help from the international community to provide them with a safe shelter in Burundi."
"On a final note, for lasting peace in Burundi, it is crucial that peace in the Congo region is established."
"Only if Africans are willing to share power does this continent have a future."
"Mr President, if we start from the principle 'better a deal that is flawed than no deal at all' , then it is true that Arusha constitutes a step forward in the Burundi peace process."
"All credit for this has to go to Mandela, who shuttled between the different parties for months in order to get them not only on speaking terms but also around the negotiating table."
"But the accord is not perfect."
"Indeed, there is still no cease-fire and the fights around the capital of Bujumbura simply continue."
"The two main Hutu rebel movements in the army, which are responsible for the best part of the violence, were not involved in the negotiations."
"As such, the next phase in Nairobi, the meeting between the armed troops on 20 September, is probably more crucial than Arusha."
"It is regrettable that the accord does not look beyond the regional context."
"The neighbouring countries Congo and Tanzania, from where the armed groups operate, must also be reminded of their responsibilities."
"Indeed, the question arises as to whether Mandela has not analysed the Burundi conflict too much from his own South African context."
"It is correct that some Tutsi parties have used the risk of annihilation of the minority as an excuse to maintain their supremacy."
"But this does not take away the fact that this risk in Burundi is real."
"This is why we need to demand sufficient safety guarantees to protect the minority and make sure that in the event of any elections, there is no incitement of ethnic hatred."
"Finally, Mr President, I do believe that Europe should resume the provision of semi-structural aid, especially in the areas of education and health care."
"Otherwise, there is a risk that we will be held partly responsible for the death of thousands of innocent citizens; a thought to which I, as a Christian-Democrat, cannot reconcile myself."
"Mr President, I fully subscribe to the entreaties of Mr Van den Bos and Mr Van Hecke."
"With 200 000 fatalities in Burundi, Commissioner, there is clearly a need for a peace deal or a peace accord."
"However, I fear that the peace accord has been brought about because it suited the Heads of State at the time."
"Maybe they should have dragged the negotiations out a while longer in order to gather everybody around the table, because I am aware that as long as the key players, both on the Hutu side and Tutsi side, do not meet, there will be no real peace."
"I do welcome the fact that some movements, which were at one time some of the most implacable, have now gathered around the table."
"This is why I have good reason to believe this peace accord sets the tone for the future."
"I now wonder how the European Union can best fulfil the desire for peace expressed by so many people in Burundi."
"To start with, I believe we will need to step up the pressure in order to achieve overall peace in the Great Lakes region."
"I cannot shake off the impression that various African leaders are still too self-seeking to be able to work steadily towards peace in Congo and the Great Lakes region."
"A second point is the contentious resumption of aid."
"I have always regretted the notorious boycott of Burundi, particularly as it was so selective."
"I now hope that we can make some real headway by means of clearly-defined peace projects and development of democracy, which we can underpin with structural aid."
"Mr President, as a militant supporter of the Lutte ouvrière party in a country that played and still plays a shameful role in Burundi and in Rwanda, as it does in the whole region of central Africa, I cannot remain silent in the face of a resolution that strings together phrases supposedly in support of the people of that region while, in fact, concealing the despicable role the major powers played in the massacres carried out by the armed bands of the two conflicting ethnic groups in that region, the Tutsis and the Hutus."
"Without even going back to the responsibility of the former Belgian colonial power deliberately sustaining and exacerbating the hostilities between the two ethnic groups in the two countries, today the part that both French and British interests played in the civil war is public knowledge, just as it is public knowledge that the French army was directly responsible for mobilising and arming the Hutu extreme right, which was responsible for real genocide."
"And successive French Governments, on the right as well as on the left, were not even willing to do what the Belgian Government did, namely acknowledge their responsibility for this situation, although obviously that in no way lessens the crushing weight of that responsibility."
"I therefore want to register my opposition to the hypocrisy of the major powers and express my solidarity with the people of Burundi and Rwanda who, over and above their ethnic rifts, over and above the responsibility of their own leaders, have paid a heavy price for the large imperialist powers' domination of Africa."
"Mr President, over one hundred years ago, European colonial powers divided tribal lands in Africa to establish national boundaries."
"African countries inherited the legacy of tribal conflict as major tribes sought to dominate national politics."
"Some examples are the Afars and Issas in Djibouti, the Kikuyu and Luo in Kenya and the Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi."
"I believe the EU has to focus on how the ruling elite, the Tutsis in Burundi, can be persuaded to reconcile and cooperate with the majority Hutu to achieve peace."
"The EU must insist that neighbouring countries do not interfere in Burundi and EU aid to them should be conditional on their cooperation."
"This Parliament and the European Commission can help Burundi and this resolution is a very good step in that direction."
"Mr President, I am very happy to be speaking at the request and on behalf of Mrs Sauquillo. We would first of all like to thank Nelson Mandela, who once again truly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize which has been awarded him."
"I would like to stress that the Arusha Agreement does not represent the end of the war, for peace has not yet been established, but the agreement does exist and requires an immediate initiative from the European Union."
"The initiative must include the following elements: we must send a message to those who have signed the agreement to urge them to persist and keep going along the road they have chosen; we must send a message to those who have not yet signed the agreement to remind them that there is no alternative to peace, that the only alternative to peace is to continue with the suffering caused by colonial inheritance, death and oppression; we must also send a message to the neighbouring countries to request that they refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of other countries and must contribute to and uphold the peace process."
"The European Union's initiative must include financial assistance, for genuine, stable peace processes need assistance if they are to evolve into stable democracies."
"After last minute amendments and a nine-hour delay, the majority of the parties involved in the two years of talks signed a scaled-down peace agreement in Arusha on 28 August."
"The Commission welcomes the signature of the peace accord as an important preliminary step in the long and difficult process of negotiations to end the conflict between Burundi's majority Hutu and minority Tutsi population."
"However, as has been said in this discussion, some very important questions are still open, such as that of the cease-fire, which is the main gap in the agreement, the amnesty, the composition of the national assembly, the duration of the agreement and the transitory government leadership - no minor issues."
"In spite of the number and the importance of these questions, the signature does represent an important event which puts an end to the Arusha process but not to the negotiations as such."
"These will continue, mainly in Bujumbura, hopefully ensuring a higher ownership of the process by the Burundians themselves."
"This has been a problem in the long process on many occasions."
"The refusal to sign the agreement by the extremist parties is of concern to the Commission and every effort should be pursued to urge them to do so."
"Two Tutsi parties added their signature to the agreement on the following day."
"Cease-fire talks are organised for 20 September in Nairobi."
"The regional presidents Moi and Thabo Mbeki stress their importance."
"Successful conclusion is seen as a prerequisite for the start of the implementation of the peace agreement, deployment of UN peacekeepers and full restoration of development cooperation."
"The European Community, at this stage, is ready at the technical level to gradually resume a full-scale cooperation programme in coordination with other donors."
"Beyond a EUR 48 million rehabilitation programme whose implementation has started, the EC is finalising the procedures for the release of EUR 50 million STABEX funds to relaunch the rural economy."
"A strategy paper is being prepared by the Commission to support the peace agreement implementation concentrating on demobilisation, social and economic reconstruction of Burundi and state reform."
"Finally, the Commission is going to hold an informal donor meeting at technical level in Brussels on 15 September."
"Its purpose is to report on the programme implementation, to improve coordination between donors, to prepare a common strategy to contribute to the peace agreement implementation and to prepare a high level round table of parties and donors which should take place in Paris this autumn."
"We are organised to step up the actual cooperation."
"I can tell Parliament that we see this as a good case to try and demonstrate how to better manage the transition from the phase of humanitarian assistance to the building up and gradual introduction of forward-oriented long-term development cooperation."
"We are giving all the signals we can to organisations like the UNHCR, and also to other donors, to try and get well organised, as you can hear from what I have said."
"Coordination is extremely important because we are still in a situation where the right balance and the right kind of signals to the parties in the process in Burundi are as important as the euros we are mobilising."
"This is a very focused effort, trying to do things right."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 5.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"Mr President, the resolution that we have before us today is not intended in any way to criticise the key actors namely the Bhutanese or Nepalese Governments in the process of finding a solution for the 96 000 Nepalese speaking Bhutanese refugees living in the camps."
"There have been 17 000 children born in those camps over the last ten years."
"This resolution seeks to encourage initiatives and action and ask the Commission to help perhaps with financial mechanisms to support the re-settlement of these people."
"We welcome the fact that Japan has donated USD 1.3 million to the refugees, and that USD 1 million has been forthcoming from world food programmes."
"But the people in those camps would prefer to be re-settled back in their homelands and not have that money."
"They sent us this memorandum asking our support for action to solve their problem and to have justice."
"In it they say ""we pray at your end, honourable European Parliamentarians, that justice may prevail on us""."
"That is what we are doing here today."
"Let us hope that our resolution will bring some justice to these people, will help them re-settle in their homelands and achieve some results."
"Mr President, earlier this year, I had the honour to be part of a delegation from the European Parliament to New Delhi and Nepal."
"Arising from our visit and in particular our visit to the refugee camps in eastern Nepal, the delegation gave a commitment that they would do everything possible to raise the issue of the continuing plight of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal."
"I would like to assure the Members of the House that the refugees are fully aware of, and greatly value and appreciate, the earlier efforts of the European Parliament in drawing attention to their situation."
"This was clearly demonstrated to us during our visit to the region, and our resolve to continue to encourage an agreement now between Bhutan and Nepal is as strong as ever."
"The influx of Bhutanese refugees into Nepal began in late 1991 and the fear of diminishing international attention, therefore, is always present."
"The refugees have been waiting for the last ten years for an amicable and permanent solution to the crisis."
"As Ms McCarthy has said - very many of them want to go home."
"There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured."
"In New York, the United Nations Millennium Summit is taking place as we speak and it offers the Prime Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal an opportunity to come together and to demonstrate their commitment to the ideas of peace and tolerance by agreeing to an early solution to the problem of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal."
"This would be a fitting way to mark the UN's Millennium Summit."
"I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so."
"One of the crucial issues to be decided is the definition of the family unit for verification purposes."
"Nepal has accepted a compromise put forward by the UNHCR who has been playing an important role in seeking to help to resolve the impasse."
"I strongly urge the Bhutanese authorities to accept the compromise so that field verification can begin immediately."
"While the European Union remains one of the major donors, both the UNHCR and the World Food Programme are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds to run the refugee camps."
"I would urge international donors to continue to make sufficient funds available to permit the running of the camps during the negotiation and the verification process."
"At the same time, I would expect the donors to insist that the Bhutanese Government facilitate a rapid repatriation of the refugees."
"I very much welcome the news conveyed to the House by Ms McCarthy of the generosity of the Japanese people in this particular respect."
"We were assured that bilateral negotiations would be speedily concluded and that actual verification in the camps would begin last July."
"That agreement regrettably is still outstanding."
"I therefore reiterate once more our appeal to all those concerned to take the necessary political initiatives to achieve a lasting solution to the unacceptable plight of the Bhutanese refugees, of whom over 17 000 have been born in the camps."
"Mr President, I think first we must thank the chairman of our delegation for relations with South-East Asia, Mr Gerard Collins, who has just spoken and to whom we owe this resolution, for the efforts he has made over the past months to try to resolve an issue which is not really that marginal, since it concerns tens of thousands of people who are now destitute, and have often been so for years."
"I also want to say that Mr Collins had the support of the entire delegation, Mrs McCarthy, Mr Thomas Mann and all the other members, and I hope the Commission will follow up Parliament' s unanimous position and that we will see rapid results."
"I think the ball is in Bhutan' s court, but it is now up to the Commission and the Council to put pressure on the Bhutanese Government."
"Aside from this question, I want to draw attention to a matter that concerns us all and concerns our future."
"Yesterday we voted for the Galeote Quecedo report on a common Community diplomacy, which in the end was reduced to a report on a future college of common diplomacy."
"That is not much."
"It is not much when we know that there is no Commission delegation in Bhutan, when we know that there is no Commission delegation in Nepal, but when we also know that no Member State has an embassy in Bhutan."
"That certainly does not make for increased contact, nor does it make it easier to take diplomatic action to help solve this particular problem and other more general ones."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is the report you adopted."
"It does not mean the communitisation, even in part, of our common foreign and security policy."
"Is it really that inconceivable that in a country such as Bhutan, where we have no embassy, we could have a Commission delegation that also acted as an embassy for the 15 Member States?"
"Is that really impossible?"
"Is it beyond your powers of imagination?"
"That is the question I wanted to ask you."
"Mr President, we in the European Parliament's SAARC delegation had an opportunity in April to see for ourselves the conditions in which tens of thousands of refugees have been living for years in the camps in eastern Nepal."
"The assistance from the European Union and the international organisations is quite respectable, but no one can guarantee long-term financial aid at that level."
"It is high time that substantial agreements were reached."
"Bhutan and Nepal are not neighbours, but they are close to each other in spirit."
"Both are kingdoms, both have parliamentary systems with short histories, one is Buddhist and the other is Hindu."
"Both are aware that lasting conflict will paralyse their national and economic progress."
"Bhutan criticises Nepal on the grounds that its constant changes of government make it incapable of action."
"That has changed."
"Nepal accuses Bhutan of not being ready to adopt effective solutions."
"I hope that will change."
"The undertakings given by the Bhutanese Foreign Minister when he visited us in Brussels on 8 June have been honoured, as crucial negotiations began mid-year."
"There is agreement on the four categories of people living in the refugee camps."
"However, there has to be a common definition of the term 'family' for the purposes of the compromise put forward by the UNHCR, which Mr Collins has referred to."
"Nepal has already agreed."
"We are also appealing to India to stop primly holding back."
"It is linked with both neighbours through agreements and economic ties."
"There are 6 million Nepalese working in India."
"The borders are open, and there are no asylum problems."
"I am very familiar with the charter stipulating that bilateral conflicts should not be resolved at SAARC level."
"Nevertheless, the largest democracy in the world does have the greatest influence in the region and bears some humanitarian responsibility here."
"Some movement is discernible."
"The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is putting its faith in far-sighted people of good will in Thimphu, in Kathmandu, and also in Delhi."
"We are hoping that the talks in New York between the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Prime Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal will lead to a decisive breakthrough."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can only lend its firm support to this resolution which, as the Members who have direct experience of this tragic situation have said, shows our institution's concern for a region which may well be far away but whose human tragedies cut us to the very heart."
"As previous speakers have pointed out, a great deal has already been achieved and more will be achieved in the future, and it is our hope that the outcome of the forthcoming talks will be positive."
"For my part, I join with Mr Dupuis in calling upon the Commission and the European Union as a whole to make diplomatic advances towards the countries which are most affected by this crisis."
"All that remains is for me to state that we too will follow future developments in the situation closely."
"Burma"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced, once again, with an exemplary case."
"The text on Burma, unfortunately the umpteenth one, is very good."
"The situation in Burma is crystal clear; there is a perfect dictatorship on the one side and an exemplary opposition on the other. There has, in fact, been no sign of progress in this country for ten years."
"That is the situation."
"So I think we should ask ourselves a few questions."
"Our policy towards Asia is a criminal policy; it is quite literally criminal."
"We treat regimes such as India, which continue to consolidate and strengthen democracy, however difficult that may be, on the same footing as other countries like China, Burma and North Korea, which, you could say, do all they can to strengthen dictatorship."
"So, I think we should consider drawing up lists, defining categories and establishing different types of relations depending on the type of country. Unfortunately that is not the case."
"The European Parliament has been calling for this for a long time and we must continue to urge it."
"We cannot continue to dialogue with organisations such as ASEAN and pretend that we regard them as a homogenous whole."
"ASEAN is simply a grouping of totally different countries, with widely diverging interests and no prospect of integration."
"We must encourage forms of integration based on democracy - which is absolutely not the case with this kind of country - and therefore promote and encourage our bilateral relations with the countries that respect democracy and want to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and pursue an extremely tough policy towards countries like Burma."
"Let me finish by saying that Burma is a country now occupied by the People' s Republic of China."
"We are informed by many sources that there are dozens of Chinese military bases in Burma."
"The People' s Republic of China is currently encircling India: that is a real fact, an actual fact."
"You are aware of the situation in Pakistan."
"The People' s Republic of China' s strategic aid to the rearmament and strengthening of Pakistan' s nuclear weapons is a form of encirclement and if, in the course of the twentieth century, the major world problem was the German problem, the Franco-German problem, today and tomorrow too it will be an Indo-Chinese problem; and if we do not, as of now, support the countries that are moving towards democracy, towards strengthening democracy, such as India, but instead continue to roll out the red carpet for the Beijing authorities, we will simply be encouraging a grouping that will eventually become explosive."
"The explosion will hit not just Asia, but in the end will also affect Europe and the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret having to speak once again to defend the cause of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"This is not only the defence of a person who suffers for having fought for democracy and freedom, but also of what she represents in a whole population' s fight to achieve those things."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi deserved the recognition of the international community by being awarded the Nobel Prize, the Sajarov Prize from this Parliament and the Prize for Freedom from Liberal International."
"Now she is being denied the most basic freedoms, along with those who follow her in the difficult process against dictatorship, to which Mr Dupuis has already referred."
"All these people are in an unacceptable situation."
"Therefore, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the proposals of the corresponding resolution and, in particular, I would like to draw attention to paragraph 8, which asks that both the United States and the Commission and the Council impose the appropriate political and economic sanctions as long as there is no process of democratisation in Burma."
"Mr President, we are once again debating the difficult situation in which Burma' s elected President finds herself, as well as the aggression displayed by that country' s military regime."
"I believe that over the past two years, we have submitted as many as five or six resolutions on the situation in Burma."
"It is almost intolerable that a President, elected more than ten years ago with 80% of the votes behind her, who offers peaceful protest against her country' s military regime, should receive insufficient support to truly adopt the role which she deserves in her country, in order to fight a military regime which rides roughshod over human rights and the rights of minorities. This is despite the fact that she receives verbal support - by Mr Clinton only a few days ago -and the fact that she has received both the Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize for her peaceful protest."
"The national economy stays afloat thanks to drugs."
"Burma, the world' s second-largest drug-producing country, after Colombia, has dismantled its own parliament, has had numerous parliamentarians killed and imprisoned in the process, and forces its minorities into slave labour, especially in the construction of infrastructure. However, it still benefits from investments, including investments from European countries, such as those of the French oil company Total and the Dutch hydraulics industry, and there has been no attempt to block this kind of investment, either on the part of the EU or on the part of national Member States."
"I am not actually in favour of economic sanctions, but in some cases - I am thinking of South Africa and Chile in the eighties - it is necessary to stop cruelty in its tracks."
"In my opinion, the European Union and the United States should agree on a strategy against Burma."
"I believe that Burma should be isolated politically and economically and that real, effective pressure must be exercised; if not, we sanction violent opposition."
"People elsewhere have commented: look at Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"She has now been in peaceful protest for twelve years and still she is being sidelined and placed under house arrest, and her people are being arrested."
"And what happens?"
"The international community looks on and does nothing."
"I would ask the European Union to enter into talks with the United States in order come up with concrete ways of helping her, and in order to ensure that she and Burma' s parliament can re-establish democracy in Burma."
"Mr President, I should like to support what the other speakers have said."
"It is ten years since the NLD won a huge majority of seats in free and fair elections, but despite that, democracy has been suppressed from every angle and at every opportunity."
"I believe that the recent readmittance of Burma to the Asean and EU-Asean meetings was a major mistake from the start."
"Burma has done nothing since being readmitted to Asean to show that it deserves it."
"There should be a serious rethink of this policy."
"Burma should be excluded."
"I also believe that the European Union could do a lot more."
"Aung San Suu Kyi has asked for sanctions but we have done absolutely nothing about this."
"Even the United States has at least halted new investment."
"Why is the European Union not ensuring that sanctions are imposed?"
"We have to do everything we can to try and stop the forced labour and the human rights abuses."
"As the resolution says, we should discourage any kind of tourism to Burma."
"That should be supported."
"Mr President, I agree with many of the comments that have been made so far by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Maij-Weggen on the situation in Burma."
"However I would also like to refer to the specific case of a constituent of mine, which provides a good example of the brutality of the present Burmese authorities."
"In September 1999, James Mawdsley, from the north-east of England was sentenced to 17 years' solitary confinement in a Burmese prison."
"His mother is currently travelling to Burma hoping to see him."
"His crime, according to the Burmese authorities, was to enter the country and attempt to draw attention to the human rights abuses taking place there."
"The charges against him were trumped up."
"For example, he was alleged to have entered the country illegally and yet British embassy staff have seen his passport, which is stamped with a Burmese immigration stamp showing that he had arrived completely legally."
"British Government ministers and staff have been making constant efforts to draw the attention of the Burmese authorities to his plight, but with no success."
"I ask Parliament and the Commission to do all they possibly can to secure his release."
"Mr President, I would like to make it clear that the fact that Iran has been replaced by Burma in the debate on human rights does not mean that my group is not deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran."
"We will continue to concern ourselves with that situation."
"However, the current situation and the scandalous decisions being taken by the Burmese military Government and their appalling behaviour simply make it essential for the European Parliament to take a stand on this."
"We are full of respect and admiration for the non-violent action, the remarkably consistent action being taken by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and also by the members and politicians of the National League for Democracy."
"They have earned our unreserved respect, and we wish to assure them that they have our support and that the European Union, together with the international community, will do everything it can to help to restore human rights, or to be more accurate, to introduce human rights, democracy and also the rule of law in Burma."
"We are certainly still pinning our hopes in San Suu Kyi."
"Her continuing campaigns show that her voice cannot be silenced and that we in Europe, therefore, also have a duty to do everything to ensure that her voice is heard not only here in Europe, but also in America and above all in Asia."
"She bears the hopes of the persecuted and the repressed, and also of the many men and women used as forced labour."
"She also bears the hopes of those citizens who opted for democracy, the parliamentary system and the rule of law before 1990."
"We must call on our partners, the ASEAN States, but also other states in Asia to do everything to bring about a change in this 'transitional government' as it so cynically still calls itself."
"That is why I think it is right that we should take stronger economic sanctions."
"The EU has acted correctly here."
"We now need an institutionalised dialogue, and a debate on Burma should be right at the top of the agenda of the Laos Summit, to make it clear that both ASEAN and the EU bear some responsibility for events in Burma."
"Violations of human rights in Colombia, particularly the case of Fr. Brendan Forde"
"Mr President, this Parliament has discussed the situation in Colombia many times."
"The situation in Colombia is that of a latent civil war in which, over several decades, the violence has taken on a structural nature."
"This latent civil war was complicated a great deal as a result of the development of drug trafficking, with Colombia becoming a country where drugs are produced and transported to the rest of the world."
"In that situation, there are various groups who use violence."
"I am referring not only to the paramilitary organisations and the guerrillas, but also to the drug trafficking organisations."
"At times, even military units use violence and violate human rights."
"In a situation of this kind, the attempt to establish peace zones, for example through the peace communities established in the rural region of Urabá, has faced great difficulties."
"In fact, recently there have been murders in these communities in Urabá, specifically in the region of La Unión."
"Their leaders have had death threats, and death threats in Colombia are something to be taken very seriously, because they tend to be carried out."
"There is really not very much this Parliament can do."
"We of course support the efforts of the Colombian Government and other organisations to achieve peace, and we reiterate our desire and interest in the European institutions cooperating with the Colombian Government in helping to maintain peace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Medina Ortega said, we too must reiterate the unfortunate position of the conflict in Colombia, and highlight that in the Peace Community in La Unión, in the region of Urabá, there have been three murders since 1997."
"Fortunately, the Colombian Government has decided to pursue those responsible and punish them accordingly."
"But the fact is that, since 1997, there have been three murders, the most recent on 8 July of this year, and the Peace Community of La Unión and the Intercongregational Committee for Justice and Peace, including the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde, have had repeated death threats, despite their position of remaining neutral and contributing to bringing peace to the area."
"We think that this situation again requires the strongest possible action on the part of the European institutions."
"Both the Commission and the European Parliament have a series of opportunities for this in cooperation with the United Nations Human Rights Office and also through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia."
"We urge the Commission, obviously in cooperation with Parliament, to provide the Colombian Government with all our political force and capacity for pressure so that finally the desired peace can come to Colombia and these tragic situations of assassinations, deaths and murders do not happen again."
"I had the honour last year of visiting this beautiful, tormented country and it is a privilege accorded to us here in the European Parliament to be able to raise our voices to defend the rights of people a great distance from here."
"I also had the honour of meeting many of the human rights activists in Colombia last year."
"This year we have heard in Ireland, as is obvious from the concern expressed by Irish colleagues here today, of the danger facing Father Brendan Forde, a Franciscan working in the small village of La Ùnion who has chosen to remain with his parishioners at considerable danger to his own life."
"He is so isolated he probably will never hear of the debate here today."
"He has to go eight miles before he can find a telephone to communicate with anybody."
"For that reason, it is our privilege here to raise our voices to demand that his life and the lives of those living in his community are protected and to make sure that the Colombian Government is aware of our concerns."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to express my grave disappointment at the resolution which we have before us."
"My group, the Green/EFA Group, signed the amendment, but we were appalled that the amendment and the resolution does not go far enough."
"They do not cover a number of serious issues like Plan Colombia and the grave human rights abuses that are taking place in the country."
"It has been stated by many human rights organisations that human rights abuses by paramilitaries have the support of the armed forces and that the murder of the poor people in rural areas is as a result of this."
"Most of the Colombian military forces continue to be implicated in serious human rights abuses and their aiding and abetting of paramilitary atrocities are basically ignored by the Colombian authorities."
"The US State Department has consistently reported that Colombia's armed forces have taken measures to punish human rights abuses in their ranks."
"Plan Colombia will result in USD 1.3 billion from the US being allocated for mainly military purposes."
"Many human rights organisations believe that the plan will worsen conditions for poor rural populations and will certainly increase political violence."
"It is going to irreversibly damage the people and the environment and it will not solve the drugs problem."
"There was no consultation on Plan Colombia with the Colombian people, which is unacceptable."
"I was in Colombia last year with NGOs and I can tell you that the situation there is really grave."
"The Colombian soldiers continue to actively encourage the paramilitaries responsible for human rights violations and it is clear that the United States and Colombia have acted against the interests of the people."
"I believe that this should have been part of the resolution."
"The only group that wanted to address Plan Colombia and the whole human rights situation in Colombia was our own group."
"That is really unfortunate and a gross abdication of our duty to people all over the world."
"Mr President, when President Pastrana appeared before this Parliament he committed himself to working for peace in his country, but he forgot to mention three quite important issues."
"Firstly, the high level of responsibility of the Government itself, which covers up violations of human rights, torture, kidnapping and murders committed by paramilitary groups in collusion with the army."
"Secondly, that such serious problems as cocaine growing and violence can only be solved through peace talks with the FAR and the ELN."
"And thirdly, that he was preparing Plan Colombia for military intervention in the area with the United States, going behind the backs of European and world opinion."
"For these reasons, and given the danger represented by Plan Colombia of Latin America becoming another Vietnam, we need to act with three specific proposals."
"Firstly, that any aid to Colombia from the European Union will be granted once a peace agreement has been signed between the Government, the FAR and the ELN."
"Secondly, that the European Union must condemn Plan Colombia and demand that the solution to the conflict be a negotiated and peaceful one, in order to avoid this escalation of military action."
"And thirdly, the European Union must demand that President Pastrana puts an end to all violations of human rights by paramilitary groups in his country, and that the sad world records of thousands of victims that are reached each year should come to an end."
"Therefore, allow me to also add - as has already been said, but I think that it is worth saying it specifically - that the European Union should establish a human rights observatory in Latin America, associated with the United Nations observatory that already exists."
"Because there are so many countries, but above all Colombia, that fail to guarantee respect for democracy and human rights, it is our responsibility to give adequate help to the region, which has such importance for us and for the world."
"Mr President, could I say directly to Commissioner Nielson that I wrote to you on 18 August expressing my concern about the life and the plight of Father Brendan Forde, the Irish priest whose life is currently under threat in the complex political circumstances that pertain in Colombia."
"Could I add to that the name of one young man born and raised in Ireland, Tristan James Murray, whose mother comes from my part of Ireland in Wexford, and his Colombian colleague, Javier Nova, young environmentalists missing since July."
"We all have concerns that Plan Colombia might escalate the conflict and increase the influence of the guerrillas out there."
"Please ensure that aid from the EU, and indeed American aid, is used as it should be used, not to increase the attacks by the militia against the peace communities in the name of trying to take out the guerrillas."
"Father Forde is staying where he is because he is trying to protect his community."
"His life has been threatened; he has been given twenty days to get out and the International Red Cross will support all we are saying about it."
"We have to raise the international profile of all the people, including the communities whose lives are under threat and we trust Commissioner Nielsen you will do all you can for us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two minutes are hardly sufficient to relate the appalling figures which describe events in Columbia."
"I will mention but a few, listed in the last e-mail I received from Amnesty International: 50 civilians were killed last month by paramilitaries; 400 civilian massacres took place during 1999; 3 500 victims of police crimes; 1 000 abductions; 250 000 Colombian civilians have been thrown out of their homes for political reasons."
"In addition, there has been another massacre in the rural community La Unión, the third in three years."
"We have a moral obligation to declare that this massacre was perfectly planned, that, nowadays, everything that happens in Columbia happens for a reason."
"So what can we do?"
"Wait for the next massacre in La Unión or another village to produce yet another resolution expressing our grief or, as some of the Members have suggested - and rightly so - make our voice heard, loud and clear?"
"In my opinion, Parliament must now find the courage to make its voice heard, for, to make reference to Amnesty International once again, all the parties taking part in the conflict are responsible for the violations of human rights in Columbia, but one of them - the paramilitaries - has a greater responsibility."
"Indeed, the paramilitary groups are crushing the civilian population in a lethal vice."
"As has been pointed out, President Pastrana appeared before this House and offered to make a substantial effort to bring all the parties to dialogue."
"It is Parliament's responsibility to call for a system of rules and rights to be re-established, within the Colombian State, most importantly, as well as condemning the current situation in Columbia."
"The paramilitaries act in agreement and in cahoots with the army, which in many cases - including this one - draw up the death lists."
"To date, there has been no serious attempt to bring the heads of this alleged paramilitary army to justice - for example Carlos Castaños, who continues to broadcast his interviews on Colombian radio with impunity."
"We therefore reiterate our support for a peaceful solution and, without hypocrisy, we call upon the Colombian Government to reflect upon the tragic actions of the paramilitaries."
"Lastly, we call upon the Commission and the Member States to employ all the appropriate political resources to preserve the security of the civilian organisations involved in upholding human rights."
"Mr President, as Manolo Medina said, once again we are talking about Colombia."
"In this case, in order to ask for protection for the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde and his colleagues."
"However, the last time a human rights defender was assassinated in Colombia was in May."
"His name was Ramiro Zapata."
"25 human rights defenders have been assassinated in the past year and a half."
"In recent years, 3 000 activists from Unión Patriótica have died."
"Luis Guillermo Pérez, also a human rights defender, insists that there is a plan, called the Hundred plan, to assassinate up to one hundred human rights defenders."
"I think that this is a catastrophe for Colombia."
"Let us hope that this human rights defender is exaggerating."
"But if what he says is true, it is a catastrophe for Colombia."
"I think that the European Union should have its own initiative, its own strategy, separate from any military venture, as that of the United States appears to be, in order to make life more bearable for the people of Colombia."
"Mr President, once again this Parliament, which has an inescapable and irrevocable commitment to human rights in Colombia and the whole world, has to express its concern regarding the situation in that country and, specifically, the death threats received by the Irish priest Brendan Forde and his community, which we firmly reject."
"The European Union, Mr President, should, in my opinion, do something more than expressing its concern, demanding the safety of its citizens and reiterating its support for the peace negotiation efforts initiated by President Pastrana with the paramilitary groups."
"It is now time to move from words to actions so that we do not just carry on making purely rhetorical statements."
"I would like to point out that President Pastrana was the first foreign Head of State who wished to appear before the plenary session of Parliament in this legislature."
"He now needs a specific response from the European Union that shows solidarity on the three fronts that he has opened up: the process of negotiation of the armed conflict, combating drugs, which we should approach from a point of view of shared responsibility, and strengthening institutions, with a particular appeal for the defence of human rights."
"I would like to recall the words of President Pastrana in this Parliament: ""I believe that a decent and democratic future is not possible without a culture of respect for fundamental rights."
"I know that in the course of the protracted internal conflict in Colombia these rights have suffered serious violations, and this must not continue."
"I am totally committed to the defence of human rights."""
"The reality that is currently devastating the country is quite different, Mr President."
"Therefore, I think it is important that the Commission tells us what resources it has in order for the Community to respond to this problem, because, in the draft budget for 2001, no reference is made to the response that Mrs González Álvarez mentioned a moment ago: a genuine response from the European Union itself."
"How does the Commission intend to respond, to show solidarity with the conflict that is devastating the country?"
"British soldiers held hostage in Sierra Leone"
"Mr President, unfortunately, kidnappings in Sierra Leone are once again in the news."
"This time it is the kidnapping of eleven British soldiers by the West Side Boys militia."
"To this we must add the attacks carried out by this group of rebels with the aim of extending their area of influence, which have cost the lives of three members of the pro-governmental forces."
"These are actions that the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns and which the European Parliament should also condemn. At the same time, it should also demand the immediate and unconditional release of the soldiers who are being held hostage and show its support for the Government of Sierra Leone, and for the UNAMSIL and British army forces who are working to consolidate peace in that country."
"It is still a precarious peace, which is demonstrated by this kidnapping."
"That is why we cannot just stop at words of condemnation, but we must move on to action and also demand that the Lomé Peace Agreements are complied with and that all the militias are disarmed."
"However, as long as poverty continues to rule in Sierra Leone, until the trafficking of diamonds is put to an end once and for all and the arms trade is ended, there will be no chance of peace for this tortured country."
"The European Union must therefore use every means within its power, not only in order to help fund the peace process, but also, above all, in order to make it possible to establish living conditions that make peace irreversible."
"We therefore need a generous and coordinated policy of development cooperation, especially in the field of education."
"This is why a budgetary effort is being requested for this policy, as a policy that will contribute to ending the blight of poverty."
"But, above all, we need decisive action on the part of the European Union, the Member States and the whole of the international community in order to put an end to diamond trafficking in the area."
"As long as a country' s natural wealth is only benefiting warlords, that is, as long as diamonds enable the paramilitaries to have sufficient capital to provide themselves with arms and continue their activities, peace will be nothing more than an impossible dream."
"Without peace, development will only be a Utopia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, hearing these accounts of misery related each time we meet here in Strasbourg makes me wonder what we can actually do to help."
"In Sierra Leone, not only are UN soldiers and British soldiers taken hostage, a complete nation has been held hostage for years We are accessories to this, if only through the diamond trade."
"On 5 July, the Security Council instituted an embargo on diamonds from Sierra Leone."
"The European Union should now pull out all the stops in order to make this embargo happen and to stop all trade in blood diamonds."
"I believe that, for this reason, it is not sufficient to curb the diamond trade in Sierra Leone."
"We should also continue to support the Government, but I also believe that support for the war tribunal is absolutely necessary."
"We need to put an end to the immunity from punishment whereby people can use weapons to kill their fellow-citizens."
"Mr President, of course I feel sympathy for the 12 British soldiers captured in Sierra Leone by one of the armed gangs plaguing the country."
"They, too, are the victims of a policy whose main victim is the people of Sierra Leone."
"But primarily, that policy is a result of government action, of the action of the UK Government supported by all the major western powers, especially France, and the UN."
"I find it disgusting that the resolution makes no mention of the United Kingdom' s past and present role in that country."
"After plundering and exploiting the region, that former colonial power rigged the elections and imposed a government that mainly represents its own interests."
"Its machinations are one of the main contributing factors in a barbaric civil war in which it is implicated directly, by its diplomacy and by the naval pressure it is exerting, and indirectly by the behaviour on the ground of the troops of its former African colonies, which is just as dreadful as that of the armed gangs."
"These armed gangs, including the RUF, certainly do not represent the interests of the people of Sierra Leone, in terms either of their methods or their objectives."
"But, however great their responsibility for the misfortunes of their country, it does not match the cynicism of the British ministers and high dignitaries."
"To conclude, we will vote against this resolution, which conceals a colonialist policy that is hardly in keeping with today' s world."
"Mr President, I rather object to the efforts made earlier by the Spanish left to make political capital out of Gibraltar on the back of the tragedy of the Kursk."
"HMS Tireless is safe in British territory and the repairs will be carried out to the highest safety standards."
"On the subject of Sierra Leone, I further object to the statement by the previous speaker, but there is a wider point that I would like to make concerning the British Government's role."
"We warned the British Labour Government months ago about the dangers of an open-ended commitment of British troops to Sierra Leone."
"Our troops should have been given a clear and finite mission with a realistic exit strategy from the start."
"The present unacceptable situation is a clear consequence of mission creep and political indecision and provides a clear lesson for the future."
"Mr President, the situation in Sierra Leone has been the subject of our urgent debates on several occasions, and we have always dealt with it by encouraging peace talks, national reconciliation and aid for the displaced population, and by calling for an international criminal justice system that can try those responsible for the genocide that is being committed in that country."
"Today, we are not faced with a merely political issue, but with a criminal act that falls under a criminal code."
"We are talking about a kidnapping carried out by criminals who have no political links, either with the members of the former military junta or with any of the groups that signed the peace agreement in July 1999."
"Their demands are limited to a request for a group of prisoners to be freed and for the revision of a peace agreement that is supposed to be putting back together a country that has been torn to pieces."
"The victims of the kidnapping undoubtedly have a great deal of political significance."
"The international presence in Sierra Leone is a good example of the perseverance on the part of the international community in seeking world peace."
"Therefore, taking on that responsibility, we are in support of the European Parliament addressing the Government of Sierra Leone today and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the British soldiers who have been taken hostage."
"Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq"
"Mr President, this is a truly distressing affair."
"Possibly the most important founding principle of the European Union was peace and those who seek to join the Union must try to conduct their domestic and their foreign affairs in as peaceable a fashion as possible."
"Turkey, as we appreciate, suffers from an extremely vulnerable border and it is a particular problem for it to establish the requisite stability and peaceful circumstances that its integration to Europe properly requires."
"As a part of the pre-accession phase of Turkey's candidacy, we should try to establish a functional forum where military as well as civilian and economic issues should be shared between us."
"Turkey's membership of NATO presents many of our Member States with a special responsibility in this respect."
"The development of a common European Security and Defence Policy should be seen as a pretext, and also as a bridge, for us to reach common positions on ways to combat terrorism while respecting fundamental rights."
"If we are able to succeed in creating such a practical forum, we should be able to expect that this sort of sad critical incident will be put firmly in the past."
"Mr President, Turkey is one of the NATO countries and is applying to join the European Union."
"It has signed all kinds of international Treaties, including those protecting human rights, banishing torture, etc. Nevertheless, Turkey continues to bomb the Kurds who live outside its borders, in northern Iraq."
"Commissioner, I think we should be quite plain about this."
"Matters will never improve without a clear, political and peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem, and Turkey should realise this."
"I believe that stabilisation - and we at least hope that peace in the Middle East is inching nearer day by day - will only happen if a solution is found to the Kurdish problem."
"We naturally want to express our sympathy to the families hit by bombings, most recently in August, and we demand the greatest respect for international borders."
"If this respect is not forthcoming, it will be a continual source of misery."
"War will never lead to peace."
"Mr President, the mother of a victim of the bombing who was interviewed on television asked ""How is my child to blame?"""
"Why should women, children and defenceless civilians always be the victims of military action?"
"Over 32 people were killed and 40 were injured in the bombing of Kurdish villages by the Turkish military in Kendakor on 15 August."
"This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity."
"It is a sign of the Turkish Government's attitude towards peace and towards the Kurds at a time when the Kurds had made a peaceful gesture."
"As a spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has confirmed, Turkey from time to time carries out operations against the PKK, who have now, for the third time, declared a unilateral ceasefire."
"I would like to know why arms are being delivered to Turkey right in the middle of the pre-accession process, and why arms factories are being built."
"Why were the human rights organisations and World Peace Day banned on 1 September?"
"Is it really possible to accelerate the democratisation process using weapons and arms?"
"The answer is no."
"The best way to achieve peace is a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights."
"Why is that mothers always have to suffer?"
"Can we not help to foster fellowship and peace between the Kurdish and Turkish peoples?"
"I welcome the MEDA programme, which states that all state, legal, political, cultural and social discrimination against the Kurdish population by the Turkish Government should cease."
"Granting EU financial aid to Turkey should be tied to solving the Kurdish problem, and this aid should be devoted to overcoming the economic and social underdevelopment of the Kurdish region."
"Bombing civilian populations should no longer be allowed in this century."
"I wish to condemn this inhumanity and want to see an end to this crime. Those guilty of such crimes should be condemned."
"I call on the Council and the Member States to consistently condemn the bombing of Kurdish villages and to make representations to the Turkish Government for them to start negotiations with the Kurds' democratic representatives for a political solution as soon as possible."
"That is the fast track into the EU."
"Mr President, this will be the third time that I have spoken in the House during this part-session on various aspects concerning Turkey and its relations with the European Union."
"This will have given me an opportunity to address a number of points that I will be taking up in the report this Assembly has asked me to draw up on enlargement to Turkey and its accession to the EU."
"I will not go back over that but I do want to give my opinion here."
"If it turns out that the bombardment of Kendakor on 15 August was carried out by the Turkish army, we will have to encourage the Turkish Government gradually to reduce the role its armed forces continue to play, on the pretext of combating terrorism, in areas likely to cast serious doubt on the credibility of Turkey' s wish to join the European Union."
"There seem to be signs that the fight against terrorism is being won and I sincerely believe that the time has come to take this kind of decision."
"Simply because the military has that force, it cannot and must not, except in times of emergency, have the power of decision on the use of force."
"My 40-year military career has fully persuaded me that cedant arma togae, let war yield to peace."
"Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution on the Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq was tabled by five of the European Parliament' s political groups."
"That proves the importance our Parliament attaches to respect for international law and human rights in that part of the world and its extreme vigilance when a candidate country for EU membership, in this case Turkey, is concerned."
"Indeed, we cannot allow northern Iraq, which is an area of limited sovereignty by virtue of international decisions, also to become an area outside the rule of law, an area where anything goes and where, on top of that, the presence of observers is entirely prohibited."
"The legitimate fight against terrorism does not justify collective acts of punishment, victimising the Kurdish inhabitants of entire villages."
"Disproportionate reprisals of that kind should be banished forever from the military arsenal of a civilised country."
"Mr President, as my colleague Mrs Uca said, it is unacceptable for a country that wishes to become a member of the European Union to bombard defenceless people, kill more than 30 civilians and injure more than 40 people."
"We think that the least that can be asked of a country, in these circumstances, is that it respects international law."
"And of course, we also must condemn the hypocrisy of some Member States which, breaking the code of conduct for exporting arms to countries that could use them in the way that Turkey did in this particular case, export arms there."
"We think it is hypocritical to condemn the event and then to send arms so that it can happen again."
"We also feel that the European Union should monitor each of the candidate countries primarily with regard to human rights."
"Otherwise, it is not acceptable for it to become a part of this Union."
"Firstly, on the refugees in Nepal, the Commission fully shares the concern of the honourable Members about the state of the refugees living in the camps in eastern Nepal and, like them, is calling for an early and permanent solution."
"New impetus and political will are needed from both sides to find an appropriate solution."
"Above all, arrangements should be agreed for those who wish to go back to Bhutan voluntarily."
"Technical solutions cannot be found unless the negotiators are firmly resolved to reach agreement."
"The Commission acknowledges the results achieved by Mrs Ogata, the head of the UNHCR, for instance, when she visited Bhutan and Nepal last May, and the commitment of both sides to find a viable solution soon."
"I have also talked to government representatives from both parties."
"They also seem determined to find a solution."
"Mrs Ogata's and the visit of a European Parliament delegation in April this year have been instrumental to genuine progress."
"However, the Commission regrets that the formula for verification in the camps has not yet been agreed, despite recent expectations that an agreement would be found."
"In its regular contacts with the Nepalese and Bhutanese authorities the Commission has invariably stressed that this problem must be dealt with as a matter of urgency."
"The EC is a major donor of humanitarian aid to the refugees and to date has spent more than EUR 11 million."
"The Commission has used every opportunity to urge both sides to achieve tangible results."
"It has repeatedly stated its commitment to provide the necessary resources to facilitate reintegration and resettlement of the refugees once real progress has been made."
"A number of EU Member States have made the same commitment."
"In the current financial year the Commission will supply EUR 1.5 million in assistance to the camps via the UNHCR."
"The risk that funds might run short should be avoided."
"This is completely manageable, given the amounts involved."
"It is our responsibility to prevent it."
"The Commission is looking forward to assessing the results of the forthcoming discussion between the Prime Minister of Nepal, Mr Koirala, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bhutan, Mr Zimba, due to take place in the UN General Assembly on 11 September."
"Moving on to the recent events in Burma, on 18 May the Commission deplored in this House the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military machine."
"We referred on that occasion to extrajudicial killings, the imposition of forced labour, the forced displacement of local populations, the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the full functioning of legitimate political parties."
"We also condemned the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and the routine practice of arbitrary arrests."
"At the same time, the Commission expressed its support for the common EU position on Burma and for the decision of the April 2000 General Affairs Council to strengthen this common position."
"We use every possible opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge the State Peace and Development Council to enter into a substantive dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities."
"The aim must be to arrive at a mutually agreed solution to the present situation, re-establishing respect for international standards of human rights in Burma."
"Several speakers this afternoon have mentioned tourism."
"The EU has already clearly expressed its support for Aung San Suu Kyi's call on people from all civilised countries to refrain from tourist visits to Burma."
"We encourage our citizens to respond accordingly."
"The most recent developments in Rangoon provide perfect proof, if proof were needed, of the validity of our condemnation of the military regime's unacceptable practices."
"The unwarranted seizure and subsequent detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party, together with local youth leaders, last Saturday, cannot in any way be justified by claims that they need 'protection' ."
"Nor can such treatment be justified by unsubstantiated allegations of conspiracy."
"This was a simple exercise in thuggery by an administration acting in panic."
"The Commission therefore joins its voice to the calls from all over the world for an immediate end to the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and her senior colleagues, the immediate restoration of normal channels for diplomatic access to the leadership of the National League for Democracy, the immediate release of the local youth leaders currently held without charge, and an immediate end to the illegal surveillance of private telephone conversations by democratically elected political representatives in Burma."
"On the human rights situation in Colombia, our attention has been drawn on a number of occasions to the murders of innocent civilians in Colombia."
"Impunity for the perpetrators of such atrocities has almost been systematic."
"We have also seen a dramatic increase in death threats against people providing assistance on the ground to more vulnerable groups."
"For example, we have been informed that serious threats have been made against the Irish priest Brendan Forde, who is working in one of the regions most affected by violence."
"The Commission deeply deplores and condemns this situation and calls all parties in the conflict to respect humanitarian law and principles."
"The Commission also supports the peace efforts promoted by President Pastrana."
"It will do anything in its power in order to promote support for lasting peace in the country."
"As regards what has been said in the debate this afternoon, in my view more guns are not a shortcut to a solution for Colombia but will merely add to the problems."
"The Commission fully shares Parliament's concerns over the recent kidnapping of eleven British soldiers in Sierra Leone."
"We hope the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining six soldiers are successful."
"We would like to express our solidarity with the soldiers and their families."
"The Commission is concerned that incidents like this and the abduction of UN personnel could hamper attempts to put the peace process back on track."
"We would welcome any decision by the United Nations Security Council to strengthen the UN force in Sierra Leone."
"The Security Council's resolution of 5 July this year banning the illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone has now been transposed into Community law."
"This ban, as well as the ban on arms sales to other groups which has been in force since 1997, must be strictly implemented."
"The Commission calls on all parties concerned - and that, of course, also includes the diamond industry in Europe - to support the UN's sanctions committees in achieving this end."
"The Commission remains supportive of the Government's attempts to restore peace to the country and to implement programmes of economic recovery."
"With funds from the European Development Fund support is being provided to demobilise and reintegrate ex-combatants within the framework of a wider reconstruction and rehabilitation programme."
"Economic recovery is being assisted through a EUR 8.2 million programme of budgetary support and a technical assistance programme supporting improved public financial management."
"Within the next few weeks the Commission will be seeking approval for a rehabilitation and reintegration programme of EUR 30 million, a health sector support programme of EUR 28 million, a programme of post-conflict budget support of EUR 34.75 million and a support programme to the Ministry of Finance of EUR 4.5 million."
"As regards humanitarian assistance, the Commission, through ECHO, is continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs and the UN."
"Since the beginning of 1999 ECHO has provided some EUR 26 million of assistance covering the supply of medical aid, therapeutic feeding, water and sanitation and psycho-social support for children affected by war."
"This is especially important, given the terrible situation for child soldiers and children in general in Sierra Leone."
"In addition, this funding has specifically covered support for amputees and refugees and internally displaced populations."
"As regards northern Iraq, the Commission shares the concern expressed in various draft resolutions about the latest operations by the Turkish Air Force and the resulting civilian casualties."
"The Commission has noted that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs is looking into the incident and into possible compensation."
"The upheavals caused by each incursion of the Turkish military into Iraq undermine the efforts to stabilise the area and inflict unnecessary suffering on the Kurdish population."
"They have suffered enough."
"What is needed for a return to normal life in the area is stability, peace and support for economic development."
"Over the past few years, the Union has repeatedly stressed the need to respect the integrity of Iraq and its border with Turkey."
"These latest border violations again do not solve the problems in Turkey, or anywhere else."
"In our view, a peaceful dialogue between the parties is the only viable path to lasting stability in the area."
"I have noted carefully what Members of this House have said this afternoon about their expectations in relation to Turkey, not least regarding its future place in European cooperation, and I certainly share their views."
"Mr President, I would like to say that, with regard to the situation in Colombia, we put a question to the Commissioner, who answered that the Commission supports the peace efforts being made by President Pastrana."
"I asked him whether the Commission would complement this rhetorical support with any kind of support that did not just consist of words."
"I realise that this is perhaps not the time to discuss this, but I would like the Commission to answer us, even if it is in writing."
"I will be happy to augment what I am saying now by more thorough comments in writing."
"My immediate response is that we have to be careful, to put it plainly and directly, not to be cast in a role as simply providing funding for activities that we may not agree with 100%."
"We also have to take care to be sufficiently focused on poverty and doing something that really is to the benefit of the most disadvantaged groups."
"So what we are doing now and what we will do in the future, financially speaking, in Colombia, will have to be tailored very carefully against that background."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 5.30 p.m."
"Temelín nuclear power station"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0708/2000 by Mrs McNally and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the Czech nuclear power plant in Temelín;"
"B5-0723/2000 by Mr Flemming and Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats), on the Temelín reactor;"
"B5-0732/2000 by Mr Echerer and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the nuclear power plant in Temelín;"
"B5-0745/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the nuclear power plant in Temelín."
"Mr President, I am taking the place of Mrs McNally who has had to go back to the United Kingdom this afternoon."
"The European Union with the support of this Parliament has already done much to raise the technical and operational safety of Soviet-type nuclear reactors and to create independent regulators."
"As I understand it, what is being done at Temelín has already been done in Finland and there is similar upgrading work in hand at Kozloduy in Bulgaria with the support of a Euratom loan."
"What I would like the Commission to confirm, if possible, is if the work at Temelín follows the recommendations of twelve inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and that it will, in fact, create safety standards equivalent to those in our Member States."
"That is the assurance, or reassurance, that the public in the European Union requires."
"We have had many messages from the Czech authorities this week."
"They claim that most of the actions which we request in this resolution have already been carried out and that the remainder are, in fact, under way."
"Is the Commission in a position to confirm that this afternoon, and if not, will it undertake to supply its views on this matter with urgency to the Industry Committee of the European Parliament?"
"Mr President, many EU Member States have a very friendly relationship with the Czech Republic, and even one based on family ties."
"But I believe that in a good family you can also say things that do not suit other members of the family. Nuclear power stations in the European Union have the highest safety standards in the world, and a candidate country that wants to commission a new nuclear power station must, of course, comply with those standards."
"It is right to say that evaluating safety standards at Temelín is a matter for the Czech nuclear regulatory authority."
"But it is also true to say that during the accession partnership with the Czech Republic, the Commission has identified the implementation of Community legislation on environmental impact assessment as a priority, partly because of Temelín."
"Nevertheless, although the Czech Republic signed the agreement on cross-border EIA, the Espoo Convention, in 1993, it has still not ratified it."
"Now, all of a sudden, trial operation is to start at Temelín, with undue haste and in a few days' time, before Germany and Austria, which are neighbouring countries, have received the information requested and before the deeply concerned population of the neighbouring countries has had an opportunity to consider the position and make their objections known to the Czech authorities."
"That is what the Espoo Convention stipulates, and it is, after all, valid EU legislation."
"I call on the Czech Government, indeed I implore it, to take seriously the fears not only of people in neighbouring countries, but also within its own borders."
"The reactors at Temelín are a Soviet design, VVER1000, and there is nothing Westinghouse can do about that."
"Please just think about Chernobyl."
"I appeal once again to the Czech Government to act voluntarily now in just the same way as they would have to act if they already belonged to the European Union and were a member of our great European family."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank my colleagues for their constructive and objective cooperation, which has resulted in this joint motion for a resolution."
"In the course of 13 project modifications, environmental impact assessment has been simply disregarded."
"As Mrs Flemming said, it is a long time since the Espoo Convention was signed."
"It should have been ratified by the Czech Parliament at the beginning of the year and transposed into national law, but this has been indefinitely delayed without any reasons being given."
"Despite this, the constant concerns about safety expressed by the public, in the press and also in private discussions are not being taken seriously."
"During the last bilateral meetings between Czech, Austrian and German experts on 2 and 5 September this year, it was once again stated that Temelín does not meet German safety standards and would not, therefore, receive an operating licence in Germany."
"My fourth point is that electricity from Temelín is not intended for internal consumption: it is intended for export, and at dumping prices at that."
"Fifthly, the safety of European citizens is at stake here and our responsibility towards them should be adequate grounds for action."
"The Commission says that we do not have any legal options here."
"Well, the Commission has known that for a long time."
"Did the Commission expect that somebody would just pull a legal measure out of the hat?"
"No."
"I expect that the Greens' view will be the well-established one that safety and nuclear power stations are two incompatible concepts.The fact of the matter is that there are eastern European nuclear power stations and western European nuclear power stations."
"Double standards are being applied here, and that must stop."
"Our friends in the Commission have to accept that you cannot use legal measures alone to solve every single problem."
"I therefore expect the Commission and the Council to demonstrate together the same strong and combined political will that the European Parliament is displaying with this motion for a resolution."
"I would like to comment on the Technical Group of Independent Members' amendment, which does not include any sensible or new requirements apart from a hint at compromise."
"I cannot vote for this policy."
"It is simply populist to gloss over the long-standing failure or lack of interest on the part of politicians towards this issue by threatening a veto - it will not have the desired effect and it will not create a constructive basis for negotiations."
"The safety of Europe's citizens and, thus, confidence in the Community should be a priority for us all."
"Our motion for a resolution is enormously important for the people of Europe and above all for the Czech public."
"I hope that we will not disappoint them."
"Mr President, this issue should not even be a subject of urgent debate."
"I deplore the cynical Green exploitation and misrepresentation of the situation."
"Interference in the internal affairs of a candidate country with the political blackmail of a threat to veto accession to the EU is wholly unacceptable."
"I regret that people in Austria have allowed themselves to be ruled by emotion, not rational scientific argument."
"The Czechs show every sign of behaving responsibly and properly according to internationally accepted standards, and we should leave them to get on with it."
"Although I signed the joint motion as instructed by my political group, I intend to vote against this resolution."
"Mr President, as the third Austrian to speak, I was starting to worry that I would have nothing to add."
"But having heard Mr Chichester, I think it is worth reiterating that we have to pay serious attention to the wishes and concerns of the people of Europe, and of Austria in particular, as regards nuclear energy. This applies especially to the Temelín nuclear power station."
"My group is supporting this motion for a resolution on Temelín for reasons of principle, because we take the people's concerns seriously and because many of us have, for a long time, been actively fighting against nuclear energy in the East and in the West."
"The political battle against the Zwentendorf nuclear power station in Austria has had an enduring formative influence on me personally, so I did not need to be convinced by the conservative arguments in the Austrian media over the last few days which I have followed with surprise and sometimes with quiet amusement."
"Like Mrs Echerer, I oppose the single, very vaguely worded amendment, because I believe that the phrase 'high level' does not mean anything, because the Czech Republic itself is surely aware of the need for a high level of safety."
"I therefore fully support the motion for a resolution before us and oppose the amendment."
"Mr President, I should like to confess to the Members of this Chamber that I feel rather ambivalent about this issue."
"On the one hand, I am an old opponent of nuclear power and have for many years been a member of the board of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate. On the other hand, I am chairman of the Delegation to the Joint EU-Czech Republic Parliamentary Committee."
"I should therefore quickly like to say three things."
"First of all: concern about nuclear power means that safety will not only be good but that it will, at all times, be as good as it possibly can be."
"Secondly, the same rules naturally apply to the Czech Republic as apply to other candidate States and, in the long run, to Member States."
"Thirdly, this resolution ought to be seen as part of an open dialogue with the Czech Republic, a dialogue we are conducting within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Committee but which ought also to be possible to conduct in our respective parliaments."
"We must broaden out this debate, which is part and parcel of our democracy."
"This ought not, however, to lead to hard feelings between the Czech Republic and the Member States of the EU."
"I hope that the Czechs are able to give positive answers to all the questions and that a favourable solution can in that way be found to this problem."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you would think that we would all have learnt some lessons from the accident at the Chernobyl reactor."
"In that case, the radiation was not confined to the Ukraine, nor was it simply a bilateral problem."
"I know that there are both advocates and opponents of nuclear power in the European Union, and that there is no common line."
"And, above all, there are no uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations."
"There is an urgent need for action here if our credibility is to be maintained."
"However, after the Chernobyl experience we have to ask if it really is possible to bring a nuclear power plant, Temelín, on line in the heart of Europe when it still has significant limitations in terms of safety."
"The Czech Republic is trying to present us with a fait accompli in commissioning Temelín."
"If you will forgive my saying so, this sort of behaviour falls far short of a spirit of partnership."
"Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules."
"A resolution was adopted in the Austrian Parliament this Tuesday by all the parties - all the parties, mark you - emphasising that approval could only be given to the completion of the accession negotiations if the Temelín plant is retrofitted."
"I wish to make one thing quite clear: we support the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU."
"But the conditions must be right."
"I call on you to support our motion for a resolution, the content of which is identical to the four-party resolution adopted in the Austrian Parliament."
"After all, it must be our objective for nuclear power stations to have the highest possible safety standards."
"Mr President, I shall also be voting for this resolution, which I consider to be reasonable."
"If it can help to defuse the battle of words between the two sides somewhat, than it will certainly have served its purpose."
"I regret that the Czech Republic is unable to defend itself here and present its case, as it is always good to hear both sides of such a complicated argument."
"However, in the same spirit of openness I would also like to say that I do not think it is right for the Austrian Government and Parliament to be delivering a kind of ultimatum here."
"That is not the way we have handled these things in the European Union up to now."
"It is quite evident that there is a problem, but if we start issuing ultimatums then the next thing will be that a delegation will arrive representing displaced persons and demand that the Czech Republic can only join the Union if the Benesch Decrees are withdrawn."
"And then some other group will come along demanding something else."
"You have to be careful with ultimatums like this."
"There are other ways of solving such problems."
"But I would also like to suggest to the Czech Republic that they should pay serious attention to the concerns expressed by the German Association for Nuclear Safety."
"That was another point I wanted to make."
"My last, but important point, is one for the Commission."
"We hear a lot about environmental impact, and that is fine."
"But we also have the Euratom Treaty."
"Article 37 of that Treaty effectively stipulates that the Commission must be kept informed about any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in any form whatsoever."
"The Commission also has to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State."
"I know that the Czech Republic does not yet belong to the European Union."
"Nevertheless, I would be interested to know what the Commission's view is in relation to this article, and whether it considers that the Czech Republic has respected it."
"It would be interesting, as Gordon Adam has already asked, to know what its view is on the environmental impact assessment."
"Mr President, Mr Linkohr's comments are not quite correct."
"I will gladly let you see the text approved by the Austrian Parliament."
"It does not contain any kind of ultimatum or any hint of blackmail, and I, too, have made it quite clear now that we cannot and certainly do not want to compel anyone to do anything."
"We request, we appeal to the Czech Government to act in accordance with current European law and quite simply to observe the Espoo Convention, even if they have not ratified it yet."
"The Commission has been following the political debate on the Temelín nuclear power plant with great attention."
"It has repeatedly stressed the importance of candidate countries adhering to a high level of nuclear safety in line with relevant Council resolutions."
"The Commission is actively participating in the deliberations of the Council aimed at assessing and ensuring a high level of nuclear safety in candidate countries as a key requirement for accession to the European Union."
"The responsibility for licensing nuclear installations lies with the Czech nuclear regulatory authority."
"The Commission has cooperated with the Czech authorities in order to reinforce the authority's capacities."
"The Czech authorities have ensured that the operating licence for Unit 1 of the Temelín nuclear power plant will not be issued until all outstanding problems are solved to the satisfaction of the nuclear regulatory authority."
"According to current Czech legislation, an environmental impact assessment is required before the operating licence is issued."
"The Commission expects this provision to be enforced by the Czech authorities."
"Mr Adams asks whether the Czechs took account of the IAEA's inspections and views."
"The answer is 'yes' ."
"The IAEA has reviewed the modifications made to the safety systems by the Czechs following the IAEA's programmes."
"The IAEA concluded that the issues were properly addressed by the Czechs."
"That is the information I am able to supply on this subject."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes' time, at 5.30 p.m."
"Fires in Europe"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0703/2000 by Mrs Malliori and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the forest fires in Europe;"
"B5-0724/2000 by Mr Hatzidakis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the fires in the south of the European Union;"
"B5-0723/2000 by Mrs Isler Béguin and Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the forest fires in Europe;"
"B5-0737/2000 by Mrs Muscardini and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the fires in Europe;"
"B5-0746/2000 by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the fires in the Mediterranean regions;"
"B5-0747/2000 by Mr Korakas and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the fires in Greece."
"Mr President, the fires which again destroyed huge tracts of forest in the Mediterranean this summer are mainly the result of the rise in temperature and prolonged dry weather, not to mention of course criminal cases of arson."
"Climatic changes, which are happening more and more rapidly, impact on the entire ecosystem."
"Scientists have pointed out the risks inherent in our inconsiderate treatment of the planet, one of the results of which is extreme meteorological phenomena."
"Southern Europe has been set alight more and more frequently over recent years."
"The Mediterranean has become a high risk area and needs special measures."
"In my country, Greece, more than 500 fires broke out this year, most of which were dealt with minimal disruption."
"However, there were, unfortunately, also occasions on which the fires got out of control, causing death and destruction."
"I should like to express my sympathy to the families of the victims and the injured in all the countries which faced similar problems."
"I think, Mr President, that a European strategy on the conservation of forests is our political responsibility and an immediate priority."
"I also think it essential that we reinstate the budget line for natural disasters."
"The Commission should exert its influence to ensure that Member States introduce stricter legislation on changes of land use, compulsory reforestation following fires, suitable training on fire-fighting for those in positions of local and regional responsibility and a public awareness campaign on the benefits of forests and how they can be protected and to encourage volunteers fire-fighters."
"Mr President, every September we return to the House and take tragic stock of the number of victims and the extent of the damage to forests as the result of fires."
"The fires are, of course, the result of climatic changes and the weather which prevails in the Mediterranean during the summer; they are also the result of criminal offences."
"There may also be other causes, such as refuse tips and, of course, the lack of certain administrative structures, especially the lack of an overall, coordinated approach to fires, exacerbates the damage which they cause."
"So what proposals can we make?"
"First and foremost, both the Member States and the Commission need to update the regional development programmes and action to prevent, restore and reforest."
"They could use the Interreg Community initiative, for example."
"Similarly, forest registers are desperately needed; this will help to protect and recover our ecological heritage and fight land speculation."
"However, what we need is coordination and cooperation at European level and I call on the Commission to propose that a European fire prevention centre be set up in order to conduct systematic studies and introduce new technical methods to prevent and fight fires."
"And to go one step further: the time has come for the Commission to draw up an integrated defence strategy to coordinate national action and measures against natural and man-made disasters, in line, of course, with the principle of subsidiarity."
"I trust that these proposals will elicit a positive response from the Commission so that we can protect our forests more efficiently."
"Mr President, indeed, like a chronic recurrent disease, the summer of 2000 will once again have suffered the ravages of fires raging through millions of hectares in our country and our continent and even causing the tragic death of a number of firemen and local residents."
"This scourge is the result of criminal action: the blame lies with irresponsible arsonists who should face deterrent penalties, and with unscrupulous developers prepared to use any means possible to get hold of land on which building is forbidden, who ought to be deterred by a whole range of legal means to prosecute them."
"But there are also other reasons for this affliction: they include the lack of any inventories of economic activities, such as agro-pastoral activities in Corsica, and the lack of any real approach, on the basis of geographical databases, to a kind of rural planning that makes the most of natural resources and reduces the risk of fires spreading."
"Lastly, and above all, there is the lack of any genuine environmental education that goes well beyond the necessary prevention and awareness-raising campaigns."
"So this summer epidemic is curable, Mr President."
"It is vital to bring a new balance into some of the land-use policies, such as stock farming in Corsica, and to allocate subsidies on the basis of economic and preventive factors."
"These upstream provisions cannot replace the need for downstream investment in adequate fire-fighting equipment in sufficient quantity to be deployed in all the EU countries."
"The citizens concerned are counting on the Commission to take practical action."
"Mr President, this year, the fires in the Mediterranean, and in Greece in particular, broke all previous records."
"I believe that the area destroyed by the fires was twice as large as at any other time and a great many people were killed despite the fact, of course, that the Greek Government was well prepared and despite the fact that Greece now has some of the best fire-fighting equipment, aeroplanes and human resources in the world."
"What it has proved is that reaction is not enough."
"We need to be pro-active."
"That is what we all say, but none of us does anything."
"It is a complicated issue and, of course, it concerns local authorities and the national government."
"What can the European Union do?"
"What it can do, Mr President, is to apply a more active basic policy with more coordination and increased intervention."
"It can examine the weaknesses of the common agricultural policy, which to all intents and purposes destroys the motivation of people living in and from forests and drives them away."
"The common agricultural policy subsidises pasturing on burnt ground, subsidises animals which graze on burnt ground, at the same time as our forests are trying to reproduce naturally."
"The European Union should also, of course, review its approach to and priorities for investments."
"We have been crying for a land register for a long time now, especially a forest register and forest maps, which need to be supported as a matter of priority over everything else and, of course, any other development and investment measures which boost the development of forests as forests rather than a commodity and which enable people who live off the forest to stay there."
"That is the best form of prevention and the best form of protection."
"Of course we shall still have fires and, with what is happening to the climate, we shall no doubt be unfortunate enough to witness more and more serious phenomena."
"But it is in our hands to try and do what we can to forestall the known causes at least."
"Mr President, Portugal has also been affected by these tragic forest fires which have been the result either of natural causes or of criminal acts motivated by base economic interests."
"We know that this matter is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, which need to organise themselves and build up their own control and prevention resources. We also know that they should give priority to actions of this kind, and to national afforestation projects, under their national regional development programmes."
"It is also necessary, however, to back a European forest strategy with technical and financial resources in order to strengthen and complement national resources."
"With this in mind, I would like to highlight the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of our resolution, which aims to create a European Fire Prevention Centre, and I would like to take the liberty of suggesting that it should be located in Portugal."
"The Commission deeply regrets the loss of human life as well as the ecological and economic damage caused by the recent forest fires in Europe."
"The principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this debate."
"We have to avoid raising too many expectations and overloading the Commission with tasks."
"We must be careful not to promise things we cannot deliver."
"Frankly, there has been enough of that in the past."
"We should be careful, when entering into discussions such as this, not to automatically assume that the Commission will solve the problem."
"We can and should do something, but I wanted to make that cautionary remark."
"To get to the core of this discussion, the question of an emergency aid budget line, the Commission is considering proposing a legal basis for such a line at the moment."
"However, the Commission might consider financial support for the restoration of the forestry production potential on the basis of the rural development regulation, No 1257/1999."
"According to the Greek authorities, the financial contributions from the agricultural funds are not sufficient for a substantial contribution to be made to the restoration work."
"The Commission therefore invites the Greek authorities to present proposals for the amendment of the development programme so that the necessary appropriations can be considered."
"I should like to draw your attention to EC Regulation No 2158/1992, under which preventive action in relation to forest fires may be financed."
"Each Member State should verify that all the necessary steps have been taken to reduce the risk of fires to a minimum."
"New Commission initiatives are already in effect, or will shortly become effective."
"A proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community mechanism for the coordination of emergency civil protection action will be considered by the college in the near future."
"This will aim to improve the mutual assistance between Member States."
"It will also have an important side effect in that it will help third countries to manage unexpected emergencies or disasters they would not be able to handle by themselves."
"Through this coordination mechanism Member States will be invited to identify groups which can intervene at short notice at the scene."
"The Commission recently initiated a satellite-based project to improve information on operational fire fighting centres in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of determining the levels of risk from day to day."
"We will consider whether this could lead to a system for early detection of forest fires."
"The Commission is also encouraging Member States to reinforce their intervention capacities."
"The Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund have already contributed substantially in the period 1994-99."
"The national authorities should provide for the necessary financial resources to consolidate this action for the period 2000-06."
"In general, the decision on the acquisition of such fire-fighting equipment will remain the responsibility of the Member States."
"Self-tuition workshops on fighting forest fires are also planned."
"However the Commission does not have enough resources to extend its activities beyond that."
"The Structural Funds can be used for restoration after natural disasters and advantage has been taken of this possibility in recent years."
"Mr President, like some other Members of the House, I have just been alerted to developments in the situation in northern Afghanistan where, after two months of relentless offensives, the Taliban apparently took the town of Taloqan last night, with a heavy toll of military and civilian victims."
"It is obviously too late to table an urgent resolution on this issue."
"But I would ask you, Mr President, to forward to the Conference of Presidents a request that the Council and the Commission make a statement to the House at our forthcoming mini-session in Brussels on what action the European Union could envisage to help find a political solution in Afghanistan and put an end to these senseless bloodbaths."
"Thank you very much, Mr Morillon, we will pass on that request."
"Mr President, I would like to support Mr Morillon's suggestion."
"I would like to emphasise - and I am now speaking on behalf of my group also - that we consider the Council Declaration on this subject to be very important, and I request you to forward it to the Conference of Presidents."
"I will gladly do that, Mr Sakellariou"
"Mr President, following the vote, I would like to ask the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets to tell us whether he has at his disposal the appropriations called for in paragraphs 12 and 14 of the motion for a resolution on fires in Europe for which we have just voted."
"Mr President, this shows the folly of making policy on the hoof."
"This has never gone through any committee."
"There have been requests for money, which does not exist and no one has said where it is going to come from."
"It is an urgency which has been voted by this Parliament - so be it, but it is quite ludicrous."
"I got the message very well, Mr Wynn."
"Situation in Fiji following the coup d'état"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Fiji following the coup d'état."
"Commissioner Nielson has the floor."
"The release of the hostages on 13 July, the arrest of the rebel leader and his main associates on 26 July and the efforts of the Government to reinstate law and order give some cause for satisfaction."
"However, there are still serious worries about the future of Fiji."
"First and foremost, the use of violence by certain ethnic groupings to impose their rule on other communities is unacceptable."
"Secondly, a democratic government must be re-established."
"The present interim government has no democratic basis."
"There should be a clear blue-print for full restoration of democratic principles and practices."
"The 1997 Constitution, which lays down the principle of equal rights for all Fijian citizens, must be reinstated."
"This process should be finalised very quickly."
"The time-frame currently being proposed, two or three years, is far too long."
"The fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji must be resolved."
"Multiracial cooperation and harmony must become a reality."
"This might require international mediation."
"If we are to be realistic, we must support every possible step on the way to stability without losing sight of the scenario I have just outlined."
"The international community and the donors of aid to Fiji agree on these principles."
"As far as the EU is concerned, the Council has informed the Fijians of its request to begin consultations under Article 366 of the Lomé Convention, which calls for a thorough examination of the situation on the basis of information to be supplied by the Fijians."
"Further input will be provided by the report of an ACP ministerial fact-finding mission to Fiji which took place in mid-August and which was led by the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea."
"Furthermore, the Commission received first-hand information from the legitimate Prime Minister, Mr Chaudhry on 31 August."
"We are now at the beginning of the consultations."
"Measures under Article 366 will be taken if the consultations fail to produce an acceptable solution for both sides in the discussions."
"All that can be said at present is that the measures, if any, should not harm the poor and those already suffering from the severe economic crisis triggered by the events."
"Poverty-related projects should, consequently, continue."
"In conclusion, I hope that the coordinated effort of the international donor community will have the desired effect on the current government in Fiji."
"Even if we achieve our aim of restoring democratic principles and a government chosen in fair and equal elections within less than two years, this will be only a first step for the solution of the Fijian problem."
"A strong long-term effort is required from all parties and, in the first instance, from the Fijian Government and the communities, to work on the entrenched prejudices and anxieties so that racial cooperation and harmony can be restored and become a reality in Fiji."
"This is absolutely essential and there are no alternatives to that reality."
"Mr President, the events that have unfolded in Fiji over the past few months seem to be taken straight from a soap opera."
"Unfortunately, they are for real. What is more, Fiji is an ACP country which enjoys considerable benefits thanks to the sugar protocol with the European Union."
"It is almost ironic that the new partnership deal, which considers democracy to be of paramount importance, was signed in Fiji at a time when that country was hit by a coup d' état."
"It illustrates, once again, how fragile democracy is, even in regions where it seemed to be an established value."
"But the Fiji story is more complicated than that."
"There is a delicate balance of power between the indigenous population and the population of Indian origin, who make up 44% of the population."
"The army plays a dubious role."
"The attacks on Indian properties could apparently take place undisturbed and without any intervention by the body of officials responsible for order. In fact, certain elements within the army openly chose the side of the army taking part in the coup."
"There are the recent revelations about the role of Mr Speight in the lucrative timber industry, which put the whole matter in a completely new light."
"According to recent information, he was apparently discharged as chairman of the state enterprise which manages mahogany plantations, and earlier in the year, he was in danger of missing out on a major contract for the development of hardwood."
"All this seems to suggest that personal and economic, rather than political, interests were behind the coup."
"Be that as it may, Speight' s undemocratic behaviour has plunged a whole country into a deep political and economic crisis."
"Tourism, which represented one third of the gross domestic product, has dropped to less than one fifth."
"Ethnic tension is once again mounting."
"Thousands of inhabitants of Indian origin are still on the run, and the events in Fiji are also prejudicing the promising dynamic in the region which was to culminate in the Pacific Regional Trade Agreement."
"The European Parliament which, in its agreements with the ACP partners, makes strict demands regarding democracy and human rights, can and must condemn such a course of events."
"We need to continue to demand that the safety of all citizens be guaranteed and that any form of ethnic division and provocation be penalised."
"Speight should not be let off the hook."
"Above all, we must work towards the return of true democracy within the meaning of the 1997 Constitution, which guarantees equal rights to all inhabitants of Fiji, and it is true that elections must be called as soon as possible."
"A three-year transitional period is not acceptable."
"If the interim government fails to restore democratic order within a reasonable period of time, sanctions must be considered, preferably 'smart' sanctions, and structural aid must be suspended."
"Consultations on this matter will be starting in September."
"I do hope that the Commission will stick to its principles and will not succumb to political or economic pressure."
"As we are about to embark on a new major partnership agreement between Europe and its partners in the ACP, it is of paramount importance not to create a precedent."
"Mr President, I generally welcome the comments both of the previous speaker and Commissioner Nielson who made a statement on behalf of the Commission."
"I am not as convinced as he is that the violence is actually over in Fiji."
"I had the opportunity last week, along with a number of colleagues from various parties and groups here, to meet with Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry who reported to us that violence against the Indo-Fijians is still continuing in Fiji."
"Secondly, I disagree that there is a fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji."
"It seems to me, if one looks at the origin of the coup d'état, that one should follow the money rather than the ethnic relations."
"I welcome the fact that Article 366 of the Lomé Convention has been invoked."
"If we look back at the history of what has happened in Fiji, we see a sweeping electoral victory by the Fijian Labour Party in the May 1999 General Election when they won, with their supporting parties, 58 out of the 71 seats, ousting the incumbent right-wing government."
"Following that, there has been a systematic attempt to destabilise the new government led by elements of the former governing party and extreme nationalist gangs under the flimsy pretext of protecting indigenous interests."
"It is interesting that, although Mahendra Chaudhry is an Indo-Fijian, twelve out of the 18 members of his cabinet are, as it were, indigenous Fijians and a majority of indigenous Fijian MPs actually supported the Government."
"The destabilisation operation was financed by sections of private enterprise, frightened by the government's radical programme of social reform and poverty alleviation and by its close association with the trade union movement."
"This financing was led by corporate groups bidding for the right to exploit mahogany and native hardwood forestry."
"The police and the military singularly failed to protect and defend the government."
"Alongside George Speight and his gang, when the people's coalition government were taken hostage on 19 May, were members of the armed forces' counter-revolutionary warfare unit."
"What has happened in Fiji is nothing less than a coup d'état by the military industrial complex."
"In fact, it is another Chile written small."
"As a result, the 1997 Constitution has been ripped up."
"A government has been imposed in power by the military that it is effectively controlled by those supporting the coup and the military is trying to offload the blame by prosecuting one small section of those involved, namely the gang around George Speight"
"I believe Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers must back the proposals by the Labour led people's coalition for reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution and, in the spirit of national conciliation, for the formation of a grand coalition for the government in Fiji."
"Unless this is achieved, unless the slide towards a form of apartheid in Fiji, where Indo-Fijians who comprise nearly half the population are rapidly becoming second-class citizens, driven from their homes and jobs, is stopped, then we should demand support for sanctions against the current government."
"We should support the moves by Premier Helen Clark from New Zealand for a concerted action at bilateral, regional and global levels, which should include, as Mr Van Hecke said, 'smart' sanctions targeted at those involved in the coups, denying them the freedom to travel, freezing foreign assets and threatening them when they are apprehended with the consequences of the UN Hostage Convention."
"Second, Fiji should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events."
"Third, there should be a denial of all economic and military assistance to and through the present government."
"The issue of Fiji is important, not only in its own right, but because it will set a precedent as to whether semi-clandestine coups-in-waiting along similar lines will see the light of day and whether Europe and the rest of the developed world is prepared to tackle the issue of indigenous rights - the Third World's variant of the racism that is threatening us all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the coup in Fiji in May of this year was not the first one."
"It was preceded by one in 1987 which resulted in exclusion from the Commonwealth. This does lead me to believe that the tension, possibly ethnic in origin, must go far deeper than we might like to think."
"Then too, tension between the indigenous people of Fiji and Indo-Fijians was at the root of the problem and, needless to say, with Indo-Fijians accounting for 44% of the population and the indigenous people accounting for 64%, two peoples of more or less the same size are involved."
"I can imagine that the removal of prejudice, as you referred to earlier Commissioner, is not a matter of course in such situations."
"Moreover, unemployment promotes tension, and the legally elected government was driven out by the military coup."
"What concerns me more than anything is that this conflict could spread to other islands with similar problems and similar tensions."
"This is, in fact, the opposite of what we have in mind and to which reference has already been made: the establishment of a great Pacific Regional Trade Agreement between 14 nations."
"If we are not careful, this will be the first major conflict in the Pacific and this may well affect the situation in the region for a few decades to come."
"All this makes me wonder whether this coup is merely the thin end of the wedge."
"It also makes me wonder what the European Union' s prevention policy actually consists of."
"What can be done in order to put such a country back on the road towards being a democratic, constitutional state, no longer in a crisis situation and with the guilty parties brought to justice, as has been requested with good reason? We should also press for the safety of all citizens - this seems basic to me, especially in a country where thousands of people are on the run in their own country - as well as for a parliament which should be re-convened this autumn, and for a democratically elected government."
"Some of our motions for resolution also include the requirement that the opposition should take part in the government. This, of course, presupposes an agreement, which has not been concluded since the multi-racial constitution of 1997, which was seemingly approved by everyone at the time but which cannot, however, be applied in practice."
"The European Union is Fiji' s key trading partner and provider of aid."
"How can we translate this role into effective peace mediation?"
"Could we not appoint a genuine mediator or mediating body in consultation with the UN and the Commonwealth?"
"The Kotonu conventions provide for a partnership for development and peace, and the Lomé conventions also provide for procedures, especially Article 366, which has already been referred to."
"These procedures should be applied with due care, intelligence and maturity."
"We invite the Commission to come back before the end of the year to report on the developments in Fiji and the region as a whole and on the efforts which the European Union has made."
"Mr President, the events of the past few months in Fiji are not an isolated incident."
"They are more than the sum-total of a crazed, racist businessman, a disloyal army, the interests of timber merchants, and politicians who accept that the democratically enacted constitution has been invalidated."
"The events have everything to do with the relationship between people and state in general and with the history of Fiji and the composition of its population in particular."
"European colonialism caused workers from other parts of the then British colonial empire to move to Fiji, as a result of which the 44% of people of Indian origin have now started to form a near-majority of the population."
"The original Fijian population has never had a say in the matter but has meanwhile been faced with the reality that the composition of the population has changed beyond recognition."
"Descendants of those newcomers rightly feel that they are a part of the established population of the group of islands, with equal rights, whilst a large section of the original population still struggles to come to terms with this new status quo."
"The situation is in many ways comparable to that in Surinam, Guyana, Trinidad and South Africa."
"Indeed, European colonialism brought peoples of very different origins together in those regions too."
"The peoples involved had nothing in common in terms of language, culture and religion and there are also striking differences in their appearance."
"They very often live as closed groups juxtaposed to one another within the same territory, but largely in separate settlements and urban areas."
"In these countries, there have often been harsh clashes between these peoples."
"Sometimes, part of such a group believes it is superior, but often the clashes are about the ruthless protection of interests and the distribution of goods in short supply among competing groups."
"These competitors need the same land, the same jobs and the same houses, whilst everything is in short supply."
"In South Africa, this situation even led to an atrocious system of inequality and oppression, referred to as apartheid."
"Meanwhile, the people of such countries have come to the conclusion that all people are equal and that they have no choice other than to join forces."
"But this does not take away the fact that closed groups continue to live side by side without real integration."
"Politicians and adventurers who wish to set peoples against each other still have plenty of scope."
"That is the key difference compared with the current states in Europe."
"The latter are generally united with one people, one common history, one language and more or less one culture."
"This is true of old countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal but is also true of relatively new countries such as Poland, Italy, Germany and Romania or of very new ones, including the Czech Republic, Slovenia or Lithuania."
"Precisely because these countries are incontrovertibly linked to the people who live there as a large majority, they can be open to minorities and newcomers and maintain their democracy."
"But in European countries, too, there are unpleasant recollections of former newcomers who came as soldiers, robbers and privileged groups of businessmen and who put the people at a disadvantage."
"Very often, people these days would prefer to see the descendants of these newcomers leave their country or else wish that they had completely adapted."
"From our European perspective, we recognise the right of the Israeli and Palestinian states to exist side by side, as was illustrated once again very clearly this week during the remarkable visit of the presidents of both parliaments."
"It is impossible to live there in peace in one state but people can quite easily co-exist as good neighbours."
"Fair enough, Europe is to blame and should help solve the problems."
"But that does not take away the fact that the situation which has arisen in Fiji is completely unacceptable."
"The equal rights of the large Indian minority, the constitution and parliamentary democracy must be restored."
"Those who use racism to their advantage must be punished and at least be excluded from political power, the refugees must be able to return home, and violence must come to an end."
"The multi-racial constitution of 1997, which came about following a previous coup d' état after lengthy negotiations, must be restored without delay."
"Mr President, I speak as a friend of Fiji, as someone who has followed events there for many years."
"I have friends and acquaintances there and have been there."
"When I spoke to the politicians the last time I was there three or four years ago the one thing they were all pleased about was the new constitution which had taken four years to put together, and when I saw the events of recent times my heart sank because I knew the consequences for that country."
"I should like clarification from you, Commissioner."
"From what you said, I assume you are saying no sanctions, that it is a matter of wait and see and giving them time to sort themselves out before we take any action."
"I would like clarity on that point."
"I do not want to walk away from here just assuming that; it would be helpful if you could be more explicit."
"Mr Ford has called for Fiji to be banned from all sporting events."
"My sport happens to be a minority sport - rugby league football - and in October or November the World Cup will be taking place in the UK and in France."
"Fiji will have a squad there as part of the World Cup."
"The Australian Government wants them banned."
"The Australian Government thinks that Fiji should not take part in this competition."
"If you speak to the players, whether they be Asian, Polynesian or Melanesian, they will say they want to play, of course."
"My specific question to you, Commissioner, is would the Commission advocate sporting bans at this time or not?"
"It may be quite useful for us, as politicians, to be confronted with the question of whether sports and politics should have anything to do with each other or not."
"It is a very useful exercise in analysing the extent of our principles and whether or not there are human activities that should be quite independent."
"Sport today is not only sport, it is also business."
"For that reason the world of sport has created more difficulties for itself than used to be the case in more innocent times."
"As far as I am informed, unlike the line you say they are following with rugby, the Australians, when it comes to participation in the Olympic Games are maintaining a clear distinction between politics and sport."
"We have no specific view in the Commission as to one event or another."
"At this moment we are engaging in the dialogue of the Lomé Convention, so at this stage we have not drawn conclusions."
"In answer to your more general question, there may very well be broad sanctions, but it depends on the outcome of the dialogue."
"This dialogue is well-organised and systematic based on the beauty of our relationship with ACP countries."
"It is not just a donor-recipient relationship."
"We have the background of a system to work from. This system is put to work in the given situation."
"The options are open."
"We have both the stick and the carrot."
"We are actively drawing into this debate the regional ACP partners and giving the authorities in the country in question a say in the discussion."
"But it is an extremely critical situation."
"It contains all the dilemmas that situations like this normally present."
"It is not easy to find out what the right thing to do is but we are doing everything to mobilise pressure for a rapid, irreversible return to democracy."
"This is also the reply to Mrs Maes."
"We do have a very important role as a trading partner and donor in Fiji and this creates a serious framework for the present discussion with the people in power in Fiji."
"As regards coming back to the Parliament, I would say that I am always of course willing to go to the Development Committee and discuss any issue."
"I would certainly like to have an opportunity to go more into detail before the end of the year if this is something the committee would welcome."
"I can fully concur with everything Mr Ford said."
"It is really tragic what is happening."
"Also, as others said, the risk of a negative spillover in the region should also be taken into consideration when we are deciding what our measures should be."
"One important measure that was taken - and this is a comment for Mr Van Hecke - was to call off the signing ceremony planned for Fiji."
"So it is not the Suva Agreement that will govern our future relationship with the ACP states."
"We went to Benin instead of Fiji in the summer and that, in fact, was a strong measure from both the EU side and the ACP side that it was taken as a natural thing that we could not sign the new agreement in Fiji."
"So, in political terms we have already sent a strong message."
"Mr President, in the joint compromise resolution there is a reference to setting a deadline at the end of November for a restoration of democracy."
"Would the Commissioner accept that is a suitable target and a suitable deadline?"
"Otherwise, the danger is the current government in Fiji will go on negotiating forever, but never come to a conclusion."
"If we reflect on the ethics of picking a date, that date is far too late, but the operational, practical idea of fixing a date is to put meaningful pressure on the partner in the discussion."
"I am not sure that particular date is meaningful."
"We have partners in the ACP Group who are part of the process of convincing and putting pressure on Fiji to do the right thing."
"I would not like to dictate a date just like that."
"I prefer to have my partners in the south well on board in the process, also taking into consideration the risk of the negative spill-over in the region."
"I would not be willing to accept a specific date at this stage."
"There is a tactical necessity not to create the problem."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure ."
"The vote on these motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)"
"Tribute"
"I am afraid I have to start today by announcing the passing away yesterday of our fellow member, Mr Günter Lüttge, who died after a serious illness."
"Mr Lüttge became an MEP in 1989 and was mainly involved in transport policy."
"I suggest we observe a minute' s silence in his memory."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, referring to the text adopted yesterday and the issue of human cloning, item 8 in the English version, paragraph 11, reads 'considers that any temporary committee set up by this Parliament ....'."
"It does not actually say that such a temporary committee should be set up."
"Could we have some guidance as to what the presidency will do about this particular section of the resolution?"
"I shall submit this to the Conference of Presidents, Mr Adam, and you will be notified of the outcome."
"Mr President, my name does not seem to be on yesterday's attendance list although I did actually sign in."
"Mr Bowis, that will be duly corrected and amended."
"Mr President, following up the point that Mr Adam made, I presume you will report back at the beginning of the mini-session on the result and, of course, if there is a proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee this House will have to vote on it."
"That will be the course of action, Mr Ford."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"European Year of Lifelong Learning (1996)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0200/2000) by Mr Gutiérrez-Cortines, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission report to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the European Year of Lifelong Learning (1996), submitted pursuant to Article 8 of European Parliament and Council Decision 2493/95/EC [COM(1999) 447 - C5-0205/1999 - 1999/2163(COS)]"
"Mr President, the report on the European Year of Lifelong Learning is seemingly an unimportant document, and yet it has revealed significant gaps and black spots in the European system."
"The report concerns a year of information and promotion in response to the Luxembourg Summit and other summits, at which tremendous importance was given to training as a means of integrating Europeans into working life, irrespective of age."
"The report has shown, first of all, that when money is invested in education, that money is multiplied."
"The Member States keen to participate quadrupled their budgets."
"That is, money invested in education gives the best results as it is multiplied and does not lead to fraud, or anything like that."
"Secondly, the European Year of Lifelong Learning highlighted the Commission's difficulty in providing information and responses and being transparent."
"It was practically impossible to gather all the necessary documentation, partly, it seems, because the Member States do not provide it, and partly because there are no procedures for collecting it with the necessary ease and speed."
"We have therefore turned the report into a response and a series of recommendations on the criteria that we think lifelong learning should meet."
"We found ourselves with a muddle of criteria, partly introduced by the Council, as the document published by the Commission, the proposal for the Year of Lifelong Learning, was of far higher quality."
"It is clear that we need much more clarity over training."
"However, training for integration, language teaching and recreational training for the elderly is mixed up with training for work, resulting in such a muddle that it is impossible to make an assessment or gauge the quality and know what the criteria are for good practice."
"So, we are asking for the educational objectives to be clearly distinguished and regulated."
"Obviously, education for the integration of immigrants is not the same as training for new qualifications, training for a first job or retraining, or many other types."
"We have therefore requested clarity and better organisation of the system as a whole."
"We have also requested greater lifelong learning and retraining for teachers."
"It is clear that, if we consider lifelong learning to be simply for unqualified groups, account will not be taken of retraining university staff and teachers at training centres, who have to be the flagship of knowledge and disseminate information in society."
"Finally, we have asked that it be made quite clear where the money from the Structural Funds for training, which is not monitored, is going."
"From our point of view, this is a key issue."
"What we cannot have is Europe paying so little attention to education and the education funds being used for other purposes."
"One of the great problems of European history stems from the fact that once social classes have fought their way up the social scale and succeeded in integrating into the ruling classes, they have imitated the faults of the aristocracy, they have become conceited and lost sight of the value of training and the fight to retain the knowledge they have acquired."
"So, we are living in an aristocratic Europe, which does not want to concern itself with education, which has become somewhat conceited about being European."
"We consider that it is enough to be a European citizen and we do not realise that if we want to have researchers, if we want to have a truly competitive Europe, we need to take care of our human resources."
"Europe needs to realise that, in spite of the subsidiarity principle, training people and helping them to manage themselves and their future is one of the fundamental objectives of its existence."
"Therefore, a Europe that only takes care of its own interests, a Europe of subsidies, a Europe with teachers who only want to reduce their teaching hours, a Europe that contemplates and confuses trade union policy with educational policy is a worrying Europe."
"I would like to draw attention to this situation, and I believe that we must rethink our attitude towards education, as we are talking about people and our future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the report before us, undoubtedly so that we can make improvements to it, as the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines said."
"I also think, however, that we ought again to use this morning' s discussion to raise awareness once more and to make people aware of education again."
"We are all delighted with the new achievements of our age: travel, the Internet, mobile phones and simultaneous television broadcasts from the other side of the world, as we are now experiencing again with the Olympic Games in Australia."
"These are all achievements, but also signs of the time and of the society in which we live: the information age, the information society, the age of knowledge, technology and globalisation, to mention but a few designations."
"All are characterised by a very rapid pace of change and by an enormous number of transformations, indeed revolutions, which have been triggered, and continue to be triggered, by the new knowledge."
"The dissemination of information and knowledge is now incomparably faster and more extensive than it was even a few years ago."
"People must be prepared for this vertiginous and fascinating roller coaster of change."
"From the earliest days of childhood, from schooldays in fact, the key words have been lifelong learning."
"That tenet is now only half the truth, however, and it cannot remain so, for the processes of change and transformation in society, in the world of work and in the environment are by no means over after school or after training, but continue and become still more marked."
"Human beings must therefore learn to meet these challenges themselves and to adjust to lifelong learning."
"Only in that way can we all, in future, also participate in the fine achievements of our age, that is to say, hold our own in the ever more rapidly changing competitiveness of life - both personal and professional - and both seize and help to create opportunities."
"In order to help these insights come to the fore throughout Europe, 1996 was designated the European Year of Lifelong Learning."
"With relatively modest financial resources of ECU 8.4 million from the European Union, a much welcomed ECU 34 million was raised for the project with the help of partner countries from the European Economic Area: Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Norway."
"In many congresses, seminars and PR events, there was constructive discussion in all areas of society of the necessity and opportunities for rethinking education in the direction of lifelong learning."
"These are opportunities - especially for Europe and European integration - of which we can avail ourselves here and now: knowledge of other languages, other cultures, other ways of life, everything that is so important for us as Europe grows together."
"The European Year of Lifelong Learning set us thinking in a way which must be continued and consolidated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the traditional concept of education was that students would cease learning when they left school."
"It is true that a small elite would continue to create, pass on or acquire new knowledge and ideas, but for the great majority, leaving school meant the end of formal education."
"Things have changed radically."
"Learning has become broader and longer."
"New methods and sources for acquiring knowledge and training have appeared."
"Anyone who does not keep up with this progress, these new requirements, risks becoming marginalised, undervalued in his or her professional life, risks losing social status and suffering intellectual impoverishment."
"It is said, and rightly so, that we are becoming a society of information and knowledge. The great philosopher Nietzsche, however, warned us that it is impossible to found a civilisation on knowledge."
"This warning should give us food for thought."
"Although, today, there is no alternative to scientific progress and to the increase in knowledge and information, the truth of the matter is that lifelong learning cannot be reduced simply to the acquisition of useful skills. It must be part of a culture, of a set of values that provide meaning for mankind' s life in society."
"Lifelong learning and training has therefore become an indispensable factor that states, educational bodies and the public themselves can no longer underestimate."
"Holding the European Year of Lifelong Learning and Training was an important step and a symbolic moment in raising the awareness of the European people with regard to this new state of affairs."
"The theorising that preceded and continued throughout the European Year of Lifelong Learning and the considerable interest it raised in schools and citizens' groups made a major contribution to this."
"'Lifelong learning and training' has definitively entered the vocabulary of politicians, educationalists and businesspeople. Even more importantly, these words have also become part of everyday language."
"Lifelong learning and training has also become an instrument in the fight against academic failure, students giving up on education and illiteracy."
"It is therefore a good cause."
"For these reasons, this initiative was valuable, timely and fruitful."
"Its objectives were achieved and what was lacking in funds was compensated for by the harnessing of goodwill and by the number of people who signed up to it."
"The line between people' s first educational experiences and later opportunities has now been crossed."
"Education..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the Liberal Group' s support for the report by Mrs Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, which, as she herself mentioned in the introduction to her report, is not, and should not be, considered to be purely a formality, a summary of the application of the European Year of Learning in 1996, but rather as an analysis that serves to make a series of proposals on what the standing of education should be in its various fields, including the fields of lifelong learning and vocational and technical training, which deserve special attention."
"This coincides with the ideas expressed a few months ago at the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, when all the Member States pledged to develop a series of measures at European Union level so that, during this decade, the European Union can become a leading society at international level and achieve the levels of competence that North America has today, particularly in technological areas."
"To be precise, the key element in the process to achieve this level of competence lies in training, education and in a society with levels of excellence that lay the necessary foundations for progress to be made in the most technologically developed and advanced fields of scientific and technological innovation."
"The report by Mrs Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, and she has also mentioned this today, shows the imbalances that still exist in the field of education between the level of the European Union and national level, that is, on the one hand we want action in education at European Union level, but on the other, the Member States do not want to give up their competences and establish true cooperation on an educational level."
"It is true that there are some programmes that we always use as references, such as Socrates or Leonardo, but in precisely these programmes, we must recognise the lack of sufficient resources to achieve the scope and effect that we would like."
"Finally, I therefore recommend that you pay particular attention to points 16, 17, 18, 19, 23 and 24, which constitute a good guide for the achievement of these higher levels of education at European Union level."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on her excellent work and also on the commendable way in which she cooperated in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Philosophical and literary texts, as well as popular wisdom, tell us that 'you are never too old to learn' ."
"The 'Lifelong Learning' initiative was a perfectly proper one and the result of a wise decision, aimed at doing justice to the demands of the twenty-first century and at enabling people to adjust to these demands."
"It is mainly the early phases of life which, right into our own time, have been, and remain, the time for education and training."
"The importance of lifelong learning cannot, however, be limited to the spheres of education and training policy alone."
"Its success also depends, in large measure, upon labour-market policy and upon the successful dissemination of science and technology."
"Lifelong learning begins where schooling, or basic education, leaves off, and this is where the first and, in my view, also the greatest weakness of this wonderful initiative is to be found. Lifelong learning can only work if there is a change to the way in which, and above all the pace at which, basic education under the original educational systems is adapted."
"In a knowledge society, one of the main functions of schooling should be to offer students methods they need to gain access to large amounts of information, to understand this information and to transform it into knowledge."
"Syllabuses, or the means by which learning has so far been imparted, must be fundamentally altered."
"I do not of course want to interfere in the nation states, but this is, nonetheless, an idea which we ought to explore communally in this European Community."
"Instead, the direction taken should be an individual one, but with social components."
"We need to learn more about arguing critically, about increasing students' self-confidence and about increasing their ability to express themselves in language."
"Skills of this kind will become ever more important alongside instrumental skills such as the ability to write, to acquire other languages and to do arithmetic."
"One goal must be to enable pupils constantly to update their knowledge and skills so that they are neither able nor willing to view a diploma or certificate as the end of a learning process or as a seal of approval upon something finally completed."
"Our society must break away from the outdated system of school, work and pension."
"Lifelong learning begins, then, with the reform of our schooling."
"The individual must learn for him or herself."
"That is not something it lies within our power to bring about, but we can do a lot to help bring it about, for the population of Europe is not, of course, just a human resource for the European labour market, but a wealth of marvellous individuals."
"Allow me to give a personal example by way of conclusion. I know a joiner in a small suburb of Vienna where the prejudice is still somewhat commonly held that anyone who works with their hands must not be very well educated."
"This joiner is between 40 and 50 years of age, speaks four languages and is known as something of a philosopher."
"A Europe of people like that would be my ideal."
"Mr President, in Finland we ordinary people say: 'All in the good time of the powers-that-be.'"
"We could say the same in connection with this, as the political balance sheet for the Year of Lifelong Learning (1996) is yet to be reckoned."
"In spite of the time wasted, the rapporteur regrets that the qualitative assessment of the implementation of the theme year programme is imperfect."
"The number of opportunities can surely be counted in a shorter space of time than this."
"In a seminar on the European paper industry held here in Strasbourg on Wednesday a representative of employees in the industry turned our intention to an important issue."
"When we purchase hardware, it is always an investment, but when we acquire software labelled 'company staff training' , it is not considered to be an investment."
"The rapporteur has justifiably emphasised this."
"Training has to be considered to be an investment and not a running cost."
"We must stress the importance of the fact that lifelong learning also involves an all-round educational element and not just a professional one."
"Far too often training is too biased in its scope, and that is especially true today of information society development."
"Electronic programs are complicated and get more so all the time."
"Those who master the language of software often do not understand the language of its content."
"Can I ask something that is being asked in Finland now? A man speaks six languages, but what has he got to say?"
"A person might speak the language of computers in the information society, but perhaps he has nothing else to say."
"It is only noughts and ones anyway."
"In this, we are clashing with the eEurope strategy, which the Commission prepared for the Lisbon summit."
"Much attention was paid to hardware in it, but little to that software which we call training software."
"The public must be trained, not only to use computers, but also to use them for their own benefit."
"People must know how to use computers for beneficial and essential purposes so they can improve their own way of working and take better control of their lives."
"Nowadays, everyone must have the necessary reading and writing skills to use the various forms of electronic media to their advantage."
"This new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning."
"When, under the eEurope programme, the aim is in place to bring a computer cable into every home, that will increase democracy."
"These days, democracy is created by everyone having equal access to a diverse array of information."
"For the information to be fully exploited we have to remember that learning is also a social event."
"Training cannot be left to depend on the eEurope programme alone: we also need social communities for it."
"As no one knows everything, an individual must be able to decide for him/herself what is worth knowing."
"If the state makes that decision it is just a step away from propaganda and indoctrination."
"When we examine EU programmes, which are often mean the same kind of thing for everyone or contain demands for conformity on the part of everyone, we see we are turning the EU into a totalitarian federation."
"We need lifelong learning and all-round educational knowledge, so that we can counter the attempt by the European Union to create a European totalitarian state and be its politburo."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just an hour ago I was still sitting with my French teacher, making a big effort to learn some more French."
"I must tell you, it is really fun learning a language."
"It is good when you know that you do not have to take an examination afterwards but are learning for yourself and in order to communicate with other people and treat them in the right way."
"I have to say that I am honestly enjoying learning French"
"(The President asked the speaker whether he might not like to continue his speech in French.) (Laughter)"
"I believe that that is also what we need in the future: for learning to be fun."
"In life, the learning pyramid is, in fact, turning."
"When it comes to learning, we really used to think of young full-time students, whereas now we see that people in employment are having to learn more and more."
"I believe that we, ourselves, in the European Parliament can confirm that we are actually, day by day, doing more in the way of learning, evaluating and passing judgment than ever we had to do at school or university."
"With increasing age, you also become more aware of what it is you would like to learn."
"You become significantly more selective, and it is the very joy of learning that makes you enthusiastic and want to learn new things."
"What we have here, then, is a paradigm shift, not only in the economy, but also in broad strata of society, not only through e-learning and the new opportunities provided by technology, but also through a change in consciousness."
"I believe that this very change in consciousness shows that adults in all walks of life really do consider lifelong learning of this kind to be more and more important."
"I therefore consider it a very good thing that we in the European Parliament should have a good look at long-term strategic issues of this kind."
"Especially on a Friday like today, it is important, I believe, that we should also have the courage to think in terms of long-term strategy about how we might best provide support to the people of Europe."
"Particularly for elderly people, the subject of health becomes increasingly important on into old age."
"We still have a lot to learn about, for example, how to eat properly and how to treat our bodies."
"I believe that precisely these fundamental virtues are very important for the future."
"What do we need now at the level of the European Community?"
"We need a general system of accreditation for private, public and in-house education, a European education passport like a European driving licence so that the building blocks of education can be used and compared throughout Europe."
"We need ways of comparing educational expenditure and revenue throughout Europe, as well as ways of comparing qualifications."
"We should be trying to introduce best practices worldwide as a spur to positive competition."
"We ought to be learning from the whole world which system and which form of education are best for our people and citizens in Europe."
"Mr President, I hope I will not strike too discordant a note, but it seems to me this debate has been excessively self-congratulatory so far."
"When I picked up the agenda and read the phrase 'Year of Lifelong Learning' it seemed to me that this was an oxymoron similar to the phrase 'military intelligence' ."
"A year seems a short time for the project."
"The question is: how valuable are these 'Year of ...' enterprises when applications for funding have to be submitted within three months and everything will have to be carried out in one year."
"I have been at the receiving end of such systems, both as a university teacher and when I was involved in an educational and social charity."
"From the point of view of people trying to do the job, these challenges, at very short notice and with very little explanation of how applications are to be made and what criteria are to be applied, can do at least as much harm as good."
"One can always point to the fact afterwards that the money was spent and other money came in and that good things have been achieved; but could things have been done better?"
"Both the Committee reports - the Committee report and the subsidiary Committee opinion - draw attention to the fact that the assessment methodology used by the Commission was not very exact and the criteria set were not particularly clear."
"This is not to say we should not do these things, but we should do them better and reflect very carefully on what can best be done at Community level and what at lower levels, not even at Member State level or in autonomous regions within the Member States, but right down at the level of schools, colleges and universities."
"My constituency has just come through a serious crisis in its educational assessment, partly due to a lack of proper consultation with classroom teachers."
"Grandiose ideas issued from on high and not adequately and rigorously tested at the sharp end will always fail, sometimes with damaging consequences for individuals and for society."
"Subsidiarity matters, especially in a field like education and lifelong learning, and we forget that at our peril."
"Networking can be useful in disseminating ideas for best practice, but we must not delude ourselves that a Year of Lifelong Learning will make a real difference."
"That can only come from the commitment of the people on the ground."
"Those are the people we must respect and encourage and support."
"We are all in favour of lifelong learning, but let us not be too self-congratulatory when the evidence is so thin."
"Lifelong learning is something we all look upon with the greatest benevolence."
"We can hear that especially from this discussion."
"When it comes to taking action, however, the situation is often the reverse."
"I agree with the rapporteur who criticises the Commission' s efforts on behalf of lifelong learning during 1996, the year of the relevant campaign, together with the slipshod evaluation which followed."
"Lifelong learning is a phenomenon requiring a lot of resources."
"It demands new thinking on educational policy and calls for financial resources to be prioritised."
"Allow me to begin by commenting on the new thinking required."
"In our education systems, we specialise in the contrary, that is to say self-enclosed educational courses, limited by time and with heavy emphasis upon the final examination."
"Lifelong learning requires the opposite, namely continuity and courses of long duration."
"It is no longer enough to educate for the immediate needs of the workplace."
"Now, it is a matter of educating people for life."
"We therefore need new forms of organisation in education."
"We need new educational ideas and tools."
"Perhaps the greatest problem is that which many other speakers have raised, namely access to money."
"We need to allocate much greater resources to education than we have done up until now, both to the workplace and to the public education system, as well as to other areas."
"There must be money to pay for the costs of education and also to replace income in the form of wages, especially in the case of those who need to study full-time."
"It is especially important to be able to finance the fairly long study periods which may be required if people are to be able to move from traditional sectors to new areas of the labour market."
"Because access to money is always a problem, I think that quantitative objectives are required in connection with expenditure on adult education."
"Consideration might be given to earmarking a certain proportion of companies' production costs for this purpose, a specific percentage of the State budget, a particular portion of normal working hours or, if appropriate, a certain number of the individual' s working hours. Alternatively, other similar quantitative measures might be made use of."
"The Swedish Presidency, which will begin on 1 January 2001, has said that lifelong learning will be one of its priorities."
"I think we could call upon the Swedish Government to propose just such quantitative objectives for lifelong adult education."
"Many speakers here in the Chamber have agreed about the need to set financial priorities."
"Perhaps we could issue a joint statement to the Swedish Presidency on this issue."
"Mr President, one of the most pleasant forms of lifelong learning is membership of the European Parliament and, especially, participation in these Friday sittings at which, for once, you have the time to deal with the reports of colleagues from other specialist fields."
"I hope that a majority of this House will also learn and not go ahead and abolish these Friday sittings."
"But now to the subject in hand. Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has submitted an excellent report which is also very critical of the fact that our heads of state and government are constantly making grandiose announcements."
"The Feira Summit was just such an occasion - a pure media event, to use the buzz word. Very little of substance happened, however."
"Little is being provided for in terms of the budget and few resources are available, because it is all about appearances."
"We need to put an end to this kind of spin."
"I am therefore very grateful for the sound report which Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has submitted."
"One thing, of course, she has quite clearly emphasised is the importance of the subsidiarity principle."
"Nonetheless, resources must also be invested at European level."
"Above all, value must be attached to quality in this area, and quality means setting priorities."
"One of our priorities must be to extend precisely this idea of lifelong learning to people in the candidate States for, in Central and Eastern Europe, a totalitarian system has, for decades, robbed people of the opportunity to develop freely."
"It is a great failing of our strategy that we concentrate very heavily upon young people in these countries."
"It is obviously important to do that as well, but the bulk of people are elderly - elderly people who have to overcome decades of dictatorship but who are, today, able to make a fresh start."
"This too is something we need to support by making this area a priority."
"I should also like to say that, in my view, elderly people in particular, who nowadays still have twenty or thirty productive years in front of them after they retire, must be able to play an increased part in our society."
"As a part of this process, there must also be educational opportunities."
"I am sorry that, nowadays, the discussion is about increasingly closing the doors of universities to older people, charging fees and ensuring that older people can no longer take an active part in the life of universities."
"Mr President, Gutiérrez-Cortines' report states that the Union administration' s besetting sin - its slow start to getting measures off the ground - afflicted the theme year of lifelong learning."
"National coordinating bodies suffered from such matters as materials arriving late and there not being enough of them."
"Furthermore, things moved slowly when it came to using the Internet."
"That naturally made it hard to implement the theme year programme."
"Unfortunately, the situation appears to be the same with the Socrates programme 2 that has just started."
"Messages of concern are coming from national agencies that the agreements between them and the Commission are still not finalised and there is a lack of certainty about payment."
"This cannot help but be reflected also in the implementation of the adult education component, Grundvik, which forms part of Socrates."
"That is a pity."
"The administrative problems associated with Socrates have to be resolved swiftly for the Union' s input into lifelong learning to come within reach of the people."
"Training and education are being seen more and more clearly as European resources."
"They do not mean just vital items of expenditure."
"Hopefully the change in attitudes will also be reflected before long in the Union' s budget."
"But the Year of European Languages, organised for next year, will have to persevere in the same way, appropriations being as meagre as they were with the Year of Lifelong Learning."
"Parliament, however, did its best to establish a legal basis in time for the measures to be effected."
"Although training comes under the principle of subsidiarity, its European dimension is strengthening all the time."
"European success in global competition is built on skilled and involved people."
"Lifelong learning is essential in the fight against unemployment and exclusion."
"It is justifiable that the report adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport should contain a request to the Commission to apply the notion of further education, not only at the level of advanced know-how and skills and universities, but also in traditional professions, particularly the craftsmen trades."
"Lifelong learning, as such, is often seen only as a necessary regeneration of the workforce."
"It should, however, be a fundamental right of every citizen, leading not just to improved professional skills, but also to human growth, happiness and understanding."
"The facilities modern technology offers for learning can be brought within everybody' s reach."
"That opportunity must be taken."
"Mr President, paragraph 16 of Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines' excellent report calls for training designed to correct school failures."
"It would be far better if we could avoid that sort of failure."
"The saddest case of all is a school leaver with no qualifications to his credit descending into hopelessness."
"A situation which becomes sadder and sadder as the occupations available to those with no qualifications become scarcer and scarcer."
"The reason is often that the young teenager is discouraged from learning by the rigidities of an education system that sticks to established lines and tries to fit square pegs into round holes."
"I appeal to the Commission to look favourably on a research programme into the use and development of aptitude tests to identify at an early stage - 12 or 13 years old at the latest - what a young person is going to be good at, no matter what that profession, occupation or job may be."
"Schools have to respond by providing courses at which young people will succeed."
"Success encourages further ambition."
"It means satisfied, enthusiastic teenagers instead of discouraged troublemakers."
"It means school-leavers with light in their eyes, with excitement about the future, able to contribute to society."
"It means school-leavers with a passport to a better and more fulfilling life."
"Nothing is more vital to the future of Europe than the young people who are going to build that Europe."
"There is not one young person who cannot play his part."
"We have to enable this sadly wasted potential to be mobilised and to succeed."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I voted for this important document, and its importance has been stressed by all the speakers, particularly by Mrs Echerer who said: 'You are never too old to learn', by Mr Posselt, who is so eager to support the elderly that I could give him a Pensioners' Party membership card, and by Commissioner Barnier himself, who has assured us of his strong commitment in this area."
"However, Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party to the European Parliament, I call for words to be translated into action."
"The elderly in the Member States have no opportunity learn, have no help from national states and are not even allowed to use school buildings, which accommodate children in the morning and could accommodate old people in the afternoon."
"Mr President, my reference to Communist dictatorships has clearly triggered feelings of great agitation in an MEP from the extreme left."
"I should therefore like to say that today' s vote has been very important."
"The people in his party, the PDS, are clearly determined not to learn anything new for the rest of their lives."
"I am therefore very pleased that we have adopted this report by a large majority."
"Mr President, lifelong learning must be a responsibility not only of the European Commission and the European institutions but also, and especially, of the Member States."
"I voted in favour because I believe that tax advantages for professional and private education must be placed centre-stage so that educational sponsorship, in particular, becomes a possibility, too."
"Incentives must be created so that, in order to take some of the pressure off the system, foundations can take over educational establishments and sponsorship can be broadly based."
"I also believe, however, that we ought to set an example at European level."
"Every year, we ought to devise and evaluate training and further education syllabuses for our officials and politicians to enable us to measure how we are meeting our own needs for professional development."
"Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece is in favour of a state lifelong learning system, since it will give workers the chance to improve their knowledge and professional skills as well as their contribution to society as a whole and their standard of living."
"However, the model being promoted by the European Union merely attempts to patch over the shortcomings in an education system which turns out disposable workers who are unable to keep up with developments in the productive process."
"Workers are forced to pass their entire lives in a vicious circle of work, unemployment, training and so on and so forth."
"Despite identifying certain shortcomings in the system, Mr Gutiérrez-Cortines' report fails to go far enough in analysing the causes or suggesting remedies, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
". (FR) I should like to begin by stressing that access to a good level of education and training is the right of every individual in order to develop his potential and ability to fit into the economic, social and cultural environment."
"This fundamental fact has fuelled debates at the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira."
"We further acknowledged that this right must be adapted to cater for the advent of the information society."
"New information and communications technology do indeed have serious repercussions on teaching methodology."
"It is now acknowledged that education and training should be a lifelong process and so, throughout these summit meetings, the Commission and the Member States have been encouraged to define coherent strategies and practical measures in order to make lifelong education and training accessible to all."
"Some parties had, however, begun to consider this subject well before that, since, even in 1996, the Commission proposed to the Council and to Parliament that the year 1996 be declared the 'European Year of Lifelong Learning' ."
"The purpose of this year was to make European citizens aware of new concepts in academic and vocational education and to conduct joint discussions with all the operators involved in the role and the stakes of education and training at the dawn of the twenty-first century."
"Given the high stakes involved, I can only, like our rapporteur, deplore the fact that the budget for the European Year of Lifelong Learning was limited to EUR 8.4 million for the fifteen Member States and their three partners in the EEA."
"By the same token, we must deplore the flagrant lack of qualitative data in the Commission report."
"The Commission should therefore improve the quality of its reports in future."
"In future programmes, their work should concentrate on defining with greater precision the various concepts and aspects of vocational and lifelong training."
"They should also speedily implement action programmes and specific measures in the context of a lifelong education and training strategy."
"The implementation of such measures must be coordinated with the Socrates II and Leonardo programmes."
"It is up to us to ensure that all citizens can benefit from this training in new technologies, as there is a great danger of seeing a 'digital divide' being established between the men and women who have the means to access this technology and those who do not."
"The entire debate on the place of universal public service in new telecommunications networks is also involved."
"Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.10 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 8 September 2000."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"Madam President, sadly, there was another incident of violence in Italy yesterday: a teacher who is Christian by religion but of Jewish origin was attacked and beaten up by a group of skinheads in Verona."
"Incidents of this nature must be condemned immediately by Parliament and others, for it is unthinkable that any hint of anti-Semitism and xenophobia should still be allowed to exist within our Union."
"I therefore feel that, laying aside political differences, this House should send a signal, a message expressing our solidarity, to the teacher who was attacked simply because he is of the Jewish race."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you, and indeed all the Members of Parliament, in advance, for your message of solidarity."
"Thank you, Mr Tajani. We shall consider the best way of passing on this entirely justified protest."
"Madam President, I asked for the floor to raise the same point."
"I would be grateful if you could pass on Parliament' s concerns, its fierce condemnation of this act and its sympathy to the young Catholic teacher who was so brutally attacked because of his Jewish origins."
"I shall be very happy to do that."
"Madam President, I too would like to support Mr Tajani and all the other Members who have spoken on the subject in their condemnation of the racist attack on a Christian teacher of Jewish origin which has taken place in my country, in Verona to be precise."
"These incidents are incomprehensible, and not only must they be condemned but the perpetrators severely punished."
"Madam President, I too would like to support Mr Tajani' s statement, which has been echoed in speeches from a number of different quarters and parties."
"On behalf of the party which I represent, the Alleanza Nazionale, I therefore join you all with the utmost solidarity in severely condemning incidents which make us ashamed to be European."
"I feel that the sensitivity of this Parliament, in which right and left are united on this matter, will contribute to combating such shameful incidents and eradicating them once and for all."
"I would like to raise as a point of order the fact that the Quaestors have made a recommendation that during constituency weeks next year MEPs should be allowed a daily allowance if they are in Brussels."
"I would like to urge you, Madam President and the Bureau members - I understand this is coming on your agenda very soon - to think very carefully before taking this decision because constituency weeks are a very good idea."
"There is a desperate need for MEPs to communicate with the electorate in a much more effective way."
"The fact that we had such a poor turnout in the European elections proves that this is the case and, if we allow people to sign in during constituency weeks, we are undermining the whole point of them."
"We are giving fuel to the Eurosceptics who think that we are pumping up our own expenses and we look like hypocrites at a time when we are asking the Commission to reform."
"Madam President, I urge you and the Bureau members to consider this issue very carefully and turn down the request by the Quaestors."
"I have not yet received this recommendation by the Quaestors."
"That is why it has not yet been placed on our Bureau' s agenda."
"Once I have received it, the Bureau will, of course, examine it very carefully indeed."
"I wish to draw our fellow MEPs' attention to a demonstration which is leaving Brussels today for Paris and to ask them to exercise the utmost vigilance where this is concerned."
"The demonstration has been organised by scientologists and is supposed to be a marathon against the religious intolerance practised in France."
"I think this is an extremely dangerous demonstration, given that France is a country in which the fight against religious cults has had some very significant successes. Europe still needs to be inspired by such successes, informed as they are by the values of secularism and tolerance, by which I mean true tolerance and not that practised by religious cults."
"Thank you for that information and clarification."
"Since the matter has been raised in the public arena, could I place on record the reason for the Quaestors' recommendation?"
"We believe that the term ""constituency weeks"" was an unfortunate one."
"They are weeks without meetings but they are weeks when the Commission, the Council and all other agents of this Parliament, including the political groups, are hard at work."
"If we are going to Nice to ask for more powers for this Parliament it is hardly a good precedent for us to send the whole Parliament off for four weeks, away from the place where they are elected to do their duty."
"Consequently, we believe that those Members - and there are many of them - who are writing reports, chairing committees, running groups and have legitimate reasons to be here should, on declaration of those objectives, be able to come and do their work in the place that they were elected to do it."
"I do not think this is the time and place to enter into a debate on this issue."
"As I said in my reply to Mrs Morgan, as soon as I have officially received the recommendation by the Quaestors, the Bureau will examine it most carefully, together with all its implications."
"Madam President, in a moment, we will be listening to a communication from the Commission on the fuel crisis, and I am pleased that the Commissioner is able to attend."
"We all know that she will not be staying for very long as she is leaving for Luxembourg later on this evening to visit the Transport Council."
"This should not prevent us, however, from entering into an extensive and searching debate on this issue and going over the short hour that was originally scheduled."
"Madam President, I express the view of many MEPs when I say that I regret that we have to deal with this issue in such a short space of time."
"The issue concerned has thrown the whole of Europe into commotion and may well do so for the foreseeable future."
"The time allocated is really far too short and, on behalf of many MEPs, I felt I had to express my dissatisfaction in public."
"Of course. It is a source of regret to me, too."
"Madam President, I would just like to return to the problems associated with the constituency weeks."
"What I find very strange is not so much the payments, but the fact that a constituency week has been scheduled just before spring half-term in certain Member States or just before carnival week in a number of other Member States when people are off work on the Monday and Tuesday."
"In opting for a constituency week at this stage, you ought to have made it coincide with carnival week instead of the week prior to it."
"I would ask the Bureau to reconsider this."
"Madam President, a fellow honourable Member has just drawn attention to an anti-Semitic incident."
"The issue of racism was heavily debated in Germany over the summer, and I would now like to tell you about several extremely disturbing incidents that have taken place there since the last part-session, in order to raise awareness of what is going on."
"Three cases in point: on 2 September, a fifty-year-old waiter of Chinese origin was beaten up and called a 'foreign pig' ."
"On 13 September, a homeless person was found dead."
"Two skinheads have admitted to beating him up."
"He had subsequently died from their kicks and punches."
"Thirdly, on 4 September, right-wing extremists beat up a person whose parents are of Tunisian origin."
"This happened in Kassel."
"I would ask that since we mourn other deaths here, could we not do the same for those whom we never knew, and especially those who were murdered for political, specifically racist, reasons?"
"I would like to raise awareness about this issue in this House, particularly as we had a debate about it in Germany."
"Thank you."
"These incidents are wholly to be regretted and condemned, and they cannot but encourage us to be extremely vigilant."
"Order of business"
"Mr President, you have just said that we will be starting at half past eleven tomorrow."
"That is a most unpleasant surprise because many of us have flights which we can only just make with the earlier voting time, the standard voting time here in the House."
"It is a huge problem, it is immensely difficult to find seats on other flights in the evening or even on the following day."
"I should therefore like to request that we either keep to a standard voting time or, if not, that we be given more notice."
"I should like to request that we keep to a standard voting time, i.e. eleven o' clock."
"An alternative proposition is that we start half an hour earlier at 8.30 and then have the voting time at 11 o' clock."
"Yes, exactly."
"There is no need to vote perhaps, if everyone agrees with this proposal to begin tomorrow at 8.30 a.m. and hold the votes at 11 a.m."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Madam President, you asked if any Members wished to make any comments on the agenda."
"I did in fact want to take this opportunity to tell you that I had no objection to Parliament discussing the racist crimes and offences committed against foreigners by people of European origin."
"If I am to believe the relevant committee in my own country, they amount to approximately thirty per year out of a total of almost four million crimes and offences, including a million committed by foreigners against native Europeans."
"I suggest that the two issues be examined concurrently."
"I think it is really a question of equity."
"Since racism is unfortunately a universal phenomenon, racist crimes and offences committed by foreigners against Europeans ought also to be investigated."
"Yes, I think that would be best."
"Madam President, not only do I think it is important we keep tomorrow' s debate on the fight against racism in the form proposed, but in addition, many of our fellow MEPs are now well aware of the fact that no country in Europe is immune from the increase in the xenophobic and populist vote."
"In the course of tomorrow' s debate, I should like us, on the basis of what many of our fellow MEPs have said today, to be able to agree upon at least one amendment, namely that, within the confines of this Parliament, no MEP may make racist remarks."
"If we succeed in ensuring that, at least in this Parliament, no one can stoop to making racist remarks, then our words and our actions will carry much more weight outside Parliament."
"I think that is the best way to respond to Mr Gollnisch."
"Measures to be taken following the fuel crisis and the rise in oil prices"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the measures to be taken following the oil crisis and the increase in the price of oil."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the whole House after having spoken yesterday for two hours with the Energy Committee."
"Recent times have been marked by the fact that oil prices have been rising for the last 18 months, and the European public is feeling the full effect."
"Clearly, the people who will suffer most as a result of this rise will be the least-favoured social groups and also certain specific sectors which are particularly affected."
"At the beginning of 1999, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at around 10 dollars, whereas today it stands at around 33 to 35 dollars."
"This is the highest level since the Gulf war, and is a level which most experts believed could only happen in cases of geopolitical crisis."
"The reason for this rise is very clear: the restriction on production on the part of the OPEC countries which coincides with a world economic recovery and the resulting increase in demand."
"The impact of this rise has been particularly great in the European Union and especially in the euro zone, owing to the euro' s value against the dollar."
"We cannot ignore the consequences of this rise on Europe' s economic development."
"In specific terms, we estimate that, at the moment, this accounts for 1% of our inflation and a reduction of around 0.3% of our growth."
"Some specific professional sectors - farming, fishing and transport - are in situations which are at times frankly difficult."
"However, both the producing countries and the consumer countries share a common interest, that of stability and the predictability of prices."
"We would all benefit from prices being established in a market of free competition and not, as is happening now, in accordance with a monopolistic situation in a market which to be honest is less than transparent."
"Furthermore, the European Union' s level of dependency currently stands at around 50%."
"However, unless we introduce new measures, we will reach more or less 70% by 2020."
"In the specific case of oil, our dependency on external sources stands at between 85% and 90%."
"This must clearly lead us to a debate on the increase in our energy dependency on external sources and, therefore, on our vulnerability in this respect."
"We must grasp our responsibility and our destiny with both hands."
"Although the European Union' s competence in the field of energy is limited, we must not remain passive in the face of such a situation and allow it to get worse, but rather we must find answers."
"That is why ensuring a sufficient level of independence and, above all, of availability in the European Union' s energy supplies, must be a priority policy and furthermore a policy on a Community scale."
"Little more than a year ago, when I first came into contact with this House as future Commissioner with responsibility for energy, I indicated very clearly that, from the Commission' s point of view, there were two crucial elements which needed to be considered in the coming years."
"On the one hand, the need to strategically promote dialogue on energy policy in international fora, and especially with the large producing and consumer countries, and, on the other, the need to adapt our priorities so that we can better focus our changes in the face of adverse energy situations such as the current one."
"The Commission intends to fulfil these fundamental objectives and has been working on them for several months."
"The Commission has practically finished the preparation of a Green Paper on the security of supply and on the Kyoto commitments, that is to say, the conditions for emissions in the energy sector. This Green Paper will be adopted before the end of the year."
"I hope it will serve as a starting point for a broad debate amongst the interested parties to examine the role and place of each of our energy sources over the next twenty or thirty years."
"Furthermore, we must promote international dialogue in the short term and step up this dialogue with the producing countries in order to convince them of our common interest in price stability - an issue which they themselves have raised - putting forward the objective of a price band."
"At the same time, we have to take account of the geopolitical context in which we are moving, especially of the peace process in the Middle East and the complex political situation in the whole area."
"The European Union must send a clear and forceful message to all the OPEC countries and highlight the need for appropriate measures to be taken in order to fulfil what they have indicated to be their objective, that is to say, for oil prices to return to a reasonable band."
"We must say that we are the main net importer and the second largest consumer of oil in the world."
"The European Union therefore has the means and reasons justifying its voice to be heard but perhaps political means are not sufficient."
"As well as this dialogue with OPEC, however, we must not forget that we need to maintain and strengthen our strategic relations with Russia and we should consider the necessary means to modernise production and distribution conditions in that country which is, let us not forget, the third largest producer of oil in the world and, if we take account of gas, their position is absolutely vital."
"The European Union must maintain a united front and speak with one voice."
"Disparate initiatives by individual Member States will always be incomplete and, what is more, less productive than those on which we stand united."
"As for the fiscal aspect, an issue that has been much discussed in recent times, the Commission understands the concerns of the professional sectors most affected by the sudden increase in oil prices."
"In this respect we encourage the Member States to enter into and maintain social dialogue with all the interested parties in order to find solutions which are suitable and conform to Community law."
"One of the lessons we can learn from the blockades which have paralysed economic activity in various States, is the need to raise the level of coordination between Member States and, of course, with the support of the Commission."
"To this end, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes I will leave this meeting to depart for Luxembourg, where a special Council of Transport Ministers is taking place."
"For both environmental and economic reasons, Member States must not give in to pressure and change their overall medium-term policy on oil."
"A reduction in taxation or subsidies over an extended period would simply amount to a transfer of the fiscal income towards the OPEC countries and would send them an inappropriate message."
"However, the very difficult situation we are in at the moment probably requires, in the short term, the adoption of aid measures by the competent public authorities."
"In fact, there are already some agreements on the table."
"I must point out though that these measures must be purely transitional and in all cases must conform to competition rules and not violate the internal rules of the single market."
"We must seek consensus on the approach to fuel taxation and prevent the kind of cacophony which results from the actions and statements of the different States of the Union."
"For example, what is the point of talking about ecological taxes on a European scale if we cannot quickly harmonise the rates of the special taxes and VAT within the Union?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this context I must say that a reduction in the special taxes in favour of road transport can only be considered as a very short-term measure, lasting no more than a few months. In no event can it be extended, since that would run directly counter to the objectives to promote other types of alternative transport, such as the railways, it would go against our Kyoto objectives and would undoubtedly contradict what have been our guiding principles in European Union transport policy until now."
"The Commission is extremely concerned about the serious attacks on free movement which have taken place recently on various occasions."
"We believe, and I wish to say this once again, that no one social category should be allowed to hold the whole of society to ransom."
"I was talking about aid, however, and I wish to say that we must break up and end anti-competitive practices and these practices are clearly taking place in the fuel sector."
"Why should there be such a considerable difference in the prices - before tax - of oil derivatives as there is at the moment in the European Union, in some cases just across the border in the next country?"
"The Commission intends to continue the contacts established with Member States in order to detect any practices which contravene competition rules."
"Any agreements between companies or abuses of dominant positions must be severely penalised."
"We will also have to examine the question of competition between intermodal sectors in order to find solutions on a European scale."
"But we must not fool ourselves, ladies and gentlemen. We are talking about short-term actions which may alleviate the current crisis, but in no way change the undeniable fact that our economy is vulnerable to energy fluctuations."
"It is true that the economy is less vulnerable than it was 25 years ago, but at the end of the day it is still vulnerable."
"Oil consumption in the European Union stands at 12 million barrels per day and is expected to reach just over 13 million in 2020."
"It is probable that the barrel price, in normal economic circumstances, will not in the long term return to below 20 dollars - and, of course, in no event to what it was 18 months ago, that is to say, 10 dollars."
"We must tackle this dependency and this situation through two fundamental fields of action: diversifying our sources and saving energy."
"The discussion of diversification requires a long-term debate."
"The future Green Paper on supply will contribute to it."
"I wish to state very clearly that, when talking about diversification of energy sources, sustainable energy has a clear and decisive contribution to make for the future, but at the moment we cannot ignore any type of energy."
"The management of demand and energy saving is the other area on which we must focus for the long term."
"With regard to oil, we are today 50% more efficient that 25 years ago, but it must be said that the transport sector still has to make a special effort in this area."
"More than 90% of the increase in oil consumption in the Union from now until 2020 will be absorbed in principle by the transport sector."
"That is why we need a White Paper on transport policy which seeks to readjust modes of transport, to improve the Trans-European Networks, to eliminate points of congestion, to promote the railways, river transport, short haul sea shipping, to promote effective and less polluting urban transport, with the rationalisation of the use of the traditional car and the promotion of innovative research projects into clean fuels, and to improve the awareness and education of drivers."
"Measures must also be adopted for construction and savings in this sector, which is one of the fields that consumes most energy, not to mention the promotion of competition in the gas sector and the emergence of gas as a competitor and alternative to oil."
"In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we will only overcome the current crisis through coherent strategies which are well coordinated and multi-faceted."
"Unfortunately, we do not have access to a panacea to resolve this situation in the short term, but luckily this current crisis has shown us the only way to overcome it: to promote competition in our markets, consolidate our common presence at an international level, coordinate our actions, adapt our priorities to the new energy objectives and act together in the fiscal field."
"In the difficult situation we find ourselves in, the citizens expect us to turn these objectives into tangible realities, thinking not only of the immediate future but also of the medium and long term."
"Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, I would like to thank the Members of the Commission for the position they adopted, which showed realism."
"We must ask ourselves whether it is necessary to get caught up in a crisis before we start to speak about better strategies."
"Nothing would now be easier than calling on all Member States of the Union to substantially decrease taxation on oil products up until the price of a barrel of crude hopefully returns to the 22 - 25 US dollar mark, or thereabouts."
"And it would be just as easy now for the Member States and their Ministers of Finance to declare that taxes should not be touched at all."
"The reason for this is the difficulty of replacing tax revenue in the short term, and the long-term consumption-curbing effect of taxes whereby we aim to have an impact on the future state of our environment."
"However, something has to be done."
"People have had enough, and above all the livelihood of people in certain occupations is directly and badly endangered, as the Commissioner said, to mention just the fishermen, farmers and people who drive for a living."
"In the longer term, fuel prices will bump up inflation still further and threaten the whole EU area with an economic setback."
"The Member States now have to find a common approach in both the short and the long term."
"Measures taken separately by individual countries under pressure from the protests will only make the situation more problematic and will distort competition."
"The responsibility for action clearly lies with national governments."
"Short-term measures will be the hardest."
"Naturally it is essential to have intensive negotiations with the OPEC countries to increase oil production, if that is possible in general, thus easing the situation by ensuring steady supplies."
"It will be difficult to get a quick result, however."
"This means that very precise measures with regard to taxes on diesel and heating oil, for example, within the realms of possibility, will be a good solution, if they are implemented generally."
"The reasons for the crisis can be found, not just in problems with supply, but also possibly in the refinery chain structure, the nature of the fuel market, futures market practices, and storage policies in certain countries and areas."
"It is claimed that the refinery chain is in the hands of so few that a cartel-like situation has developed in the market."
"I myself am not claiming that this is the case, but we need to look into the situation."
"One question is this: is the Union in a position to negotiate strategies for vital stocks of oil both within its own territory and with the United States, as, apparently, the decline in US stocks and now their need for replenishment are pushing up the spot price of oil even further."
"The Commissioner has already mentioned the dilapidated state of production machinery in Russia, a large oil producer."
"Is it not time - the question is obviously mainly directed at Russia, but it is for us to consider also - that we embarked on measures that would persuade people to invest in Russian oil production?"
"In the long term, as the former Saudi Oil Minister, Sheikh Yamani, suggested, the permanently high price of oil will lead to other forms of energy."
"With a glint in his eye, he said that the Stone Age did not end because people ran out of stones."
"What is essential now, however, is the ability on the part of the countries of the Union to react in the short term."
"Is it actually so that a reduction in the relatively same rate of tax on liquid fuel until the middle of next year by national governments throughout the Union is impossible?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President of the Commission, on this issue there is a European problem: we do not have a European policy in this area and the Vice-President has recognised this fact."
"Furthermore, this is a policy which requires much perseverance as well as investment and resources, because the problem, in relation to energy, is that 'we only remember Santa Bárbara when it thunders' , that is to say, in normal conditions, as Mrs de Palacio has pointed out, consumption tends to increase, and in a society where the car is king, this means a trend towards greater dependency."
"In the medium and long term, I believe that the course of action described by the Commissioner, in line with what the Commission had proposed, should be maintained, monitored and strengthened, taking advantage of the development of sustainable energy, reducing dependency on oil, managing, for example, to break up the compartmentalisation of certain national markets and I am thinking, for instance, of the development of the railways as a complement and an alternative to the development of road transport."
"None of this, however, is going to resolve the current situation."
"That is to say, we need a virtuous policy, but at the same time we are now facing a particularly complex situation in that there are a series of professions who are in a very difficult position and which, as forms of Community-scale protests are developing in Europe, has lead to blockades and disorder and disparate reactions from our governments."
"I would like very briefly to point out that, in recent times, thanks to more rigorous budgetary management, there has been talk of lightening the tax burden."
"The people do not therefore understand why this cannot extend to oil products."
"We must be able to understand this reaction and, at the same time, we must explain to our citizens the reasons for our decisions."
"It is true that compensatory measures are required."
"It is very important that we manage to improve the situation of transparency as well as anti-monopoly measures, which are the responsibility of the Commission, because somebody is benefiting: OPEC has increased the price, but does not take more than 5 or 6 dollars per barrel."
"Above all, we must try to see to it that our governments react jointly and that, finally, we create a European energy policy that is in keeping with the common economic and social area."
"Madam President, Commissioner, you made it quite plain: we remain vulnerable."
"It is a scarce commodity."
"We seem to have forgotten that, once upon a time, we paid as little as USD 10 for a barrel of oil."
"We did not ask ourselves the questions which we probably should have asked and which we are asking ourselves today."
"Commissioner, you also mentioned that we have seen prices rise for the past eighteen months. I wonder why the European experts and powers that be did not meet sooner to establish, when prices first started to rise, how things would develop, how this could be prevented from continuing and how we could avoid getting to the point where we are today."
"Commissioner, you also stated that we should respond as a united front but we now see that every country has caught ""the French flu"" ."
"There is a lack of internal coherence, both in the reactions to the protests - protests which I can often understand very well - and in defending the currency, as well as a lack of external coherence in our attitude to OPEC."
"We have to admit that a price of USD 10 per barrel of oil is just as abnormal as one of USD 35 and you are well aware that, while a price of USD 10 may be attractive to ourselves, it is not viable globally."
"These are facts which we all seem to have forgotten for the time being."
"I believe we ought not to do this in future."
"You have listed the main strands in your communication which you published in the first week of September."
"They are sound, and cover transport policy, energy policy and environmental policy."
"I hope that, this evening in Luxembourg, you will manage to persuade people to adopt the same line because we need to emerge from this crisis now. We need to ensure that the next crisis is not as deep and can be held off for longer than we might anticipate."
"At any rate, initiatives should be tabled at European level and a minimum level of cooperation guaranteed in order to help the most needy, as you stated yourself."
"This is why I believe that a cut in the general tax burden, as proposed by my party in Belgium, is to be preferred to a specific tax burden on fuel."
"What we must not do, whatever happens, is to say to people that energy could become cheap, as this would be the wrong message altogether."
"Mr President, we should not wonder at all that we are once again in the midst of a fuel crisis."
"This is the third one, and since 1979 energy policy has been little more than a series of failures."
"A lot has been said about switching to a sustainable energy policy, but precious little has been done about it."
"I welcome the ideas that have been put forward here today by the Commissioner."
"Now transport ministers really do have the opportunity to make a definite U-turn in energy policy in the direction of a sustainable energy economy."
"Road transport has increased from a 50% share of all transport in 1980 to an 85% share in 2000."
"If we were now to reduce fuel taxation generally, this would be very much like lowering the price of heroine on the drugs market."
"The end result would surely be that there would be more drug addicts than before and a greater crisis."
"We should not be making these kinds of mistakes now."
"Nuclear power is not an alternative either in this situation, as only 10% of electricity is produced using oil, and, besides, all the development work going on with regard to new vehicles, for example, is based on the idea that the cars of the future are perhaps more likely to run on hydrogen, but certainly not on nuclear energy."
"Our group has today proposed an integrated programme such as this to serve as the European Union' s new energy policy programme."
"We want to start implementing this also with regard to the budget, and we are proposing a new budget policy called "" New Energy Sources"" ."
"We want to promote energy saving, for example, and better construction technology for homes and buildings."
"We also want the European Union to have powers to manage the new energy policy."
"We require the issue of energy to be included in the Treaty and have its own chapter there, and we want to stress how important it is to rid ourselves of the requirement of unanimity with regard to taxation."
"For almost ten years, we have been trying to establish a common energy tax in the European Union."
"Commission Members have come and gone, but this problem has always remained unsolved."
"In the short term we have to help the direct victims of this oil crisis, but it has to be done with the proper care and focus."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is my impression that this so-called fuel crisis reveals a number of structural problems which the European Union and the fifteen Member States should be dare to examine in every possible aspect."
"The first of these problems concerns our relations with the South, in the event the producer countries."
"Did Europe worry, at the beginning of last year, about the disastrous consequences for the economies and populations of a number of these countries when the price of a barrel of oil fell to less than USD 10?"
"This was hailed as good news when, in fact, the situation was just as worrying as an increase in the price to USD 34."
"We need to establish a genuine long-term partnership between these countries and ourselves."
"And then, all the other root causes of the current situation need to be looked at: cases of speculation, the inadequate stocks in the United States and the fall in the value of the euro."
"The second problem revealed, in my view, by this crisis is the lack of coherence between our strategy choices within the Union."
"The talk nowadays is of giving priority to rail over road transport and going in for piggybacking."
"That is basic, a real social choice and an ecologically responsible act in the strongest sense of the term."
"But for how long has exactly the opposite strategy been adopted, with road transport being pushed hard at the expense of rail?"
"Europe is so little prepared for this development that, today, you still have to change trains between France and Italy because the value of electrical current supply in the two countries are incompatible."
"The third fundamental problem illustrated spectacularly by this crisis is the extreme difficulty many European leaders have in making an accurate assessment of grass-root demands."
"They have not seen, or have not wanted to see, the serious problems which this rise in fuel costs presented for people obliged to use their cars or dependent upon domestic fuel oil."
"Our fellow citizens are not prepared to shoulder the burden of this economic crisis, and they are protesting at the way in which countries have indulged the oil companies, even though the latter have been quite shameless in the profits they have been making."
"More and more pressure is going to be exerted in favour of a reduction in fuel tax and an appropriate levy on oil companies' profits."
"The majority of my group is of the view that the Fifteen ought to take radical environmental measures, effectively promoting rail transport while responding, in the present context, to this legitimate social expectation."
"In so doing, they would also do Europe what I think is a currently much needed service."
"Mr President, the excessive rise in the price of oil is not without its causes, but there is a risk that, because of its own large share of responsibility for these causes, Europe will not take account of them."
"The prime cause is the increase in production prices due to the oligopoly carefully organised by the oil-producing countries."
"The short supply of oil has been exacerbated by the sanctions against Iraq, the unjust and immoral continuation of which may be in the interests of the American oil companies but is contrary to the interests of Europe."
"The second cause is the depreciation of the euro and, therefore, of all the participating European currencies."
"It was valued at USD 1.18 when it was launched."
"It is now valued at only USD 0.85."
"We were promised a strong currency."
"It was a lie, and now we are having to foot a much higher bill."
"The third cause is the excessive, even insane, taxation practised by the Member States, and this proto-socialist policy has been continued, if not actually initiated, by conservative governments."
"It is maintained under pressure from green organisations which are hostile to the motor car because it represents freedom for the individual."
"It is taxation of this kind which multiplies the increase in farm gate prices by a factor of 3, 4 or 5."
"The alignment of our foreign policy with that of the United States, the depreciation of the euro as a currency and the increase in taxation due to pressure from green campaigners are the three causes of the increase, which we deplore but for which our institutions bear a very heavy responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the last fortnight, we have seen a real euro-shambles where transport is concerned, with a petrol shortage, road blockades, mass protests and governments disabled."
"You really would have thought you were back in 1973 after the first oil crisis."
"And that is not counting the plummeting euro and the explosion in the price of a barrel of crude oil, factors not anticipated in the past oracular pronouncements by self-styled experts on Europe."
"Largely predictable though it was, this crisis is as much the responsibility of the oil producers as of government."
"Many varied solutions have been put forward, for the situations and the reasons for them are different from one country to another."
"Many of these solutions are perfectly rational and obvious and, occasionally, ideological such as restrictions on vehicles or the eco-tax but, as you reminded us, none of these is a panacea that will in itself sort out the situation."
"It should be remembered that what chiefly distinguishes the fuel question is its relation to currency and taxation issues and the way it goes on to affect urban and rural planning."
"For, if this crisis affects people in their working lives, it also affects people in their private lives, especially in rural areas where the car is still too often the main means of transport and communication and the one to which people resort."
"It is a situation resulting from the gradual withdrawal of public services which has not been offset by private operators, who are much too concerned with maximising their profits."
"Strategies relating to taxation, the currency and urban and rural planning are matters for each Member State and each Member State alone, in accordance with the sacrosanct principle of subsidiarity."
"To conclude, we want to see lower fuel tax because, at present, it is too much of a burden on the people of Europe, in both their private and working lives."
"However, there are additional strategies open to our Member States."
"The European Union must leave the latter free to exercise their sovereignty in making judicious strategy choices when it comes to energy savings, supplementary forms of renewable energy, the redistribution of freight to the railways and rivers and the development of public transport and the opening up of rural areas."
"Mr President, this is actually the third oil crisis we have had, but it contrasts sharply with the other two."
"They were political crises of man-made origin, and they came about in 1973 and 1979 with the fall of the Shah regime."
"For fifteen years now there have clear indications and studies - for example, Global 2000, the report compiled for Jimmy Carter - to the effect that there would be a real shortage in raw materials by the turn of the century."
"In other words, the third oil crisis we are experiencing now, is here to stay."
"Whether the price drops again in the short term is of no consequence because there will be a steady upward trend in the long term."
"It even says in Colin Campbell' s study - anyone interested in having a copy can get one from me - that there will be a shortage of raw materials, i.e. oil, in the early years of the 21st century, the reason being that the production curve has passed its peak."
"I therefore believe that even demonstrations are onto a loser, because you can only squeeze so much juice from a lemon."
"We will still have oil, but it will not come cheap."
"In other words, the price of oil will rise to between USD 40 and 60 in the future."
"There are enough studies to this effect."
"Even if they should prove to be wrong, now is the time to consider and analyse them."
"Nor is it an OPEC crisis, because only 40% of the oil produced comes from OPEC countries; the remaining 60% comes from non-OPEC countries."
"If this was just a man-made crisis, the other oil producers could redress the balance."
"Mr President, let us put this matter in perspective."
"This is not as much of a crisis as the 1970s."
"It is as much a taxpayer' s crisis as an energy crisis."
"It is not acceptable for governments to put the blame on OPEC, on oil companies, on peaceful protesters, on other political parties, or even on the European Union for protests about levels of taxation that are too high."
"In the UK, tax takes 75% or three-quarters of the price of a litre of petrol or diesel and that is the responsibility of the government, no one else."
"Energy supply is more elastic than demand."
"We learned this in the 1970s, when higher prices brought more oil fields into production yet did not reduce consumption in the transport sector."
"High taxation raises revenue, but fails to cut consumption."
"Nevertheless, the price increases and the tax protests are timely, to remind us both about our dependence in Europe on imported energy and about the difficulties we face in achieving environmental objectives such as CO2 emission reduction."
"If taxation of energy is to be used for pursuing environmental aids, then the policy has to be transparent and consistent so as to carry public opinion with us."
"Where policies are perceived as unfair and inconsistent, as in the UK, then protests will enjoy widespread popular support."
"To put fuel taxes up so much as to make industry uncompetitive while reducing taxes on domestic household energy consumption, is crazy politics and bad economics."
"Let us not be beguiled by arguments about harmonising taxation, because harmonised taxes under socialists have only one way to go and that is up."
"That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want."
"Mr President, the explosion in the prices of oil products illustrates the need to make the euro into a genuinely international currency."
"The Americans, like ourselves, are suffering an explosion in farm gate prices."
"Since barrels of oil are paid for in dollars, the increase has a greater impact upon countries whose currencies have lost ground against the dollar."
"Among these currencies are the euro, the Danish krone, the British pound and a lot of other currencies."
"Mrs de Palacio has just emphasised that Europe is the world' s biggest oil importer."
"Given this status, it is not right that it should continue to pay for its imports in dollars."
"The Socialists are asking the Commission to encourage European oil importers to sign contracts in euros."
"An initiative of that kind has a chance of succeeding."
"Producers know that the dollar will be certain to lose value against the euro."
"For producers, contracts made out in euros could become an insurance against an inevitable economic downturn in the United States."
"A word about monetary policy."
"The ECB has recently justified keeping tight control of its key interest rates by referring to the inflationary pressure created by the increase in oil prices and in rates of exchange."
"According to the ECB, monetary policy cannot remedy this situation in the short term."
"Economic policy cannot offer a solution to the rise in oil prices either, and must, in addition, be subject to a rise in the cost of capital."
"The ECB says that imported inflation is also a form of inflation to be combated."
"I would conclude by saying that the price of oil will be brought down neither by increasing the cost of investments nor by reducing the purchasing power of the people of Europe."
"Rather than soothing inflationary fever, is not the ECB' s treatment in danger of damaging the health of the European economy?"
"Mr President, current petrol and diesel prices strike at the very heart of transport companies and threaten their existence."
"Such prices are unacceptable."
"I believe we must temporarily reduce the various tax burdens to an economically and socially sustainable level."
"Bear in mind that we are not the ones that set the tax rates."
"As a European Union, we have set minimum rates of taxation for motor vehicle and mineral oil."
"It is the Member States that have the room for manoeuvre."
"They have pushed it to the limit, and now we are facing this crisis of high oil prices, they must drop these prices and coordinate them."
"We cannot have a situation where, rightly or wrongly, one government caves in but another does not, and where companies in one country have distortions in competition to contend with that companies from another country do not."
"They get the same prices in the same market but their costs are different."
"This is an intolerable state of affairs for the transport sector."
"Madam Vice-President, I would suggest that you go to Luxembourg and tell the Transport Ministers, firstly that we need concerted action, and secondly, that we need to see a reduction in costs for the transport sector."
"Thirdly, we do not want the Transport Ministers to make empty promises that will be scotched by the Finance Ministers in two weeks' time."
"The decisions reached by the 15 Member States this evening, or in the course of the next few days, must be upheld."
"They must translate into action."
"Some Ministers bemoan the fate of the transport sector, whilst others refuse to reduce or amend taxes. Such two-faced behaviour is unsupportable!"
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, we have been sleepwalking for decades."
"British Conservatives still are but it is time to wake up."
"We have two choices."
"One is a bad choice and that is to adopt a short-term fix and cut taxes, abdicate our government responsibilities."
"We cannot avoid the other choice and the real question which is: How do we use a finite resource when demand is increasing and we have environmental promises?"
"The rational choice is to stop the profligate use of petrol and diesel and to change the behaviour of the public and of those involved in transport."
"Let us lower and enforce speed limits."
"We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products."
"We must adopt alternative fuels - biodiesel, fuel cells, gas and electric cars."
"Let us realign the Fifth Frame Work Programme in its mid-term towards much more research into and development of those alternatives."
"Let us put more money in the budget, change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener."
"We do not need a new budget heading."
"These heading exist."
"Let us put more money in them."
"Let us negotiate - but as the European Union - because stability is in the interests not only of oil - importing countries but also of oil - exporting countries."
"Good luck, Commissioner, when you go to Luxembourg."
"Mr President, yes, Mrs Palacio, you are absolutely right - what we need is dialogue."
"Yes, we must increase the financial support, and yes, we oppose cartels and monopolies."
"That is all quite true."
"But reducing taxation and other things - which, funnily enough, is what certain Members to my left have suggested - is no way to solve the problem."
"That would lead nowhere. OPEC and the oil producing countries will immediately move in to close this gap."
"They have a political and economic hold over us."
"What chance do we stand against this?"
"(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski) Have we reduced our consumption?"
"No."
"Mr Jarzembowski, who has just spoken - he can shout loudly, and so can I as it happens - says that there must be a paradigm shift where traffic is concerned."
"There is more road transport than there was ten years ago."
"It is high time this was changed."
"We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned."
"There needs to be more transport via rail and water - let us make it happen."
"We need to be less dependent."
"Let us pursue a common energy policy, for example."
"You, Mrs Palacio, and we MEPs, should call for a common energy policy to be incorporated into the Treaty."
"We are still lacking such a policy."
"So who is guilty of blocking it to date?"
"For example, what we need to do, Mrs Palacio, is to get rid of the link between gas and oil prices."
"You could do that in tandem with the Commission."
"Why are gas prices linked to oil prices?"
"There is no reason why they should be."
"You are the obvious person to bring this about."
"We can do all of these things."
"There are many things we can do, which the Member States have failed to do so far."
"We can use these opportunities."
"Unfortunately, I am speaking too fast for the interpreter, and I apologise for this."
"Right now, there must be no falling out between groups on the right, and those on the left or in the centre, above or below."
"The OPEC States will watch from the sidelines, smile indulgently, and put the prices up."
"(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)"
"We must show a united front, and the same goes for the Ministers meeting in the Transport Council - and you, Mr Jarzembowski, would do well to shout less loudly and at last get round to doing something in your transport committee."
"Mr President, I would to thank all the Members who have spoken in the debate and point out that there is largely a broad consensus on our approach to this issue."
"Ten dollars per barrel of oil was far too low a price and, furthermore, it had negative effects on our economies, although this seems more complicated to explain."
"On the other hand, 35 dollars is too high a price for us to bear."
"That is why we have to try immediately to persuade OPEC to increase production in order to lower the tension over prices, so that we can really fulfil that ""target band"" and make the markets more stable."
"We should not once again - as the spokesman of the Socialist Group said a moment ago - forget the problem and 'only remember Santa Bárbara when it thunders' , but we should maintain our action over time."
"In the Directorate-General for Energy we have been working since November on the medium-term strategy for energy, and I therefore hope that we will be able to present a quality document in the coming weeks."
"We are seeking a medium-term view, which is combined with a review of the Union' s transport policy because it is a fact that energy is a crucial component in transport."
"Much of our energy is destined for this specific sector in particular."
"This means coordinating the energy policy."
"I would like us to try to communitise this, but, in the mean time, we must coordinate the energy policy of the Member States."
"It is also necessary to continue making progress on transport policies and we must avoid, as a result of a crisis such as this, suddenly changing our transport policy and energy policy which has been established over recent years."
"We must be coherent."
"We must not therefore use the method of lowering taxes as a solution to this circumstantial rise in oil prices."
"Perhaps, in a very limited way, some countries may resort to that method, above all because there may be an exception in the directive on hydrocarbons."
"We could probably consider certain proposals such as postponing the ecotax, but what we cannot do is propose one thing and then its complete opposite."
"I repeat that we must have a minimum degree of internal coherence in our policies."
"Energy and transport policies are medium- and long-term policies, which cannot be modified under pressure from very specific circumstances, which I am sure are going to change within a year and a half or two years although, no doubt, we will not return to prices of 10 dollars per barrel. However, they are going to change simply for market reasons, even if OPEC does nothing."
"Nevertheless, these long-term measures cannot absolve us of our current responsibilities, responsibilities, which we all share, which range from safeguarding the freedom of movement to complying with Community rules."
"But it is also the responsibility of the governments to take measures to alleviate the difficulties and provide solutions for the sectors that are most affected."
"We are talking specifically of the transport sector and now, in the Council of Transport Ministers, I hope we will reach some agreements."
"There are also problems in the fishing and agricultural sectors, without forgetting that there is another whole series of sectors affected by these difficulties."
"We must work on issues such as energy saving, renewable energies, research into biofuels and the use of biomass."
"Before the end of the year we will produce a regulation on buildings which this House can deal with."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must now leave you because I am running a little late for the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"So you keep a few Ministers waiting - it could be worse!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Secretariat for joint supervisory data protection bodies"
"The next item is the report (A5-0225/2000) on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision [7381/2000 - C5-0230/2000 - 2000/0804(CNS)] establishing a Secretariat for the Joint Supervisory Data Protection Bodies set up by the Convention on the Establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention), the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders (Schengen Convention)."
"Mr President, I have no doubt that in the age of new communications technologies, in the age of the Internet, which is well under way at the beginning of this new century, we legislators are faced with a very exciting challenge: to protect people from intrusion and from attacks on their private life, their dignity or their reputation."
"The protection of these rights is recognised in numerous legislative texts of a universal nature, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of a transnational nature, such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties, or of a national nature, such as the constitutions of the Member States, but the legislative diversity in this area requires that efforts be made in terms of the harmonisation and unification of criteria."
"The majority of countries are beginning a legislative process to prevent violations of people' s fundamental rights, such as the right to private life, and this right is also expressly included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We are therefore facing a legislative challenge of unquestionable importance, which must regulate to ensure that this right is respected and the exceptions which, in a democratic society, it is necessary to establish in order, as the Convention of the Protection of Human Rights says, to safeguard public security, defend public order and prevent crime."
"The report which I am presenting to Parliament aims to analyse one of the many aspects involved in this legislative task: the creation of a single secretariat for the three supervisory bodies for the protection of data from Europol, Schengen and customs information, within the framework of the third pillar and in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters enshrined in Chapter VI of the Treaty."
"The Council' s proposal for a decision is correct but is, in my view, timid and does not go far enough."
"In this delicate field of data protection we must achieve two fundamental objectives: transparency in the future functioning of the secretariat and the independence of its work."
"I do not believe that either objective is fully guaranteed in the Council' s proposal, hence the content of the amendments I am proposing, which have been accepted practically unanimously in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights. Justice and Home Affairs."
"I wonder whether it is a positive thing, in terms of transparency, to have three joint data protection bodies within the third pillar?"
"I believe not."
"I therefore believe that the final objective should be the establishment of a single body corresponding to a single legal framework within the European Union and that that body be provided with its own budget and staff, even exceeding the normal distribution between pillars, taking advantage of the option provided for in Article 42 of the Treaty of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament is currently examining and debating the consequences for personal and economic relations in the European Union of the discovery of a possible spying network known as the Echelon system, and is also studying a regulation on the protection of physical persons in the processing of data by the institutions of the Community."
"We are furthermore now examining this proposal for the third pillar."
"As we will see, these are different aspects of the same problem."
"I therefore believe that this Parliament must go further than the Council' s decision, which, as I have said, falls short on aspects such as the election and appointment of the secretariat, its dismissal or the guarantee of professional secrecy in its functioning."
"Independence is another basic element which is not sufficiently guaranteed in the Council' s proposal."
"Parliament is the institution which must guarantee its independence, by means of the democratic control which legitimately corresponds to it."
"That is why in the future the body should be appointed by Parliament and the secretariat of the three bodies would enjoy more independence if the costs of staffing and the resources needed for its funding were to be included in section 8B of the general European Union budget, as I propose, and not in the Council' s budget."
"Let us not fool ourselves, financial independence is essential to guaranteeing functional independence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are legislating in a field which is fundamental to the future of our interpersonal, economic and commercial relations."
"Our challenge is to create a balance and compatibility between the right to privacy and the right of free access to information."
"The introduction of new technologies, computers and telecommunications has broken down barriers and transcended borders."
"There has been a genuine revolution in commercial, social and personal relations which have a real effect on the daily lives of citizens: health, advertising, banking transactions, or even aspects which relate to the security and defence of citizens, and of States themselves, can be jeopardised if there are no rules to guarantee the correct transmission and storage of the data which today circulate with total freedom and which are not immune to the serious danger of indiscriminate use."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Hernández Mollar on the excellent report he has presented to us, which the Group of the European People's Party endorses and which gained the almost unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"This is a small step forward, but one which signals the beginnings of a strategy for harmonisation which, we hope, will be enacted under the third pillar."
"We are thus beginning to move towards harmonisation, with the creation of a joint secretariat for the various supervisory bodies."
"We hope that a set of common regulations for supervision and for a single supervisory body can be adopted in the medium term."
"This is crucial if we are to guarantee that the public' s fundamental right to privacy is respected, safeguarding the legal principle of fair and equal treatment for all citizens. Laws must be applied and interpreted according to the same criteria, providing the same level of data protection."
"In fact, there is no justification for the existence of three separate joint supervisory bodies."
"Today, in addition to national supervisory bodies, there are also these three joint supervisory bodies, each with its own secretariat."
"The question is: can this system really guarantee effective protection?"
"I do not think it can."
"These bodies therefore need to be merged into one single entity as soon as possible, with legal personality and its own budget, which will ensure that it is impartial and independent from the other institutions, as Mr Hernández Mollar has just said, and he is quite right."
"This is a matter of protecting the interests and rights of our citizens."
"There is also a vital need to create a single legal framework in the European Union to provide citizens with sufficient guarantees, essentially by preventing the improper use or dissemination of personal data and by remedying the shortcomings in the current system of protection."
"The constitutions in force in the various Member States recognise the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Union' s draft Charter of Fundamental Rights also expressly upholds every citizen' s right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her."
"The very fact that different laws exist in each country, however, raises various problems that can be overcome by adopting minimum standards which will make it possible to harmonise these national laws, thereby guaranteeing that citizens' fundamental rights are respected, and specifically the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression and of information."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increasingly complex nature of society and of economic life, backed up by ever more powerful technology, is creating new situations which threaten the individual rights of our citizens and leave them unprotected. This requires us to establish appropriate mechanisms for protecting our citizens from potential abuses of these rights."
"The current system, which is designed to protect people' s privacy and which guarantees all citizens' inalienable right to privacy with regard to the computerised processing of their personal data, is widely considered to be inefficient. This is because in addition to national data protection supervisory bodies there are still three joint supervisory bodies in the European Union, each with its own secretariat."
"In order to combat this duplication of supervisory bodies, which leads to inefficiency, the Portuguese have drawn up an initiative for a proposal with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision to create a single secretariat for the three joint data protection supervisory bodies."
"In the current circumstances, it is generally accepted that this is a viable solution which would reduce the problems caused by the existence of three data protection supervisory bodies within the Union."
"The rapporteur' s suggestion that a single data protection supervisory body should be created, with a single secretariat, with legal personality and its own budget is also to be welcomed."
"This would create ideal conditions for achieving our stated aims of protecting our citizens' private life and individual freedoms, without, on the other hand, impeding the free flow of information, which is the hallmark of modern societies."
"The rapporteur recognises that it is not feasible to set up this single body in the European Union in the short term, and refers in his report to establishing it in the medium term, under the third pillar."
"Whilst I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, I should also like to draw your attention to the risk of postponing the creation of this authority for years and years."
"It might have been wiser for the report to have set a fixed and reasonable deadline for this body to be established, which would give more force to the proposal put forward by the rapporteur and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, rapporteur, I welcome any initiative that aims to improve data protection for the people of the European Union."
"However, there are serious problems with the EUROPOL and Schengen Conventions, and as regards customs cooperation."
"One of these is the inadequate level of protection for data collated and processed in the institutions."
"As far as I am concerned, it goes without saying that the proposed secretariat must be independent of the institutions requiring monitoring, as is borne out by the fact that it has its own budget."
"Yet still I cannot vote in favour of Mr Hernández Mollar' s report."
"I ask myself this: why should bringing all those who have been responsible for data protection hitherto, together in one secretariat headed by one General Secretary, lead to improvements in data protection merely because it is certain to lead to savings in this sphere?"
"Bringing these officials together under one roof will not guarantee better data protection."
"Taking an overall political view, I see Portugal' s initiative, together with the report, as being one more step along the way towards improving coordination between Schengen and EUROPOL."
"When it comes to the problems associated with the aforesaid conventions, inadequate data protection is the least of our worries."
"Both EUROPOL and Schengen will add hugely to the construction of fortress Europe."
"Fundamental human rights such as the right to freedom of movement, the right to asylum, or in many cases, even the simple right to human dignity, will be compromised, and these institutions will support and control this."
"Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of an initiative that may bring about a mild improvement, when it will also help legitimise these institutions as a result."
"Since I am basically critical of EUROPOL, and Schengen in general, and I believe that having one General Secretary instead of three does not equal better data protection, I intend to abstain."
"Mr President, this report deals with issues which are of very great importance to personal privacy and data protection."
"Within the EU, extensive registers of personal data are now being compiled in which very sensitive personal information is stored."
"At the same time, it is obvious that these registers are inadequately supervised and insufficiently secure."
"Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left are obviously keen to improve data protection and supervision."
"We therefore support the idea of introducing a single independent supervisory authority with proper powers and resources."
"To that extent, we are in favour of the basic ideas in this report but we wish, however, to point out that it is important to construct this supervisory authority on the basis of the skills possessed by the Member States in this area."
"A new supervisory authority must be able to cover all the relevant registers, including the Eurodac register which has a major role to play in the EU' s asylum policy."
"Refugees are an especially vulnerable group, and information contained on a register can be a direct reason for deporting people and so have serious consequences for an asylum seeker."
"It is therefore especially important to be able to see to it that the register contains accurate information, that the asylum seeker is provided with information about his or her rights and that there are opportunities for appeal."
"Moreover, the Sirene organisation established under the Schengen agreement must be covered by a new supervisory authority."
"By and large, the relatively little known Sirene can send any personal data at all between Member States at short notice, as well as combine data relating to ordinary police matters with that concerning state security and policy on refugees."
"The whole of the Sirene organisation suffers from a palpable lack of public and parliamentary control."
"We already have significant experience in this area when it comes to dealing with the Schengen agreement' s large register of personal data, SIS."
"That experience is unfortunately very disheartening."
"The Joint Supervisory Authority, or JSA, has had quite inadequate resources."
"Moreover, it has been denied access to important information in SIS."
"This may be seen from the JSA' s first annual reports."
"In spite of the difficult working conditions, the JSA reveals serious deficiencies in SIS, for example incorrect information on file, instances of Member States' illegally copying information and inadequate procedures for gaining access to registers."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"In order to obtain effective data protection, more than effective supervision is required."
"More basic changes are needed when it comes to the rules governing the registers."
"One requirement is that registers of criminals be distinguished from registers of refugees and registers kept to protect state security."
"These different areas must not be covered by joint organisations and registers."
"Public and parliamentary control must be reinforced, especially when it comes to Sirene and Schengen."
"Moreover, clear limits must be set for what may be recorded in Europol' s investigation register, founded upon Article 10.1 of the Europol Convention."
"At present, the scope of the register goes far beyond what is necessary."
"People who are not suspected of crimes may be registered, and sensitive personal data about political views, religious affiliation and sexual orientation may be recorded."
"That is unreasonable."
"A central place must be given to personal privacy and legal rights."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Hernández Mollar, for his valuable work in drafting this report."
"In matters of data protection we have to make the difficult compromise between the protection of privacy, the safety of our citizens, and the stability of the Single Market."
"A basic pre-condition of a market in a Europe with no internal borders is that information flows unhindered and fast."
"As the visible supervision of the movement of goods and services has come to an end, the importance of so-called invisible supervision has grown year after year."
"The rapid exchange of information between official bodies is the only chance we have of preventing criminal exploitation of the benefits of this free movement."
"The level of data protection in today' s bit streams is still not adequate in the European Union."
"The fundamental human right of confidentiality as far as mail is concerned is being jeopardised, for example through criminal activity and inquiries carried out using email systems."
"The rapid growth in ecommerce in particular is posing new threats to the protection of data concerning our citizens."
"For example, the theft of credit card information and the abuse of personal ID are growing dramatically in the information networks."
"In addition, databases established for purposes of marketing, which contain details of people' s way of life and consumer habits, are often in conflict with basic rights which are there to protect privacy."
"It is reasonable to suppose that the work of the various data protection bodies working now in the EU area can be made more effective through centralisation."
"The founding of a joint body with respect to the work of Europol, customs control and the ordinary fundamental rights of EU citizens is an excellent idea."
"At the same time, however, we must ensure that there are adequate resources available."
"The workload is increasing at a ferocious rate."
"And one must clarify ways of making data protection cooperation more effective between the Secretariat to be created and the national authorities."
"The independence of data protection bodies is the key to success here."
"Supervision always leads to difficult interpretations of a situation, the outcome of which many players may well wish to influence, owing to purely financial interests."
"Because of this, the bodies will have to work in close cooperation with the EU and national courts of justice."
"The European Parliament must monitor closely the work and accountability of the official Secretariat to be set up from a position of impartiality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentleman, first of all, the Commission wishes to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar, for the excellent report that he has presented and acknowledge that our participation in this debate has been made easier by the fact that we broadly agree with and support the approach he has proposed."
"The Commission is pleased with the initiative that has been taken by the Portuguese Government, as we feel that it will contribute to our efforts to rationalise, in a sensible way, the administrative support provided to the bodies responsible for supervising and guaranteeing data protection established by the Europol Convention, the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement."
"The Commission shares the rapporteur' s view that a single supervisory body needs to be created for these three instruments, because a single supervisory body would ensure that the principles of data protection are applied more coherently, both under the Schengen Convention and the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes. The creation of a single supervisory body would also prevent an undesirable duplication of work."
"Similarly, the Commission agrees with the idea that a range of common essential principles on data protection needs to be established and can be implemented as uniformly as possible throughout the third pillar."
"It is true that there are currently shortcomings in the Community legal framework in this area."
"We are pleased that a specialist Council Group has initiated the debate on these common general principles and also that the French Presidency has already made it clear that this issue is one of its priorities."
"We must recognise that this is not an easy task, not only because of the sophistication of the technology, but also because it is particularly important for us to find a solution that strikes a balance between safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms on the one hand and on the other, having the instruments needed to ensure that the democratic rule of law is respected and that we can effectively fight transnational and organised crime."
"I feel sure that our first task must be to define these common principles, which can then be translated into the various legislative instruments that we will need to adopt in the coming years under the third pillar."
"This approach also involves - as various speakers have already pointed out - introducing, either under the Europol Convention or under new laws based on the Schengen Convention, clear and transparent principles of democratic and judicial supervision, which will guarantee the fundamental values on which a Union governed by the rule of law must be based."
"Perhaps the most difficult issue that this report raises is the problem of deciding whether a separate budget heading should be created for the joint secretariat."
"The Commission agrees with the rapporteur' s assertion that it is extremely important to guarantee the independence of this secretariat in relation to the Council itself."
"The idea that we are therefore advocating, even if this issue can potentially only be resolved in the long term, is to create a separate budget heading."
"Nevertheless, we understand that for the moment, the Council' s prime concern is that the creation of a new budget heading could cause delays in setting up a joint secretariat."
"So in practical terms the Commission understands the Council' s desire to use existing financial structures, but only as a provisional measure."
"In the event that the Council decides to uphold its position, the Commission will back Mr Hernández Mollar' s proposal, which is to reiterate the recitals put forward by the rapporteur so as to make it quite clear that these are merely provisional financial arrangements pending the creation of a single supervisory body responsible for data protection under the three conventions."
"To conclude, I am delighted that this report and its underlying principles have received such widespread support in the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Eurodac"
"The next item is the report (A5-0219/2000) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of finger prints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (renewed consultation) [8417/2000 - C5-0256/2000 - 1999/0116(CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we are able to celebrate a ten-year anniversary almost exactly to the day."
"Almost exactly ten years ago to the day, we started discussing which country should in fact be responsible for processing asylum applications."
"Then the Dublin Convention came into force."
"Yet, to this day, we have failed to make Dublin truly enforceable, in other words, we have been unable to establish a suitable instrument of control."
"We have been discussing the fact that we need an instrument of this kind, for years, but so far to no avail, and tomorrow we will have our one and only chance to actually complete Eurodac."
"I would be delighted if we could."
"A great many Council Presidents, who have held office in the intervening period, would be delighted too, and everyone has promised that they will make it an absolute priority to try and make Eurodac a reality."
"This has been a long, drawn-out business, and it concerns an important issue."
"Why do we need Eurodac and what can it do?"
"Eurodac is a system that will enable us to compare fingerprints and ascertain in an appropriate manner, which country was the first point of contact for the refugee, and, as such, which country is responsible for processing the asylum application. This will also allow for a distribution of the burden amongst the Member States."
"And, of course, it is also an instrument that will be used to establish if an applicant has submitted asylum applications before."
"In other words, it is also an instrument for fighting abuse and illegal activity. It is an instrument that we both want, and need, to have at all costs."
"As I said, it has been a long, drawn-out business and the last time we discussed it in Parliament was December 1999."
"The vast majority of us were agreed, firstly on the fact that we must get Eurodac up and running, and secondly, on the conditions under which it should be implemented."
"Above all, we have seen eye to eye with Commissioner Vitorino throughout, and I would like to thank him, because he has moved heaven and earth to enable Eurodac to at last become a reality."
"Parliament established that the implementing powers would be conferred on the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the EC Treaty."
"However, immediately after we had taken this decision, the Council met in December and, for reasons which we do not understand at all, shelved these joint proposals from Parliament and the Commission, and reserved the most important implementing powers for itself."
"Consequently, because there had been a substantial amendment, this required reconsultation of Parliament, i.e. we have had to review the situation, albeit only in respect of the relevant points, i.e. Articles 22 and 23 alone."
"We confined ourselves to these areas in committee, with the exception of Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, who sparked off a new discussion."
"I do not know what she was hoping to achieve in this way."
"The object of the exercise was simply to deal with Articles 22 and 23."
"The new proposal relating to these articles accommodates the Council' s wish to retain sole responsibility for the most important implementing powers, i.e. those regarding the collection, transmission and comparison of fingerprints, those for the blocking of the data concerning applicants for asylum, and those for drawing up statistics on asylum applicants."
"There was unanimous agreement in committee that we should stand by our original proposal and reject that of the Council."
"Why?"
"For two quite crucial reasons."
"Firstly, the Council' s move is contrary to Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which establishes the principle that the implementation of the rules which the Council lays down shall be conferred on the Commission."
"This is particularly important in this case."
"The Commission could take a far more impartial - i.e. it would be less likely to accommodate specific national interests - and objective line when it comes to implementing this regulation."
"Therefore we as a Parliament support this."
"There is also a second reason as to why we oppose the Council' s proposal."
"It works against Parliament because it excludes us, because there is no longer a comitology procedure, and because we will no longer have access or entitlement to the information we need."
"This proposal would whittle away Parliament' s rights."
"For these two highly convincing reasons, we are in favour of the proposal submitted by the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino, to the effect that implementing powers should be bestowed on the Commission, and I would urge you all to attend tomorrow' s vote."
"This will be our opportunity to make Europe a safer place, and to take action against abuse."
"Let us seize this opportunity and use this chance to at last make Eurodac a reality."
"I should very much like to support what Mr Pirker has just said."
"As a past Minister for Immigration and Asylum in the United Kingdom, I am well aware that the confusion with regard to determining which country should deal with any particular application has been an immense problem and one that has created a considerable level of friction between Members of the European Union."
"Unless it is tackled urgently, it will continue to be an area of friction as we look at the enlargement process."
"The Dublin Convention in itself has always been important but it is the flaws in the Dublin Convention and our failure to administer the Dublin Convention properly, which has caused issues to arise which could even threaten the human rights of some of the applicants and individuals concerned."
"All the countries that are signatories to the United Nations Convention of 1951 are well aware of the criteria for determining whether someone should be granted the extremely valuable and significant status of a refugee and I hope that nothing we ever do here would affect the right to make an application within those criteria."
"However - with new technology, with new travelling arrangements, and indeed with people who want to abuse the system using that technology - it has become more and more difficult for the authorities to treat people in an appropriate and fair manner in handling their cases."
"Eurodac has to run hand in hand with the reform of the Dublin Convention and I am somewhat concerned at the attitude that the Council has adopted in the past."
"Mr Pirker has spoken of the delays that have occurred and the numerous times that this vital issue has been reconsidered."
"My feelings are clear: if the Council wishes to reserve powers to itself when the information from Eurodac should be available to this democratic body, Parliament, then that is unacceptable."
"That is all the more reason why we need to treat this matter with urgency, why we need to resolve it, and why Parliament should continue to play a strong role in the future in the superintendence and monitoring of vital issues relating to the granting refugee status to those who might apply."
"I fully support Mr Pirker and I hope we make strong moves now to conclude this matter in the interests of everybody."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, has said, this Parliament has already expressed its opinion more than once on the proposed Eurodac Agreement."
"Last time it expressed its opinion on the proposal as a whole and I believe that the position Parliament adopted was very close to what the Socialist Group wanted."
"I wish to defend Parliament' s position, which this House voted for a few months ago in relation to the Eurodac Agreement."
"I therefore believe that we are now being consulted on an amendment which the Council is introducing in this communication, and that it affects the allocation of competences for this action by the Council."
"The Treaty established that the Commission must have responsibility for implementation - for Eurodac also, we believe - and also established that Parliament can supervise what the Commission does."
"This still does not seem sufficient to us, and we hope that, at least in the legislative and supervisory field, we can have further competences."
"For this reason, my Group is tomorrow going to abstain in the vote on all the amendments which do not relate to this change to the Council' s communication."
"We are going to abstain on those amendments which we feel have already been approved by Parliament and which are already included in this Parliament' s previous report."
"We are going to abstain for reasons which I imagine are very different from Mr Pirker' s reasons for voting against it, but we are going to abstain in order to maintain the position which Parliament has already expressed."
"However, on behalf of my group, I would like to express my support for the amendments proposed by Mr Pirker, for the reasons which I have already expressed, because I believe that the previous proposal was better and because I believe that the Commission must take this project forward."
"I hope that it does so taking account of Parliament' s decision and it is important that tomorrow' s vote shows Parliament' s strong support for the previous proposal."
"Mr President, we are developing a third pillar on the basis of policies which have been intergovernmental and which must become Community policies."
"I believe it is very important for Parliament to support these first actions we are taking and also to support the Commission so that it can play the role accorded it by the Treaty."
"The ELDR Group fully supports Mr Pirker in his insistence that Article 202 of the Treaty should be followed in its general rule that implementation powers for this regulation should be conferred on the Commission."
"He is absolutely right to argue that the Commission is in a stronger position to take an impartial view which does not bend to accommodate specific national interests and therefore it is arguably more capable of drawing up adequate data-protection safeguards."
"Secondly, although Parliament may have its arguments with the Commission from time to time, we do have a much better chance of exercising democratic supervision if the Commission has the implementing powers than if the Council has them."
"This is because the regulatory committee procedure, coupled with the interinstitutional agreement, entitles Parliament to receive draft implementing measures."
"And when - rather than if - we achieve codecision in this area, this will enable Parliament to require the Commission to re-examine the measures if the implementing measures are exceeded."
"We would be foolish, as a Parliament, to rely on the Council' s goodwill rather than on rights which we possess if the Commission has the implementing powers."
"That is why my group will abstain on some of the amendments of substance which would alter the substantive details of the Eurodac regulation."
"My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state loudly and in unison that our interests lie in backing the Commission."
"That is the only issue that we ought to concentrate on now and, perhaps with some slight regret, we feel that Parliament' s position needs to be slimmed down to Mr Pirker' s points on comitology."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now facing a fairly unusual procedure which deserves a detailed explanation so that everyone can vote in the full knowledge of what is explicitly and implicitly at stake in this matter."
"Last November, the majority of the European Parliament adopted a report on the creation of the Eurodac system."
"Following this vote, the Council modified its proposal for a regulation, stating that the Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints should be established and administered by the Council rather than the Commission."
"This important change is the reason why this report is being re-examined by this Chamber."
"In the opinion of our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, it was the Commission rather than the Council that should be given responsibility for administering this new facility, Eurodac."
"Indeed, the Commission quite rightly emphasised that, as the only Community institution of the Union, it ought to have responsibility for administering a Community programme like Eurodac, and not in any circumstances the Council, which is an intergovernmental body."
"We wholly support the Commission on this."
"However, the new proposal being examined today has not taken any account whatsoever of the amendments Parliament has voted in favour of."
"Whether it be about specifying 18 years as the minimum age at which an applicant for asylum can be registered on the Eurodac database, about erasing personal data once legally recognised status has been acquired or about substituting the expression 'third-country national' for 'alien' , the Council has not seen fit to take account of Parliament' s opinion and has been supported in this by the Commission, which has also declined to take account of it."
"It is in view of this situation that I am today asking you again to uphold the vote which Parliament wisely held last year."
"This means voting on the text adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which includes the amendments relating to the lower age limit of 18 years, the erasing of personal data in the case of any applicant who has achieved legal status and the use of the expression 'third-country national' rather than 'alien' ."
"The amendments to the report proposed by the Group of the European People' s Party, to which the rapporteur belongs, should therefore be rejected."
"I really find it difficult to understand how anyone can remain silent and avoid taking sides and consider taking fingerprints from 14-year-old adolescents to be a legitimate action, when it is something which contravenes all the international treaties in force, particularly those on the rights of the child."
"When it comes to erasing personal data, it is just a question of being sensible."
"Once the applicant concerned has obtained legal status, there is in fact no justification for retaining the personal data and fingerprints of someone whose situation has been regularised in law."
"That would be to view him as a potential criminal."
"It is not solely in the future Charter that the protection of fundamental rights, close to our hearts as it is, becomes an issue, but also in every European text, where we must be vigilant in their defence."
"What is at stake is Parliament' s credibility in the eyes of those who already have a lot of difficulty putting their trust in us."
"The people of Europe find it incomprehensible, and surprising to say the least, that the European Parliament should one day come out in favour of a report only, a few months later, to go back on its decision and vote in favour of a radically different report."
"How can our electorate have confidence in a Parliament which changes its views according to the way the wind blows and which is incapable of facing up to the Commission and the Council which do not, for all that, have the democratic legitimacy with which we have as an institution."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would today ask you to vote in such a way as to reaffirm last November' s vote and to adopt the report in the form presented to you by the committee."
"It is in adopting coherent and consistent positions that Parliament will enhance its stature."
"Mr President, today' s debate has its pitfalls inasmuch as we are being asked to amend, or to refuse to amend, a system, namely the Eurodac system, which our group has comprehensively rejected."
"The Eurodac system is part and parcel of a general tendency to criminalise and penalise immigrants and those who are being persecuted the world over."
"It reveals the true face of liberal Europe, which is setting itself up as a besieged fortress."
"How can anyone imagine that it is by means of repressive laws that the starving of the earth are to be prevented from coming to Europe, even at the risk of their lives, as has been seen recently at Dover and in Gibraltar."
"On the contrary, it is, as we all know, these combined weapons of criminalisation which force thousands of foreigners to become illegal immigrants who then fall victim to smugglers, slave merchants or unscrupulous bosses who grossly exploit them."
"Regularising the status of illegal immigrants en masse is the way to put a spoke in the wheels of all these dealers in human misery."
"It is these combined weapons of criminalisation which will erode our own freedoms, as witness the French Presidency' s plan, which we shall have to express our opinion on. This plan is aimed at cracking down on anyone who comes to the aid of an immigrant without the proper papers."
"It is because of these weapons and because of this strategy that, today in France, a boy of Tamil origin is imprisoned with his mother in the Aranc detention centre waiting for a judgement from the Minister of the Interior and, in all likelihood, his expulsion from the country."
"Recording people' s fingerprints on computer is an attack on individual freedom."
"It systematically treats asylum seekers as suspects and puts a question mark over the confidentiality of the documents held by the bodies responsible for examining their applications."
"It infringes the legal protection due to refugees in being applied even to 14-year-olds."
"It contravenes the International Declaration on the Rights of the Child and, in particular, Article 10 of this."
"Who, among you here, would dare take the fingerprints of a young lad of 14?"
"The Eurodac project makes criminals of immigrants without proper papers, often deprived of legal status because of the differences in the laws between one European country and another."
"It fundamentally violates all the international conventions protecting human rights."
"With this project, Fortress Europe is guilty of failing to assist refugees who are in danger."
"This is hardly a surprise coming from a liberal Europe which equips the Ankara dictatorship with combat helicopters at the same time as rejecting Kurdish refugees."
"At a time when a wave of racism and xenophobia is forming across Europe and when consideration is being given to drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, you ought to reject Eurodac, with or without amendments."
"It is our own freedoms that are at stake."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Radical Members of the Bonino List, I would like to express concern and strong opposition to a Europe which, especially in its gradual creation of a so-called Area of Freedom, Justice and Security, is following the intergovernmental road, which only incorporates elements that are repressive and destroy freedoms and trample underfoot the rights of the citizens of the European Union and the Member States."
"The Eurodac incident is an example of this: without having defined any kind of European political asylum policy at all, the Member States, through the Council, created the Dublin Convention, which legalises mutual backscratching as regards applicants for asylum and the examination of their applications for political asylum in our Member States."
"At this point, in order to bring the Convention into operation, the Council promoted the creation of the Eurodac system, and initially made the Commission responsible for its implementation."
"However, it then decided to go further and extend electronic fingerprinting to illegal immigrants, removed the management responsibilities from the Commission, and took them directly upon itself."
"In the face of this confusion, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is right, through Mr Pirker' s report, to restore these responsibilities to the Commission and to make other amendments of substance which we fully support."
"Having said that, since we do not, however, support the basic bureaucratic, repressive approach sustained by the Council and abetted by the Commission, which is reflected in the Dublin Convention and the EURODAC system, we will vote for the amendments of substance tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs but against the legislative resolution, for it leaves the way almost completely open for this absurd piece of legislation which introduces the systematic compilation of police records on refugees and illegal immigrants at European level: a legal, political and humanitarian atrocity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to speak about the issues underlying the proposal for a regulation, which have been so thoroughly studied and discussed in committee and in this Chamber, a process that culminated in the vote on Parliament' s opinion last November."
"It is nevertheless worthwhile saying, in line with the views of the rapporteur Mr Pirker and of the Commission itself, how incomprehensible we find it that in the new text, the Council proposes to reserve to itself responsibility for implementing the Eurodac regulation, which departs from the system previously envisaged, in which these powers would fall to the Commission."
"We are unhappy with this, firstly because Parliament, as has already been pointed out, is seeing its rights diminished, specifically its right to remain informed."
"In fact, the Commission is, in general terms, obliged, under the terms of Article 7 of the decision on comitology, to keep Parliament informed of committee proceedings and whenever the Commission transmits relevant measures or proposals to the Council."
"With this new text, this prerogative is clearly undermined."
"Secondly, there is a lack of legal coherence and above all a lack of legal justification in these transfers of competence."
"Article 1 of the decision on comitology has not been respected and therefore this course of action breaches Article 202 of the Treaty, since this article contains no provisions that would justify this procedure being adopted in this specific case."
"Our view is that the generally accepted status of the Commission is still valid: it is the guardian of the treaties, equidistant from each of the Member States; it is autonomous, independent and the defender of the common good."
"It is the Commission rather than the Member States that is responsible - transcending borders and national peculiarities - for drafting laws that provide adequate protection on issues involving fundamental freedoms."
"The Council has demonstrated its lack of confidence in the Commission."
"Without wishing to appear perverse, perhaps the Council is looking for a legal fight over this issue, which would clear the way for an almost certain application to the European Court of Justice to delay the universal implementation of the new Community legislation in progress on the right to asylum."
"Sometimes in politics, things are indeed what they seem!"
"Unfortunately, Commissioner, and this is not your fault, this is a matter on which you cannot allay our fears."
"Mr President, I am grateful to Commissioner Vitorino for his work."
"I speak for some Members on this side of the House in saying that there are concerns about this report."
"We are not one hundred percent happy."
"We wish we were not at this stage today, but I look at this from the point of view - which I share with several colleagues, that we do not want asylum seekers to be seen as criminals."
"Criminals have their fingerprints taken and we need not automatically or in any way assume that asylum seekers ought to be put into this category."
"Many of them are escaping from terror, from torture, from other experiences."
"We want to make certain that at our frontiers they are not put through similar experiences and practices again."
"I accept what Mr Kirkhope said a few minutes ago, that there are frictions and difficulties with the system which need to be sorted out."
"Other colleagues have referred to the issue of fingerprinting 14-year-olds, which has been very sensitive and very emotive."
"On this side of the House we are realistic."
"That is why we are looking for the safeguards that have been put into the report."
"It is why we would prefer that there be parliamentary scrutiny in the question of Commission versus Council."
"We believe that Parliament is there to safeguard citizens and make certain that the asylum policy is carried out in the fairest possible way."
"With those reservations and I know I speak on behalf of several colleagues - I will be following Mrs Terrón' s line."
"We wish the Commission well in this work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission wishes to thank the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and especially Mr Pirker, for the speed with which the renewed consultation on the Eurodac project has proceeded, as well as for the quality of the proposals that have been presented."
"I should like to begin by reminding honourable Members that the Tampere European Council requested that the Eurodac system be completed as quickly as possible."
"We can conclude from this report that the Commission and the European Parliament have played their part in this task most speedily."
"What is under discussion today is merely a new consultation on the specific issue of comitology."
"I am not going to comment again on the fundamentals of the Eurodac system, but I would like to remind you, and particularly Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, that following the debate in the European Parliament the Commission submitted an amended proposal."
"Although it is true that this amended proposal did not include all the amendments approved by the European Parliament, it must at least be recognised that some of the suggestions made by Parliament were incorporated."
"Therefore, on the only issue which is still under discussion - comitology - the Commission wishes to remind Parliament of the position it adopted towards the Council: we disagree with the Council' s decision to reserve to itself the power to lay down most of the implementing rules here."
"This factor was crucial in the commitments that the Commission made to you, the European Parliament, with regard to our reasons for being prepared to participate in a Eurodac system."
"One of the crucial factors is that, if the system is managed and implemented by the Commission, there is a guarantee of effective control by the European Parliament. Some of the doubts as to the legitimacy of the Eurodac system could be dispelled by bringing these two elements together, with responsibility for the management and implementation of the system falling to the Commission and democratic control to the European Parliament."
"Secondly, it is our view that the Council' s decision is not properly underpinned by the principles and criteria governing the actual comitology rules."
"We will therefore continue to state our position to the Council, which is that we would have a win-win situation if the solution adopted were the one for which the Commission has always fought."
"Lastly, I should like once more to make it clear to Parliament that we have not used these doubts or this quarrel about interpretation in relation to Eurodac as an excuse for inaction: the Commission has already submitted a working paper on revising the Dublin Convention, which it has in fact sent to the European Parliament."
"It is our view that the shortcomings and errors in the workings of the Dublin Convention show precisely why we need a European asylum policy."
"I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission has today given substance to a key aspect of the Tampere mandate on asylum by approving a proposal for a directive on minimum rules for a common procedure for requests for asylum."
"This shows that we are not working on a piecemeal basis; we are putting together a jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw that involves revising the Dublin Convention."
"Another piece of this jigsaw is the decision that we have adopted today, to propose a directive on minimum standards for a common asylum procedure, and another piece is the preparatory technical work on the Eurodac system, which has not stood still, but is continuing. This work can, of course, only be carried out when there is a clear and unassailable legal basis for developing the Eurodac system."
"Once again, I would like to thank you - even the honourable Members who have criticised the Commission - for the support expressed by various political groups for the Commission to manage and implement the Eurodac system."
"We are prepared to take on this challenge, in the hope that the Council will listen to us."
"Commissioner, before you leave the Chamber I invite you to come here so that I can take your fingerprints, perhaps, together with Mr Pirker."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment"
"The next item is the report (A5-0222/2000) by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the second time Directive 89/655/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work (2nd individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 of Directive 89/391/EEC) (important text for the EEA) [COM(1998) 678 - C4-0707/1998 - 1998/0327(COD)]"
"Mr President, the first question to be asked about this report is: Why do we need this directive?"
"It is very interesting when you look at the statistics because the exact reasons become clear."
"Almost 10% of all occupational accidents involve falls from heights."
"One in ten of those involves permanent invalidity or death."
"Across the European Union in any one year there are approximately half a million falls from heights in the workplace."
"300 000 of those result in absences from the workplace of more than three days and 40 000 result in serious injury."
"Unfortunately, 1 000 are fatal."
"Many of these accidents - many of which can be avoided - come about because of the poor use of scaffolding or ladders."
"In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, the body looking at accidents in the workplace has estimated that some 30% of all prohibition notices in the United Kingdom are issued for unsafe scaffolding alone. In fact, 90% of all accidents on ladders come about because of the misuse of ladders."
"These are statistics gathered by industry groups and others and not because of equipment failure."
"Figures published recently by the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao suggest enormous variations between Member States in the incidence of falls from heights."
"Such variations suggest that health and safety levels are not the same for all workers across the European Union."
"That is why we need to establish minimum requirements with a view to protecting workers from falls from heights."
"The current cost, both in personal terms and those of the workers and families affected and in terms of economic costs to industry and the social and health protection systems, warrants legislation in this area."
"Billions of pounds are spent caring for workers who have been injured or become ill."
"This can largely be avoided."
"The background to this proposal suggests additional reasons for having this legislation."
"This is an amendment to an existing directive on the general minimum requirements for work equipment at work."
"A proposal to include scaffolding in an earlier amendment to the directive was rejected by Parliament, thanks to many of my colleagues on the other side of the House."
"The directive finally adopted covered only two specific types of work equipment: mobile equipment and equipment for lifting loads which are very important areas in their own right."
"This directive will rectify this serious omission."
"If we do not include falls from heights, the only certainty is that there will be more and the rate will increase."
"If Parliament rejects this addition, then it must hold itself responsible for the consequences."
"The Commission' s original intention was to present a proposal for a scaffolding directive."
"However, because serious falls from heights do not occur only from scaffolding, the scope has been widened to include protection for workers from all manner of falls from heights."
"Although falls from heights occur in circumstances where ladders and scaffolding are not present, the main focus of the proposal is on scaffolding, ladders and rope access, as you will see as you read."
"The current rules in many Member States apply only to the building industry, so another important factor is that the scope is extended to other sectors."
"Also it is important to stress as some seem mildly confused about this, that this proposal is based on Article 138, previously Article 118a, which laid down the minimum requirements for ensuring a better level of protection for workers health and safety."
"We are not dealing with the construction, the concept or the design or work equipment, but with the risks to the health and safety of workers using the equipment."
"It does seem to me that there are some people in this House who are a little bit dim in grasping that."
"The importance of working at heights and having this directive is clear also."
"Some have questioned the validity of this legislation and they are free to do so."
"However, contrary to what has been suggested, this proposal does not merely suggest training people to use ladders, nor does it outlaw the use of ladders."
"What it does is provide for safe use of ladders and other equipment."
"I wonder whether the critics of this report have ever worked on construction sites as many of us have."
"I wonder whether they would accept that there are many people who know exactly what this legislation can bring about."
"Finally, concerning the amendments tabled, which I have only just seen today, I welcome Amendments Nos 22 and 25: Amendment No 22 as a second choice if Amendment No 5 falls and Amendment No 25 as a recital as it hits the tone of my report very well."
"However, for consistency' s sake and with regard to the framework directive which is the basis of this whole legislative approach, I cannot accept the others at present."
"Mr President, I feel obliged, and I would like to do so courteously, to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, on his sensitivity, his excellent report and his willingness to accept the proposals - which I believe are well put together - of the Group on whose behalf I have the honour of speaking."
"All of this means that we have a text which enjoys broad consensus, and not only amongst the two main Groups, since this consensus has been forged through constant communication with social operators, entrepreneurs and workers, via the trade unions."
"I believe that consensus is necessary in a field in which the safety, health, integrity and the very lives of workers are at stake."
"Very recently I was going for a walk around my town, Vigo, in Galicia, in the north west of Spain, when I happened to see a large works sign."
"The works involved the renovation of an old square in the town' s historic quarter, and the sign said: ""This company respects the law."
"It uses safety equipment and devices."
"If you are not familiar with them, do not enter the site."
"Inform us of any situation of risk."
"Please help us to fulfil the legal obligations for protecting the safety and health of workers"" ."
"I mention the contents of this works sign and the advice, legal requirements for third parties and those with an interest in the works, because I believe that it represents a summary of the requirements of a good policy on health at work."
"A good policy on health at work must begin by being preventive and the idea of prevention must to a large extent include awareness, not only on the part of workers and employers, but also on the part of society as a whole."
"Unfortunately, every day we hear news of accidents at work."
"We know very well there is no such thing as zero risk, but we are also aware that society must not cease in its efforts to prevent risk being turned into accidents."
"When an accident happens, the responsibility may perhaps fall to the employer, because they have still not been convinced that money spent on safety is an investment."
"Or perhaps it may fall to the worker, because they ignore the risks, or because of a lack of caution, or because adequate measures or precautions have not been taken, mainly in activities such as construction, in which the temporary nature of works and of the sector itself - a bridging sector, between primary activity, mainly agricultural, and the industrial and service sectors - require even more precautionary measures."
"Or it may perhaps fall to the administration itself through the insufficiency, and therefore ineffectiveness, of the inspection, advisory and control services responsible for informing, advising and, where necessary, penalising non-compliance with the employment legislation."
"Health and safety at work, especially where the risk is very high, is the responsibility of society and of all the sectors concerned, and the whole of society must assume its fair share of responsibility and commitment."
"The employer should consider money spent on safety at work as an investment."
"The worker should take full precautions, demanding and arguing for the use of preventive and protective mechanisms, as well as the good practices of companies."
"States and governments should amend the measures for the promotion of preventive actions, for the inspection of the measures to prevent accidents, and also for the replacement of the administrative and political methods for combating accidents at work."
"The old model of penalties, which has shown itself to be insufficient and ineffective, should be replaced with a method providing stimulus and incentive, by intensifying action in all companies or activities with the highest number of accidents, and also by offering benefits and advantages to companies with the lowest number of accidents and the highest spending on prevention and awareness."
"Furthermore, the Commission and the Council should set minimum conditions which may seem strict to some, but which will allow working conditions to be improved and the health and safety of workers to be protected, harmonising legislation in a market operating with the free movement of workers."
"In this way, European citizens will see Europe as being closer to them, a Europe that addresses their problems, concerns and interests."
"Mr President, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his efforts in moderating and reconciling the various interests so that Parliament can make a positive, consensual contribution to improving this excellent Commission proposal."
"Negligence in work organisation, a lack of appropriate equipment for personal and collective safety, the low level of training and the high number of self-employed workers are the main causes of the high level of injuries and deaths in the workplace."
"The risks inherent in the building industry are even greater when compared with other, similar sectors."
"Over the last 50 years, business activity has increased apace, and immigrant workers and sub-contractors are used to a great extent."
"Apart from the aspects that have already been mentioned, the problems of communication and organisation are getting worse, and there is a tendency for the safety of everyone on building sites to be neglected, and for responsibility to be watered down."
"It can never be stated too strongly that all the directives relating to the health and safety of workers and particularly the definition of responsibility contained in Directive 89/655/EEC are in force. These state that the employer, the owner of the site, is responsible for any accidents that happen there, and also for preventing them."
"The person responsible for the safety of the site is obliged to carry out a risk assessment and to ensure that checks on safety equipment used by everyone with access to the site, regardless of their job, employment status or length of service, have been carried out."
"The risk assessment has been carried out at a snail' s pace in the European Union, and this second revision is a positive sign that we really want to support and encourage."
"Even looking at the matter from a purely economic point of view, it is extremely worrying to note that in the European Union, in 1996, out of every 100 000 workers, 4 229 took more than three days' sick leave as a result of accidents in the workplace."
"In that year, four million seven hundred thousand accidents took place."
"Although fatal accidents have decreased by 13%, which is to some extent linked to Community action between 1994 and 1996, there were still 5 549 deaths in 1996."
"It is estimated that the damage caused to the European economy in that year was around 146 million working days lost."
"It is particularly relevant to the debate on the directive that I mentioned earlier that, although the construction industry does not have the highest number of accidents, it does have the greatest number of fatal accidents, comparable only with the road haulage sector."
"Europe cannot at the same time consider itself to be the world' s leading social model and yet allow people to count for little and for their lives to be reduced to mere statistics."
"Men, especially young men under the age of 25, are the main victims of accidents in the workplace, but the probability of death as a result of an accident increases with age and is highest for those between 55 and 64 years old. This probability is highest in smaller companies - with up to 50 employees - and for self-employed workers, for whom the accident rate stands at 73.1% of all accidents in the workplace."
"This illustrates the need for measures to be adopted in professions with a high turnover of workers: measures which focus on young people' s qualifications, multidisciplinary solutions involving training and qualifications and the quality of SMEs in some sectors."
"Since the famous survey conducted in 1907 in the United States, when identification, compulsory registration, cause of death, the employer' s age, the worker' s age, name, circumstances and the accident itself were studied to establish costs and duties enabling workers to be better protected..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, as a number of speakers have already mentioned, falls from heights are among the most serious categories of industrial accident and, by means of this report which is a stage in the elaboration of the directive on minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment, we are setting to work on doing something about the problem."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to say that, overall, we regard the result as progress."
"The main features of the rules we are proposing to introduce in this area seem to be clear and, at the same time, appear to take due account of the fact that businesses will have to be able to make the rules work in practice and on a day-to-day basis."
"For we need to remember that, however commendable and laudable the purpose behind what we are adopting, the consequences will not necessarily always be as we hope, and our objective must therefore always be to formulate rules which are as simple and precise as possible and to ensure that there is room for the flexibility needed in the labour market."
"I believe that our rapporteur, Peter Skinner, has striven to find this balance between the desire for clear rules and the need for flexibility and diversity. He deserves a lot of thanks for this, as well as for his method of working. aimed at building consensus."
"However, I believe that it will also be important in the future to work on reducing the risk of accidents by acquiring greater knowledge of how such accidents happen."
"How many accidents are we talking about?"
"When do they occur?"
"How do they happen?"
"What can we do to prevent them?"
"I believe that the work begun with the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao will make a positive contribution to a reduction in the accident figures as we find the answers to these questions and use them constructively."
"This is a proper path to go down: the authorities cooperating with the two sides of industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report before us has been commended by everyone as being useful and necessary."
"It concerns the use of ladders, scaffolding and ropes, working at heights, and, from time to time, alongside dangerous drops."
"The background to this report is, of course, the many accidents which have occurred in the past and the inadequacy of directives to date."
"This is why it is useful and necessary to have this report, although it has been a long time coming. However, all credit to Mr Skinner for finally managing to complete it."
"Despite this, it is a problem report in a way, not because it is causing something to be done, but because the sector we are dealing with is extremely diverse."
"It covers people working in the service sector, maintenance sector, painters, window cleaners, etc."
"Working at heights is not always for long periods of time but often for short spells."
"This means that the definitions we use should be specific rather than vague, and that the provisions we make should be enforceable, which is far from always being the case."
"I have already indicated that some descriptions are vague, including those describing ""short duration"" and ""low level of risk"" , for example, whilst the assessing of risks involving only a couple of people has been over-regulated."
"We have managed to discuss some of these instances within the committee and these sections have been deleted from the report, which has led to an improvement."
"I welcome the progress made and we should be able to continue in the same vein."
"Let us examine a number of aspects, such as scaffold bearing surfaces. Needless to say, they should be securely fixed but it is not always possible to brace them against movement, as long as they do not slip."
"Mobile scaffolds must be prevented from moving about, but this cannot always be legislated for sufficiently. You cannot have red lights everywhere."
"Portable ladders must be anchored down and be solid, but they must remain serviceable."
"This is why we have proposed requesting split voting for a number of amendments. In this way, everyone will have the opportunity to propose improvements on the vulnerable sections of the directive."
"Mr President, I think it outrageous that the problem of accidents due to falls at work can give rise to some much opposition and cannot be sorted out more quickly."
"Yet, the rapporteur himself reminds us how urgent the matter is when he quotes a figure of 500 000 accidents per year in this sphere alone, leading to at least 40 000 cases of seriously injury and around a thousand deaths."
"As the rapporteur is careful to point out, however, building firms are opposed to regulation of any kind and, as a result, the report carefully avoids implicating them."
"Technical defects in scaffolding and other systems do cause accidents in the workplace, but the main cause is production rates, working hours and poor conditions."
"The report asks for employers to make arrangements at least to limit the carnage, if not to put an end to it."
"If emergency measures were to be agreed, forcing employers to make such arrangements, then I should immediately be all in favour of them. I doubt, however, if that would be possible, so respectful is this Parliament of employers' interests."
"Meanwhile, capitalist exploitation continues to exact a heavy toll among tens of thousands of employees in terms of their health and, sometimes, their lives."
"Mr President, we support and value Mr Skinner' s work, although we do feel that, given the premises and, above all, the implications of the issue, he could have been a little more incisive, in view, moreover, of the fact that eleven years have passed since the first directive on the subject was produced and of the shortcomings of its amending directive which entered into force five years ago."
"Of course, we are aware of the greater or lesser sensitivity towards these issues shown in the positions adopted within this very Parliament and elsewhere, and of the concerns raised regarding legislation which is more stringent or would involve greater costs for businesses."
"However, as the rapporteur points out, we must consider just how much a worker' s life and health is worth."
"In effect, occupational accidents continue to be the scourge of the world of employment in all the countries of the European Union, although there is a higher incidence in certain sectors."
"This can certainly be explained by the many factors which contribute in various ways to increasing or reducing the size of the phenomenon, but we are now faced with an indisputable cause of injury, which is present in all the Member States, and which is sadly responsible for as much as ten percent of all occupational accidents, namely falls from heights."
"It must be said that the Economic and Social Committee' s opinion certainly laid out, clearly and precisely, not only the scale of the problem but also and above all the solutions to be adopted: Mr Skinner has not failed to build on this foundation, taking as a starting point the need to consolidate the relevant terminology used, to improve the way work is organised and to provide specific training and information for the workers involved."
"It must also be pointed out, however, that the solution should nevertheless be implemented via the preparation and issuing of more precise, and more stringent guidelines on prevention by the Commission, making it possible, among other things, to overcome the problem of the fragmentation of responsibilities in this area and, at the same time, to provide, along with more binding controls, for a system of incentives, particularly where small- and medium-sized businesses are concerned, to ensure that occupational safety rules are implemented efficiently and effectively."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Skinner for his commendable report on this complex issue of health and safety requirements for the use of work equipment, and also for being willing to adopt important proposals put forward by the PPE-DE Group."
"Mr Perez Alvarez has already gone into this."
"I am not happy on every count."
"A certain amount of amendment will be necessary prior to the second reading, but the PPE-DE Group is prepared to accept the report overall."
"The report in its present form even takes account of objections raised by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and calls for experts to be involved, but, of course, only where the setting up of ladders and scaffolding equipment at the workplace is concerned."
"As is surely the case with all legal texts at national - and at regional level for that matter - some of the phraseology might raise a smile, if you can call any of it a laughing matter that is."
"The smile certainly drained from my face when I read the European-wide statistics on accidents in the workplace, and on hearing them just now."
"I do not intend to go further into the facts and figures, as we have already heard a great deal on that score."
"But there is one fundamental point I would like to make."
"Safety measures are not the only things that cost."
"Continued payment of wages, sick pay, invalidity, widows' and orphans' allowances are a drain on business and on the national economy."
"This is how productive a moderate social policy is."
"Preventive action is also better, cheaper and more humane than a social policy that deals with the consequences."
"It is no good shutting the stable door when the horse has bolted; you need to make sure it is shut to start with."
"'But what about subsidiarity?' , goes the common cry."
"This principle is not meant to render Europe completely inert!"
"I like the definition provided in Quadragesimo anno the best: subsidiarity - gives right of way in cases of doubt to smaller living entities and to solutions reached by social partners, in the face of State, or - I might well add - EU rulings."
"But if the smaller entity is unable to perform its tasks in the interests of the public good, then the larger entity must step in."
"This explains why so many European minimum standards were laid down in the EU Treaties in the eighties, when Christian Democrats and Conservatives had the monopoly on power in Europe; in other words, it is a Christian Democrat affair."
"Incidentally, health and safety regulations have been organised at international level since the industrial revolution in the 19th century."
"The great Conservative British statesman Benjamin Disraeli was one of the pioneers of health and safety regulations."
"Continental Europe took its cue from England, adopted these laws and also enshrined them in international conventions, doing so from the very outset."
"In view of globalisation and Europeanisation, there is without doubt a need for the European social dimension in the 21st century."
"We want to Europeanise the economy."
"We have the single currency."
"It cannot be the answer to deal with social policy at a purely regional, or even provincial, level."
"Minimum standards mean subsidiarity."
"Each country can frame its own health and safety regulations provided that European minimum standards are observed."
"We PPE-DE Group Members are opposed to European maximum standards."
"In Germany the picture is completed by legal acts introduced by the social partners."
"There are German standards and health and safety regulations for the workplace."
"We also have statutes such as legal acts governing professional trade associations, not to mention the accident prevention law."
"Incidentally, it is all very well for people to be critical - for stylistic reasons among others - of the fact that we have a whole host of detailed regulations."
"I tell you this though; a fraction of these practical regulations would do the citizens and workers of the Member States a greater service than reams and reams of fancy talk and great ideologies."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur' s fine report points out, the figures recently published by the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, whose headquarters are in Bilbao, indicate very differing results in relation to work accidents between the various Member States, owing to the fact that the States are not applying uniform statistical criteria."
"It is therefore urgent that we establish harmonised standards at Community level so that we can have comparable data and assess the results of preventive policies in each European State, community or region. We must do this to ensure that we do not have first- or second-class workers, or lower, but that all workers are protected by safety regulations and requirements of the same quality."
"It is also the case that we need more site inspectors so that companies will sufficiently respect the regulations, but it is just as true that the public institutions and companies must begin by setting an example in all of this. Nevertheless, even today, many activities and workplaces of public bodies do not have the required plans for prevention of work-related risk that are laid down in Community directives."
"I would therefore like to call on all the European public managers to make an effort to be the first to comply with the regulations, so that managers in the private sector cannot use institutional laziness as an excuse."
"The Commission has proposed an amended directive on health and safety at work."
"This report suggests it should be longer and more detailed."
"UK Conservatives believe that we should vote against it for that very reason."
"This is not a question of whether or not health and safety at work is an important issue."
"Of course it is."
"It is not a question of whether or not the recommendations in the report are sound."
"Many of them are and Peter Skinner has put a lot of thought into his work."
"It is a question of how the European Parliament should be spending its time and be seen to be spending its time."
"It is a question of what Parliament should be looking at as its priorities."
"It is a question of whether it should be for the Commission and for the European Parliament to prescribe the fine detail of people' s working and waking lives."
"There is a problem in the UK, but not confined to the UK. The EU is seen to be interfering."
"The European Parliament is often seen to be interfering even more."
"It is not seen as focusing on the big issues."
"Our constituents ask us why they should vote for anybody at the European elections."
"They ask: what are you doing for us?"
"What shall we answer?"
"We have the opportunity to tell our people that we do care about the big issues that they care about, that we can help deliver a better peace, security, prosperity, environment and quality of life - issues that can genuinely be helped best at a European level."
"Or we can answer that the EU, through the Commission and Parliament, is about deciding whether or not it should be legal for one person to stand at the bottom of a ladder holding on to it while another person climbs up it."
"This is the issue that we are discussing today."
"Let us oppose this latest example of red tape from the top."
"At some time or other, Parliament must give a clear signal as to its true sense of purpose, its true priorities."
"I say: Let it be now."
"I am very grateful to be able to follow my colleague, Philip Bushill-Matthews, because I share many of the concerns he has expressed."
"I think that this proposal reflects no credit on the European Union or on this House."
"I think if the European Union - and indeed if the European Parliament - wishes to be taken seriously by the people of Europe then this is exactly the sort of legislation which it should cease to enact because we all know that health and safety and workers' safety is a priority for all Member States, and so it should be."
"But there is no justification for a Europe-wide standard on this issue."
"There can be no reason why Member States, acting in a uniform way, would necessarily be able to tackle this problem more effectively than individual Member States and, above all, there can be no reason for taking such a close interest in ordinary aspects of people' s working lives."
"It can make no sense to legislate on how Europeans are permitted to climb ladders."
"This should not be the priority for this House."
"It is too great a level of detail for this House to involve itself in and it will merely lead to the ridiculing of the European Union because this is just the sort of interference which is deeply unpopular with many citizens across the European Union."
"Instead of engaging in this sort of interference, we should be addressing those issues where it is constructive for Member States to work together and develop some common standards."
"A common and uniform and centralised standard on how you climb a ladder is not necessary and it is an undesirable interference with the way people run their work environment."
"We can trust the people of Europe to decide for themselves how they climb ladders."
"I believe that it is not necessary to conduct a risk assessment every time it is proposed to use a ladder."
"As anyone working in the home can tell you, ladders are used very commonly and very frequently and, yes, there are accidents but I do not believe this kind of directive will ever eliminate those accidents."
"All it will do is add yet another layer of European bureaucracy and red tape to be dealt with by a business community already suffocated by the weight of red tape."
"As my colleague has said, it is time for a change."
"It is time for this Parliament to start addressing the issues which are of concern to the citizens of Europe and to stop addressing itself to detailed questions where it can be of no assistance in actually securing worker protection."
"In fact, all it is doing is bringing itself and the European Union into disrepute and burdening European businesses with a layer of cost and bureaucracy that they can ill afford."
"I have to express amazement at the two speeches we have just heard, one from Mr Bushill-Matthews and the other from Mrs Villiers."
"They seem to be engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"They deplore the fact that the European Parliament is regarded as involving itself in trivia and generating red tape and yet they spend their time issuing press releases describing very important pieces of health and safety legislation as nothing but trivia and red tape."
"It is hardly surprising that the British media project the sort of image that they describe."
"This is a very important piece of health and safety legislation, building upon the corpus of such legislation that we have adopted at European level over the last twenty years."
"It is not trivial for the families of the 500 000 people who fall from heights at work every year."
"300 000 of those accidents are serious enough to cause the employees to be absent from work more than three days."
"40 000 of those falls are very serious and 1 000 result in deaths."
"Try to explain to the families concerned that this is a trivial issue."
"It is not."
"It is a very important issue and survey after survey, including those in Eurobarometer, and surveys of SMEs including by the last British Government have shown that SMEs themselves recognise the importance of good health and safety legislation."
"I deplore the fact that the consensus we have had in this important area of policy has been broken in this way by a small minority in the EPP."
"It really is absolutely deplorable and we should all - right across the political spectrum - make it clear that we will not tolerate that sort of behaviour from that minority."
"It is described as bureaucratic."
"But read the directive itself, read the proposal."
"Is it onerous?"
"Is it burdensome?"
"Does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height?"
"No, it does not, it is a very easily understood, readable, implementable directive and it should be described in that way."
"It should be described as making a valuable contribution to preventing injury and deaths within the European Union."
"Please do not engage in this trivialisation and then come along here and hypocritically express surprise that this institution is being held in ridicule."
"You are the people who are causing that."
"Stop it now, please."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my delegation intends to back the Skinner report on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the second time the Directive concerning minimum health and safety requirements."
"The key issue of health and safety protection for workers is a matter of concern to us all."
"No one is prepared to expose themselves to the accusation that they are anti-social, and it is undoubtedly justifiable to have minimum regulations in the European area."
"It also accords with the EU Treaty, and so we will give the rapporteur the respect due to him."
"But I am at a loss as to why MEPs manoeuvre themselves time and again into predicaments where they either face the accusation of being of an anti-social disposition, or else risk becoming a laughing stock."
"I certainly cannot see why mature adults should be dictated to on how they should climb ladders, or get down them, or why a risk assessment should have to be completed before a ladder is used; or why there should be an instruction to the effect that, two people should not climb a ladder at the same time, if at all possible, or even one stating that time spent up a ladder should not exceed half an hour, or - a peculiar refinement - 25% of total working hours."
"The Skinner report will go down in parliamentary lore as 'the ladder report' , and the people of the European Union will justifiably ask themselves whether we do not have anything better to do than produce legislation on things they take for granted, which should in fact be a matter for in-house experts and have no place either in an EU directive or an associated report produced by the codecision-making Parliament!"
"In fact this is not the first time that a report with a social component has contained such absurdities."
"When MEPs have to rack their brains over matters such as the physical constitution of Europeans, in order to establish standards for the average size of tractor seat, or the conditions under which panicled tomatoes - the Austrian word is Rispenparadeiser - can enter the market, this shows an MEP' s job description, but also the raison d' être of the European institutions, in a poor light, to say nothing of the fact that such detailed provisions and over-regulation can become counter-productive."
"The same applies to national legislation on protection for workers, incidentally."
"Despite all the financial incentives, protective measures of this kind are apt to deter employers from taking on apprentices, thereby contributing to youth unemployment rather than helping to alleviate it."
"In addition, however, the Skinner report raises the fundamental question as to what Europe should do and what it should not do."
"In other words, it is about competences and the judicious application of the subsidiarity principle."
"We cannot, and must not, evade the issue any longer."
"This is not just because of the Intergovernmental Conference and the organisational form of the European Union, which must find a satisfactory solution in view of the forthcoming enlargement."
"This issue has to do with the acceptance of the Union by the people, which is the subject of much complaint."
"We need more Europe where internal and external security is concerned, more Europe when it comes to looking after our interests in the global competition, in currency policy and in the completion of the single market."
"But what we do not need is a Europe that makes inroads on the autonomy of governments, regional administrative bodies, and lastly, the individual, and which takes away the individual' s right to an opinion."
"I therefore intend to use this report as an opportunity to highlight the demand for a debate on competences after the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, let us be absolutely clear about the fact that there is no one in this Parliament who wants anything other than the best."
"Let us make it clear that no one in this Parliament wants anything other than that the number of accidents, especially fatal accidents, should fall in all workplaces around our splendid continent and in our Member States."
"Let us, however, at the same time make it absolutely clear to one other - and I am addressing a number of speakers here - that different answers can be arrived at to the question of what is the correct level of political decision-making at which to make these important decisions."
"After listening to Mr Hughes, to the British Labour Government and also to others in Britain, I am extremely confident that they are deeply committed to finding answers to these questions."
"After listening to Mr Menrad, I am very confident that the German Christian Democratic Party is thoroughly engaged with these issues in Germany."
"I can guarantee that all seven parliamentary parties in Sweden, especially my own Christian Democratic Party, are concerned about the matter."
"I can also assure you that public opinion and the trade unions are very committed to the issue and want to enact laws which will lead to a very significant reduction in the number of deaths due to industrial accidents."
"What is it, then, which leads us to believe that it is at the level of the European Parliament, representing countries with more than 15 national parliaments, that the right forum for decision-making is to be found?"
"In the light of the subsidiarity or proximity principle, allow me to express my doubts about the extent to which this issue is suited to being dealt with specifically in the European Parliament."
"Amendment 14, paragraph 4.2.2, for example, reads as follows: 'Before portable ladders are brought into service, their feet shall be prevented from slipping by securing the stiles at or near their upper or lower ends, by any anti-slip device or by any other arrangement of equivalent effectiveness."
"As a priority, ladders should be secured firmly using all possible means."
"Ladders used for access should be long enough for their uprights to protrude sufficiently beyond the access platform. Ladders in several sections shall be so used as to ensure that they are secure."
"The holding of the ladder by another person as a safety measure shall not be allowed.'"
"This text is well meant and perfectly in order legally."
"I can absolutely assure you that, at home in Mora in Dalarna, where I live, as well as in the Swedish Parliament and also in all other national parliaments, these matters are being carefully looked into."
"In view of the subsidiarity principle in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, is it right of the European Parliament to legislate at this very high level of detail?"
"Instead what we ought to be doing is aiming for a directive which specifies our objectives."
"In that way, we can allow the Member States themselves, their people and their elected representatives in national parliaments and governments to be responsible for the existence of regulations ensuring that working life does not involve unnecessary risks."
"Allow them to determine how to frame the rules so as to fulfil the requirements of the directive in the best way."
"National legislation is being enacted in this area to add to the existing national laws."
"The two sides of industry are also extremely active in this area."
"We Swedish Christian Democrats shall be voting against this report on the basis of the subsidiarity principle."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Skinner for skilfully managing to formulate a series of compromises which strike a good balance between the different interests involved."
"This has led to a document that has clearly won considerable approval, which is quite an achievement on this very important political issue."
"This text is a good answer to Mr Bushill-Matthews' voters and what Europe does for them."
"It is something concrete and it concerns people is every day lives."
"Using the enterprises' language, I should like to say that this directive is based not only on social solidarity and social justice, but on competition issues as well."
"That is why we try to help applicant countries to develop and implement health and safety policies."
"These health and safety policies are the Commission' s first priority in the social agenda."
"Apart from undertaking the specific commitments set out in this agenda, we are starting to prepare a communication on health and safety and future strategies for health and safety."
"The European Parliament has many new ideas and we expect your contribution to this communication."
"If we turn to the current text, this is the second amendment of Directive 89/655 EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work equipment."
"It aims to prevent falls from heights by setting minimum requirements for the use of the relevant work equipment such as ladders and scaffolding."
"Falls from heights account for more than 10% of occupational accidents and one in ten of such falls results in permanent invalidity or death."
"This is a particularly serious problem, which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering and human tragedy for the people directly involved and their families."
"The current proposal is a very important step towards doing something concrete about this."
"I welcome your broad support."
"It is obvious it is something more than bureaucracy."
"Since my reply must deal with the technical details because of the rules of this procedure, I have to stick to the written text."
"On your amendments and the ideas behind the amendments, we are happy to accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 15, 20 and 22 as they stand."
"On the text of Amendments Nos 10, 13, 14, 18, the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed and can agree with most of the texts put forward."
"However, we do propose a few changes or additions, mainly to be sure that we take account of all possible situations and do not create any unintended holes in the safety net we intend to provide with this initiative."
"On Amendment No 10, we agree with the inclusion of a reference to a prior risk assessment, but would prefer different wording in order to specify the circumstances for the use of ladders."
"Similarly, on Amendment No 13 we share the desire to ensure that there is no implied obligation to use mobile platforms, but we believe that this is best achieved by the original wording with the possible addition of the phrase ""of adequate dimensions"" ."
"Also, Amendment No 14 will improve the directive, but in order to avoid any risk of a different interpretation in the future, we would prefer a slight change to the wording, which would include retaining the requirement to prevent the sections of a multi-section ladder from moving relative to each other."
"This is because even slight sudden movements that do not threaten the security of the ladder may cause the worker to lose balance and fall."
"We agree with the main idea behind Amendment No 18 and the references to the securing of the decks and the prevention of unintentional movement."
"However, we must oppose the reference to ""load-bearing surfaces"" as they will cause confusion over what is meant by ""deck"" ."
"We also must oppose the reference to planks forming the scaffold deck as this implies that scaffolding systems that use prefabricated boards are not covered."
"Likewise Amendments Nos 16 and 19 need only slight modification to avoid difficulties in interpretation later on."
"Finally, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 21, 23, 24, 25 and 26."
"This is not a question of a political disagreement but simply that Amendments Nos 6 and 7 change accepted standard texts while the other amendments repeat what is stated elsewhere."
"We must endeavour to keep Community legislation as straightforward as possible and avoid any inconsistencies in the overall framework."
"This is especially important in the field of health and safety where businesses sometimes have in implementing rules because of their complexities."
"With regard to Amendment No 1, the issue is already covered by the text."
"In the same way, the definition of ""collective fall protection safeguards"" given in Amendment No 8 is not necessary."
"These safeguards have already been mentioned in the basic directive and there is no risk of confusion."
"Also Amendment No 21 is unnecessary as this area is already covered by Directive 92/57/EEC and it refers to a specific paragraph."
"Here again, if we repeat something that has already been defined, it is a potential for conflicting interpretations."
"Amendment No 5 is covered by Amendment No 22, which is accepted as it stands."
"Amendment No 6 covers training, which is already incorporated in Recital 7, and research, which is beyond the scope of this directive."
"Furthermore, Recital 7 uses a standard form of words."
"There are thus several reasons for not accepting Amendment No 6."
"Amendment No 7 advocates a change in Article 2(3)."
"This is established standard wording and the Commission therefore cannot accept a change to it."
"Amendment No 23 cannot be supported by the Commission as the issue of health and safety committees in enterprises has been appropriately addressed in the framework directive and according to it, detailed regulation is a matter of subsidiarity for all Member States."
"Amendments Nos 24 and 25 must be rejected because training is already adequately covered, especially following Amendments Nos 16, 19 and 22."
"In spite of its simplicity, the Commission cannot support Amendment No 26 as we prefer to specify the circumstances for the use of ladders."
"To sum up, I am happy that we agree on all main issues and our differences lie in a few technical points."
"I repeat my appreciation of your extensive work and it will improve the protection of workers in this field."
"We will improve the protection we intend to provide with this initiative."
"Mr President, I am glad to see the tradition of speaking to the Commissioner is still alive and well."
"I am particularly pleased with the comments she has made."
"I hope that Parliament' s amendments will be adopted tomorrow as I am sure they will be, despite the elements in this Parliament which do not seem to want to join in and that we will have an interesting discussion with the Council."
"I wonder if the Commissioner would join me in deploring the way in which this report has been treated, with parts - notably the ladders - being isolated and suggestions made - by Mr Bushill-Matthews for one - that this is something that is futile if not childish."
"Commissioner, I hope you will agree that this is a Treaty obligation for us all to look at."
"The basis is Article 138, which was previously Article 118a - and if I am right, we must look into the costs - administrative and otherwise - for small-to-medium-sized businesses, as laid down in the Treaty already."
"This is a small-to-medium-sized-business-friendly piece of legislation, but more importantly it is friendly to the workers who have to use this equipment."
"That is why the legislation is there and is to be applied across the European Union."
"If only Mr Bushill-Matthews had been here when I first started, he would have heard some of the arguments which I wish to place before this House as to why it is important to have EU legislation."
"It is a great problem when you do not hear the arguments, but you merely come in with your own loaded thoughts."
"Indeed, it is a great shame, and I hope that Mrs Villiers will come back some time and perhaps pay a visit to our committee so she can hear some of the debate about this report as well - because I noticed that she disappeared soon after she made her point - maybe we will read about that in the papers as well."
"Finally, I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is here, that the journalist on the Daily Mail, to which you sent your press releases on this report, rang me back and asked me about a specific amendment that contained your phraseology and your words, which he said was the nonsense part of this whole directive."
"Perhaps you can correct him instead of correcting us."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m."
"Competition rules"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0217/2000) by Mr Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on competition rules relating to horizontal cooperation agreements [C5-0304/2000 - 2000/2154(COS)]."
"Mr President, perhaps I can begin by saying the introduction of the title of our debate no doubt had many Daily Mail journalists salivating, but the issues that we are considering are fundamental issues that go to the heart of what the European Union is all about."
"That is the development of a true, single market; because if we were able to achieve a true, single market, not only might we find more unanimity within this Chamber, but we should be well on the way to serving our constituents by ensuring that we achieve real economic progress in Europe."
"Therefore, this particular piece of legislation falls within that context."
"There are a number of ways in which competition policy is important in driving this agenda forward."
"The Commissioner, and I congratulate him for it, has seized the initiative in terms of the application of state-aid policy; we will be debating that in the second session in Strasbourg in connection with another report which I am currently taking before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The other major area that Commissioner Monti has been busy with is the modernisation of competition policy itself."
"We are awaiting the outcome of the Commissioner' s review of over 100 responses to his White Paper on the reform of restrictive trade practices and the abuse of market power."
"Earlier today I heard that we may receive the result before the end of this month; perhaps we will hear more from the Commissioner about that in due course."
"The reform that we are looking at, according to the Commission itself, forms part of the overall agenda of reform."
"Within that context, I want to say to the Commissioner that business is looking for a number of things."
"It is certainly looking for the things that the Commission was seeking consultees from about whether the current regulations have become too legalistic, too bureaucratic and could be simplified."
"I have no doubt that the Commissioner' s proposals will achieve that simplification."
"Business is looking for the development of confidence in the whole range of new mechanisms which the Commissioner is seeking to bring forward as part of its overall reform package."
"I would therefore ask the Commission how he sees this specific reform, which is not controversial, in the context of his wider reform of competition policy which, as he well knows, might be generously said to be slightly more controversial."
"May I turn to some of the detailed areas in the particular proposals that the Commission has asked Parliament to comment upon."
"Firstly, I welcome this process."
"The Commissioner is inviting Parliament to express its views in relation to the paper that was produced in April of this year."
"In essence there are a number of areas where, having agreed with the thrust of the reform being taken forward, I feel that the Commission might give the matter further thought."
"Firstly, I would like the Commissioner to explain why there is a contrast between the treatment of horizontal restraints and vertical restraints."
"I would like the Commissioner to indicate whether, in due course, it is his intention to see further exemption categories specified in the legislation."
"I have indicated that businesses are strongly of the view that the duration of exemption in the cases of research and development should be expanded up to a period of ten years."
"Since the Commission' s own papers make it clear that horizontal cooperation agreements are generally not made in order to work against the interests of consumers, I would be grateful to see what the Commissioner' s response is in that particular area."
"I would also be grateful to have clarification of the position regarding trade supplies, not least because that is an issue that troubles Mr Berenguer Fuster."
"I know he has tabled amendments in relation to that."
"I am particularly concerned to ensure that we take all steps to avoid a re-nationalisation of EU competition law and I would be grateful to hear what reassurances we can have from the Commissioner in that area."
"Finally, business would prefer a lengthier transition period; they would also prefer the Commission to look at more than just the market share in assessing market power."
"For these purposes what the Commission proposes may be appropriate, but deciding market power solely by assessing market share is too inexact a science."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Evans warmly for his report, and also for his statement just now, which has already placed this report and the Commission' s statement in the wider context of the necessary reform of competition policy."
"We know how rapidly the world economy is changing and so we are also aware of the increasing importance of research and development, the value of cooperation between companies, and the need for companies to specialise, and hence also the need for specialisation agreements."
"Competition is not an end in itself, as far as we are concerned, it is a means of achieving growth and employment, and if, like the Commissioner and ourselves, you champion a functioning single market organised along the lines of the social market economy, you do not favour unlimited competition, but competition governed by the necessary principles of political organisation, keeping in mind that we have a responsibility towards the future and our fellow human beings."
"The point has already been made today that these are very welcome reforms, that there is a need for companies to work together, and that the statement affords companies greater freedom as regards their cooperation agreements, and will allow for simplification, flexibilisation and liberalisation."
"That is what we have on the plus side."
"We are also critical of some aspects, and there are certain things we would like to see."
"The rapporteur touched on some of them, and I would like to explore them again."
"Firstly, Commissioner, we believe that, in view of increasing autonomy, the people hanker after legal certainty."
"I therefore ask myself whether treating horizontal restraints and vertical restraints differently will really lead to greater legal certainty, or whether it would not be better for both, to have a block exemption regulation."
"Secondly, it is our wish that the exploitation of the results should not be restricted to five years, but should be extended to ten."
"We urge you to make it perfectly clear, by including them in the guidelines, that reciprocal, or unilateral agreements on supply - 'trade supplies' for short - are not affected by the ban laid down in Article 81(2), and we take the view - which is also expressed in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - that you ought to consider the definition of market share."
"Which market do we mean?"
"The buying market, the selling market, the national market, the regional market?"
"We all know that the market is in a constant state of flux for the businesses concerned, and we also fear that guidelines 122 and 141 will set an arbitrary market power threshold of 15%."
"We feel it is important to increase this threshold, just as we believe that the length of the transitional period for introduction of these regulations should be increased to at least two years, so that your aspirations are fully realised."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Evans on his wonderful report and point out once again the large extent to which we have agreed on analysing the reforms of Community competition law as a whole, as well as the social consequences of competition."
"It is true that the great beneficiaries of an appropriate competition policy are the consumers, the citizens as a whole."
"We should not see this regulation as something that exclusively concerns companies; it is of interest to all of us as citizens."
"We also agree on our positive assessment of the Commission' s attempts to modernise and reform Community competition law."
"We must congratulate Mr Monti and the whole of the Commission on having the courage and bravery to complete a reform - which the Commission is determined to do - a reform that was started years ago."
"I have said in other interventions that, in my opinion, it is not only necessary but also takes us in the right direction."
"The Commission' s chosen path is the right one."
"Having been in force for 40 years, Community competition law had begun to show signs of exhaustion."
"There is no doubt whatsoever that the competition rules included in the Treaty, and in the law derived from it, have contributed significantly to the growth of a culture of competition, and have been fundamental to the creation of the single market."
"On the other hand, the Commission' s decisions and the judgments of the Court of Justice have enjoyed well-earned prestige in terms of achieving this aim."
"We must not forget, however, that those rules were initially alien to European law."
"The European legal tradition, especially the continental tradition, concentrated more on aspects relating to unfair competition; the free competition elements were imported from the United States."
"A Spanish business academic - Professor Garrigues - explained very graphically that the American soldiers who came to Europe to fight in the Second World War brought 'antitrust' legislation in their rucksacks."
"Now, those positive aspects could not disguise certain deficiencies which had traditionally been demonstrated by the experts."
"Perhaps the best-founded criticism referred to the rigidity of the rules."
"It is true that it was perhaps necessary at the beginning to apply the rules so rigidly, because new rules had to be applied, imported from the United States, in accordance with the continental legal tradition."
"I must add here that it is no surprise that Mr Evans' assessment and concern does not coincide exactly with that of his colleague in the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr Karas."
"Mr Evans is behaving more like an Anglo-Saxon lawyer, while Mr Karas has demonstrated the usual preoccupations of continental lawyers."
"I believe that this reform is more along the lines of Anglo-Saxon law and, despite being a continental lawyer, I agree with it."
"I am not so concerned about legal certainty as some people."
"Nevertheless, it is true that what was acceptable twenty or thirty years ago is not necessarily acceptable today."
"Today, the single market is a reality and the culture of competition is sufficiently widespread."
"Change was therefore necessary."
"It is no longer possible to apply competition rules which do not take account of the economic analysis and a consideration of the market' s power."
"In the field of vertical restrictions, the new regulations on exemption by category and the guidelines for their application have been approved."
"The time has now come to introduce reform in the field of horizontal restrictions."
"In this area, the Commission is now presenting us with two proposals for regulations, one on research and development agreements, and the other on the regulation of specialisation agreements, accompanied by guidelines."
"It should be noted, as the report does, that there is now an noticeable difference with regard to the treatment of vertical and horizontal restrictions since, in the case of vertical restrictions, there was a single regulation and guidelines which covered all the possibilities to which that regulation applied."
"With regard to horizontal restrictions, however, there are guidelines which are, to a large extent, broader than the two specific aspects regulated by the two proposals for regulations."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has presented Parliament with five amendments which express some of our concerns."
"Of these, I would draw your attention to our concern at the fact that crisis cartels are not dealt with. They were included in the previous legislation and have disappeared here without sufficient justification."
"I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of these amendments."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the reform, the Commission will be able to focus on tackling the conduct of those who hold power in the market, because it is that conduct which is genuinely anti-competitive and damaging to the market."
"I repeat that in this sense we are in agreement."
"It seems that we will finally be able to say goodbye to an over-rigorous and over-formal approach and welcome economic analysis into European competition law."
"Mr President, in the proposals which he has formulated in the report under discussion, our rapporteur, Mr Evans, is calling for the Commission to relax the competition rules for horizontal cooperation agreements between companies operating at the same market level."
"It would therefore appear that the Commission has a keener sense of fair trading than the European Parliament, despite the fact that, logically-speaking, the opposite should apply."
"It is the European Parliament which should be more sensitive to the social impact of competition policy."
"Especially as, even though we have the most stringent fair trading legislation, the real world in which we live is a world in which large monopolies abuse dominant market positions, in which mergers, take-overs and acquisitions by corporate behemoths are a daily occurrence, giving rise to monopolies of global proportions which almost always lay off thousands of workers and have a huge impact on employment and which then monopolise wealth-producing resources, markets and consumers."
"It is precisely because the real world is thus that we should be more careful and stricter when it comes to ensuring that horizontal cooperation agreements are treated and controlled in the same manner as mergers and vertical restraints."
"This being so, we are unable to vote in favour of the proposals calling for policy restrictions to be relaxed, as proposed by the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Evans on the quality and weight of his report."
"I would also like to express the Commission' s appreciation of Parliament' s consistently constructive attitude to competition issues, which we consider to be an important tool in the framework of the social market economy to which Mr Karas referred, the ultimate aim of which, as Mr Berenguer Fuster stressed, is to protect the consumer."
"Mr Berenguer has also grasped perfectly the line which the Commission intends to take, which is to focus more on economic analysis in developing competition policy, but, at the same time, as Mr Karas, Mr Evans and others have requested, we are endeavouring to provide the greatest possible legal certainty for businesses."
"Today' s debate concerns a major aspect of our attempts to modernise competition policy."
"On the one hand, the Commission has drawn up a revised version of the block exemption regulations on research and development and specialisation agreements, and, on the other hand, it has prepared draft guidelines on the applicability of article 81 to horizontal cooperation agreements."
"In this way, it is the Commission' s intention to codify the relevant case law and working practice as they have developed on the basis the evaluation of individual cases over all these years, without making any major changes to the criteria for evaluating horizontal cooperation agreements on the basis of Community law."
"These documents are therefore intended to clarify the criteria used to implement competition policy in this field, certainly not to alter them."
"I would like to stress this aspect, because there has been some criticism of the Commission' s proposal that it is masking a thorough revision of the line taken regarding the horizontal cooperation agreements."
"These allegations are completely unfounded."
"It is generally understood that agreements signed between competitors are likely to restrict competition to a much greater degree than other types of agreement."
"This is certainly the case where agreements between competitors are intended to set prices, divide up the market or limit production."
"We are certainly not attempting to make anybody think that horizontal agreements, which have severely negative implications for competition, will in the future be regulated less rigorously."
"However, in the absence of basic restrictions, it is necessary for the agreements to be examined in their economic context, so that it can be ascertained whether they would have a negative effect on the market."
"There is, however, clearly a need to update and clarify the regulations on horizontal agreements for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because these regulations represent a response to the present economic reality, for businesses have to react to increasing pressure from competition and adapt to a market which is in a constant state of flux."
"Cooperation can often be a way to share risks, save on expenditure, pool expertise and speed up the launching of innovations onto the market."
"It is an important tool, particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses."
"Consumers will benefit from these economic advantages, but only if effective competition is maintained on the market."
"Our second reason for revising the legislation in this area is the fact that clarification of the norms is essential for the success of our undertaking to modernise competition policy, an undertaking whose scope the rapporteur, Mr Evans, has grasped fully, and for this I am grateful to him, as I am for his reference to state aid, which is another, no less important element of competition policy."
"The line taken is similar to that recently adopted on vertical agreements, and primarily responds to two objectives: preventing the Directorate-General for Competition having to examine cases which have no bearing on competition policy, and enabling the businesses themselves to establish whether or not an agreement would restrict competition and whether it would be eligible for an exemption."
"The draft resolution shows that Parliament supports the aims of the reform."
"The questions raised by you and others contain extremely valuable suggestions."
"I am now, already, able to inform you that I intend to incorporate the majority of these suggestions."
"I shall, in particular, recommend to the Commission that it adheres to your opinion on three major points in respect of the block exemption regulations."
"Firstly, the maximum duration of the exemption for research and development agreements should be extended beyond the current limit of five years."
"However, a compromise does need to be reached between the businesses' interests in exploiting the results of their own research and the public interest, in guaranteeing competition on the new markets."
"I shall therefore propose to limit the duration of the exemption not to ten but to seven years."
"Secondly, the restrictions concerning the possibility of parties exploiting the results of research and development projects carried out jointly should be as few as possible, in order to encourage the movement of knowledge, which is instrumental in both technical and economic progress."
"I shall therefore propose, on the basis of your comments, that, as a rule, these restrictions be allowed to intervene only where they are to be applied to businesses which are not in direct competition."
"Thirdly, the transitional period should be extended."
"In this we can take the block exemption regulations on vertical agreements as an example and set a period of 18 months."
"Then, with regard to the guidelines, we will certainly be able to comply with your request to operate a clearer distinction between the guidelines for horizontal agreements and those for vertical agreements, and to be clearer in our handling of industrial supply agreements."
"The Commission intends to adopt the definitive version of the block exemption regulations and guidelines before the end of the year."
"This would avoid a legal gap forming after the current regulations expire, but it would also contribute considerably to keeping Community policy up to date."
"Mr President, this debate has touched on a number of other important, interesting points."
"I do not have the time to comment on all of them, but I would just like to make a couple of observations."
"Mr Theonas, you raised the question of mergers."
"The care with which the Commission has exercised its powers in the area of merger control cannot have escaped you."
"As we are required to do by the regulation, we are adhering rigorously to the criterion of prohibiting mergers where they would lead to the creation or consolidation of a dominant position."
"Often, this is not the case - there is no danger of it happening - partly because the businesses are aware of this requirement and propose remedies which can, on occasions, be extremely effective."
"Mr Evans raised the question of trade supplies."
"I agree that the treatment of industrial supply agreements needs to be elaborated in the guidelines."
"This will be done in the chapter on production agreements."
"Crisis cartels, Mr Berenguer, aim directly at reducing output and raising prices; they therefore always have a restrictive effect on competition."
"That does not exclude the possibility of such cartels being exempt under Article 81(3)."
"It would, however, only be possible after an individual examination of the case and the merits of the agreement."
"That is why it would be inappropriate to include these agreements in the guidelines."
"Finally, how does this all fit into the broader modernisation effort?"
"First of all I can confirm to Mr Evans that I expect the Commission to be able to adopt a proposal for a regulation to reform Regulation 17 of 1962 before the end of this month."
"That reform involves the elimination of the notification system."
"This, however, Mr Karas, should not reduce the legal certainty for companies."
"In order to ensure this, the Commission is clarifying its present substantive rules."
"We have already done so for distribution - vertical agreements - and we are now doing it for horizontal agreements."
"Our block exemption regulations and notices will give companies more certainty on the contents of our rules and in self-assessing their agreements in the spirit of an overall modernisation effort."
"This cannot be considered a renationalisation of competition policy but, more than in the past, it will benefit from the cooperation of the national in the cooperation of the national competition authorities and the national courts in the general effort of applying EC competition rules."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m."
"Environmental dimension in the development process"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0215/2000) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the Commission' s opinion on the European Parliament' s amendments to the joint position of the Council on the proposed European Parliament and Council regulation on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries (amending the Commission' s proposal) [C5-0283/2000 - 1999/0020(COD)]."
"Mr President, the regulation we are now to be discussing concerns the prior conditions for ensuring that, under the European Union's aid policy, better account is taken of the physical environment and of basic natural resources in conjunction with various development projects."
"This is an important issue because we know that economic growth can often have damaging consequences for the natural environment, either when natural resources are exploited, in the course of industrial production itself or when products are used."
"Environmental damage has harmful effects on public health."
"It is in danger of destroying biological diversity and may also entail damage which jeopardises the long-term productive capacity of natural systems."
"When and if that happens, the health of our economies is also affected."
"By thinking in preventive terms and by choosing methods and techniques which interfere with the environment as little as possible, growth can be combined with proper consideration for the environment."
"That is important in our own countries, but we still have a long way to go throughout the European Union."
"It is also important, of course, in the developing countries, especially in connection with the development cooperation initiated by the European Union."
"The requirements for integrating environmental considerations include extensive method development work and demonstration projects, as well as education and training, both of the Commission' s staff and of affected personnel in the recipient countries."
"The regulation we are discussing lays down detailed rules for this and makes a nice large sum of money available."
"This matter has been debated by Parliament twice before."
"At the last reading, there were significant differences between our own points of view and the proposal adopted by the Council."
"Conciliation was initiated, and we are now seeing the result of this."
"From Parliament' s point of view, I think we should greet the result of this conciliation with great satisfaction."
"We have achieved what we were aiming for in a number of important areas."
"Allow me to mention three important examples of these."
"First of all, the budget is near enough double the size of the original amount."
"We have gone from EUR 50 million to EUR 93 million."
"Secondly, the degree to which the Member States were to be involved in the implementation itself was a major issue."
"Parliament' s approach to this question was to opt for the least possible involvement, that is to say to make the Commission chiefly responsible for the implementation itself and to evaluate it subsequently."
"The compromise we have reached means that there is to be joint decision-making only in the case of activities involving more than EUR 2.5 million, when active participation on the part of the Member States is actually required."
"That is a good thing, in my view."
"If, as it ought to be, our aim is to simplify the provision of aid, remove the bureaucracy surrounding it and, in that way, close the gap between promises and commitments, on the one hand, and the activities carried out, on the other, it is essential that the Member States should interfere less in operational activity."
"With the conciliation we have achieved, we have taken a welcome step in that direction."
"Thirdly, we demanded at the second reading that the regulation should not be limited in time, that is to say that this type of activity should be planned on a very long-term basis."
"Now that the development process is to be evaluated after four years and decisions then taken about the future, I think, however, that we should be satisfied."
"Once the evaluation has taken place, we shall have every opportunity to establish guidelines, and more detailed guidelines than today' s, for this important activity."
"I therefore recommend that Parliament approve the result of the conciliation."
"Mr President, this draft regulation is one of the first regulations in the sphere of development policy to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure."
"The European Parliament has done justice to the weightier responsibility it bears by virtue of its increased decision-making powers."
"Many people felt that this regulation should be passed as quickly as possible, which has meant Parliament having to distance itself from many of its proposed amendments."
"The path we chose was undoubtedly the right one."
"We were able to make a few improvements to this draft regulation."
"One of the most important improvements - the rapporteur has already mentioned it - is that the potential activities provided for by this regulation are to be adequately funded."
"It was a great achievement on our part to secure an increase in the funding from EUR 54.4 million to EUR 93 million - i.e. it was practically doubled - even though we know that we would need a much larger amount to do justice to the importance of this issue in terms of our common future."
"But that would lead to a general political discussion, which would of course be beyond the scope of this regulation."
"Our proposed amendments enabled us to make a number of changes to Article 3, which is concerned with the nature of the measures to be carried out."
"I am disappointed that Parliament' s proposed amendment was not adopted, because it advocated dispensing with bank guarantees or credit safeguards if need be, in order to make the range of applicants and the target group as large as possible."
"Despite everything, I believe this represents a great achievement on Parliament' s part, and also on the part of the rapporteur."
"Mr President, eight years after the Rio conference, where the countries of the United Nations acknowledged that development and the environment were inextricably linked, the European Union is finally adopting regulations to ensure that the environment is integrated into the development projects of developing countries."
"Although we have cause to congratulate ourselves on the financial contribution agreed in the course of the conciliation - and I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group - the budget in question is still modest, given the considerable needs and still greater expectations of the populations concerned."
"Are we not merely salving our consciences by granting just a little more than EUR 15 million over a period of six years to developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and South America when we are aware of the social, economic and ecological conditions in these underprivileged lands?"
"This budget line, designed to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process, will be of no significance whatsoever if the environmental dimension is neglected in the case of other projects."
"I would like to remind you that sustainable development which integrates the environmental dimension fully is still, more than ever, the only model of development able to meet the requirements both of the underprivileged countries of the South and the polluted countries of the North."
"On behalf of the Commission, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, and the members of the conciliation delegation on having put together a compromise package which the Council has already formally adopted."
"The Commission supports the proposed regulation currently before you."
"It considers it a valuable instrument for carrying out strategic and pilot activities in the field of the environment."
"It is, of course, a supplementary instrument to the others at the disposal of the Commission."
"Fortunately, our activities in the field of environment and development are not limited to actions funded under this regulation."
"We are mainstreaming the environment in everything we do."
"Hence, we intend to use it in a strategic fashion focusing, in particular, on support for the various international environmental conventions."
"Plans to finance projects which will meet the objectives of the regulation are already advanced."
"Once it has been formally adopted and funds made available we will proceed to finalise agreements for their implementation."
"However, time will be against us since we are fast approaching the end of the financial year."
"Once more, I wish to thank Parliament for their work in ensuring the passage of this regulation and the interest that many Members have shown."
"I am confident that the regulation will provide us with a useful tool for ensuring that the environmental dimension is fully taken into account in our development cooperation."
"Sustainable management of forests in developing countries"
"The next item is the report (A5-0216/2000) by Mr Fernández Martín, on behalf of the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on a joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council regulation on measures designed to promote the conservation and sustainable management of forests in developing countries [C5­0284/2000 - 1999/0015(COS)]."
"Mr President, with this report on the regulation on the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and other types of forest in developing countries, and with the previous report by Mr Wijkman, Parliament is reaching the high point today, with the corresponding vote tomorrow, of its first exercise of its new codecision competences in the field of cooperation and development."
"It has taken the procedure a long time to come to an end, since we have spent almost three years on the first and second readings and on the debate in conciliation."
"As rapporteur, I would like to express my satisfaction that such a long period has been fruitful and has enabled us to reach an agreement on the text of the regulation which I am today asking Parliament to vote in favour of."
"We started from very different positions."
"Basically, the differences between Parliament and the Council concerned the budgetary funding of the programme, the timetable and commitology."
"Parliament had proposed, in previous stages of the procedure, numerous amendments which the Council and the Commission have accepted and I must say - it is fair to recognise this - that the Commission' s management of the previous programme, its high level of execution and its good results, have meant that the rapporteur, with the support of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, has been able to persuade the Council of the need to maintain the programme with a sufficient degree of funding to guarantee its success."
"The tropical forests and their various functions and usefulness to humanity can contribute to a large extent to the achievement of the Union' s aims, not only in terms of development and the environment, but also with regard to its objectives of fighting poverty and sustainable economic and social development."
"With the regulation, the European Union provides appropriate financial and technical aid with a view to promoting conservation and the sustainable management of tropical forests and other types of forest in developing countries, so that the forests may play their role as generators of wealth and social development with the sustainable environmental criteria which is expected of them at local, national and international levels."
"The regulation says that the sustainable management of the forests must seek to improve the living conditions and well-being of the populations within the limits of the capacity of the ecosystems, maintaining the natural heritage and its biological diversity."
"This must be done by promoting the active participation of the populations which depend on the forests and the local communities in the creation of policies and planning in the field of development."
"To this end, it is necessary to improve coordination and the flow of information between Commission projects - those that the Commission will present in the coming years - and those of the Member States, in order to achieve more coherent actions and therefore a more efficient use of resources."
"In terms of the budget, we should be pleased that, after the restrictions which, in general, have resulted from the plans for reconstruction in Kosovo, we now have a contribution of EUR 249 million, having started with an initial Council proposal of EUR 9 million, for a period of 6 years, from now until 2006."
"This will provide sufficient funding to fulfil the objectives, at least with the same efficiency with which they have been fulfilled during the period which is coming to an end now."
"Nevertheless, in the field of commitology the differing positions of Parliament, especially the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the Council are well known."
"Our position is more inclined towards giving greater competences to the Commission in this area."
"We have not managed to reach an agreement, since this agreement is waiting for the problem to be dealt with globally."
"However, at least the Committee on Development and Cooperation can feel satisfied because, on this question of commitology, an agreement has been reached which will allow us to establish the necessary budgetary estimates and a precise timetable for maintaining up-to-date information on the strategic guidelines and the priorities for implementing actions for the coming years."
"To sum up, Mr President, this is a sound agreement for a sound programme for the conservation of the tropical forests."
"Mr President, not only is the present draft regulation on measures to promote the sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries, very closely associated with the previous regulation in terms of subject matter, the political pressure and the political arguments used to rail-road this regulation through as quickly as possible are also reminiscent of what happened the last time round."
"In this case too, we opted for a conciliation procedure, notwithstanding all the prophecies of doom, and I believe we substantially improved the content of the regulation in the process."
"The active participation of the local communities and those who are directly affected, in the development of the national forestry policy and development planning, is now one of the objectives of the regulation, and this represents a major step forwards in terms of content, to my mind."
"Parliament has managed to secure adequate funding."
"The Council' s proposal earmarked a ridiculously low sum of EUR 63 million for the period between 2000 and 2006."
"Parliament demanded EUR 249 million for the same period and achieved it, making the point very clearly in so doing that it is unacceptable as far as we are concerned to play the reconstruction in the Balkans - as important as it is - off against EU development policy and development cooperation."
"It is vital that the Commission reports back to Parliament annually on the guidelines and priorities it has worked out."
"Together with Article 11 of this regulation, which lays down an annual reporting obligation in respect of financed projects and measures, this provides us with the basic tools we will need to draw attention, in good time, to disturbing trends."
"Mr President, my feeling is that the conservation of tropical forests should certainly be brought about through funding, contributions etc., but above all - and this is why the report appealed to me - it should involve the participation of the local peoples, providing them with ideas for a future for the forest and genuinely sustainable forest management."
"A few years ago, the magazine 'Nature' featured a study into a Peruvian forest and the best way to exploit it."
"This forest, like all tropical forests, boasted remarkable biodiversity: it contained a good 270 plant species in a single hectare, whereas a European forest can have as few as six or seven species per hectare."
"Now, this rich biodiversity - which, moreover, is not confined to plant species - has a financial consequence which is in itself truly impressive."
"However, there are different ways of accessing this potential source of revenue: for example, it is possible to cut down all the trees and sell the wood, which would bring in FF 5 000 plus another FF 15 000 from using the land as pastureland - which is what usually happens - or for crops."
"In this scenario, the land becomes poor in humus and desertification soon follows."
"On the other hand, another approach could be to exploit the produce of the land, such as fruit and the produce of the underwood, and to operate a system of controlled tree felling, which would produce an annual income of FF 2 000. In this case, the income would be regular, practically perennial."
"This is just one example to illustrate that I am a firm believer in the principle of providing services, technical information and advice on a modus operandi to these peoples, so that they can sustain their forests themselves, for I am sure that it is in their interest to operate in this way rather than conducting mass tree-felling operations and laying waste to vast numbers of these areas which are so valuable for our planet' s atmosphere."
"I would like to end by quoting an aphorism from Chairman Mao' s Little Red Book - which, although it is no longer popular can still be useful on occasions. It reads: ""Do not give a fisherman fish; teach him how to fish better"" ."
"On behalf of the Commission, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for his work on this regulation."
"I congratulate Mr Fernández Martín and the other members of the conciliation delegation for their efforts to achieve a satisfactory conclusion on the tropical forests regulation."
"The Commission supports the proposed text before you."
"As with the environment budget heading we intend to use the tropical forests budget heading strategically and in coordination with actions funded under the other instruments at the disposal of the Commission."
"At international level I envisage this regulation to be an important tool for the Community to promote the conclusions of the UN intergovernmental forum on forests."
"This area, as has been clearly expressed in these contributions, is crucial for biodiversity, for climate, and for our conscience in handing over an Earth that has these qualities to future generations."
"Anybody who has had the thrill of being in a real tropical forest will never forget the experience and we should certainly not deny our children that."
"Once more, I offer my congratulations to Parliament for this successful conclusion and I also wish to express my appreciation for the input it has made during the first and second readings of the regulation."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Complementarity on development cooperation policies"
"The next item is the report (A5-0227/2000) by Mrs Ferrer, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on complementarity between Community and Member States' policies on development cooperation [COM(1999)218 - C5-0179/1999 - 1999/2156(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in poverty, despite the gradual growth of world GDP over recent decades, the current tendency of Member States to reduce the funds intended for official aid to development in favour of direct investment, of which only 1% goes to the least-developed countries - which increases the gulf which separates those countries from the rich or developing countries - and the conviction that the globalisation process may increase the difficulties of the poor countries, are all factors which demonstrate the urgent need to improve the effectiveness of policies on development cooperation."
"In the field of democracy and respect for human rights we are also very far from the desirable parameters: coups d' états, violence, wars and violations of human rights are still realities in the least-developed countries."
"In this context, it is essential to strengthen the complementarity of policies on development cooperation implemented by the Community and the Member States."
"Firstly, because complementarity enables us to take advantage of the synergy resulting from a coordinated approach in the actions to be implemented, not only by the European Union but also by all the international donors, which will improve the impact of those actions."
"Secondly, because it contributes an element of added value to the Member States' interventions, which will help to optimise the resources destined for development aid and to achieve better results."
"Thirdly, because it would improve the visibility of the European Union and make its development policy more credible, which will allow it to exert the political influence it deserves as the main provider of funds - let us remember that between half and two thirds of development aid comes from the European Union - and both the NGOs and the recipient countries would like this influence to be greater given that nobody is more sensitive than the European Union in the field of social justice and human development."
"Lastly, improving complementarity is important because the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the Member States and the Community must coordinate their policies on development cooperation and harmonise their aid programmes."
"That is why we must take a positive view of the Commission' s presentation of the communication on the complementarity of Community and Member States' policies on development cooperation, since the measures it proposes may contribute to removing the obstacles which hinder significant advances in this area."
"In general terms, it can be said that the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and myself, are in agreement on the broad approach of the document and on the measures it proposes."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make some specific points. The first is that I consider that the Commission should have taken account of the fact that complementarity is not an isolated element, but should rather be dealt with within a context of a global strategy which also addresses the issues of coordination and coherence, since coherence is inseparable from coordination and complementarity, and, without coordination, complementarity is not possible."
"Therefore, I believe that, in order to really improve the impact of European development policies and safeguard the credibility of the Union, it would have been much more appropriate and would have made things much clearer if these aspects had been tackled jointly within the framework of the communication on development policy, since that would have better highlighted the essential and inseparable nature of these elements in relation to the formulation of a development policy in accordance with the Union' s objectives."
"My second point relates to the very concept of complementarity, which must not be viewed as a protective principle for preserving the competences of the Member States in this field, but as a manifestation of a political will to unite our efforts to improve and contribute more effectively to implementing the objectives of our policies on development cooperation."
"Furthermore, the need to ensure the unity, coherence and effectiveness of Union action in the field of external policy - which is also laid down in the Treaty - must extend to development policies, since these are an integral part of the Union' s external action."
"The Commission should therefore take the initiative and make a qualitative leap in that direction in order to allow the European Union to establish its strategic priorities in the field of development aid."
"Thirdly, I must say that it will be difficult for measures to strengthen complementarity, alone, to achieve the desired results."
"For that, the political will of the Council must, as a precondition, make progress towards greater integration in the field of cooperation, because what has hindered the progress of complementarity has been above all the fact that the Member States define their development cooperation policies more in accordance with their geo-strategic economic interests and their colonial pasts than with the objectives of the Union in relation to development."
"Lastly, we should repeat that, as well as the operative measures to improve the management of programmes, with which - as I have said - the Committee on Development and Cooperation is in agreement in principle, we believe that the Commission should take the responsibility for reflecting and making proposals, which is an essential requirement if the Union wants to direct aid not only towards promoting the economic growth of the beneficiary countries but also so that that growth will reach all sections of the population, thereby fulfilling its commitment to the development of peoples and, therefore, its commitment to peace, since, without development, peace will always be difficult to attain."
"In any event, and to sum up, I would like to reiterate the timeliness of this communication - even though we would have liked it to have been part of a global package - and say how fitting the measures are and that, together with the measures also proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation in my report, we hope that they will help to guide our action, providing better operational management."
"I should repeat once again that the Council must show signs of political will, without which it will be very difficult to make the principle of complementarity a reality."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer on having produced a balanced report."
"It is important that we recognise the role of the EU and the extent of its influence. We demand coherence and coordination."
"I would similarly like to say how satisfied I am that the importance of the work of NGOs, which work independently of governments, is being acknowledged and taken into account in development cooperation with the express purpose of strengthening civil society as a result of such cooperation."
"I also think that the recommendation that coordination should take place within the framework of the strategies selected by the target countries themselves is a healthy approach to the issue."
"When we speak of development cooperation, in the same breath it is a salutary exercise to remind ourselves that development cooperation is not an objective in itself."
"The objective is for the less developed countries to be able to sort out their affairs themselves, take responsibility for their own development, and act as societies in a manner that is just."
"And instead of hindering these opportunities, we should try to help put things right."
"At EU level, this means, for example, that our policy should not encourage countries to survive on the basis of just one product."
"Only those countries whose economy is in decent shape can benefit from globalisation."
"Those developing countries that struggle along on the basis of one product will run into difficulties."
"At EU level, we must also see to it that our values are reflected in our policy on development cooperation."
"Conditionality must have its place."
"Thus, we cannot aid countries that show no interest in their citizens' human rights or democracy."
"In other cases we have to confine ourselves just to humanitarian aid."
"I would also say it was vital that the EU should have a human rights secretary, in the manner of the Ombudsman, whose job would include observing the human rights situation in the less developed countries."
"At EU level we must really be aware of the political effects of aid, as we already know from experience that aid can be damaging."
"In fact the risk is considerable."
"We have to develop the sort of aid that by its nature prevents conflicts, and does not fuel them."
"Aid must be directed in such a way that it brings benefit to the worst-off of all."
"Crises caused by environmental problems must be able to be predicted, and aid should not be given in such a way that it stirs up conflict over natural resources."
"We have to learn to recognise those societies in which the risk of violence is associated with state-induced terror."
"In channelling aid we have to see to it that it does not prop up undemocratic state structures."
"Through the conditionality of aid we can prevent corruption and the oppression of certain groups."
"I know that the issue is not simple and that conditionality is an arduous and cumbersome exercise, but positive conditionality, as it is referred to, can achieve a lot."
"Experience has shown it."
"For that reason the EU should not shy away from it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before this debate we would have liked to ask the Council a question on the policy of complementarity. We tried to, but we were unable to."
"It has not been possible, and we regret this because the truth is, Commissioner, that on this matter you are not alone. There are also the Member States and the Council."
"In any event, I believe that the report which Mrs Ferrer has presented this afternoon is a sound report and, as she too has said, we would have liked to have a joint text."
"We are dealing with development policy in a piecemeal way and this prevents us from having an overview."
"Her report can, however, be considered to be an important contribution."
"This report is of an importance which transcends the material scope of development aid policy."
"As well as being a requirement of the Treaty, complementarity between Community aid policy and that of the Member States, is an invaluable instrument for helping the Union and the Member States to progress along a common path in the field of aid."
"We Socialists believe that development aid policy in general must be the flagship of Community external action and yet there is no such complementarity, apart from a few pilot projects."
"We are failing to use a mechanism which would to such a large extent maximise the resources, which are becoming scarcer, dedicated to aid as the political result of a joint effort, despite the repeated requests of this Parliament and the repeated resolutions of the Council itself, which basically has ultimate responsibility in this area."
"Complementarity is currently expressed in operational coordination on the ground and in the commitology procedure in Brussels."
"With regard to the former, I have already said that it is only applied in certain pilot projects."
"As for commitology, I will give you an example of how this is not working either: the Latin America committee has only met twice this year, instead of on a monthly basis which used to be the case and which would be necessary for it to work."
"Some of the programmes approved by this committee, such as the regional programme for the reconstruction of Central America in relation to Hurricane Mitch, are still to be implemented."
"There is a clear lack of political will to implement the measures which we decide on in Parliament, and that leads to inefficiency in the achievement of our political objectives, to a gradual paralysis of the functioning of the European institutions and to a bad image which, as the previous speaker said, is sometimes projected to the public."
"Complementarity with the Member States, coherence between Community policies and coordination between departments must form the basis of development aid policy if this policy is to fulfil this Parliament' s minimum requirements in terms of efficiency."
"There are problems with the diversity of instruments and the duplication of procedures, but the real problem is the lack of political will."
"As has been said before, the States must overcome their individual tendencies - which often reflect their concerns about former colonial relationships or other factors - and commit themselves to a common European project."
"If we do not adopt this policy, we will not be efficient in terms of development cooperation."
"The Commission now has the opportunity to include these elements in its reform and the Council has the historic responsibility to involve itself in the definition and implementation of Community policies."
"Both institutions can rely on the strong support of the Socialist Group in Parliament in relation to development aid policy."
"The policy of complementarity between national and Community policies has a total of 16 players (15+1)."
"Coherence between Community policies and coordination between departments within the Commission are intended to create what we wish to be the Union' s development aid policy, with the aim of improving the efficiency of European aid by helping to optimise the use of resources, both human and financial, and to make the European Union more visible, thereby making it more efficient and giving it a greater presence in the international community."
"We hope that all of this will be introduced with the reform and that we will have coherent, complementary and coordinated policies in order to achieve greater efficiency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Ferrer' s report deals with the Commission communication on complementarity between Community and Member State policies on development cooperation."
"I share her disappointment that we are discussing this in isolation."
"Instead, we should be having a searching debate on a global strategy for our cooperation with the Southern countries, which involves the triptych of complementarity, coordination and cohesion, also known as the three Cs, where Europe continues to fail so miserably. This, in fact, also goes for the Member States, because the European Member States simply refuse to take these values on board and prefer to stick to their own neo-colonial ideas."
"The lack of efficient Community development cooperation therefore serve the Member States as an excellent alibi for not having to attain complementarity, and certainly not coordination and cohesion."
"Some Member States make the bold claim that the Community should not adopt development policy but should delegate everything to the Member States."
"We certainly do not share this view."
"Anyone who is genuinely concerned about fair-minded world relations in terms of development must admit that, all too often, the Member States' own strategic and economic interests prevail over development interests."
"At best, they try to mitigate or alleviate the effects of economic policy pursued by the rich countries in the fields of globalisation, our need for raw materials, minerals, oil, etc."
"There is no doubt that we want poor countries to be included in the general economic and cultural developments in the world in the interests of the populations concerned and not only in the interests of the industrialised world."
"This is why we need to free ourselves from these neo-colonial dynamics and relations which feed dependency and destroy the environment."
"We need to abolish poverty in the world."
"This requires a global, multilateral strategy, which, first and foremost relies on the coordination of Member State and Community development policy in every country, in every recipient country and at international level."
"This is more important than complementarity."
"There is no doubt that a more coordinated policy would have a far greater impact."
"The contrast between the high level of European aid, which accounts for more than half of all aid globally, and the little political impact, for example upon ending armed conflict and severe violations of human rights, is really poignant."
"If coordination and complementarity were already in place in the recipient countries, donor countries would prefer to hoist their national flags there too."
"Is the Council actually prepared to change the system of comitology?"
"This, in my opinion, is a sine qua non."
"It will be a real challenge for the Commission to delegate EU responsibilites to our delegations based out there."
"If this fails, then opponents of the joint development policy are bound to press for abolition full stop."
"With regard to coordination at international level, we would welcome a European approach which can be different from that of the IMF and the World Bank."
"We do not want to be an extension of the Bretton Woods institutions."
"We want to play a leading role in the world."
"This is why these Member States should stop telling their electorate that nothing in Europe ever works."
"It is high time they acknowledged their own share of responsibility for these failures, but we should do the same."
"Mr President, we share the rapporteur' s view that, pursuant to Article 177 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the European Union fulfils an auxiliary role in the field of development cooperation."
"From this article, it is clear that there is no question of replacing the Member States' development policy."
"The EU aid policy is determined by the fifteen Member States and financed by contributions from the Member States, as established in the EU Treaty."
"In theory, this is a solid basis for a decisive and clear DC policy, with implementation to match."
"In practice, however, both leave something to be desired."
"The payments, for example, pose a problem."
"On the whole, two visions are to be distinguished between in the DC Council: that of the Northern Member States, which consider DC to be a valuable area of policy and which are, by and large, of the opinion that the EU DC is lacking in terms of quality, and that of the Southern Member States which consider DC to be merely an instrument of foreign and economic relations."
"These discrepancies are marginalised all too easily by the EU in the complementarity and coordination proposed by the rapporteur and the Commission."
"The reason why the Council and Member States suffer from a lack of 'political will' , as highlighted by the rapporteur and Commission, can therefore be found in this fundamental difference in approach to development cooperation."
"This is why at EU level, it is impossible to develop cohesive policy in this area."
"Finally, the Treaty terms the EU' s DC as supplementary to the aid from Member States."
"In our opinion, this means that the Commission should provide the added value over and above what the Member States can offer, such as granting emergency aid in emergency situations such as natural disasters and wars."
"Long-term programmes, on the other hand, fare better within bilateral, often historical relations between developing countries and Member States."
"In any case, the Commission should not act as the sixteenth bilateral donor, which is the case in practice."
"The European Union could, however, help coordinate Member State aid and intervene if the Member States fail to take any action."
"We therefore partly endorse the view that European coordination and complementarity are important, but we do not conclude from that that EU DC coordination adds something to what should be the actual objective, namely coordination which unites all relevant donors, preferably under the guidance of the recipient country or, if this is not possible, under the guidance of the UN or the World Bank."
"We will take a stance to this effect in the discussion on coordination and complementarity."
"Mr President, the fine report which my compatriot, Mrs Ferrer, is presenting us with today addresses a problem which has been highlighted on numerous occasions and, at the same time, the urgent need to resolve it and open up new avenues in the relations between the united Europe and the third world."
"The problem I am referring to is the notable lack of harmony and coordination in development cooperation action and policy between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and between some of the Member States themselves, on the other."
"What has been described and condemned by many authoritative voices and, in particular, by organisations that work in this area - and also by our own Parliament - is that over the years the different Member States have been acting independently in the field of cooperation, often according to individual national views and interests, sometimes honourable and sometimes less so, but in any event without any significant effort to be coherent and fairly distribute roles, not even in terms of providing mutual information and even less in terms of coordination."
"To sum up, there has been no effort to act rationally and efficiently so that the available resources, which are always limited, are not wasted and instead yield the best possible results."
"Furthermore, until very recently, the required effort has not been made to reasonably coordinate Community policy in this field with the policies that at the same time were being carried out by the 15 Member States, although this is certainly not exclusive to the area which we are dealing with. It was truly regrettable to see how Community actions were being implemented, sometimes without even an awareness of what each of the Member States was doing in relation to the relevant countries or sectors."
"The result was, and to a large extent still is, so far, disparate actions, overlapping in many cases, and even the duplication and incompatibility of what each of us is doing."
"This is absurd and is something of a disaster."
"This situation was naturally unsustainable and was one more problem to resolve, but that need has become all the more blatant and urgent given that the very process of European construction, the reforms and the progress of the Union, are making it essential that we act on the international stage as one country, with one voice, and given that it is an undeniable priority for the viability of our project that we implement a common foreign and security policy."
"In our opinion, anything we can do in the field of development policy is but a substantial part of this foreign and security policy."
"That is what Mrs Ferrer demonstrates, and the heading of her report highlights the key concept of complementarity."
"This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in Parliament, of course."
"The faults which we had noted were too obvious not to have been raised in previous debates."
"Nevertheless, by taking account of a situation which is particularly pressing, but also particularly favourable, we are taking an important step forward and we are doing so at a time when both the Commission and the Council seem convinced that we have to adopt specific measures in order to leave behind the previous situation and produce the coherence which will enable the resources which Europe intends for development cooperation to be more substantial, in both qualitative and quantitative terms."
"Furthermore, in this way, we will achieve for Europe a much more decisive role in the challenge, which is of such concern to us, of creating a fairer, more balanced and therefore more stable world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the same line as my predecessors, because, unfortunately, we cannot conceal the fact that the public image of European development cooperation bears no relation to the enormous amount of financial support that the EU itself and its Member States gives to the countries of the south."
"Although the EU is by far the largest donor, it comes off far worse in terms of people' s perceptions than do the large multilateral organisations, such as the UN and the World Bank."
"Approximately 60% of all financial aid comes out of the European pot."
"Complementarity, coherence and coordination are the notorious three C' s at the centre of the debate on European development cooperation."
"The European Commission' s financial housekeeping, which revealed a considerable amount of unspent funds, played no small part in re-igniting the reform debate."
"Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though."
"Nor can it be denied that there have been successes that should be shouted from the rooftops."
"Above all, it is practices that must change, which requires the necessary amount of political will on the part of all those concerned."
"Take Mozambique and the deployment of ECHO, for example."
"Right at the very start of the flood disaster at the beginning of February, ECHO rushed to the aid of the most vulnerable with EUR 750 000."
"Since then, a further EUR 9.65 million have been made available as emergency aid, and EUR 21 million are to be provided in addition, to deal with the consequences in the medium-term."
"There was a rapid reaction from the Member States too."
"The European Union and its Member States have provided a total of EUR 85 million in aid, whereas the UN contribution brought the overall international package to only EUR 115 million, including the European funds."
"What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C' s."
"Coherence can only be achieved if strategies and measures are brought into line."
"Complementarity and coordination are important pre-requisites for creating synergy."
"The juxtaposition of multilateral and bilateral development cooperation, on the other hand - which is in evidence in countries besides Mozambique - leads to completely unnecessary frictional losses, as I saw for myself when I visited the country a few weeks ago."
"Mrs Ferrer' s report contains a whole host of proposals and demands that deserve our unqualified support."
"I would like to highlight three points in particular: complementarity, coherence and coordination must be brought together in one uniform strategy because they are interdependent."
"The political leaders and the civil society of the partner States must have their decision-making powers strengthened, as must the EU delegation posts in situ, which is already happening with the elaboration of national indicative programmes within the scope of ACP cooperation."
"This will also require there to be improved cooperation between the delegations of the European Union and the diplomatic services of the Member States, which is a matter for the Council."
"We need to redouble our efforts, in order, not only to further coordination between the EU and the Member States in this sphere, but also with the international bodies."
"Since we provide the lion' s share of the funding for development cooperation, we are also entitled to clear recognition on the operational front and in terms of public perceptions."
"There have certainly been positive moves in this direction, but they must be developed, and consolidated in a definitive frame of reference."
"At the same time, we must overcome the burdensome legacy of colonial history, or the geo-strategic interests of individual Member States."
"The lack of political will on the part of the Member States represents the greatest obstacle to us being able to practise the three C' s satisfactorily, because they have no real interest in efficient, harmonised development cooperation, thereby tarnishing the European image and preventing us from optimising our potential as regards development policy, which reflects badly on the Member States themselves more than anything."
"Those in the European capitals ought to learn that strengthening Europe' s standing can do the same for their own image."
"I believe that complementarity and EU coordination are among our most important tools for increasing the effectiveness and impact of EU development cooperation on the ground."
"I therefore welcome Mrs Ferrer' s report."
"Parliament and the Commission share the same considerations and agree on the approach."
"We agree that we now need to see results."
"We need to increase internal EU coordination, country by country and sector by sector, following the 1998 guidelines on operational coordination."
"We should help partner countries in their efforts and reinforce the role of EU coordination as regards wider global coordination between donors, whether they be the World Bank, United Nations organisations or bilateral governmental or non-governmental organisations."
"The Commission has already taken the first step."
"We have adopted a harmonised framework for the elaboration of the country strategy papers."
"We will use this framework in future programming exercises."
"The country strategy papers will guide us when reviewing our assistance programmes."
"They will indicate how Community assistance fits in with what other donors are doing."
"These country strategy papers are the first practical tool, not only for improved donor coordination and complementarity, but also for overall coherence of development cooperation policy with other EU policies."
"The country strategy papers should also steer us in the right direction for achieving an optimum division of labour between the Commission and Member States."
"Collectively, we should be able to respond to most of the essential needs of partners in the developing countries."
"The move towards sector-wide programmes will greatly facilitate this process."
"I also hope it will produce greater cost effectiveness."
"However, if we are to succeed in this, our Member States must join forces and participate in this exercise."
"The quantitative aspect of how much each and every Member State is mobilising and putting into this effort is also part of our collective success or collective failure."
"Let me comment on some details of your report."
"Firstly, I note that at several points in the resolution, the issue of complementarity is placed within a broader framework connected with a need for greater consistency between the various policies of the EU."
"I agree."
"This is the reason we speak about the policy of the three Cs: complementarity, coherence and coordination."
"On coherence - which we have often discussed - we have now established the coherence focal point in the Directorate General for Development."
"It has been operational since the start of this month and we are using it and we would like others to do the same whenever a problem seems to exist concerning coherence."
"I should also mention that today is a big day for coherence in our development policy and trade policy."
"The Commission, having talked about quota-free or duty-free access for essentially all products from least developed countries; has decided to drop the word ""essentially"" ."
"From today the Commission has a clear policy."
"It is now up to the Member States."
"We are offering, for all products, quota-free, tariff-free access for the least developed countries."
"This is a very good decision."
"Secondly, I welcome your wish to strengthen coordination between the Community and the Member States in international forums and at international conferences."
"We, in the Commission, share your concern."
"It is paramount that we improve the effectiveness and visibility of the EU at international level."
"This has been demonstrated at several conferences: we work well together and we represent a constructive progressive force at global level."
"I have been invited to participate in the development committee in the World Bank."
"No Commissioner has tried that before."
"Next May we are organising a conference with Unctad, in this Chamber, on the least developed countries and we are also organising a conference with WHO and UNAIDS on 28 September concerning malaria, HIV-AIDS and tuberculosis, the three major communicable diseases."
"We also work well with our partners at multilateral level."
"Thirdly, specifically relating to the recommendations of the motion for a resolution, I welcome your support especially on two essential issues: firstly, human resources and, secondly, the role of management committees in development cooperation."
"The lack of human resources is a serious and real problem that for too long has been ignored."
"It has come back to haunt us and now requires action."
"We are continuing our efforts at the Commission to improve the effectiveness of our services."
"We are radically changing how we do things but this is not enough."
"We also need the human resources to match our programme resources and ambitions."
"Your support here will be crucial when the budgetary decisions have to be taken."
"As regards the Member State committees that work in parallel with the Commission in the management and implementation of the development programmes, we believe that their key role should be to discuss political priorities and overall strategy with us."
"It should not be to micromanage the process or examine individual projects as is, unfortunately, still the case."
"We need to find more effective ways of working together."
"The support of Parliament is also vital."
"It was said in the discussion here that some Member States want to dismantle what we do collectively."
"I do not think this is the case."
"In any case, Member States warmly welcomed the overall policy statement which is the basis for what we do."
"We also have a clear commitment on the ninth EDF and the financial perspective."
"Compared with any other major worldwide donors, the Commission - and what we do together in Europe - is backed financially in a much more predictable and solid way."
"This also puts a heavy responsibility on our shoulders but, the basis is that we are not only the biggest but also the most predictable and stable donor to work with."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work."
"This is a very useful report and I am determined to move forward on complementarity and will use the new tools available: the country strategy papers, the new and improved programming systems and a more effective management of external assistance, which also includes greater responsibility for our delegations in third countries."
"I am confident that the European Parliament will provide us with the necessary support in these endeavours."
"I look forward to continuing to work with you in an open and constructive manner."
"The reform process is now moving."
"We know what kind of battles to fight and, with your support, we are also going to win them."
"Today we can be proud that we are doing all this and, hopefully, tomorrow we will also have reason to be proud of how we are doing it."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Trade in goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0228/2000) by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation No 3448/93 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products [COM(1999) 717 - C5-0095/2000 - 1999/0284(CNS)]."
"Mr President, the proposal for a regulation before us relates to the scheme specifically covering exchanges of non-Annex 1 products with third countries, the main provision of which is for the granting of export refunds in respect of incorporated agricultural products."
"Annex 1 of the Treaty defines the list of products eligible for a COM under the CAP."
"These are basic agricultural products and products that have undergone initial processing."
"Non-Annex 1 products are those that have been processed a second time."
"The problem which has now come fully to light and which the Community has to deal with as from this year is the fact that, because of the consolidations granted by the Community under the Marrakesh agreements, refunds are no longer sufficient in relation to needs."
"The Commission cannot be said to have been overly imaginative in seeking solutions to this difficult problem, where a lot is at stake for our manufacturers and processors of agricultural products."
"Other than simply withdrawing certain products from the list of those eligible for refunds and in that way causing difficult administrative problems for the sectors concerned, one solution alone presents itself, as usual: that of extending the system of active improvement which allows agricultural raw materials to be imported at the so-called world market price, as long as the processed products in which they are incorporated are re-exported."
"No alternative solution to the system of refunds on agricultural products has been seriously looked into."
"Other windows onto the subject, opened by certain Member States such as Germany and Austria, were immediately closed again, since any alternative proposal was declared out of hand to be incompatible with the constraints to which we have subjected ourselves under the GATT agreement."
"In the circumstances, we obviously have to give primary consideration to the size of the sector concerned and to the volume of exports."
"Rapidly increasing exports of non-Annex 1 processed products alone represent 25% of total exports of products from the food and agricultural sector as a whole, and 2.5 million jobs, widely distributed among the different countries of Europe, depend upon this single sector."
"For these products, additional access to agricultural product refunds at least constitutes a partial, quick fix solution which, in the absence of alternative proposals, makes it possible immediately to guarantee the competitiveness of non-Annex 1 products."
"The parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has maintained that the ways in which the additional agricultural product refunds were applied should be determined in such a way as effectively to enable companies to have recourse to these within the acceptable limits laid down by the supply balances. In this way, it would be possible to maintain a sufficient quantity of refunds for companies which cannot make use of these, either in order to avoid GMOs or because of the unavailability of raw materials on the world market or the lack of staff or appropriate infrastructures."
"That said, agricultural product refunds present a range of risks and disadvantages."
"First of all, a disadvantage in terms of principle: agricultural product refunds do, indeed, by their nature circumvent the Community' s expressed preference."
"The European agri-foodstuffs industry ought to be encouraged to give preference to Community raw materials."
"This implies that, despite the extension proposed to us, the agricultural product refunds ought definitely not to become a structural tool but ought to remain a residual scheme and a last resort solution, to be implemented only when there is a real shortage of refunds."
"That is why we are proposing a series of amendments which ought to be taken into consideration overall to reinforce this residual character of the agricultural product refunds."
"We believe that any extension to the agricultural product refunds should be subject to very strict supervision and follow-up."
"That is why we are in favour of establishing quotas for the scheme."
"That is why we are also proposing that, at the end of the first year in which the scheme has been implemented, the Commission should present the European Parliament with a precise interim report providing, in particular, an update on the situation regarding each COM concerned."
"In that way, we shall have a tool of superintendence and control with which to ensure that agricultural product refunds are of limited availability, that the amounts concerned are no more than are really needed, that they do not have an adverse effect upon our own producers of raw materials and that they are not concentrated upon a limited number of COMs at the risk of destabilising these."
"A second disadvantage of the system of agricultural product refunds is the particular complexity and the cumbersome procedures it imposes upon SMEs in particular."
"The latter ought to be given easier access to these refunds, which remain more straightforward to administer, and, in this context, they ought to be exempted from presentation of certificates up to an adjustable ceiling of EUR 50 000 per year."
"Bear in mind that the refunds, particularly for processed food products, are far from being reserved solely for large businesses."
"They play an essential role where SMEs are concerned."
"These, then, are the component elements of a genuine monitoring tool which we think it essential to implement in order to ensure that the new agricultural product refunds are operating in accordance with the objectives which justify our agreeing to them."
"In the longer term, however, there will only be a lasting solution to the issue we are to deal with today as a matter of urgency if, when the WTO agreements next come up for renewal, Community negotiators receive clear instructions to the effect that adequate account must be taken of the interests of our non-Annex 1 products and that the close links forged by our processing industries with our producers of agricultural raw materials and their countries must be maintained and consolidated."
"Mr President, the Commission' s plans to slash export refunds will cost the EU' s food and drink processors an estimated EUR 145 million per year."
"It is particularly galling that the decision to impose these cuts was taken without consultation with this House."
"Export refunds are not a subsidy."
"They compensate the food and drink industry for sourcing their raw materials within the EU at higher prices than can be obtained on world markets."
"It is astonishing that the Commission chose to single out German fruit yoghurt, Scotch whisky and pharmaceutical products for these cuts, apparently for no better reason than the belief that these are wealthy industries which do not deserve assistance."
"Other sectors, such as pasta, confectionery and some dairy products that also receive export refunds, have escaped relatively unscathed."
"This is deeply unfair."
"The cuts are damaging to EU industry and they will destroy the competitive advantage of our agri-foodstuffs sector and they will destroy jobs."
"The Commission' s scheme to compensate food processors for losing out on export refunds, by encouraging them to seek inward processing relief on a range of commodities from outside the EU, is both muddle-headed and inept."
"Not only does the scheme encourage processors to import grain and other raw materials from outside the EU - once again to the direct disadvantage of our beleaguered farmers - but it also involves a mountain of red tape and bureaucratic complexity which will virtually exclude SMEs from this scheme."
"The Commission must devise a new system."
"Those food and drink exporters who through adding value to their products, constitute a vitally important part of the EU agricultural economy must receive alternative compensation exactly equivalent to the value of the export refunds they have lost."
"To do otherwise will place EU food processors at a massive competitive disadvantage on world markets."
"Export refunds are essential to ensure the international competitiveness of non-Annex - I processed food. In addition, the food and drink processors in the EU purchase around two-thirds of all their agricultural produce within the 15 Member States."
"This deliberate attack on non-Annex - I export refunds further undermines our farmers who are suffering their worst recession in decades."
"It is also a direct attack on the fastest growing export sector within the EU, our processed food sector."
"We are committed to 36% reduction of export refunds over six years and we are nearing the end of that period under our obligations in the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement."
"However, these cuts should not be targeted in such an arbitrary manner on a small number of industries, as the Commission has chosen to do."
"Access to IPR offers only a very unsatisfactory and temporary solution."
"I congratulate Mr Souchet in drawing up a good report in the face of Commission intransigence on this issue."
"He is fundamentally correct in describing the Commission proposal as a temporary measure."
"There is no doubt that the whole system now needs to be dismantled and rebuilt in a much more sensible and less complex manner, in line with our WTO and GATT requirements."
"Mr President, this proposal relates to an extremely delicate area."
"We simply have to note that, basically, the system of inward processing breaks with the principle of European preference or, if you like, the system of Community preferences."
"This is a very delicate area and, furthermore, the system of inward processing, in its application, is extremely complex and slow and therefore harms numerous small- and medium-sized businesses."
"In this delicate area, our decisions, as politicians, should be directed towards maintaining the competitiveness of the European food industry in the world and towards strengthening the close links between the processing industry and the producers of raw materials."
"The greatest responsibility in this area falls to the Commission."
"We require a creative and flexible Commission, capable of judging changes in the markets, measured and, at the same time, imaginative."
"We need a Commission which gives priority to the European farm model and the defence of small farmers, but the truth is that so far all the Commission has demonstrated in this area has been its opacity, its discretionary approach to legislation and very little else."
"As for the European Parliament, Mr President, both the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development and its chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, have worked seriously and prudently on this difficult report."
"Mr Souchet has produced a wonderful report, and I congratulate him on his work as rapporteur. He has been correct, specifically in his proposals to limit and rationalise the use of the system of inward processing by adapting it to the situation of the markets, the regulatory framework and the budgetary framework."
"All of this is correct, as well as his demands for exemptions in favour of small exporters."
"Many thanks, therefore, to the rapporteur and the European Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will improve its work in this area."
"Mr President, the Commission is proposing changes to trade arrangements for processed agricultural products."
"The purpose is to end subsidies and restrict them by means of a certificate."
"There are two fundamental courses of development behind this: on the one hand, the pressures caused by the liberalisation of world trade on reducing export aid and, on the other, the EU' s internal budgetary pressures mainly associated with external relations."
"The food processing chain and, ultimately, the farmers, are going to foot this bill."
"Already the market situation is putting immense pressure on the European producer."
"In addition, costs are rising thanks, for example, to higher fuel prices and increasing environmental and other obligations."
"Profitability in production is shaky, and this rather pointedly begs the question as to whether agricultural production in Europe makes sense any longer."
"Our committee and the European Liberal Democrats believe that the EU must safeguard the profitability of the production chain."
"The Commission is proposing selective deterioration."
"We are, however, in a position of constraint."
"It may be necessary to act in this way, but certain principles have to be adhered to in this issue."
"The changes must take account of small companies active in this sector of industry."
"For example, in the country I represent large export companies simply cannot exist, owing to the country' s small population."
"There should be some flexibility in setting the restrictions in respect of export aid procedures."
"For that reason, the wording of Amendment No 8 is justified."
"It provides a degree of flexibility, especially for small companies."
"I would also like to make the comment that by replacing cuts in export aid with inward processing and additional procedures the effects will be unevenly spread, in that a heavy burden will fall on the remoter EU countries in terms of transport costs."
"For that reason I agree with the rapporteur that, in the long run, these procedures will not work."
"This is a question of temporary solutions only."
"Our group supports the committee' s amendments."
"Mr President, when the Commission' s proposal landed on the table we rubbed our eyes a little in disbelief."
"'Active processing trade' - what on earth does that mean?"
"Once I had immersed myself more deeply in the subject, I was amazed to learn what this was all about."
"It had been clear up until now: industry buys products produced in the EU and is then given export refunds in order to be able to compete on the international market."
"Now the Commission is saying that there is no longer enough money, however, because we entered into a commitment in Marrakech and now we are going to have to rethink the situation."
"Then they have a brainwave to the effect that industry will no longer buy agricultural raw materials on the EU market but on the world market instead, which the EU, for its part, will export its raw materials onto, and in dumping its goods will also be partly responsible for world market prices."
"They think that industry will now be able to buy there, local products will stay where they are, and industry will then make refined products from the aforesaid local products and bring them onto the world market."
"We were absolutely convinced at first that there was no chance of this working."
"Then we gave the issue every attention in committee, but the view I have just described to you is that of the Commission."
"Subsequently, we tried to discuss whether or not it would be possible to sell products produced within the EU at world market prices, as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries do, so that, at the very least, the products we sometimes have an abundance of - although we do not produce surpluses overall, there is an abundance of produce in certain sectors - could be reduced."
"But no, they did not want to float this idea at the WTO negotiations."
"An apparently elegant solution was being proposed, which undermined the WTO negotiations somewhat."
"There is a passage in the explanatory statement of this regulation which states that the Community preferential arrangements must not be undermined, nor must there be disturbances to the European market."
"When I buy products elsewhere, which are available here in abundance, then of course I cannot assume that there will be no disruption to the market."
"It seems to be a compromise solution, and my group is unable to accept it in its present form."
"I would like to offer my compliments to the rapporteur."
"Mr Souchet is someone who can always be relied upon to speak up for agricultural interests. His approach may, from time to time, be a little on the traditional side for my taste, but I am full of admiration for him."
"You have done your level best for rural farming in Europe, and that is the spirit in which we will vote for the proposed amendments that we put forward in committee."
"We endorse your report, but we intend to reject the legislative resolution."
"We had to draw the line at this point, at the very least, because, overall, we do not think it is a balanced and reasonable solution, and on the whole, we feel, and fear, that if this mechanism is implemented, prices within the EU will come under direct pressure once again."
"We will lead the next discussion we have on prices and the next discussions we have about whether prices of our products within the EU are pitched too high."
"But what we in fact need to discuss, is whether the sale prices on the world market call for a price discussion, because no one in the world can produce goods in an environmentally and socially responsible manner under these conditions."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, makes a number of accurate comments as regards the impact of the proposed amendments to Regulation 3448/93 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products."
"If the proposed amendments are accepted and the inward processing arrangements are opened yet further, Community preference, which has already deteriorated, will no longer apply in practice and it will be more difficult to place processed Community agricultural products on international markets; small- and medium-sized units relying on Community agricultural produce and Community export refunds stand to lose and large processing units buying cheap raw materials from third countries stand to gain."
"The brunt of this adverse impact will be felt in the Mediterranean countries, including Greece, because these are the countries which produce these products and most processing units in these countries are small- or medium-sized."
"It would be an affront, having created such an unfortunate situation, if we were to accept the proposed amendments to the regulation, even on a provisional basis, i.e. until the WTO agreement is completed, on the pretext of safeguarding employment and the value added."
"That is why, despite the fact that we agree with many of the rapporteur' s findings, we disagree with his conclusion on the opening of inward processing arrangements, even on a provisional basis, precisely because we believe that, under present circumstances, provisional measures will turn into permanent measures and will exacerbate the situation."
"Mr President, according to this regulation, the Commission is stuck with a limited budget, and this is due to a complex of three reasons: firstly, the guaranteed prices for agricultural products of European origin; secondly, export refunds to companies which sell these agricultural raw materials in processed form on the world market; and thirdly, the agreements within the WTO."
"Mr Souchet is right in pointing out that it is not so much the limited budget but rather the WTO rules which are playing tricks on the Commission."
"In the case of shortages of raw materials on the internal European market, the food industry can import these from the world market without any import duty and under inward processing arrangements, as has been the case to date."
"But the regulation changes the essence of inward processing."
"A shortage of raw materials no longer justifies the use of inward processing, but rather financial motives, namely reaching the WTO ceiling."
"Suppose there was a surplus of cereals on the internal market whilst the ceiling of refunds had been reached."
"Inward processing would then open the door to cereal imports from the world market."
"There is a very real danger that the relationship between the food industry and the farmer then changes from one of partnership to one of competition."
"European farmers are not just producers of agricultural products; very often they also maintain our cultural landscape, but at a price."
"We should be very much aware of that price, which is passed on to the food industry."
"It requires creativity to find sound solutions for farmers and industry within the strict boundaries of the World Trade Organisation."
"It is inevitable that some industries will lose their export subsidies in the process."
"A number of industries process only a small proportion of their agricultural products into finished products."
"It is unfair in my eyes that they should complain, especially in view of the high profit margins they submit each quarter."
"Small exporters, on the other hand, deserve more protection."
"We back the amendments which have their interests in mind."
"Together with the rapporteur, we would call on the Commission to keep a close eye on the balance between agriculture and the food industry in Europe during the forthcoming negotiations within the framework of the WTO."
"Mr President, the Commission' s proposal to reduce refunds for processed agricultural products and to make inward processing easier carries considerable risks."
"I shall highlight just three of them."
"The first is that this proposal is not driven so much by the restrictions imposed by the WTO, but particularly by the well-known budget restrictions currently being applied in the European Union, specifically due to the need to reallocate means and resources to commitments that the Union has given in the field of external affairs, notably Kosovo."
"These objectives are not under threat."
"They will have to be addressed in a transparent way during the major debates on the European Union' s options."
"What is not acceptable is that little more than a year ago, the Financial Perspectives up to 2007 were approved, and now, a few months later, resources that had been earmarked for agriculture are being withdrawn."
"The second risk is that the increasing use of inward processing could put us in the extremely dangerous situation of no longer producing many agricultural products within the European Union, since it would be more profitable to import them in their raw state, process them and re-export them."
"Only a few sections of society would benefit from this and it would spell disaster for agricultural communities."
"In the long term, the European Union' s dependence on external supplies in a sector as strategically important as food production would make the Union as a whole extremely vulnerable."
"It would therefore be a foolish mistake to think that the practice of inward processing could be a lasting solution."
"The third risk relates to our negotiating strategy for the Millennium Round."
"This week, the Commission has approved a document on the competitiveness of our exports, which reveals its fundamental position on the various types of export aid."
"The Commission' s position is quite clear: the European Union will not in future accept reductions, within the WTO, only in support for export refunds - there will also have to be reductions in all types of support provided by our main competitors in the international markets, ranging from export credits to food aid and state-run businesses."
"All this will have to be ""put on the table"" and reduced under the GATT rules."
"The European Union' s stance on this issue is totally correct: all types of aid which have a similar effect must come under the WTO rules, not only the refund system used by the European Union."
"It is in this context of external pressure that the European Union is applying in the framework of the GATT, that is, the WTO negotiations, that it seems to be a mistake to have presented this proposal at this time."
"To conclude, I should simply like to thank Mr Souchet for the tremendous job he has done, which we greatly appreciate."
"Mr President, in complimenting Mr Souchet on his work, I express my disappointment and concern with regard to the Commission proposal to reduce subsidies worth EUR 145 million per year to the food and drink industry."
"This proposal has serious implications for Ireland' s dairy sector and will result in a serious loss of trade, particularly in the area of the reprocessing of dairy products."
"I fully support the rapporteur in his proposals that the measure should only be introduced on a temporary basis and that aid should be introduced to cushion the effects on the sectors which are most affected."
"I have given the example of Ireland' s dairy industry and would ask the Commissioner to examine the implications for this sector in particular."
"I also support the provisions in Mr Souchet' s report which states that we must ensure respect for the European agriculture and food production model."
"It is only right and proper that we negotiate a new regulatory framework for exports or products not covered by Annex I as part of the WTO Millennium Round."
"Mr Souchet is correct when he states that the decision to cut export refunds for certain products is unacceptable because such arrangements originally contributed to the management of the internal market."
"This situation in fact was validated by the World Trade Organisation."
"I believe that the proposed opening of on additional facility for raw materials that have access to inward processing arrangements will not be sufficient to cover the food industry supply and export requirements."
"Long-term, Europe needs to exercise greater vigilance in relation to world trade - which is now under consideration - and how decisions taken there impact on our processors and on our farmers."
"There is sufficient evidence that our competitors in the world market, particularly the United States and New Zealand, are not always as committed to adhering to the rules as are the EU Member States."
"With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe, we must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which, of course, is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive player in world trade."
"Already our competitors have demonstrated their negotiating skills in this crucial area of international policy."
"Mr President, you really have to rub your eyes two or three times when you read what kind of proposal the Commission has come up with by way of a solution to these problems, which have been discussed time and again."
"It is absolutely true what Mr Souchet, as rapporteur, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to say on the subject."
"They have my unequivocal support."
"On the other hand, however, there can be no doubt that the bottleneck in the budget and also the special WTO agreements represent a completely new challenge at the end of the day, particularly where export refunds are concerned."
"Who would have thought, even as little as a year ago, that we would be facing this conundrum, and having to weigh up the interests of agricultural product processors against those of the farmers who produce the products."
"If the Commission is now looking for a way to resolve this export bottleneck in products that are not covered by Annex I, then it is certainly responding to a need."
"Yet there is not the slightest suggestion in the Commission proposal that the problems facing the raw materials producers, i.e. the farmers, have been registered."
"I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet."
"Thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report."
"He rightly complains that the Commission is offering no alternative courses of action."
"One thing is for sure though, there must be no restriction in the availability of raw materials at competitive prices, and at the end of the day, agricultural policy cannot be devoted exclusively to the protection of the raw materials producers."
"But then nor should the burden fall on one side alone in agriculture, or have to be borne by individual products."
"There are agricultural products that almost pay for the export refunds themselves, at the end of the day, owing to contributions from the producers, i.e. the farmers."
"Sugar is a case in point."
"The farmers' contributions go into the general melting pot of the EU budget on the revenue side, and if export refunds are cut then these contributions will decline too."
"As I said, sugar is a particular case in point."
"I feel we must give special consideration to this issue, and give it priority where export refunds are concerned."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, on his report, because there was only one possible response to the Commission proposal, which was not a good proposal, and that was a powerful parliamentary response, which is what we have."
"I am extremely pleased with it."
"It is also providing us with the opportunity to examine the situation we currently find ourselves in, as we are being forced to adapt regulations on two counts, which means that we sometimes need to adopt working methods which are not our own."
"The first point is agreements reached at WTO level and the second one could be the budget."
"I would like briefly to explain both, starting with the WTO rules."
"It is becoming clear - poignantly so - given the price level in the EU but also outside, that we still need refunds, and there is also an indication that the difference in power between producers and farmers worldwide and those who sell their products is still far too pronounced."
"As long as this is the case, we cannot in fact do without refunds."
"This will also need to be spelled out clearly during the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"The second point concerns the budget."
"It does not seem right to me to use this in the argument regarding the refund regulation and processed agricultural products."
"Why?"
"Because the European Union has, for a number of years, awarded refunds to Member States because it simply was unable spend it all itself."
"Surely, this cannot be the argument."
"Secondly, Parliament made it abundantly clear in its report on the 2001 budget, which was adopted in the Agricultural Committee, that there is extra scope within the framework of the financial agreements of Berlin."
"In these agreements, a number of proposals have been made for a number of export certificates in order to solve this problem. For example, an extra five million has been proposed for cereals in the form of spirits, an extra ten million for cereals and rice, eleven million for sugar and isoglucose and eleven million for processed dairy produce."
"So the money is available and the solution should thus be in sight."
"The fact remains that the agricultural policy is, in principle, there for the benefit of farmers."
"This is why it has been framed with the European rural areas in mind."
"The fact that this regulation is necessary also illustrates the close relationship between the processing industries in Europe and the farmers."
"In this sense, an interim regulation is essential."
"But I should add that, quite clearly, we should drive home the message to the processing industry that, first and foremost, we rely on products which are grown within the European Union."
"In addition, I should also call on the Commission to give due consideration to small- and medium-sized businesses."
"In many heavily agricultural regions, jobs are already thin on the ground, so it is precisely those companies that should be able to cope with this type of regulation and should, in that sense, be given more attention."
"On behalf of the Commission and in particular my colleague Mr Liikanen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the preparation of your report."
"I hope that your deliberations will lead to a consensus that opens the way for a rapid implementation early in the new budgetary year."
"We all agree on the need to promote the Union' s processed food industry competitive position."
"Export refunds are an important instrument in sustaining the industry' s competitiveness by compensating for high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union."
"However, both budget constraints and commitments under the WTO severely restrict available refunds that will no longer be sufficient to cover the industry' s export opportunities."
"It is for this reason that the Commission has proposed, within a balanced package of specific measures, an additional facility of inward processing relief - IPR - that will help compensate for the industry' s loss of international competitiveness."
"The Commission can agree with your proposed Amendments Nos 2, 6, 10, 13 and 15."
"The Commission can broadly agree with the purpose of Amendments Nos 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 but does not consider them entirely appropriate for a number of reasons."
"For WTO negotiations, a specific mandate from the Council is required therefore the present regulation does not seem to be the appropriate means of determining the Union' s position."
"This relates to the first of the amendments."
"Furthermore, some amendments could entail an administrative burden related to implementation and control that would appear disproportionate."
"This concerns Amendments Nos 3, 11 and 14."
"The threshold for exempting small exporters from the export refund certificate system has already been increased to EUR 50 000, which concerns Amendments Nos 7 and 8."
"The remaining flexibility under the 2000 budget has already been used, which relates to Amendment No 9."
"Finally, the Commission is not ready to accept Amendments Nos 4, 5, 12, 16 and part of Amendment No 1."
"As a general rule, the Commission does not support discrimination among individual products concerning the possibility of access to inward processing relief."
"This relates to part of Amendments Nos 1, 4, 12 and 16."
"Moreover, the use of C-sugar in processed products for export is not possible under current market organisation: this concerns Amendment No 12."
"Operators importing products under the IPR do not receive any refund for the export of processed goods, so the assumption in Amendment No 5 is incorrect."
"Mr President, permit me to address two comments to the Commission."
"Firstly, the Commissioner said: in view of the ""high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union"" ."
"Perhaps the Commission could get used to the following version: in view of the ""low world market prices caused by dumping"" , because otherwise we risk creating the impression that the agricultural pricing system within the EU is pitched too high."
"No, it is too low on the world market because farmers cannot produce at this price."
"Secondly, this is a report according to Article 37."
"We reserve the right - I will discuss this with the other groups - to refer this back to committee, because what you have said, your assumptions that is, will of course put paid to the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It is then highly likely that we will enter negotiations."
"I am just saying this now to give you food for thought."
"The honourable Members here will then be able to make their feelings known in the discussions."
"I just wanted to give you advance notice."
"Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m.."
"Enforcement of civil and commercial judgments"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0253/2000) by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [COM(1999) 348 - C5-0169/1999 - 1999/0154(CNS)]."
"Mr President, I speak first on behalf of the committee and will speak later on behalf of my group."
"In finally presenting this report to plenary on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, there are many people I should and will thank, but there is one whose inspiration I would especially like to mention because I hope it will set the scene for our debate tonight."
"As a young lawyer in London in the early 1980s, I was privileged to work with a then elderly German lady, who was one of those remarkable German-Jewish immigrés who came to London in the early war years and entered the English legal profession."
"This amazing lady not only qualified as an English solicitor, having previously qualified in Germany, but, as a true European of her own generation, she also obtained a doctorate from the Sorbonne the title of which was the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments."
"She inspired me with an interest in this area of law and as she gradually retired and handed over her practice, I became more and more familiar with the workings of the Brussels Convention as it came into force in the UK."
"I hope she would approve of where we have got to today, and how the European Union is now able to allow lawyers to move and practise in other Member States by choice rather than force of circumstance and that by this regulation our committee will further assist a step forward in giving greater access to justice to our citizens across Europe."
"I want to use this occasion to say something about the importance of what we are doing here."
"The original EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments of 1968 was an important landmark in this field of international private law, marking a departure from a previous patchwork of mainly bilateral treaties between various countries."
"For the first time, by way of an intergovernmental convention, the EC gave itself a special, unique and comprehensive regime of recognition and enforcement."
"We are now participating in the next important landmark in that process - seeing what was a convention become a Community act, a regulation, in one fell swoop bringing a previous area of private international law into Community law and more importantly into the internal market."
"How fitting that it should be our committee, with its new competence in this legislature bridging the themes of legal affairs in the internal market, that should have had to deal with this new Brussels regulation."
"The committee has been at pains throughout this process to point out and highlight the importance of the internal market dimension of this proposal which gives us a chance to ensure even more strongly than before that our businesses and citizens can have confidence that contracts and obligations they enter into across the Union will be upheld by a common framework of procedural law on jurisdiction and enforcement."
"We are making progress towards a system of civil law and justice that will give ease and certainty of access across Member State boundaries, at last beginning to make a reality of the area of freedom and justice proposed at Tampere."
"The issue that has, of course, taken most of the committee' s time and attention has been the fact that this proposal for a regulation has coincided with the growth of e-commerce which in itself offers enormous opportunities to business and consumers within the internal market."
"The committee has, as the Commission will be well aware, grappled long and hard with the issues raised in Articles 15 and 17 of the proposed regulation. That is to say where there is a dispute between a business and a consumer, whose court should the parties have recourse to."
"These two articles, in whatever combination, have to be read together."
"The Commission proposal in line with previous consumer protection legislation took the view in dealing with Article 15 that all such disputes should go to the consumer' s court whilst willing to defer to a general proposition that contracts concluded at a distance should fall under this category."
"The committee has been searching for a way of protecting Europe' s growing e-commerce sector and especially small businesses from exposure to 15 different and diverse legal jurisdictions."
"The committee has therefore opted by a small majority in favour of the option of Article 17a which modifies the general principle in Article 15."
"This modification allows parties in a B to C contract to contract in favour of the seller' s jurisdiction."
"This was felt to uphold the freedom of contract of the parties but addition there is another element to which I will now turn."
"I believe the committee' s most fundamental contribution to this debate will be the introduction of the reference of such B to C disputes to ADR or EDR."
"This has been generally agreed to be the best way to neutralise the difficult discussion about whose jurisdiction can apply."
"There can be no doubt that the Brussels Convention made enormous strides in simplifying the jurisdiction rules applicable to cross-border disputes but they are still a lawyer' s dream and a litigant' s nightmare."
"They have not created real ease of access to justice."
"The opening up of a simple effective system of cross-border disputes is the committee' s goal in introducing the concept of ADR and we welcome the way in which this has already been picked up and worked on by the Commission."
"There was also agreement in committee that in this evolving area we remain deeply concerned as to the impact of legislation on Europe' s e-business."
"Therefore, in line with the E-commerce Directive, we have asked for a two-year review."
"I have covered the main aspects."
"I wish to conclude with a note of thanks to my colleague on the committee, especially to our chairman who I know feels as passionately as I do about this area of law, whatever our differences, but my biggest set of thanks must go to the committee secretariat and to Mr Robert Bray for all his help and advice throughout this process."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of her presentation for what is a very fair and balanced report."
"On behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I am pleased to be able to deliver this opinion, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Hazan, who unfortunately cannot be with us tonight."
"My committee considers it important to give a positive response to this Commission proposal, which strives to make the recognition and enforcement of judgments between Member States almost automatic."
"Not only does this regulation build upon the judicial cooperation between the States it marks an attempt to put the citizen at the heart of the Europe - the citizen, not just big business, money brokers and others, with perhaps profit purely as their motive."
"My committee also considers that the provision of the regulation which seeks to protect the weaker parties in a contract should be approved."
"This will enable consumers, workers and insurers to be safeguarded by effective European regulations that can be automatically applicable across the Member States."
"Following this logic, it seems clear to us that there are no legitimate grounds to exempt e-commerce transactions from consumer protection rules."
"The rapporteur has referred to this, but e-commerce is an area which is set to grow."
"To differentiate between the rights of those buying on line and those shopping in the high street would go against the valuable work that the European Parliament and the EU in general has already done in championing the rights of the citizens."
"E-consumers, in common with all weaker parties to a contract and indeed European citizens in general, deserve and should be given the right to a fair hearing."
"Finally, my committee welcomes the introduction of alternative dispute resolution procedures and hopes that this regulation can enter into force as soon as possible."
"Mr President, please allow me to begin with a few words in my capacity as Chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Rarely have I felt as proud of my position as I am today in relation to this report, due to the work that has been carried out in committee over the last year."
"The fact that it has taken a year does not mean that Parliament has not been interested. On the contrary, there has been intense and fruitful debate between the members of the Committee, as well as people from the academic world and all the interested parties."
"I warmly congratulate Mrs Wallis on having made this work possible, as rapporteur, and of course I thank the secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs for the work they have done and, in particular, as Mrs Wallis has also mentioned, the work of Mr Bray."
"We have had disagreements, Mr President, but I am sure that whatever the result achieved in this House tomorrow, the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs will have moved this issue forward significantly."
"I shall now continue, Mr President, on behalf of the PPE."
"As you well know, and as the rapporteur has reminded us, the main question being debated deals with judgments by the competent court on contracts concluded with consumers on the Internet."
"I would like to say once again how proud I am at the balanced and detailed nature of this report."
"It proposes pragmatic solutions, which are likely to increase consumer protection and at the same time allow businesses, in particular small- and medium-sized ones, which make up the social fabric of Europe, to offer their services and products to consumers resident within the internal market."
"The internal market must be a genuine domestic market, both for businesses and for consumers."
"As for the consumer, it is proposed that the scope of the special system be extended to those who sign contracts at a distance within the internal market with no distinction whatsoever between directed and undirected activities and, as the rapporteur has highlighted, it incorporates the extrajudicial resolution of disputes into the regulation."
"With regard to the promotion of cross-border electronic commerce, it is proposed to allow businesses, under certain very specific and very restricted circumstances, to insert jurisdiction clauses which the consumer could accept."
"Mr President, I am convinced that Parliament' s opinion will have a real impact on the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"In fact, as Mrs Wallis has said, Parliament has done what neither the Commission nor the Council has dared to do, which is to hold a realistic debate on the basic question, on the protection of consumers in the 21st century, not the protection of consumers in the 19th century, nor the 20th century, with all the interested parties and taking account of all the interests involved."
"When we examine the history of this issue, we realise that the Commission, in making its proposal, has limited itself to a draft review of the Brussels Convention, carried out by a committee of experts before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, i.e. when this was an intergovernmental matter, very close to international public law."
"Furthermore, Mr President, that committee worked alone, with no transparency, with no interministerial consultations and without consulting the interested parties."
"It is clear that the Justice and Home Affairs Council expected that, given the weak institutional powers of this Parliament in this field, even after Amsterdam, the final adoption of the regulation by the Council would be a mere formality."
"The clear unwillingness of the Justice and Home Affairs Council to open a debate on this question indicates that in recent times Parliament has been subject to every type of pressure."
"After more than one year of discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can say simply that the arguments levelled against its report lack foundation and are more the result of intimidation and demagoguery than of basic reasoning."
"Let us look at this briefly."
"Some people are trying to politicise the debate, hoping that that will create a left-right division, trying to take the consumer hostage, saying that the report would prejudice their protection."
"This argument is both demagogic and unjustified and is ultimately based an antiquated form of protection, which is ineffective and grounded in a nationalist view that runs counter to European construction."
"The solutions that have been adopted offer much more protection than those proposed by the Commission or - and here I disagree with Mrs Wallis - those presented to Parliament, which in reality limit the protection solely to consumers targeted by an Internet site, by a business."
"Pseudo-legal arguments have also been put forward, such as the supposed incompatibility with the directive on abusive clauses or with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice."
"Well, there is no incompatibility with that or with anything else and allow me to quote the report, issued by the SANCO Directorate-General on 20 September 1999, which says, and I quote in French because it is the only version that exists: ""The jurisdiction clauses are therefore possible and legal, within the meaning of this proposal, provided that certain conditions are guaranteed"" ."
"It continues: ""It is therefore necessary for the consumer to be clearly informed before signing the contract"" ."
"It is precisely for this reason, Mr President, that the Committee on Legal Affairs requires strict conditions of transparency."
"It is therefore not true that this report goes against an intended Community objective."
"Lastly, and perhaps this is the most cynical of the arguments, people say: ""Well, this creates difficulties for small- and medium-sized businesses, but they should be insured"" ."
"That is like saying: ""There should not be firemen in towns or cities."
"If a house burns down, the owners should be insured"" ."
"We must create good legislation, which is balanced for everyone."
"To end, I disagree with Mrs Wallis' solution, despite the fact that we have shared this adventure, because I believe that at the end of the day her solution does not offer more protection to the consumer, since it only protects the consumer which a company has targeted."
"A lawyer could spend years and years pondering which jurisdiction should apply in the case of active or passive sites or directed or undirected activities."
"In conclusion, Mr President, it seems to me that in this field of judicial cooperation Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission that it will not accept being sidelined or manipulated by dogmatic arguments that represent purely nationalist interests."
"Instead, by dint of its thorough work, Parliament has here a great opportunity to demonstrate that pragmatic and reasonable solutions can be found to rebalance this proposal whatever the result tomorrow in this House."
"Mr President, we all know that the development of the Internet as a shopping channel can bring great benefits: new opportunities for small businesses, for Internet start-ups and opening up the single market to our consumers right across 15 Member States."
"It can lead to lower prices for them."
"It can lead to a range of choice and we all support that, but we also know from surveys by national consumer councils, particularly in my Member State, that consumers do not yet have sufficient trust and confidence in the new technology to shop on-line."
"I am pleased to see that businesses recognise that consumer confidence is critical to the growth of this small-business e-commerce network."
"They recognise it is a precondition for persuading the consumer to shop on-line and therefore our key objective has to be to encourage that trust and confidence which in turn will benefit business by broadening their customer and consumer market base."
"It is regrettable that in committee this debate has declined in some ways to business versus industry."
"Both business and industry can gain from a common sense approach to this."
"We can only recognise the full potential of business-to-consumer e-commerce if sufficient trust and confidence is there."
"The way to persuade those consumers to take the plunge is to ensure that their rights are intact and this has to include, in my group' s view, the right to take action in their own national court."
"There is a view that consumers are only engaging in buying CDs, books, low-value items, but of course we know that e-commerce is taking off in such way that soon they will be buying financial services, they will be buying cars."
"In my constituency they want to buy cheaper cars from France and the Netherlands."
"These are serious amounts of money and, as we encourage more consumers to go on-line, we really must give them the right to sue in their own courts so that we do not expect them - particularly poorer consumers - to go to courts abroad."
"In reality we know that regulating the e-commerce world in the interests of both business and consumers requires a more innovative approach."
"It needs a fundamental legal framework with innovative, non-legislative solutions and that is why I support Mrs Wallis' proposals: looking at the potential of ADR systems, looking at trustmarks, supporting small businesses in voluntary codes of good conduct, and finding mutually satisfactory ways to solve disputes."
"Internet service providers have a role to play in this."
"America Online, for example, runs its own merchant business programme where it guarantees to support the consumer in getting legal redress from any of the businesses that use them as a provider."
"The reality is that none of these systems, of course, are in place in Europe, nor are they even really developed."
"Even in the US, where only 8% of websites have trustmarks, there are still considerable problems gaining legal redress."
"ADRs, therefore, cannot be a replacement for legal remedy."
"The consumer cannot be bound to lose his right to go to court by contracts, as inserted in the report that is before us from the Legal Affairs Committee."
"More work needs to be done in the area."
"We need to create trust but, until these new systems are in place, there is no reason why consumers should not enjoy the same rights on-line as they do offline."
"I cannot deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts."
"They are entitled to their own system of justice and we have to continue to support that."
"We do not support jurisdiction clauses because my group also believes that these are in contravention of the unfair contract term legislation, by causing significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under contract to the detriment of the consumer."
"This we believe would create more legal uncertainty, more court cases, more money perhaps for lawyers, but that cannot be in the interests of business or consumers."
"I am very pleased that in my country the CBI has backed Mrs Wallis' approach."
"It is a sensible position in helping us to work with business and consumers that we can ensure that court action is only the last resort and we can find better ways to resolve disputes."
"It is a matter of some regret to me that members of the Legal Affairs Committee seem to have forgotten that it is our committee which bears the responsibility for the legal protection of the consumer."
"It cannot, therefore, be right that we respond to the challenges of the new world of e-commerce by seeking to limit or constrain those rights."
"This will send a bad signal to consumers."
"It will not support e-business development and it will mean that we will not develop the e-commerce business-to-consumer sector."
"I appeal, therefore, for some common sense in this debate."
"I know that no legislation is perfect."
"We are all struggling in the e-commerce world to get legislation that is right, to get the right balance between self-regulation and a regulatory framework which gives minimum guarantees."
"That is why I believe also that this two-year review clause is sensible."
"It will allow us to look at legislation, how it is impacting on SMEs and now it is impacting on consumers."
"The idea of setting up a case book and collecting evidence is an excellent idea."
"We now have to work to find practical and effective ways to resolve disputes."
"This cannot be at the expense of consumers."
"The opinion on this report revolves around Articles 15 and 17."
"I now speak on behalf of my group, in respect of the amendments tabled by them and other political groups."
"The shared aim of all of us is to try to find a balanced way of protecting consumers and shielding SMEs from differing Member State jurisdictions."
"This problem has been exaggerated totally out of proportion."
"From the evidence available, such cross border B to C disputes are few and far between and the hope is that most of them will now be weeded out by ADR systems."
"But, where they go beyond that, it is the consumer who is most disadvantaged."
"The bigger businesses will be able to afford legal assistance."
"The astute and sensible SME can insure for a modest premium."
"That leaves the residue of unsuspecting businesses that may get involved in a transaction outside their Member State."
"In these circumstances it is not unreasonable to build on the previous content of Article 15, use the concept of ""directed at"" , acknowledge that this is a concept also found in American jurisprudence and utilised by WIPO."
"It is not simple but it has been used and there is no simple solution here."
"This, in combination with a modification to Article 17, which allows freedom of contract to choose ADR but respects existing consumer rights in the form of the unfair contract terms directive, presents a much more workable, legally certain package that will promote confidence."
"It is a mark of the balance that we have achieved in these amendments that they have won the support of the CBI in my own country and more than partial support from consumer organisations."
"They certainly prefer this package to the committee one."
"What I did not refer to when I spoke previously was Parliament' s role in this legislative process."
"We are consultees."
"We know from what has been said on this subject by Commissioner Byrne that he will not accept the type of formulation proposed by the committee at Article 17a. I believe that Commissioner Vitorino shares his view."
"From the Council' s perspective, the UK Government expressed a similar view."
"It seems unlikely that a French Presidency, which is highlighting consumer affairs, will take a different view."
"We could say that, because we are only consultees, we can say what we like."
"We are merely signalling a political direction but it is important that we should signal a legally certain and workable solution, not one that will create as many problems as it seeks to solve."
"Parliament should behave responsibly as a grown-up legislator, not as a petulant child."
"We have the opportunity to build on the already substantial achievements in the committee' s final report."
"I hope that we will go further."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her persistence."
"It has been a long and hard road."
"The European Commission has made a proposal which would ensure that consumers would have the right to take action in their own national courts and legal disputes arising from cross-border e-commerce transactions."
"Amendments from the Legal Affairs Committee before Parliament would take that right and make it subject to unreasonable conditions and I cannot support those amendments."
"The amendments shift the balance in the report towards traders and away from consumers."
"Consumers can agree - prior to the conclusion of the contract - that they cannot bring proceedings against the other party in the courts of the Member States where they are domiciled."
"The main problem with this approach is that it assumes that consumers first read the small print in such contracts and, even if they do, that they fully understand the implications of agreeing to forego the right to sue in their own courts and the differences in relation to costs incurred, legal systems, the choice of language used and so on."
"It is unlikely that the average consumer understands or is aware and we cannot agree to their full legal rights being abrogated in this way."
"I agree with Mrs Wallis that Commissioner Byrne was right to say that he would not accept this, and I hope that Commissioner Vitorino feels the same way, because this would be a disastrous outcome."
"The committee did, however, agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet."
"Under the proposal, key information contained in the court files in the Member States would be copied, using a standard form, to a centralised database for on-line access by interested parties."
"Such a system will also promote the convergence and coordination of the different national legal systems and enable parties to check on the status of trading partners and suppliers, especially in an age of on-line trading."
"This European causebook is very much to be welcomed and I hope that we will be able to support this report."
"I want to compliment Mrs Wallis on the preparation and the presentation of her report."
"I broadly welcome this report and I want to focus in particular on Amendment No 20, Recital 26 (new), which states that the Commission will consider proposals for the establishment of a Centralised Electronic European Union Causebook and Judgment Registry Database."
"This has been justified very clearly in the report."
"It is pro-citizen and it is pro-consumer and I would strongly urge the Commissioner to consider this proposal favourably, particularly in view of the fact that it is so pro-consumer and pro-citizen. I would strongly urge the Commission to consider it favourably as we now live in a global network with a global economy, global companies."
"But we have yet to establish an infrastructure to enable the Brussels Convention, as amended and extended, to benefit our EU consumer citizens and to attract inward investment."
"It is necessary to establish the causebook which has been inspired by a proposal from an Irish lawyer, Twinkle Egan who has worked diligently on this initiative for some years."
"At the expense of repeating myself, this will ensure that it is to the citizens' advantage."
"This system has the advantage of having already been vetted by many reputable institutions including the International Bar Association."
"The system has the attraction of being capable, of extension, to synchronising the international legal system of the global world in which we now live and trade."
"The system would enable citizens of the Community and others to have prompt and easy access to authoritative and up-to-date information in relation to the existence and progress of trans-border litigation in which they may have a legitimate interest."
"This system would also provide efficiency in obtaining and enforcing judgments within the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unlike many other MEPs, I am not in the habit of routinely thanking the rapporteur."
"I only do so when there is a reason."
"Today, we do have reason for thanking Diana Wallis for displaying what has most emphatically been the patience of a saint and the stamina of an athlete in drawing up this report."
"I want to emphasise that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports her and the amendments she has tabled on the Group' s behalf."
"I also want to point out that the debate has been frustrating to some degree."
"If the same energy had been put into developing confidence-building systems instead of into lobbying which has not always been very professional, I believe that a lot would already have happened to create the confidence and confidence-building systems which are required if consumers are to have the courage to begin trading."
"One great merit of this piece of work is the importance which the rapporteur and Parliament attach to consumer-friendly dispute-resolution mechanisms and the pressure they have brought to bear in order to obtain these."
"This is important, and I do not believe that the same weight would have been given to this issue if this work had not been done."
"As has been repeated a great many times, the biggest dispute, as we all know, has been about which court is to have competence in matters relating to electronic commerce."
"This is an issue which will set a precedent, and that is why we have seen such vigorous lobbying."
"It is a question with which we shall be confronted many times in connection, for example, with tax issues and cyber crime."
"We must resolve the issue of which is to be the competent court."
"I believe that there is a lot to indicate that, in the future, we must have clearer rules specifically in connection with places of domicile."
"We cannot proceed as often on the basis of where events have taken place."
"This also emerged yesterday from our seminar on cyber crime."
"What is to be taken as the domicile address?"
"That is why it is important that we should establish today that it is the consumer' s domicile address which matters in the end."
"Finally, I should like to ask those who are going to support the majority of the committee in the vote how they can look consumers in their own countries in the eye when the latter become aware that the view of the majority of the committee will, in practice, lead to their being denied access to their own courts."
"I should like finally to strike a biblical note."
"I once met an old man who said, 'I am in no doubt at all that, when I speak to my God, I can speak in my own language. I also hope, however, that the same will apply in the courts I may be called before' ."
"I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mrs Wallis for her tremendous effort and work on this very difficult brief and I also want to support the call by my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, and my other Irish colleague, Nuala Ahern, with regard to the establishment of a centralised European Union Electronic Database on case-law, put forward by Twinkle Egan, a barrister from Ireland."
"However, when we look at the difficulties which have arisen with regard to this report, when we look at the disparate views - the so-called purists on behalf of the consumers or the other so-called purists on behalf of business and e-commerce - we sometimes forget that a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises are consumers themselves, who will be trading with larger companies or larger suppliers and who deserve the same protection that I, ""as an individual"" or anybody else, as an individual consumer, would have."
"Therefore, what is most of all required within the new framework is certainty with regard to the protection available and the responsibilities of the people who are trading on-line."
"I look to other legislation to see what analogies or what benefits can be drawn from it."
"Under the various insurance directives, for instance, non-national insurance companies are required to have an agent in each Member State to deal with insurance claims that may occur in that Member State."
"Why not put in place a similar requirement on on-line trading companies?"
"Likewise, under the consumer credit directive, the provider of the service is required to inform the consumer of certain rights, certain entitlements, certain get-out clauses as well."
"It is not difficult to transpose that kind of ideology into a direct consumer-service-provider relationship also."
"That is why, more than anything else today, we need to put this regulation in place."
"We do not need to defer it any longer."
"We do not need to put any more mud into the water."
"We need to enable Europe, which is lagging behind in e-commerce and Internet business worldwide, to put in place new arrangements with regard to creation of on-line business and the protection of consumer rights and also to ensure that Europe takes its rightful place at the top of the world trading system of Internet and on-line businesses."
"That is why it is important that we should support the general opinion, agreed by the Legal Affairs Committee and as proposed by Mrs Wallis, concerning those areas over which there has been some conflict, I take note of what Commissioner Byrne said recently in his speech about the other opportunities."
"No consumer, ""as an individual"" or as a company, can be denied the ultimate right to take legal action but that does not mean that this should be the first course of action."
"There should be an agreed dispute-resolution mechanism available at local level, which can reduce the cost of settling consumer disputes because, as has been pointed out by many speakers this evening, there is the question of added costs with regard to resolution of disputes."
"Finally, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission representatives for their work and remind all Members that there is another way under the Brussels I Convention and we can put other mechanisms in place."
"Let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us."
"As Mrs Wallis knows only too well I have not agreed with a number of things that she has said during the time she has been rapporteur for this important report but I would like to put on record my appreciation for the very considerable work and effort she has put into what she has done for this Parliament."
"As spokesman for the British Conservatives and the Legal Affairs Committee, I want to begin by endorsing the remarks made by Mrs Palacio, chairman of that committee."
"The process of which this debate is a part is, as has been explained already, a component of the so-called Amsterdamisation of the Brussels Convention."
"It is an unusual process but one in which Parliament has to give the message from its consultation that the Brussels Convention must not merely be transformed into a regulation it has to be brought up-to-date to meet the needs of the contemporary world."
"The Convention itself is old: it antedates my own country' s joining the European Economic Community."
"It goes back to an era before not only the Internet but even before the commercially available personal computer."
"It is therefore tragic that the Commission and the Council have been so timid in getting to grips with the reality of the modern world for we are in a world which is moving away from that of national jurisdictions into the world of networks."
"In the world of networks traditional jurisdiction-based disputes-resolution procedures are of no real help to consumers and traders when things go wrong."
"It is for this reason that the jurisdictional aspects and arguments must be squeezed out of disputes."
"ADRs which are a form of bona fide privatised law, agreed upon by the parties and legislators, must be the first and the main means of resolving disputes."
"They cannot merely be the pre-trial steps before a disappointed consumer takes refuge in his own legal system for, if they become that, myriads of SMEs will boycott the Net for business, thereby reducing their own profitability and their contribution to society and the national exchequers."
"It will seriously reduce Europe' s citizens' choices, thereby reducing their quality of life and standard of living."
"I hear my opponents say: there is Lord Inglewood representing the forces of reaction, flying in the face of the Community' s honourable tradition of consumer protection and arguing at variance with the detailed terms of existing European Community consumer protection legislation."
"Taking the latter point first, I argue in the way I do because existing legislation no longer meets the consumers' needs."
"After all, a later statute succeeds its predecessors and, if the form of protection the consumer is given needs overhauling, earlier legislators cannot and do not stop the draftsmen and their successor legislators."
"When it is time for change then it is the time for change and that time is now."
"The world has moved on."
"We have got to move on with it and nowhere is this more clearly seen than in the debate we have had about the so-called directed website."
"Such a thing is a contradiction in terms since the Net is a shop window at every terminal link to the network and, to argue in some contrived way, that a site can be directed at some and not others is linguistically facile, commercially nonsensical and technologically illiterate."
"We have an opportunity tomorrow to vote for the 21st century, its consumers, traders and citizens by voting for the committee' s report or we can look at the future and then turn our back on it and find superficial comfort in the last century by voting for the amendments."
"We, in my delegation and in this group, shall be voting for the 21st century' s solutions to 21st problems and supporting the committee' s report."
"Mr President, I respect your tenureship of the chair and I yield to no one in that, but I wonder how you can justify the fact that you indicate a time and then in the case of several speakers absolutely ignore it."
"I do not cast any judgement over the previous speakers or the substance of their remarks, but, if people have been allocated a period of three minutes, to give them 50% more is insulting to those people who have spoken earlier and have kept rigidly to their time."
"I wonder whether you could justify why you have decided to ignore the clock?"
"I have not ignored the clock and I am very concerned that some Members may be abusing my tolerance."
"In general, Members have respected the time limits for their interventions and, in any event, they have expressed their points of view."
"I accept responsibility for this anomaly, which is going to be positive since we are going to gain time - if we do not waste it with points of order - and it is not going to set a precedent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, could I first underline the fact that Mrs Wallis has spared no effort in submitting this report for discussion."
"The report, as it was approved within the committee, is in my view a fine example of a document which has struck a fine balance between the interests of all parties, both small- and medium-sized businesses and consumers."
"It would be regrettable if this balance were to be disturbed by tomorrow' s vote, besides which, it is highly unlikely in my view that the Council would be able to agree on the tabled amendments."
"Allow me to explain why."
"The terminology, as it is currently before us, is clear."
"We talk about 'contracts concluded at a distance' , terminology which, even to a lay person, is far more transparent than 'directed activities' , as is currently used in the amendment."
"Let me illustrate this with an example."
"If a French winegrower recommends his crémant in French, a French consumer may well enjoy protection under the Brussels convention, because the winegrower' s 'activities' are 'purposely directed in a substantial way' , but the English, Belgian or Italian consumer will not enjoy this protection because the activities were not purposely directed in a substantial way to those consumers."
"This creates considerable legal uncertainty and will lead to various procedures having to be thrashed out before the courts where each case will need to be examined individually to establish whether the activities were purposely directed or not."
"Secondly, it is crucial in my opinion that the report offers parties themselves the opportunity of building a competence clause into their contracts."
"Contractual freedom is a fundamental principle."
"If we deny a party contractual freedom and, with it, the constitutional right to go to court, I can foresee various procedures needing to be instituted on account of denial of justice."
"In my view, the Brussels convention is of major strategic importance for the development of e-commerce within the internal market and it will also have a major impact on the success or failure of small- and medium-sized businesses."
"I therefore hope that this report, as approved in the committee, will be adopted in its unamended form in the plenary tomorrow."
"Mr President, as I have said in this Chamber on previous occasions, I have the privilege of working in a very interesting Legal Affairs Committee and being one of the few non-lawyers on the committee."
"Diana Wallis as a distinguished international lawyer has been the ideal person to work on this very complex file."
"I would like to thank her for the way she has done it and the way she has so freely shared her knowledge with us."
"I have certainly learned a great deal from it."
"I want to pick up on what is a central point for me: we are, as my colleague Lord Inglewood said, trying to reflect a new world in which we want small businesses to take advantage of the most powerful, international marketing tool that they have ever been offered."
"There are many business that we want to use the network, the Internet, to sell to consumers all over Europe."
"Many of those small business will have no experience of exporting, they will not have a network of lawyers, they will be uncertain themselves about how they are going to deal with consumer complaints."
"The way that the committee has finally structured its approach strikes exactly the right balance."
"Let us be clear, that what we have proposed in these alternative jurisdiction clauses is not something for the larger businesses."
"Large businesses, even medium-sized businesses, will have offices all over Europe, they will have lawyers, they will be able to deal with consumers in that respect."
"The basis of consumers being able to go to the court of their domicile to receive justice in the event of disputes still remains intact."
"Listening to some of the speeches you have heard this evening, you would think that option was under threat."
"We have had Mrs Ahern - I am sorry she is not here - saying it will be a disastrous outcome if the committee' s report is voted through."
"I fundamentally disagree with that."
"What we have done is offer small companies the alternative of doing something else."
"They can offer consumers alternative jurisdiction but only under very specific conditions."
"A double lock is built in there, because they must agree to incorporate an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism before they can use the alternative clause and the terms must also be made very clear to the consumer concerned before he accepts them."
"Let us think about this on-line world, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who have shopped on-line will know that you are offered the conditions and you must positively accept them."
"You press the button, you move your mouse, you make a conscious decision."
"How many of you, when you last had your gas or electricity bill, turned it over to look at the small print - the conditions?"
"How many of you realised that you were accepting them?"
"In the on-line world, we must think differently."
"We are thinking in the old world here - some of our colleagues are thinking in the old world."
"What we need to do tomorrow is to accept the committee' s report and move forward."
"That is our role as a grown-up legislator: to think about new ideas, encourage change and not necessarily, as Lord Inglewood said, go along with an accepted wisdom that has been with us for many years."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, it is important for the e-commerce market that we can conduct pan-European trade in an electronic environment."
"No barriers to the market should be set up, either legislative or technological."
"A Europe without borders is to the benefit of consumers."
"If the amendments made by the committee to the report now being discussed were to be rejected tomorrow, the future of ecommerce in Europe would be in jeopardy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as nice as it would be for the employment situation for our legal profession, it would be an enormous burden for small- and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to take account of the legislation that exists in all EU countries and the signatories to the Locarno Agreement when they are engaged in e-commerce."
"Presumably this would also mean that any respectable companies that want to be responsible and look after their consumers' interests, will not become involved in ecommerce at all."
"As a result, there will be less on offer to the consumer as a whole, as Lord Inglewood earlier mentioned."
"On the other hand, irresponsible rascals would remain in the market and they would look after the consumer only until the clink of money is heard in the seller' s bank account, and no longer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, according to a proposal by a consumer organisation, marketing could be directed at just one country or just certain markets, which is not technically possible in the world of the Internet."
"The electronic world knows no national frontiers."
"Besides, this would discriminate against consumers, as the consumer must have the right to order products from anywhere to go anywhere."
"This kind of interpretation would probably also run counter to the principle of the free movement of goods and services as referred to in Article 49 of the Treaty of Rome."
"A company engaged in e-commerce cannot normally even know what country the consumer is in."
"It would therefore be impossible to require a company to find out beforehand about the consumer protection legislation that exists in the customer' s country, as that country could be anywhere."
"Instead it would be reasonable to create alternative procedures for resolving disputes."
"The e-commerce players should, however, have the right to choose between normal court procedures or an alternative way to resolve the dispute."
"I would also ask the Council and the Commission to still take time to reflect whether it would be worth considering this charge-back mechanism, which Mrs de Palacio mentioned again in her amendment to the report."
"It could increase bureaucracy from the point of view of the consumer."
"In this the committee' s position is not absolute but it would seem that the majority in this Chamber support it and that tomorrow it will be upheld as Parliament' s position, which is a good thing."
"About 18 months ago the Council of the European Union nodded through a draft of the new Brussels regulation which essentially rubber-stamped old principles supposedly in order to apply them to modern conditions, but without thought, without real discussion and without consultation, I hope, whatever the result of the vote tomorrow, that both the Commission and Council will take note of the very extensive discussions and debate which we have had in this Parliament, which have taken account of the concerns both of business and consumers."
"I disagree with Mrs Wallis' suggestion that, because of some criticism from David Byrne of the result reached in the Legal Affairs Committee, we should give way now."
"I would say it is our democratic duty to stand up for what we believe is the right solution for consumers and for e-commerce in the European Union regardless of whether that gives distress to Mr Byrne or not."
"I would give my wholehearted support to the conclusion reached in the Legal Affairs Committee."
"It is a common-sense balance between, on the one hand, protecting consumers and, on the other hand, ensuring that those same consumers have access to the low prices and wide choices that are available with the truly competitive market."
"We have to decide, in a new era where physical location has become almost meaningless, where a dispute is eventually litigated, where a dispute is eventually solved."
"To allow consumers and businesses the freedom to make that choice themselves is the most pragmatic and the most common-sense solution and this gives the maximum certainty both to business and to consumers."
"It does not strip consumers of their pre-existing rights."
"It gives them choices and it reflects their enhanced status in a new Internet world, which gives them more power and more choices than ever before."
"If small businesses are driven out of the market because of the proposals from the Commission or if we adopt Mrs Wallis' amendments tomorrow then it will be consumers who suffer because it will leave them at the mercy of the large global players and it will deprive them of the low prices that they deserve under the new Internet economy."
"Even more importantly, it will also threaten the new economy and the e-economy in the European Union."
"We are sadly far behind the United States and, if tomorrow we support the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis, we will stay far behind the United States."
"With the Commission' s proposals, we certainly have the worst of both worlds."
"We have uncertainty and legal risk for business without genuine consumer protection, because in many cases the right to sue in your own home court may be illusory if you cannot enforce the judgment without going overseas and incurring the same inconvenience as if you had to go overseas in any event to litigate this issue."
"The Legal Affairs Committee has come up with a pragmatic solution."
"It is a common sense balance to a difficult issue and I would appeal to the House to support the resolution as put forward by the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wishes to begin by expressing its pleasure at the fact that this proposal has received not only the careful attention that the European Parliament gives to all of our proposals, but also because this represents work of the highest quality, which shows the great commitment of its rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, whom I should like to congratulate in particular, and of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, chaired by Mrs Palacio."
"The ""Amsterdamisation"" of the Brussels I Convention is, as you know, one of the priorities of the French Presidency."
"From the Commission' s point of view, the issue is to adopt a legal instrument which will enable us to define clear and transparent rules which everyone can accept. These rules are necessary if we are to be able to harmoniously apply the principle of mutual recognition of legal judgments, which will, of course, involve a debate on determining the principles and rules that apply to the competence of the Member States' courts when they rule on trans-border disputes."
"The scope of this regulation is therefore very broad."
"First of all, it contains a principle which I believe is universally accepted today: that of the jurisdiction of the courts in the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled."
"To achieve greater flexibility and to adapt more efficiently to the specific needs of the parties in a given dispute, the proposal for a regulation lays down alternative rules for jurisdiction, essentially the jurisdiction of the courts in the Member State of the place where the contract was concluded or of the place where the damage was done in the event that an offence has been committed."
"The regulation also lays down rules for the protection of the weaker party to consumer contracts, that is to say the consumer, but I shall return to this subject in greater detail later. It also lays down rules for the protection of workers and insurance policyholders, who are deemed to be the weaker parties to such contracts."
"As long as certain conditions are met, these parties have the right to bring a case before a court in the Member State in which they reside."
"This is the broad legal framework."
"I understand - and I feel that it is important to make this clear to the House - that the proposed regulation is a horizontal instrument, which can be applied, in a general way, to both civil and commercial matters. It covers both contractual and non-contractual matters."
"It is therefore worth bearing in mind that in the field of contracts, we are dealing with legal rules on general contracts between companies, between companies and consumers, and even contracts between private individuals."
"Various types of special contract, such as employment or insurance contracts, are therefore dealt with separately."
"Having said this, my concern is to emphasise the fact that although we recognise that the debate has naturally become polarised around one aspect of the regulation' s implementation, namely that concerning the new rules on e-commerce, this regulation covers more than just this one area."
"There is an enormous and immediate advantage in moving towards adopting a regulation on this matter on the basis of civil judicial cooperation."
"Let us move on now to the issue that has aroused the most passion in the debate, which concerns consumer contracts concluded electronically, in other words, the amendments to Articles 15, 16 and 17."
"First of all, I wish to say, on behalf of the Commission, that our proposal, which defines rules for judicial competence, is not seeking to come down on the side of judicial procedures at the expense of an alternative dispute-resolution system. This is not a dogmatic proposal seeking to enshrine the legal approach and to reject the choice of extrajudicial approaches to dispute resolution."
"Quite the contrary."
"The Commission shares the concern that honourable Members have expressed about the fact that perhaps in an increasingly general way, but particularly where e-commerce is concerned, the extra-judicial resolution of disputes is, without a shadow of a doubt, a much better solution in most cases than resorting to judicial procedures."
"This is not only because in most cases, in this type of contract, the sums involved today are, as we know, relatively small. Also and above all, it is because the speed with which these contracts are concluded by electronic means is in stark contrast to the excessive formality and slowness with which courts tend to act when resolving these disputes."
"We do not see ourselves in this light because, as you know, anthropologically speaking, dinosaurs no longer existed in the nineteenth century. We are not dinosaurs, fiercely resisting the adoption of alternative methods for resolving disputes and obsessively pursuing the notion that the courts are always the solution to all ills."
"This is not the Commission' s position. I even think that the extremely intensive work that we have been carrying out, which I will shortly discuss in greater detail, to promote alternative means for resolving disputes at European level is tangible proof that instead of merely making grandiose statements, we are working on the ground to implement mechanisms for alternative forms of dispute resolution."
"Furthermore, we are convinced that it is possible to make use of new communication technologies, such as the Internet, the new network concept and flows to facilitate extrajudicial dispute resolution."
"That is why I would say that the commitment to responding to the challenges that have been set for us here is not so much a question of a making a dogmatic choice of legal solutions. It is rather a question of our ability to give credibility to alternative mechanisms for dispute resolution and to give consumers and business people confidence in these mechanisms."
"Probably the greatest tribute that we could pay to this debate would be to say in a few years' time that we wasted a great deal of time on a highly legalistic debate that in practice was shown to have no real importance at all."
"In other words, the best way of honouring this debate would be to see if we can create a system for dispute resolution that renders the debate on access to the judicial process almost obsolete."
"Why is it that we cannot avoid discussing the issue of the judicial approach?"
"It is because the Commission does, in fact, share the idea that extrajudicial resolution must become the rule but that, in order to provide an incentive for people to seek recourse to this extrajudicial approach, there must be clear principles for the alternative, that is the judicial route."
"There must therefore be rules on the jurisdiction of the courts in those cases - which the Commission hopes will be rare - where an alternative form of resolution is not possible or does not produce a satisfactory result."
"Accordingly, with regard to consumer contracts the Commission found the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs extremely useful and takes the view that the second part of Amendment No 23 contains a principle which is considerably clearer and more reliable than that contained in our original proposal."
"The phrase 'directs such activities to' is an ambiguous one, which could cause problems by being open to interpretation and could drag us into a never-ending discussion on what are positive, active or passive web sites."
"We therefore feel that it would be helpful to replace this phrase with ""contracts concluded at a distance"" . We are prepared to incorporate this phrase into the amended proposal."
"This action would, however, have two consequences for Article 15."
"First of all, its wording needs to be adapted so that it does not limit the scope of Article 15 to contracts concluded in the consumer' s home, which is an impossible condition to establish for contracts concluded electronically."
"We are therefore not inclined to retain the first part of Amendment No 23."
"Secondly, it is important to point out that, because of the amendment I have just mentioned, ""presential"" contracts are also covered by Article 15. By ""presential"" contracts, I mean those that are concluded face to face."
"I am thinking here of situations in which the vendor, even if he or she has been contacted by the consumer, via the Internet for example, has gone to the consumer' s home in order to conclude the contract there. I also have in mind contracts where the consumer has been given an incentive, at the initiative of the other party, the co-contractor, even to leave the state in which he or she is domiciled in order to conclude the contract, as happens, for example, in contractual situations involving holidays organised by the suppliers themselves."
"If these stipulations are guaranteed, we feel that the phrase ""contract concluded at a distance"" would be much more appropriate to the situations I have been describing."
"On the other hand, we have problems with Amendment No 24, which concerns Article 16."
"Our view is that this amendment would mean applying the general rule of the jurisdiction of the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled and using the courts to override all of the common provisions of European Union and Member State consumer law as they stand today."
"As I see it, such an amendment would, in fact, render useless any provision in the field of consumer contracts, notably Article 15 itself. Apart from this, unless I am mistaken, this would leave consumers in a worse situation than that of an operator who is bound by a business-to-business contract, and who would be able to choose between having the case heard in a court in the defendant' s state of domicile and a court in the place where the contract was concluded."
"The same thing applies to the amendment seeking to open up the system laid down in the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction clauses in consumer contracts."
"I am referring here to Article 17."
"The Commission feels that Amendment No 26 is unacceptable since the clauses that are proposed would, in our opinion, be systematically used by the supplier, unless, of course, they were based on free and individual negotiation on the part of the consumer."
"The new Article 17(a) that has been proposed seeks to replace the guarantees provided by the courts by an extrajudicial and binding system of dispute resolution."
"The issue of the binding nature of these decisions is extremely important."
"My view is that this proposal would create a compulsory arbitration system for resolving these consumer disputes."
"As I see it, however, arbitration generally follows more complex procedural rules than those applied by the courts. I feel that the solution put forward in this proposal would present legal problems with regard to the law applicable and to the implementation arbitration awards."
"This concern on the part of the Commission would also apply to Amendment No 39, to which various Members have put their name."
"We understand the intention of this amendment, which establishes the freedom of the parties to agree upon a 'get-out' clause for an extrajudicial mechanism for dispute resolution, and lays down that this mechanism, which may be binding on both parties and which has the Commission's approval, enables the supplier to refuse to enter into the transaction if the consumer does not accept the clause."
"Presumably, whether juris tantum or juris et de jure applies, this would always be in accordance with Directive 93/13/EEC on abusive clauses."
"I believe that this amendment would raise similar difficulties in law. I shall not go into further detail about the idea contained in this amendment that an abusive clause would never be involved, but the truth is that by relying on the binding nature of the decision of the ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) body on both parties and therefore on the consumer, we would be opting as a general rule to compulsorily replace the courts with extrajudicial dispute resolution mechanisms."
"Such a solution would, in fact, raise constitutional issues in some Member States, in which it is not possible to prohibit access to the courts, even if only as a last resort, and would open the way for an interpretation of what is a question of law and what is a question of fact in this type of contract which, in my opinion, would vitiate the efficiency and speed of the system."
"The Commission' s view is that this regulation should not depend on the adoption of a package of legislative and non-legislative measures on e-commerce between companies and consumers."
"We feel sure that actions we have already launched and which are now up and running will enable alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to be put in place shortly and will enable us to provide a rapid response to the challenges of settling disputes arising from e-commerce."
"I would remind you of the revision of the Commission' s 1998 recommendation on the principles applying to alternative dispute resolution bodies, which in fact form the basis of what is known as the EEJ-Net - the European Extrajudicial Network - which has already been launched."
"Similarly, under the e-Europe initiative, which was adopted by the Feira European Council, the Commission is currently actively working on formulating proposals for codes of conduct, trust marks and extrajudicial procedures for the extrajudicial resolution of disputes arising from e-commerce. The Commission has also been given the task of preparing a Green Paper solely devoted to alternative methods of dispute resolution, as was decided by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of May of this year."
"All of this is currently being done and is part of our short-term work programme."
"In another area, that of minor disputes heard by the so-called ""small claims"" courts, we have already initiated work in line with the Tampere mandate, to simplify and speed up the processing of trans-border disputes involving small or uncontested sums."
"We are therefore convinced that these initiatives, which are already under way, and on which there will have to be a full debate with civil society, with interested parties, with associations representing industry, business and consumers and, of course, with the European Parliament, will enable us to put in place, in the short term, a legal reference framework which will establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms."
"We therefore think that, in order to allow this process some time in which to develop, it would be appropriate if the entry into force of this regulation were postponed for a few months."
"We propose that this should wait until six months after its publication, not only so as to enable operators to become fully conversant with the regulation, but also so as to enable the work that is currently under way on alternative means for dispute resolution to be concluded."
"Lastly, the Commission wishes to state that it is able to accept Amendments Nos 3, 27 and 30 on the introduction of provisions on trusts, with the reservation that some small changes are made to the terminology used. We can also accept Amendment No 22, on group insurance contracts, Amendments Nos 28, 29, 33 and 34, which allow notaries to be included in the authorities that are able to take part in the exequatur procedure."
"Mr President, forgive me for being more of a bore than I usually am, but the valid arguments and especially the passion of the criticisms that have been made deserved a frank answer from the Commission. The Commission is humble enough to say that it has learnt from this legislative process and that you can be quite sure that this work will not end here."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your extensive intervention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I should publicly like to reject and condemn the botched procedure, although I do not know if it has been adopted by the Conference of Presidents, the Presidencies of the Council and the Commission or the Presidency of Parliament, for dealing with an issue as important and far-reaching as terrorism in Spain."
"This may be in line with the Rules of Procedure, but it is neither ethically nor democratically acceptable for such a crucial issue to be dealt with using a procedure that does not provide for a political debate on a specific proposal for a resolution to which all of the interested parliamentary groups can present amendments."
"As I see it, the procedure adopted asserts that a written declaration presented by five Spanish Members of the European Parliament - who are fully within their rights to do so - can become the official position of Parliament. If this were the case, however, it would amount to a position adopted selfishly, by the back door and almost by stealth, so as to prevent other groups and Members from having the chance to present amendments or changes with the aim of achieving a broad consensus on the text."
"Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, might I be so bold as to say that what has happened today is a huge political mistake, and that something as important as Parliament' s position on terrorism will not have the broad support of everyone, since there will be some who, whilst unequivocally rejecting and condemning terrorism..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am very sorry Mr Ortuondo, we are now taking note of the fact that you do not approve of what has been decided."
"However, this is a decision taken by the competent bodies of this Parliament."
"We have taken note of your opinion."
"Let us turn to what we should be talking about, namely the Minutes, as Mr Ortuondo did not comment on the Minutes."
"Who wants to comment on yesterday' s Minutes?"
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a deplorable state of affairs at the European School I in Brussels."
"Thousands of children and young people - most of whom are the offspring of our officials - have not had any lessons since the end of June."
"They have, as yet, been unable to start the first term of the new school year."
"It was originally scheduled for 7 September."
"Several days previous to that, it was postponed until today, and now the parents have been informed once again that the term cannot begin because some major building work has yet to be completed."
"The renovation work has been going on for years at this school, and the asbestos problems are a familiar tale too."
"Yet no alternative arrangements were made for the children."
"I urge the President of our Parliament, in conjunction with the Commission, to ensure that this disgraceful state of affairs is not resolved at the children' s expense."
"I cannot believe what is going on!"
"School attendance is compulsory and yet the children are unable to fulfil this requirement."
"Mrs Schleicher, it would be particularly tragic if children were to suffer because it is impossible to receive an education."
"I am taking note of this and will pass it on, at your request, to the Bureau and other competent Parliament bodies."
"We will see what we can do."
"Terrorism in Spain"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on terrorism in Spain."
"This debate is opened on behalf of the Council and Commission."
"I have been informed that Minister Paul, representing the Council, is still on his way and hopes to arrive here very shortly."
"He is on his way here on the train from Paris and, as the sitting started early, is unable to attend at present."
"But I assume that Commissioner Vitorino is ready to make his statement now, and we will wait and see whether the Minister will be arriving shortly."
"If this is the case, I should like to give the floor to Commissioner Vitorino, who will be speaking on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been disturbed to see renewed acts of violence in the Basque Country."
"The Commission agrees with the repeated and forceful statements that have been made condemning these loathesome acts of terrorism committed in the territory of the Member States of the European Union - in all Member States, but particularly in Spain."
"Terrorism represents one of the greatest challenges our societies face and is unacceptable, because of the indiscriminate violence that characterises it, and which particularly affects the civilian population."
"Terrorist attacks shock and sadden the entire European public and fully deserve to be rejected because Europe's citizens continue to express their unrelenting desire to share a peaceful future."
"The Commission believes that the solidarity shown by the other Member States can and must support the Spanish authorities' fight against terrorism."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the step forward represented by the enshrinement in the Treaty of Amsterdam of the principle of solidarity in the fight against terrorism."
"Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union specifically mentions terrorism as one of the forms of crime to be prevented and fought at European level and one of the areas in which the European Union can bring added value to this fight."
"The European dimension of the fight against terrorism is not, however, a recent concept."
"Some key acts of cooperation between the judicial systems and police services of at least two states, particularly on both sides of the French-Spanish border, have recently produced some good results in this fight against terrorism."
"For its part, the Commission is cooperating with the Member States and with Europol with the same aim."
"Similarly, in the framework of action by the Council of Europe and the United Nations, there are various appropriate international conventions against terrorism that have not yet been signed, but which are currently being negotiated."
"Nevertheless, these new attacks unfortunately show that these efforts are still not enough to eliminate terrorism."
"We must go further in terms of European cooperation."
"A few words on behalf of the Commission would be appropriate here, heartfelt words of respect for and in tribute to the victims of terrorist attacks, who have often been representatives of the people, whose legitimacy comes from the ballot box in democratic elections. I also wish to pay tribute to those who have fallen victim to terrorism because they are carrying out their professional duties out of a sense of duty as servants of the state and of the people."
"But I also wish to pay tribute to those arbitrary victims of terrorism, the anonymous members of the public who refuse to live under the blackmail of fear. The finest tribute that I can pay is exactly this, to prove that we in the European institutions are able to contribute to this collective effort on the part of Europe' s citizens."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam, as I have already stated, enables the European Union to make this contribution."
"Immediately following its entry into force, therefore, the Heads of State and Government meeting at the Tampere European Council included terrorism in their overall approach to combating all forms of crime."
"Clear political commitments were given, such as the commitment to set up joint investigation teams, which, in my view, represent the most effective instrument for fighting terrorism at its very roots."
"Europol, whose mandate expressly covers terrorism, must also give its support to this joint action and participate in these joint investigation teams."
"The greater operational capacity Europol has, the more effective its support will be."
"Although it is true that in many cases bilateral cooperation between police forces is an essential instrument for combating terrorism, it is no less true that the need to establish the link between some terrorist acts and other forms of organised crime, in its methods, in its networks of activity and even in its sources of financing, requires a multilateral, not just a bilateral vision of the phenomenon of terrorism."
"Furthermore, Mr President, instruments for judicial cooperation, specifically those designed to prevent criminals from benefiting from and taking advantage of the differences in legislation across Europe, will also enable us to reduce, or even, one day, to eliminate all the obstacles that are raised when an application is made to extradite terrorists from one European Union country to another to stand trial."
"The path we must take is quite clear, as it was decided in Tampere that formal extradition proceedings between Member States for those who have actually been sentenced must in future be abolished. The principle of mutual recognition of judgments should also apply to final judgments, but also to judgments prior to the trial stage itself."
"A first objective would therefore be to guarantee that capture orders for the purpose of a trial are implemented, bearing in mind the gravity of the crimes we are talking about, in the event that several warrants are served on the same person."
"Our institutional partners now have the responsibility of ensuring that these guidelines, which have already been accepted at political level, are translated more rapidly into laws and into action."
"Various essential actions for stepping up the fight against terrorism are already included in the scoreboard for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. I feel certain that these actions, particularly the commitment given by the Heads of State and Government to the effect that terrorism is one of the forms of crime on which the European institutions will have to adopt common definitions, charges and sanctions, will rapidly be given substance in order to send out a clear message that terrorist acts will not be protected by the legislation of any Member State."
"I should therefore like to reiterate the Commission' s commitment to promoting more effective European action against terrorism, using all the means made available to it under the treaties, whether these terrorist acts take place in Spain or in any other Member State, as I have just been informed has happened tonight in the United Kingdom."
"In democratic societies such as ours, terrorism cannot take shelter behind any supposedly political justification."
"Terrorism, it must be said, is a dead end and the fact that it has fortunately disappeared from other European countries gives us cause for hope that sooner or later it will also be eliminated in Spain."
"It is up to governments to demonstrate to the public in their countries the absurdity of terrorism and to attack it root and branch by means of a multifaceted intervention strategy."
"I am sure that democratic societies, of which we are proud to belong, will win this battle, as long as we do not abdicate our democratic values and demonstrate that democracy is a powerful system for fighting terrorism and therefore make both preventive policies and the repression of terrorist acts more effective."
"This is clearly what Spain is doing and is also what the Commission is committed to doing in the fields in which it has competence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is an area of freedom which we all wish to strengthen."
"Hence, all terrorist attacks are not just attacks on democracy and the rule of law but they also prevent Europe' s citizens from enjoying the freedom that we all desire."
"Our commitment and our collective efforts must therefore be directed towards enabling everyone to fully enjoy this freedom."
"Freedom must not be surrendered to blackmail or to fear, because only in freedom can human dignity be experienced."
"Mr President, do you not think that it would be a better idea - and I say this, of course, as a point of order, not as an intervention - if we waited a few more minutes for the Minister to arrive?"
"It would be difficult, you understand, for me to respond to the representative of the Council if he did not have the opportunity to speak first."
"I therefore suggest that the sitting be suspended for less than 10 minutes, until nine o' clock, which is the time the Minister is due to arrive at Parliament."
"Mr Galeote, I hear what you are saying."
"By way of apology on behalf of Mr Paul, I would like to point out that his train from Paris is due at 8.20 a.m."
"We expect him here any minute."
"I would prefer it if we embarked on today' s proceedings rather than adjourn, in view of today' s punishing schedule and the fact that the House decided yesterday to vote at 11 a.m."
"I would actually like to ask you to make a start."
"We have heard the Commissioner' s statement."
"We decided yesterday to start at 8.30 a.m., and it would therefore be odd if we were to suspend proceedings at this stage."
"Mr President, I am convinced that the vast majority of Basque people, given the opportunity, would thank the French Presidency of the Council and the European Parliament for echoing their deep desire for peace and democratic coexistence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, since the first democratic elections took place in Spain in 1977, the Basque Country has emerged as the European region with the highest degree of self-government."
"Since then, the Basque people have had the opportunity, on six occasions, to elect the representatives for their autonomous parliament and violent and radical nationalism has never won the democratic support of the Basque people at the polls."
"However, since our Constitution was approved, enshrining the democratic rights of the people of Spain, ETA has killed 804 people in my country and left over 2000 widows and orphans all over Spain, mainly in the Basque Country."
"Their victims were men and women from all walks of life, including, of course, those who dedicated part of their lives to fighting the dictatorship."
"As part of the struggle to banish fear, these days in the Basque Country and in the rest of Spain there is a popular, civic and peaceful backlash against the tyranny of murderous terrorism."
"In my view, ladies and gentlemen, this debate must take up and broaden this popular call and encourage the people of Europe to work together to create a great pact for freedom."
"We must be able to make the people of our countries of origin realise that the fundamental principles on which our common coexistence rests are threatened whenever anyone, in any part of Europe, is killed because of their beliefs."
"Only the united stand taken by democrats can ensure that the perpetrators of violence are marginalised as well as those who, owing to the permissiveness generated in our democracies, protect, induce, justify or tolerate terrorist acts of any kind."
"I hope my message is clear."
"We all doubtless agree that dialogue is a decisive factor in the democratic process."
"There is only one exception to this golden rule and that exception is also an essential component of democratic systems."
"In a democracy, ladies and gentlemen, the voice of those who are intent on destroying it and who use criminal methods to achieve their ends must be silenced by the law, by the Rule of Law."
"Democracy must never bow to those who at the same time, and this is something I stress, at the same time, insist on holding it to ransom, gun in hand."
"I am convinced of the personal and political commitment of Commissioner Vitorino and the College of Commissioners to this undertaking, something that they have demonstrated on several occasions."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to use his exclusive powers of legislative initiative to propose new measures to enable us to make progress as regards European cooperation which, as you yourself pointed out, is still insufficient."
"One of the most effective measures in the fight against terrorism is in fact the European arrest warrant, which would mean that terrorists served their sentences in the country where they committed their most heinous crime."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by sparing a thought for those Europeans most affected by fear, in other words, the victims of terrorism and their families."
"Today, thanks to this debate, they are a little less alone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States of the European Union are unanimous in condemning terrorism, whatever the motives of the groups of criminals carrying out terrorist attacks, and so the Council of the European Union is just as firm in its condemnation of all the forms of terrorism carried out on European territory."
"I should like to point out that at the Summit of the Heads of State and Government which was held on 19 and 20 June this year in Santa Maria da Feira, in Portugal, the Council expressed its outrage at the tragic events related to terrorism in Europe and vigorously reaffirmed its commitment to continuing to fight terrorism at European level and to stepping up and intensifying cooperation between Member States in this area."
"Since France currently holds the Council Presidency, at this point I would particularly like to express our solidarity in the face of the terrorism in Spain, which is the most deadly in Europe at the present time."
"Clearly, the European Union cannot possibly tolerate Spanish terrorists using the construction of Europe as an alibi in order to justify their claims."
"In no instance can violent nationalism be compatible with the ideals of the European Union."
"Combating all forms of terrorism is therefore a priority for the European Union in order to achieve the area of freedom, security and justice set as a goal by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere Summit in October 1999."
"Of course, alongside the multilateral cooperation implemented by the European Union bodies, there is also particularly effective bilateral cooperation, and we have recently seen the results of French and Spanish operational cooperation."
"It is the role and the responsibility of the European Union in combating terrorism in general, and therefore also terrorism in Spain, which I wished to discuss this morning in my capacity as co-chairman, together with Elisabeth Guigou, the French Minister of Justice, of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"If you will allow me briefly to outline the story so far, the cooperation between the Member States of the European Union on internal security originated in 1976, at the time of the Trevi groups."
"These informal groups, which met every six months, were, from the outset, a reflection of the determination to have police cooperation in a number of areas, including on terrorism, which was of particular concern to the members of the Trevi I group."
"Cooperation in police matters, an idea developed at the Trevi Conference, led to the establishment of a network of liaison officers."
"The implementation of this network, undoubtedly the most effective cooperative network, was the result of the action programme adopted in Dublin in June 1990 by the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the twelve Member States at that time."
"It involves exchanges of information between experts posted in specialised departments in the various Member States."
"These liaison officers are responsible for exchanging information, but also for supporting the relevant departments in an advisory role."
"I think it is safe to say by now that this network of liaison officers has very clearly demonstrated its effectiveness by facilitating the smooth running of police inquiries in real time."
"In the context of cooperation on justice and home affairs, a specific counter-terrorism working group was also established, subsequently, by the Maastricht Treaty."
"This Experts Group on terrorism was confirmed by the Treaty of Amsterdam, clearly demonstrating the need for a body within which the representatives of the fifteen Member States have the opportunity to meet to exchange views and cooperate."
"The work of this group was what led the Council to adopt two important decisions which I would like to remind you of."
"In 1996, the Council adopted a Joint Action establishing a European Directory of specialised counter-terrorist competences, skills and expertise, and stipulating that it be maintained."
"Moreover, at the end of 1999, the Council adopted a recommendation on cooperation in combating the financing of terrorist groups."
"I should also at this point mention the role played by the European Police Office, Europol, in combating terrorism."
"From the outset, the Convention of 26 July 1995 establishing the European Police Office stipulated that this police cooperation body would be competent to deal with 'crimes committed or likely to be committed in the course of terrorist activities against life, limb, personal freedom or property'."
"The initial wording of the Convention stipulated that Europol' s mandate would be extended to terrorism within two years at the latest of the Convention' s entry into force, which was on 1 October 1998."
"As you know, there is a Europol department dedicated to combating terrorism."
"This was a request from Spain and so, naturally, a leading official from Spain was given the job of managing that department."
"In view of the criminal activity undertaken at that time by some terrorist groups, the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which met on 28 and 29 May 1998, took the decision to authorise Europol to bring forward its counter-terrorism activities and have them begin on 1 January 1999."
"Finally, I cannot, of course, fail to mention the current priorities of the French Presidency of the European Union in the area we are discussing this morning."
"In particular, the French Presidency wishes to improve and intensify the cooperation between Member States, but also to extend this cooperation yet further to include the candidate countries."
"This is both legal and police cooperation, which will no doubt one day lead to the harmonisation or unification of criminal charging systems."
"The Spanish Government, for example, would like a European arrest warrant to be established."
"Among the priorities of the French Presidency I should particularly like to mention the initiative to establish a programme of information and measures to be undertaken in order to prepare for the accession of the candidate countries to the European Union."
"This approach is intended to enable us to increase our knowledge of their counter-terrorism organisations and to increase awareness in countries which do not a priori have any specific experience in this field."
"In order to draw up an accurate picture of the terrorism situation within the European Union, and this is the second priority of our presidency, we wished to continue the practice of providing an opportunity at each meeting of the working group of exchanging information on recent developments in terrorism in each of the States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is this system, with a combination of bilateral and multilateral cooperation, which very recently, in fact just a few days ago, made it possible to achieve some remarkable successes in the fight against terrorism in Spain."
"Mr President, while we have been here discussing these issues, José Luis Ruiz, a town councillor of the governing Partido Popular party in a town in Catalonia, has been murdered by ETA."
"Some are trying to confuse us and seem intent on creating confusion between the people of good will in Parliament."
"But there is a clearly defined line that separates us."
"On one side stand those that die for democracy, and on the other, stand those that kill in their attempts to deprive us of our freedom."
"Thank you, Mr Galeote, for your contribution."
"The fact that this is the way things are done is extremely tragic and difficult to take in."
"Mr President, although I imagine that you were about to suggest the same thing, I, on behalf of everyone here, ask you to call for a minute' s silence for this latest victim of democracy, this time in Catalonia."
"(The House observed a minute' s silence) President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to return to the agenda, but we will have to do so."
"It is important for a Parliament to speak out in public on this kind of matter."
"Mr President, I was probably the first to hear about the terrorist attack this morning at 7.40, so I have known about it for a while now."
"The attack happened in Catalonia about three or four kilometres from my house and it appears that the situation is worsening since, even though ETA have already killed more than 800 people, they have committed yet another atrocity, even as we speak."
"No political objective justifies the use of violence."
"We can but express our wholehearted condemnation of terrorism and particularly at a time when the terrorists seem so intent on destroying us."
"We must therefore, once again, strongly reiterate our firm and cooperative position as the Commissioner said, in support of a strong democracy, given that terrorism constitutes a direct threat to our core values."
"We should like to express our solidarity with those who have been affected and also, in particular, our hope for peace."
"In the wake of the latest atrocity, the debate is especially difficult for this Member, and this is something I commented on to four of the five people that signed the declaration against terrorism in Spain."
"I pointed out to two of them that the signing of the declaration may prove difficult for some due to the content of one of the paragraphs, the second paragraph in fact."
"This paragraph rejects dialogue with any group that tolerates terrorism or that is involved in it."
"The reason I spoke to the authors of the text is that I think they need to find a formula on which everyone agrees."
"One might wonder why the second paragraph of the text as it stands is proving so difficult to sign."
"The reason is because it calls into question the culture of peace and the culture of dialogue."
"What is more, if we renounce dialogue the Northern Ireland peace process would not be possible, the Middle East peace process would not be possible and, the Member of the European Parliament, Mr John Hume, would not have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and I think it is important his work receives recognition."
"If ETA does not give up its weapons, we shall not give up ours."
"If ETA refuses to renounce violence, we shall refuse to renounce the law and dialogue, which are our weapons."
"We have no others."
"This is why I strongly urge those that presented the declaration - as I have done so in private and do so now publicly - to do all they can to enable us to sign it, because any position that is adopted on terrorism requires universal backing."
"On the other hand, if this declaration is supposed to stem from the 1997 declaration adopted by Parliament, which spoke of dialogue in positive terms, it would seem strange not to have recourse to it, and in particular, to the eighth paragraph in which Parliament considers dialogue in positive terms."
"Mr President, we should all be in a position to sign the declaration."
"Nothing justifies the use of terrorism and nothing justifies the failure of democratic forces to adopt a united front in the face of it."
"Mr President, I have requested the floor on a point of order regarding the intervention we have just heard from our distinguished fellow Member, Mr Esteve."
"On 14 December 1995, Parliament adopted a resolution in which it reiterated its rejection of any type of dialogue with anyone who collaborates with, protects, incites or carries out terrorist acts of any kind, and on 15 October 1998, Parliament adopted a resolution in which it reiterated its refusal to enter into dialogue with anyone that collaborates with, permits, encourages, supports or carries out criminal acts."
"These are both Parliament resolutions, Mr Esteve, and according to you we should encourage the signing of the declaration."
"It is difficult to encourage someone who is genuinely at peace with their conscience."
"Mr President, in addition to expressing my agreement with the content of Mr Esteve' s speech, I should firstly like, on behalf of our group and also on behalf of my party, Eusko Alkartasuna - one of the governing parties of the Basque Country along with our colleagues from the Basque Nationalist Party - to express our clear and wholehearted rejection of terrorism and especially today, in the wake of the criminal outrage that has been committed in Catalonia."
"We regret that unequivocal repudiations and constructive proposals do not, however, go hand in hand, as proved by the declaration that has already been discussed and which has been presented by several groups to the exclusion of others and without open debate."
"We naturally respect the freedom of individuals and political groups to make statements, but forcing us to reject dialogue, and for a large number of reasons, is something we cannot accept."
"In the first place, this is because we, like Mo Mowlam, firmly believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve violent conflicts in whatever part of the world, and, in the second place, because we cannot be inconsistent with declarations made by Parliament on previous occasions, a few of which I shall mention here."
"A few days ago in Strasbourg, President Nicole Fontaine herself made reference to all of the democrats of Europe, men and women alike, and especially the Basque Country in Spain, which, in her view, continues to believe in political dialogue, despite the climate of terror that exists."
"Where would Lionel Jospin, François Bayrou or our fellow Member of the European Parliament and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, John Hume, as well as all those in favour of the Irish peace process be if they accepted proposals that condemned dialogue?"
"Where would Commissioner Reding stand as a result?"
"I shall not quote from the text, but the Commissioner' s report on terrorism presented to Parliament in 1997 is there for consultation."
"When we talk about a serious European conflict we cannot consider it lightly and simply content ourselves with rhetorical and repeated statements, without attacking the root causes underlying all of these problems and without trying, together, to find a solution."
"Parliament needs to be in a position to promote initiatives that will put an end to this cruel violence afflicting the Basque Country, and which will help find new paths of dialogue, especially between the Basque democratic forces."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although all groups, including ours, must be self-critical, it is now time we set to work and, above all, attempted to combat such a serious problem as terrorism from solid foundations, the maximum consensus possible and, of course, in the knowledge that dialogue has been, is and will always be the most valued method for achieving peace and reconciliation."
"We could have presented an alternative text here, but this would have been a serious mistake because in our view, resolving a matter as serious and important as this requires us to do everything that we can, except to put forward proposals that divide Parliament."
"Allow me, if you will, to make a small personal confession."
"Thirty years ago at the height of the Franco dictatorship in 1970, I was in prison for championing freedoms and at that time I was against ETA."
"Like any human of integrity and intelligence, I am prepared to learn, but let me tell you this; I do not accept lessons in how to stand firm against terrorism."
"I shall end, Mr President, by recalling the words of Jorge Luís Borges when he wrote ""Around 500 years before the Christian era, the greatest thing to happen in the history of the world occurred in Greece - the discovery of dialogue."
"Faith, certainty, dogmas, anathemas, prayers, prohibitions, orders, taboos, tyrannies, wars and glories overwhelmed the order of things."
"Out of this, some Greeks acquired - we shall never know how - the singular habit of conversing."""
"Without those Greeks, Western culture would be inconceivable."
"If only today we were able to hold on to that great value of global culture that is dialogue, without prejudice to the greatest strength of our democratic convictions and the outright rejection of terrorism, and do so despite the latest painful, sad and abhorrent murder, even during the most difficult times and in the face of our most stubborn and murderous enemies."
"Mr President, on a point of order, Northern Ireland has been referred to a number of times in this debate and the notion of unconditional dialogue with terror has been suggested as the basis of the Irish peace process."
"The Irish peace process was based on the unconditional cease-fire of the Provisional IRA."
"Mr President, I understand that there are several debates taking place concurrently and that it is probably easier to speak when one is independent of any particular political group, but everything appears to be moving in favour of political dialogue and the clarification of what we are discussing here, as well as the objectives of the written declaration that has been presented."
"Today is pointless already, after all that we have heard about the significance of ETA terrorism, its devastating effects on the population, its outright assault on the democratic values enshrined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and in the Statute of Guernica, that cost the countless efforts and sacrifices of the Basque and Spanish people as a whole to achieve."
"We have heard from those who fought against the Franco dictatorship, who are present today and are to be commended, but there are others, now dead, who no longer have a voice and can no longer participate in political dialogue."
"This is why the issue must be clarified here today, and why I must respond to the various interpretations of what constitutes political dialogue."
"Quite clearly, over and above natural political differences political dialogue must exist, a political dialogue between people and organisations that respect and defend the values of democracy and freedom."
"Political dialogue cannot be achieved when, with one hand, or at a given moment, people call for dialogue and with the other, they turn a pistol or a bomb on those with whom they are supposedly in talks."
"(Applause)No one can be invited to join in this dialogue."
"Political dialogue should take place between democratic parties, whether they be nationalist or not, with Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya, with Convergència i Unió, with the PNV, with Eusko Alkartasuna, with Izquíerda Unida, with the PSOE, with the governing Partido Popular, and within the institutions, transparently and clearly, on behalf of the people and answering to all Spanish citizens."
"We cannot, however enter into the kind of dialogue that the proponents of violence are calling for, as that kind of dialogue is not permissible in a democratic and open society."
"We are aware that problems and any political, economic and social contradictions can be resolved through dialogue and through decisions taken by democratic institutions. However, we must not use dialogue as a universal rhetorical remedy that is also open to those who perpetrate and advocate violence and to those who bemoan the deaths as though they were traffic accidents when they are in fact cruel murders committed against children and defenceless people, as in the name of democracy, this is unacceptable."
"I think these people should remain silent and I hope they hear my message and adopt a more moral approach to the problem, as opposed to violence."
"(Applause)Dialogue cannot serve to cover up violence and terror, nor can it mean surrender in the face of crime. Political dialogue is only possible when the bombs cease to go off, the guns are silent and democratic values have been accepted."
"We wholeheartedly reject the call for dialogue and the meekness that both lead to dictatorships and concentration camps."
"We are, however, in favour of responsible and democratic dialogue in order to achieve peaceful coexistence and to strengthen democracy, which is so essential to us."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, more than 15 000 people have been arrested, more than 5 000 tortured."
"Hundreds of people have been killed."
"Journalists and deputies have been killed by state terrorists, local councillors have been killed by state terrorists, men and women, my colleagues have been killed by state terrorists in the Spanish Kingdom."
"Can the European Parliament collaborate with state terrorism?"
"(Loud protests and heckling)"
"Today, more than ever, the great majority of the Basque people remain committed to non-violence."
"It is particularly fitting, at this moment, to remind ourselves that the Lizarra Agreement, that two years ago opened the way to a peaceful and democratic Basque society, was consistently rejected by the Government of Madrid after an unconditional ceasefire."
"(Continued protests)"
"The moving remarks from the victims of ETA and the Spanish repression prove better than anything else the tragedy of permitting this excellent opportunity to be wasted."
"We stand ready to help in any way the peace process."
"We will never do anything that could hinder the settlement once and for all of the ongoing conflict through the recognition of the Basque identity."
"(Protests, pounding on desks)"
"Here you see the Spanish idea of freedom of speech and democracy."
"They are not tolerant, they have spoken for more than three-quarters of an hour, they cannot stand just one minute by me, that is their democracy."
"(Continuing protests)"
"The day when the European Union will stand for a political solution, I will assure you that for 100% of the Basque inhabitants, including PP and Socialists, will be the happiest day in our lives."
"Mr President, on behalf of the British Conservatives, I should like to offer our strong support to the Spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism."
"The United Kingdom has suffered from terrorism for over 30 years."
"Indeed, there was another incident in London last night, and I offer our condolences to the latest victim of terrorism in Spain."
"In order to defeat terrorists, it is essential that government should be unambiguous in the message that it sends out and that public opinion should be kept resolute."
"Terrorists should be given no hope of achieving their objectives by force, no comfort that they will avoid punishment for their awful crimes and no hiding-place."
"In particular, no European Union Member State should provide sanctuary for terrorists so they can mount attacks on another state."
"I am afraid the UK experience has in fact been largely negative on all these counts."
"We support the Spanish Government and security forces in their tough stance against ETA terrorism and express solidarity with the Spanish people and in particular, those that have suffered directly as victims of terrorism."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, let us send out a very clear and unequivocal message from this Parliament today that violence has no role of any description in solving the problems of a divided people."
"All that violence does is deepen the divisions and make the problem much more difficult to resolve."
"Organisations which use violence, should be told very clearly that their claim to be acting to achieve human and civil rights for people is completely false, because their method undermines the most fundamental human right of all, the right to life."
"The message we should send out is that there should be an absolute and complete end to violence."
"Following an absolute and complete end to violence, there can be dialogue and this dialogue should involve democratically elected representatives of all sections of the people."
"The objective of that dialogue would be an agreement that would enjoy the loyalty of all sections of the people."
"This is a straightforward and logical way of dealing with terrorism and those who genuinely want to solve the problem should have no difficulty in following that path."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I of course support the unreserved condemnation and outrage that everyone within this Chamber feels at the news that the blindest and most cowardly form of terrorism has struck once again in Spain, at 7.40 this morning, making a victim of José Ruiz, a municipal councillor in Sant Adrià de Besós, in Catalonia."
"On behalf of the European Council, I have pointed out the structure of bilateral and multilateral cooperation enabling our police and legal systems to relentlessly score points against terrorism."
"This cooperation achieved a notable success a few days ago with some of the main leaders of ETA being arrested in France."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, this success must not induce in us any sense of collective self-satisfaction."
"This is a just war which democracy is waging against violence and which we must continue to fight every inch of the way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would just like to add my own deepest sympathy with regard to the victim of the attack which occurred in Catalonia this morning, and also to stress my concern at the events in London."
"In particular, I want to state that, outside this debate on the legal instruments - police cooperation, legal cooperation, the questions of how to make the extradition system more effective and how to ensure a European mandate for investigation, which we are looking into - there is an added value which Europe is providing in the fight for freedom and democracy."
"I believe that the main message is a clear message of solidarity, solidarity with the people of Spain as a whole, and with the Basque people."
"On a personal note, like the Spaniards, I have lived in a country which spent more than 40 years under dictatorship at a time when all the other countries of Europe were democratic."
"I believe that the most important added value which your institution can give the fight for freedom and democracy in Europe is to send out this message of solidarity to the victims."
"We must never lose hope. We must never lose faith in the fact that freedom and democracy are values for all time."
"Mr President, I should just like to say two things: firstly, we all need to draw on the things that have been said; and secondly, that we realise when we are playing into the hands of those of whom we are so critical, by making noise while others are talking."
"Mr President, we all in fact need to know who is playing into the hands of whom, given that in this democratic Parliament words are what count above all."
"We democrats cannot prevent the terrorists from murdering us, but we can and must stop them from insulting us, and both democrats and freedom fighters have been insulted here."
"Mr President, over and above the dialogue with the perpetrators of violence, over and above the rejection of all terrorism, a rejection with which we wholeheartedly agree, I believe that there is something fundamental lacking in Spain, and that is dialogue between the Basque Government and the Spanish Government, dialogue between the Partido Popular (PP), the Socialists (PSOE), the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and Eusko Alkartasuna, the latter two of which are both governing parties in the Basque Country."
"Our decision not to sign this declaration is not the result of the fact that there is no dialogue with the terrorists, a position we understand, it is rather because there is no dialogue between the democrats which, over and above the cruelty of the killing, is the fundamental problem."
"Parliament needs to facilitate dialogue between the democrats."
"The President of my country, Galicia, once said that Europe no longer constituted an international affair and Mr Mayor Oreja said that he did not want international mediators."
"I stand by these two statements made by the Partido Popular party and make the point that Europe is no longer an international affair in our view and Parliament must mediate politically, not between the terrorists and the government, but between the Basque Government and the Spanish Government, between the PP and the PSOE and the PVN-EA, as this is what is presently lacking in Spain, over and above the terrorist violence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely sensitive issue."
"If we return to the procedure, I should like to give the floor to Mr Gorostiaga first."
"I wanted to end the debate a moment ago, but given the nature of the topic, I am being indulgent, yet I also have to be neutral."
"I would request the next speakers, if they want to raise a procedural point, to keep it extremely brief, and I would ask the honourable Members to remain as calm as possible."
"I shall now give Mr Gorostiaga the floor on a procedural motion."
"Mr President, that honours you greatly."
"You are really democratic because you accept free speech."
"It is not the problem really; these people do not accept that there is another possibility: namely that the Basque Country has the right to its own identity in Europe."
"That is what is impossible for the Spanish democrats to accept."
"Mr President, I am now in a position to provide Parliament with more details."
"The local councillor of the governing Partido Popular party, José Luis Ruiz Casado, was firstly shot in the back of the head and, on falling to the ground, was finished off by his killers."
"As I said before, Mr Nogueira, a person may choose which side of the fence to sit on, but he later cannot seek futile excuses to justify his decision."
"Mr Gorostiaga, in the name of this freedom of expression that you cite, can you look me in the eyes and assure me that neither myself nor my family are under threat from ETA for using this freedom of expression here in Parliament?"
"Can you honestly assure me of that, Mr Gorostiaga?"
"The debate is closed."
"I should like to thank the Council and Commission for their input."
"Racism"
"The next item is the joint debate on the oral questions:"
"(B5-0534/00) by Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council on the European Union' s stance, on the World Conference of 2001 against racism;"
"(B5-0536/00) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to the Commission, on racism in East Germany;"
"(B5-0537/00) by Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to the Commission, on right-wing extremist violence in Germany."
"Mr President, there must be a common and effective EU contribution to the success of the UN World Conference Against Racism next year and its European preparatory conference next month."
"The EU has a human rights duty and competence to make all different, all equal, a reality."
"It can and must forcefully tackle race discrimination and xenophobia making the EU a world leader in the celebration of multicultural and ethnic diversity."
"Let us do it with wholehearted political conviction, not just as a diplomatic exercise."
"This question and motion outlines ways in which racism must be documented and prevented and sanctions implemented."
"Getting effective sanctions means firstly exploiting EU powers for anti-discrimination laws and agreeing the Article 13 Race Directive in record time sent the right signal of determination."
"Effectiveness also means stepping up intergovernmental police and judicial cooperation under Article 29 of the EU Treaty and ways to do that are explored here."
"We want to hear that the Member States will sign Protocol No 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights which makes discrimination a direct infringement of the convention on the occasion of the convention' s fiftieth anniversary in November."
"Other Members and Groups with many helpful amendments which I will accept, but there are some I cannot accept."
"Firstly, I regret that the opportunity has been taken to identify specific countries and parties as especially bad e.g. Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6."
"The trouble with singling out some countries but not others is that you do not make a comprehensive assessment."
"I therefore appeal to the sponsors of these amendments to consider withdrawing them."
"In particular I would appeal to Mr Ford to withdraw his Amendment No 1 even if I have sympathy with it since it would be a pity if a motion on these very important European and world conferences were derailed over Austria."
"Mr President, scarcely a day goes by without a news report of right-wing extremist acts in central Germany."
"Citizens' initiatives, various religious denominations and other social groupings have been warning against right-wing extremism for years."
"It is there in the East and in the West, even though the acts are perpetrated by a minority."
"In the East, right-wing groups no longer regard themselves as a minority, but believe they hold centre stage in society, and they have cult status among young people."
"Silence breeds consent right across the social divide, which means there are certain zones in EU cities where the right wing holds sway and not the state."
"There may well be various reasons as to why this is so, e.g. people were brought up in a totalitarian state, many people in the East suffer from a lack of self-esteem, there is high unemployment, and young people feel they have no future prospects, but we must not dwell on these explanations and instead, take action at long last."
"A Europe founded on the inviolability of human dignity and which guarantees freedom of movement, must take a zero tolerance line with right-wing violence."
"So it is time to break our silence over the right-wing violence that has become an everyday occurrence in parts of the European Union, even if we stand accused of running down our own countries."
"We need a tolerant government and the pro-active financial support of local groups and players, and of those who have the courage to stand up for their beliefs."
"Europe must be seen to fly the flag on this issue."
"It must provide these groups with outside support, so as to encourage them to continue to stand up for their own convictions against the right wing."
"Mr President, in response to an inquiry from the PDS Group in the Bundestag, the German Government revealed that in 1999, a total of 2031 right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic criminal offences were committed in Germany."
"The well-known German newspaper 'Der Tagesspiegel' records that there have been 93 murders with a right-wing extremist background over the past ten years."
"Being of DDR origin, the developments in eastern Germany are of course particularly hard for me to bear."
"There are undoubtedly underlying reasons, stemming from the way society was in the DDR; in particular the after-effects of authoritarian structures and the weakness of civil society in eastern Germany."
"But there are just as many reasons that have to do with the developments that have taken place over the last ten years, for example the dissociation of economic and social development in eastern Germany from that in the former Bundesländer, the lack of respect for East Germans' curriculum vitaes and their experience, and the lack of rigour in the debate on right-wing extremism past and present."
"Long-established right-wing extremist parties and organisations are transferring their infrastructure, organisational set-ups and funds from the old Bundesländer to the new Bundesländer on a massive scale."
"The social polarisation of society, state withdrawal from social and educational establishments and the increasingly fierce competition within the labour market, provide a fertile breeding ground for racism and xenophobia."
"The feeling of helplessness that grips so many people in the face of socially and culturally destructive global competition, and the suppression of politics and democracy in favour of profit-making business interests."
"A policy of rhetoric, underpinned by nationalism, which uses immigration as a point of departure for election campaigns, will smooth the way for racism and xenophobia."
"The European Union' s restrictive immigration and asylum policy, the lack of transparency, and citizens' involvement, are contributory factors."
"The first thing we need though, is for there to be rigorous stigmatisation of racist and right-wing extremist views, secondly, the EU and its Member States must make their immigration and asylum policies more acceptance and integration-orientated, thirdly, we need an active employment and social policy, particularly for young people, and fourthly, we need a classical education policy that instils tolerance and considers cultural and ethnic diversity to be enriching."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to answer Baroness Ludford' s question point by point."
"The Council and the Presidency attach great importance to the European Conference against racism ""All Different, All Equal"" which will be held in Strasbourg between 11 and 13 October 2000, in preparation for the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism."
"In this context, the Presidency is sparing no effort to achieve the utmost cooperation and coordination between the Member States of the European Union in the preparations for the conference in Strasbourg."
"There is already very active coordination of efforts between Member States, in addition to the many preparatory meetings which have taken place."
"At this stage, the Council does not, at this European Conference in Strasbourg, intend to present a position common to the fifteen Member States, according to the terms of Article 34(2)."
"I think it is important, however, that the coordination between the European Union Member States should continue in order to avoid a situation where they are expressing divergent views on the various issues raised."
"The Council does intend, and I must stress this, to present a common position at the World Conference which is due to be held next year in South Africa, and work on finalising this common position has already been set in motion."
"In order to coordinate their positions ready for the European Conference, the Member Sates will, of course, take account of the very useful recommendations given in the document provided by the Commission departments on 17 April."
"As to the resources to be implemented in order to ensure maximum synergy between the work carried out in this area by, on the one hand, the United Nations High Commissioner's Office for Human Rights and, on the other, the Council of Europe' s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, but also the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, I would like to remind Baroness Ludford that, on 21 December 1998, the Council adopted a decision relating to the conclusion of an agreement for the purpose of establishing close cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Monitoring Centre, and that the cooperation between these two institutions has actually been very fruitful."
"Moreover, research is underway into how to establish closer links between the High Commissioner' s Office and the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia."
"I should, further, like to point out that on 21 June 2000, the Council directive was adopted, implementing the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin."
"Because of the duplication that now exists between this directive and the proposal for a directive on the creation of a general framework promoting equal treatment in employment and work - the directive on discrimination - racial discrimination was withdrawn from its scope, but let me remind you that the scope of this proposal for a directive is a great deal more limited than that of the directive previously adopted, which covers not only the sectors of employment and work but also social protection, welfare benefits and education, as well as access to goods and services and the provision of goods and services."
"Next, work on the Community Action Programme to combat discrimination is well underway within the Council and I can safely state today that, if the European Parliament issues its opinion during its first part-session in October, the Council will be in a position to adopt a political agreement on this text on 17 October, so that the text could be adopted before the end of the French Presidency, enabling the programme to be launched, as anticipated, on 1 January 2001."
"Finally, on the subject of the 1996 Joint Action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia, in May 1998 the Council examined a report on Member States' compliance with the obligations upon them under the Joint Action and decided that the implementation of this Joint Action should be re-examined in 2000."
"Let me point out that the Presidency is currently making arrangements for this review which will assist the Council in assessing the overall effectiveness of the Joint Action and in ascertaining which features need strengthening."
"I hope, Baroness, that I have given as full an answer as possible."
"Mr President, there were two monsters in Ancient Greek mythology which killed and swallowed people, Scylla and Charybdis."
"The two monsters in Europe today are terrorism and racism."
"And these, unfortunately, are the subject of our debate today."
"Odysseus overcame both monsters, but he needed ingenuity, persistence and courage."
"Today, the political, democratic leadership of Europe has to play the role of Odysseus."
"Sixty years ago, we lived through one of the worst wars in the history of mankind."
"The idea behind the European Union was to create institutions which would guarantee peace and significant steps were taken in the years which followed."
"Unfortunately, the clouds of racism are still hovering over Europe."
"There are numerous dimensions to the fight against racism at European level."
"One such dimension is the EU' s basic policy of deepening its policies, i.e. strengthening social cohesion in Europe and ironing out differences, and another is its enlargement policy, i.e. strengthening countries which have problems."
"As far as anti-racist policies in particular are concerned, I should like to refer to quite specific policies and measures."
"In 1996, the Council approved a joint action on judicial cooperation between Member States on questions of racism."
"We are about to enter the second stage of this joint action."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is a really important weapon in Europe' s institutional arsenal."
"Articles 29 and 13 allow us to adopt quite specific policies."
"Article 29 allows us to combat racism and xenophobia by cooperating in the area of justice and security, in order to create a single area of freedom and justice."
"In Tampere, the policy for measures in this sector was evaluated and decided and we are now moving more towards measures relating to this sort of crime via the Internet."
"Secondly, two directives have been proposed on the basis of Article 13; the directive on racial discrimination was voted through by the European Parliament and the Council in record time, a mere six months, and is now part of European legislation."
"The purpose of the second directive is to combat all forms of discrimination in the workplace and this will be debated during the French Presidency."
"Of course, laws alone are never enough, which is why the Commission has proposed an anti-discrimination programme which allows governments, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to work together on innovative policies and to exchange best practices in the fight against racism."
"The European monitoring centre in Vienna is an important institution, the purpose of which is to provide objective, reliable, comparable data on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and to act as a basic design tool at both European and national level."
"The monitoring centre has already drawn up studies on the extent of racism and on manifestations of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in various Member States, in order to analyse their causes, repercussions and results and has examined examples of good practices which are working in certain Member States."
"The monitoring centre is setting up a coordinated network of non-governmental organisations and organisations which can work together at European level in order to address questions of xenophobia."
"Similarly, it can make recommendations to the Community and the Member States in connection with policies which should be pursued and it has already been working with the German Government."
"Finally, the Strasbourg conference is a very important event."
"The Commission is also involved from the point of view of theoretical and political proposals."
"We have already submitted two documents incorporating all the experience and proposals on how to combat racism at Community level, together with our experience in matters of education, training, research and policy for young people in order to address these matters."
"There is financial support for the conference as regards non-governmental organisations because we believe that they can play an important role, over and above the role of governments and, of course, we are negotiating for support for the involvement of non-governmental organisations in the regional conferences to be held in Chile, Senegal and Iran."
"Honourable Members, we must never forget that the European Union was constructed in order to prevent a recurrence of the racist atrocities which we lived through 60 years ago."
"Policy is based, at European level, on an institutional arsenal which we strengthened with the Treaty of Amsterdam but in which there is still room for further effort, by creating structures to study and analyse this phenomenon and support governments, by supporting a European network between various agencies so that they can increase public awareness and, of course, by exchanging and supporting national policies on education, the mass media, policies for young people and information at national level."
"However, we must say, and this is important, that all these policies, this entire philosophy is based on one principle: zero tolerance in Europe towards racism and zero tolerance of the reason for any operation based on racism."
"Mr President, racism is indeed a scourge affecting our society."
"It is even one of the most appalling human failings, and no one has a monopoly on it."
"Often, it is the product of fear, ignorance, foolishness and selfishness, but also of institutional cowardice."
"If a society wishes to call itself truly civilised, it has a duty to track down, prohibit, punish and eradicate racism by means of education and prosecution."
"Europe wishes to be a civilised society, and has the opportunity every day to show that it is."
"Parliament is required to give an opinion on the European Union' s position at the World Conference Against Racism."
"Our position must be clear, intelligible and specific."
"Our position must be clear, without going into unnecessary details."
"Personally, I am all in favour of brief texts."
"It must be up-to-date, i.e. it must take account of the new means of communications which can also be used as media for the expression of racist views."
"Our position must be intelligible."
"That is to say, it must be structured around the major key ideas establishing a method: the identification of racism, particularly with the aid of our partners, the NGOs or our own monitoring centres, the punishment of racism, with the idea of zero tolerance and, of course, the prevention of racism."
"Our position must be specific."
"That is to say, beyond the universal value of the fight against racism, there must be a specifically European message, for, let us be clear about this, Europe has often been the home of racism."
"We can, moreover, even see the revival of racism in some European Union countries. In such instances we have a duty to remember and a duty to be vigilant."
"Our message must be an ambitious one."
"We must be a role model."
"As the Commissioner pointed out, we do not lack the resources to combat discrimination or racism in general."
"We are currently drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the first article of which prioritises human dignity."
"That, I believe, is the reason why the PPE has become involved in framing this text."
"We want to ensure that it is rid of all the pointlessly contentious dross to do with the current situation and free of any additions which do not contribute to the formulation of the text."
"In this, as the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament, we have a shared responsibility and we want to be very scrupulous about this common approach, as Europe' s credibility, at this World Conference Against Racism, will depend, above all, on our assessment of the situation and on how credible we are on our own territory."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate serves as a timely continuation of the debate we held in Parliament first thing this morning on the issue of terrorism in Spain."
"Today we learned of the death, very near to where I live, of another person who worked of his own free will in the world of politics: a local councillor."
"I say that this debate is a timely continuation of this morning' s debate because, as John Hume has so often reminded us in Parliament, all conflicts are linked to the notion of difference, all conflicts focus on what we do not accept in others."
"John Hume has also reminded us on many occasions in Parliament that the European Union is and must continue to be an example of conflict resolution."
"One could say that the European Union today is the practical expression of the exact opposite to the notions of terrorism and racism."
"This is why I believe that Europe has to go to the World Conference Against Racism having adopted a strong and common position, a position that has been tried and tested on other occasions, the first of which was the application in the European Union of the United Nations Convention of 1965."
"However, Mr President, I think there is another, more important issue that we must tackle without delay."
"We cannot allow the radicals in Spain - in El Ejido - in Italy, Germany or Austria to take the initiative in this field."
"We must talk to the people of Europe and we must - as has been achieved in the directive against discrimination - make progress on all of the other objectives of the Tampere European Council."
"Lastly, I should like to congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report and let her know that we intend to seriously examine its proposals."
"We have to accept that these days Europe is a more pluralistic place than it used to be and we must let the world know that we are pleased that this is the case."
"Mr President, 'They died because they looked different, thought differently and lived a different kind of life.' So read the title of an article in a daily newspaper on right-wing extremist violence in Germany."
"I do not intend to recount how many times Jewish cemeteries have suffered arson attacks and desecration, or describe to you the various racist attacks that have taken place."
"Racism in Germany and in Europe constitutes one of the greatest challenges our society has to overcome."
"Not only does racism put the minorities living amongst us at risk, it also jeopardises the values our societies were founded on after dreadful experiences."
"The European Union is the product of this development."
"We can only welcome the fact that the United Nations have seized the initiative and will hold a World Conference Against Racism next year."
"We must make use of this opportunity and make a clear European contribution to this conference."
"I very much regret that my colleagues from Germany are not present in the Chamber at the moment to join me in sending out the message that racism does not stand a chance, either in Germany or Europe."
"Mr President, from the racial persecution in El Ejido, in Spain, to the murder of Mozambicans in East Germany, everywhere incidents of racist violence are inflaming passions in the heart of Europe."
"We often condemn the perpetrators of such violence."
"I think it is high time that we pointed the finger at the people who provide the ideological weapons to arm them, the soundbites."
"As we know, the parties of the extreme right build themselves up by exploiting social problems, job insecurity and unemployment."
"This is what we must fight, and we must also, where necessary, combat the spineless consensus between traditional political parties, on the left wing as well as the right, which helps gain them more sympathisers."
"As you ought to know, the extreme right gets into power only by exploiting and stressing our weaknesses, the areas we neglect."
"All those who repeat their words and their ideas are therefore giving them credibility, and all those who think they can moderate them by involving them in public affairs are making them commonplace."
"It is not possible to understand the strategy of the parties of the extreme right by looking only at their hatred of foreigners."
"Instead one must look at their overall social programme, their homophobic utterances, and their anti-cultural attitude."
"It then becomes clear that their strategy is one of homophobic statements, attacks on culture and on workers' rights, opposing the right to strike, opposing the self-determination of workers."
"We should also avoid the situation of women being banished from the world of work due to the establishment of a 'wage' for mothers, as we have seen recently."
"The only possible response is a hardline attitude."
"We have only succeeded in combating the Front National effectively in France because we never had any government alliance."
"In Europe, we must make massive investments in education, prevention and combating job insecurity, and we must reaffirm the fact that non-European residents have the same rights as European residents."
"I shall conclude by thanking Commissioner Diamantopoulou for making the comparison between terrorism and racism, because I consider that it is an attack on the physical dignity of persons, and as such is intolerable."
"The Europe of tolerance and opposition to hatred versus the Europe of violence and indifference: this is what is at stake at the conference."
"Mr President, this is a valuable report, but it remains to be seen whether it will actually be followed up by those responsible."
"It is valuable, although there are some omissions: for example, there is no mention of one form of institutional racism, the denial of the right of self-determination of peoples."
"Sadly, the European Union has much to learn in this area: it has conferred the status of candidate country on Turkey, which denies this right, in the same way, moreover, that China denies this right to Tibet, and yet the whole world is in favour of improving relations with China for economic reasons."
"In relation to this report, I would like to focus particularly on Amendment No 6 - which I hope will be rejected - which cites the political movement to which I belong as a racist party."
"Now, there are very strict laws against racism in Italy."
"The judiciary is by no means lenient towards my political movement: our secretary has been convicted on several occasions and prosecuted a number of times, but never for racism."
"The party leaders, and I myself, are under investigation on grounds of separatism, which is punishable by imprisonment, but no member of my movement has been either convicted or brought to trial for racism or acts of violence."
"I therefore do not understand why we are being accused of racism."
"I belong to the Lega Nord, not to Mr Haider' s movement, and I therefore fail to understand why the two should be confused."
"I reiterate: in Italy, my movement is not currently arraigned on charges of racism and has never been convicted of racism in the past, and I therefore fiercely reject this accusation."
"The statements of those jokers who persist, year in, year out, in asserting to the contrary, are pure fabrication."
"Mr President, last Friday, the German Lower House discussed adopting a more hard-line approach in order to fight right-wing extremism at home."
"This was an opportune debate at the appropriate level."
"The spokesperson of the Greens, and as such a fellow member of the party of Mrs Schroedter, who submitted the oral questions, argued on that occasion that there are no easy solutions for combating right-wing extremism."
"However, to him, the many initiatives against right-wing extremism from the citizens in the new federal states offer a ray of hope."
"This Green representative sounds all in all less gloomy and less alarming than his colleague within our own EP ranks."
"In saying that, I have no intention of playing down the genuine concerns of Mrs Schroedter with regard to society' s current aversion to foreigners, if not downright xenophobia in the east of Germany."
"Considerably more East Germans than West Germans seem to think that too many foreigners are residing within their own territory and even feel exploited by this group."
"A remarkable state of affairs, given the sobering fact that hardly any foreigners live in East Germany."
"They make up between 1 and 2.5% of the population over there, according to a recent German press source."
"It seems logical that this paradox is very much playing on the minds of the Germans."
"It is exactly this crucial factor at home that I miss in Mrs Schroedter' s written introduction to her questions."
"By way of background to racist violence in the new federal states, she quotes the ""dramatically high percentage"" of racist attitudes among the population, including the fact that racism is being elevated to ""a kind of youth culture"" ."
"This reasoning immediately brings to mind an obvious follow-up question: why do racism and right-wing extremism thrive within the territory of the former German Socialist state of workers and farmers, the GDR, of all places?"
"Our fellow MEP, André Brie provides a clear and plausible answer to this."
"The writer of the Frankfurter Allgemeine' s leader quoted him approvingly yesterday as saying: 'One of a number of causes of right-wing violence is definitely to be found in the GDR.'"
"The German commentator, Lutz Rathenov, is bringing this viewpoint even more into focus: 'The GDR used to treat foreigners in a way which right-wing extremists would dream about these days.'"
"This attitude is, to this day, leaving its mark in the east of the united Germany."
"According to Rathenov, right-wing extremism cannot be eradicated as a localised and clearly identifiable evil. Instead, a social norm has emerged for which the Federal Republic is ill prepared and for which it is partly to blame."
"Which West German negotiating partners of the GDR were concerned about the fate of the Vietnamese immigrant workers in East Germany at the time?"
"In the words of Rathenov, did it bother him as a Christian Socialist negotiator, that, in the event of their becoming pregnant, these Vietnamese women were forced to have abortions?"
"Overcoming the GDR complex within the Federal Republic, namely the feeling many East Germans have of being second-class citizens, will take time."
"As an antidote to East German right-radicals, neo-nazis and skinheads, insider Lutz Rathenov is making an interesting proposal: 'There are places where young people should be sent abroad en masse for a couple of years.'"
"On a voluntary basis, I think Europe would be prepared to finance this proposal."
"Mr President, unfortunately, a number of delegates here in this House are using this extremely important debate about racism to place themselves on an imaginary list of good and evil."
"Whilst those of a left-wing persuasion define their position at a comfortable distance from Stalinism, Communism and left-wing extremism as if it were the most natural thing in the world, they are evidently incapable of recognising the difference between the right, right-wing extremism and fascism."
"However, those who, as a matter of course, only ever lay responsibility for crimes against humanity at the door of their political opponents, are committing the fatal error of simply using those very crimes to absolve themselves of all blame."
"No one in this House becomes an anti-fascist by denouncing their political opponents as fascists."
"One cannot escape one' s own history and one' s own responsibility that easily."
"Finally, a word to Mr Ford, who unleashed the customary tirade of hatred against Austria in his proposed amendment."
"Perhaps next time he could get his political facts straight, because that is not how the European Council responded."
"Austria still belongs to the European Council, and no one spoke to us on that occasion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is this debate actually about?"
"Quite simply, it is about the difficult task of finding a position which the European Union, i.e. the European Parliament, can agree on as regards a strategy for dealing with racism, and then representing this position at the world conference."
"The Commissioner has made constructive proposals on a sensitive issue, as has the author of the motion for a resolution, Mrs Ludford, and we will support them in this."
"But this debate should never be misused for other purposes."
"I am sorry to say that certain delegates have repeatedly done exactly that; for example there is one who only makes reference to one region in the fight against racism, thereby giving an exaggerated impression of the problems which exist on a European and worldwide scale."
"Mr Ford defamed my country, Austria, in his statement."
"He told me he had not read the Wise Men' s report, but that did not stop him from writing in his statement, with reference to the report of the Three Wise Men, that the problems of racism and xenophobia would endure."
"Had he read the report, he would have found that that is patently untrue."
"There are no problems there of the kind he describes."
"On the contrary, the report registers a very positive response to the government, because it is pursuing successful counter-strategies, some of which go beyond the standards set by other EU countries."
"I have here motions for resolutions that call, in general terms, for budgetary lines to be increased, without saying to what end, and without specifying which activities are to be the beneficiaries of this funding."
"Some of the demands are excessive, such as those calling for the level of immigration to be increased, and for illegal entrants to the Union to be placed on an equal legal footing."
"These are all things that work people into a state of panic, given the sensitivity of the issue."
"What we really need is a plan for tackling the root causes, immigration policy strategies that take account of integration capacity, and of an individual Member State' s absorption capacity, also strategies leading to a common asylum policy which help refugees whilst tackling abuse, and measures promoting integration."
"We ought not to be so superficial and submissive in our dealings with this issue."
"The matter is far too serious for that."
"As I see it, there is a great deal to be done, and those who want to work constructively on this issue are invited to take the proposals put forward by Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Mrs Ludford as their true example, and to disregard, or give a wide berth to unsuitable debates in plenary session, with a view to making progress in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sichrovsky has just given us some food for thought."
"It is true that being on the left does not make you proof against a fascist mindset."
"History has borne this out."
"Therefore it is absolutely true that the left must reflect on their past too, as must the right."
"But the object of the exercise today is for the democrats to give thought to the tasks they face here and now."
"The task facing the democratic parties at present, be they in East Germany, in your country, in Italy or in Spain - El Ejido to name but one - is how to actually mobilise the silent majority of people who stand idly by and watch as defenceless, helpless people are driven through the streets and murdered."
"How do we mobilise this majority?"
"The question we must ask ourselves is this, 'Why are five thousand people in my homeland - which is North Rhine Westphalia in Germany - prepared to take to the streets in protest against a decree on fighting dogs, but only 300 turn out to protest against right-wing extremism?'"
"That is the question we must ask ourselves."
"I will tell you something, Mr Sichrovsky, you represent the Freedom Party."
"People who criticise your party are not disparaging Austria as a whole."
"I respect the Austrian people but I despise the racists in your party - let there be no mistake about that - of whom you are one."
"The same applies to you, Mr Pirker, in every sense."
"Therefore, to recap: the point of these oral questions, and the statements made by Mrs Ludford, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs Kaufmann, is not to single out any old region in Europe and say 'that is where things are at their worst' ."
"We German delegates, coming as we do from a land notorious for its perpetrators of fascism, always find it hard to bear that something like this is going on in our country, of all places."
"But anyone who believes that fascism is a German phenomenon inevitably plays down the fact that the problem is endemic to Europe."
"Therefore I say again: this is a European battle."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, as a Radical and a European Federalist, an anti-fascist and an anti-communist, I put to you this question: which is worse in terms of racism: the programmes of extremist right-wing parties or the practical policies of European governments, which are prohibitionist and repressive on matters of immigration, drugs, new forms of employment and everything else?"
"Which is worse?"
"Parliament has no trouble appeasing its conscience on this matter, making solemn declarations and financing useless initiatives and monitoring centres."
"But racism should be fought by basing our societies on rights and freedoms, whereas Europe is growing into an anti-democratic, prohibitionist society which is repressive in all areas, with the result that it has become fearful to the point that it even wants to ban opinions and parties."
"This is the road to ruin."
"In the United States of America, where, in 2050, whites will be in a minority, there is an American Nazi party and there is a candidate for the American presidential elections from the Nazi party, but no one thinks of banning it, no one is afraid, because the weapons of democracy and freedom are being used to combat racism."
"This is how racism must be fought, and this is how we must fight it in Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Schulz called me a racist."
"Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity to respond."
"He described himself as a representative of a country notorious for its perpetrators of fascism."
"I would never use such an expression, even though many members of my family were murdered during the Holocaust."
"I would ask Mr Schulz, as a representative of the country notorious for its perpetrators of fascism - his own words - to cite just one, just one, racist comment that I have made in the course of my career in politics."
"If he is unable to come up with one, then would he please apologise, not for criticising, but for vilifying my character."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can safely say, from what we have heard this morning, that extremism and racism are two of the most important issues we have to deal with at present. The past few months in particular have seen a whole spate of racially motivated criminal acts in Germany."
"The events that took place in Dessau, Munich, Ludwigshafen, Düsseldorf are of such concern to us primarily because violent acts were committed against defenceless people with great indifference and coldbloodedness."
"The fact that the crimes were committed in all these different places, however, shows that racism and right-wing extremism are not problems specific to East Germany, but are to be found throughout Germany, indeed throughout Europe."
"It does not help matters though, Mrs Schroedter and also Mr Schulz, to want to concentrate on tackling this problem in the new German Länder, singling these regions out for attention."
"It is true that the propaganda peddled by these groups, which have long been active in the old Länder, has, I regret to say, fallen on fertile ground in the new Länder in recent years, and that we undoubtedly need to take appropriate action."
"But hysteria makes for a poor counsellor."
"What we need is to show a united front in the fight against violence, but also to have faith and confidence in the ability of state and society to rid us of this monster."
"It is in no one' s interests to assert that over 10% of people in the new Bundesländer are of a racist disposition, or to disparage them as such."
"16 million citizens cannot, and will not, allow themselves to be labelled as such all because of the activities of an extremist minority."
"Our citizens have done nothing to deserve this, and nor, more to the point, have our young people, the vast majority of whom are tolerant and open-minded."
"I would expressly like to draw attention to the various actions undertaken by the inhabitants of the new Bundesländer over the past few weeks and months, which have demonstrated repeatedly that they feel a great deal of solidarity with the victims of these crimes, and that we will not tolerate xenophobic machinations and acts of violence in our country."
"Mr President, there has been some interest in my commitment to Austria."
"I have to say to Mr Pirker that I have been interested in what has been happening in Austria for some time."
"I was there in 1986 protesting about Mr Haider' s discrimination against the Slovene speaking minority in Corinthia."
"While I accept, of course, that individual members of the Freedom Party may well be impeccable and upstanding individuals, there is a phrase that those that lie down with dogs get fleas."
"So it may be unfortunate that some people who have chosen particular political parties get labelled in that way but it is their own ultimate responsibility."
"Can I congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report."
"She has put a great deal of work into it."
"I have to say, however, and it is not her fault, that there are sins of omission as far as I am concerned."
"Commissioner Diamantopoulou made the point very clearly that there are two monsters facing us here in Europe, terrorism and racism."
"We have to recognise that those monsters exist and I am not sure that we do in this particular resolution."
"There is still a view that there is not really any racism in Europe."
"If there is any racism, it is fairly small and, if it does exist, it is the fault of the victims."
"I reject that."
"We have had in East Germany the assassination of a Mozambique man, attacks on migrant workers in Spain, an attack on a Jewish professor in Italy, and the continued rise of racism within football that was presented to us yesterday by those people who are campaigning around the "" Show racism the red card"" slogan."
"We have had the recent condemnation of a terrorist bomber in the United Kingdom, David Copeland, who killed gay people and non-gay people in a gay bar and, of course, we have had the effective sacking of Professor Pelinka from the Observatory by the Austrian Government."
"If Europe wishes to play a central role in the World Conference Against Racism it has to start seeing itself as others see it rather than as we would like to be."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Leipzig, from East Germany that is."
"I have seen often enough how right-wing extremists have harassed - or attempted to harass - foreigners, or even those who hold different beliefs."
"But I have also seen the other side, and how courageous men and women have defended themselves."
"It is wrong to picture East Germany as being predominantly right-wing extremist in its leanings."
"The vast majority of people are open-minded and tolerant, and an ever-increasing number of them are prepared to nail their colours to the mast."
"I believe it is also wrong to maintain that the young people are right-wing extremists."
"The issue is more complex than that, for although, Mrs Schroedter, it may be precisely these young people that grab the headlines, they do live with their parents and exist within a social sphere."
"In other words, if we want to solve this problem then we must do more to educate them politically and to communicate values to them, and more still to encourage them to stand up for their beliefs."
"Over the past few weeks, the German Government has made an additional DM 70 million available for just such projects."
"I feel that is a very important sign."
"Likewise, for me personally, the fact that consideration is being given to banning the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany) sends out a very important social signal."
"We Germans will not submit to being terrorised by a minority."
"It is our democracy that is being put to the test here."
"Speaking as a European, I beseech you not to write East Germany off as a region."
"I myself, together with many other people throughout Germany, condemn right-wing extremism and xenophobia, and we need the support of the rest of Europe in our fight against it."
"Mr President, allow me to start, in this highly topical debate, by supporting what Mr Sylla said yesterday before the order of business, i.e. that we must begin by combating manifestations of racism here in this House and that we must stamp out the racist language to which the far right wing of Parliament frequently resorts."
"However, whether some of us like it or not, Europe is already a multiracial and multicultural continent and no racist is going to stop people intermingling and intermarrying."
"Unfortunately, the ideologies to which millions of human lives were sacrificed are again taking centre stage."
"In fact, today, they are even worse, because apart from the basic racist ideology, they include religion and culture and propagandise racial, linguistic and religious purity together with genuine cultural identity."
"The sad thing is that the proponents of racial violence are young people up to the age of 20, most of whom have not completed their education or who do not have a profession."
"The package of measures which Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already presented is, in my view, an integrated proposal and may provide a convincing response to the racism and xenophobia which we are witnessing today in the European Union."
"That the state and political leaders have a responsibility goes without saying."
"However, the media still have an important role to play by promoting the variety and richness of contemporary multiracial and multicultural society and, instead of dramatising and distinguishing crime by immigrants from crime in general, could present the positive contribution made by immigrants."
"We also need to take immediate action to include the consequences of and the fight against racism in school curricula and in teacher training courses."
"We also need to mobilise political circles in the way suggested by the Commissioner and other honourable Members."
"Mr President, I asked to speak out of turn because I feel that I have to set the record straight."
"Europe is based on principles of freedom, justice and respect for human rights and it is not entitled to discounts either internally or with its negotiating partners, still less for commercial or economic reasons."
"I should therefore like to make it clear that, as far as Turkey' s candidature is concerned, the criteria have been laid down quite clearly."
"Negotiations on Turkey' s candidature will only commence once we feel that it meets the Copenhagen criteria."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Organised crime"
"The next item is the oral question (B5­0476/2000) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on a Council action plan to prevent and combat organised crime."
"Mr President, honourable Members, this debate is about fighting crime - organised crime to be precise - which is now responsible for at least one in four of all crimes, and which makes huge profits from drug crimes, trafficking in human beings, insurance and credit card fraud, and from other activities."
"These ill-gotten gains are laundered and go into circulation in the legal economy."
"In so doing, they undermine our national economies, and in view of corruption, also erode our social systems and states."
"We therefore need to muster all our resources and bring all our strategies into play, so that we are appropriately equipped in our fight against organised crime."
"So we need these measures, and this proposed plan of action has special significance, because it sends out a signal to the people of Europe that Europe is not just an economic and currency union, but in the interests of its people and the Member States, it must also be built up into a union of security."
"An action plan of this kind will undoubtedly help to achieve this objective."
"But we must take the necessary European rules of the game into account when putting plans of this kind into practice."
"That is what happened with this action plan, and so I submitted a parliamentary question back in the spring, at the time of the Portuguese Presidency, which has applied itself very diligently to this issue, but has failed to play by the rules."
"Indeed the Presidency promised that Parliament would deal with the action plan, the opinion would be awaited and then incorporated into the action plan, and only then would the action plan be put into practice."
"The erstwhile Portuguese Presidency failed to keep its promise and this led to the question being asked that we are dealing with today."
"The criticism is justified, for more reason than one."
"Firstly, because the failure to involve Parliament has taken us a step backwards, not just to the days before the Treaty of Amsterdam, but long before the Treaty of Maastricht, because according to Chapter 6, Parliament must be involved in every case."
"But even the Treaty of Amsterdam demands openness and transparency and so, as a body representing the interests of the citizens, Parliament should have played a full part in the proceedings, as per the undertaking it received here from the Presidency at the beginning."
"Another broken promise."
"The question I would like to ask the French Presidency is how it intends to handle this, i.e. whether it will involve Parliament in the framing of long-term strategies, as provided for by the Treaty, await our opinion and then develop strategies that are in keeping with Parliament' s proposals."
"However, the action plan content has also been subject to criticism, which has to do with the fact that recommendations have been drafted and numbered from 1 to 5 in order of priority."
"Yet these lists of priorities have not been drawn up solely on the basis of urgency and absolute necessity, but very often, I regret to say, on the basis of feasibility, and I will give you an example."
"The freezing, or confiscation, of the ill-gotten gains of organised crime was only given a priority rating of 3, even though we all know that money is the driving force behind organised crime, and so the freezing, or confiscation, of these assets should have been given a priority rating of 1."
"There are other examples I could mention."
"I therefore call upon the French Council Presidency to rethink this list of priorities and to reorganise it in terms of real priorities, rather than ranking the objectives according to how difficult they will be to accomplish."
"We also feel that we need to develop preventive measures, and we have submitted concrete proposals to this end."
"They range from reviewing legislation in terms of the impact it has on preventing organised crime, to preventive measures aimed at deploying technical instruments too, with a view to nipping organised crime in the bud."
"For example, these include higher security standards for credit cards or electronic immobilisers for cars."
"So what we are talking about is a whole host of concrete proposals, and as a Parliament we are aiming firstly, to be fully involved in the process, and, secondly, for our proposals to be incorporated into the action plans, i.e. the long-term strategies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of course shares the view that it is important to ensure a wide exchange of views and information and maintain consultation between the institutions of the European Union."
"The Presidency has also committed itself to involving Parliament to a greater extent in the work undertaken in the field of justice and home affairs, in particular by means of regular participation in the meetings of your parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The Council is bound, nonetheless, to comply with the terms of the Treaty."
"The legal framework does not, in fact, allow it to consult Parliament on strategy papers currently being studied within the offices of the Council."
"On the other hand, as you know, on 21 December 1999, the Council sent Parliament the strategy document on organised crime drawn up under the Finnish Presidency, expressly specifying that it wished to keep Parliament informed right from the start of discussions on this document."
"What is more, at the meetings of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Portuguese Presidency informed Parliament of the work being carried out and of the reasons why the Council deemed it urgent to continue with the procedure for the adoption of the strategy document."
"In particular, the Presidency explained that the previous action programme, for 1997, had already expired and that the European Council had requested that it be followed up."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not unaware that, in response to the strategy document, Parliament is currently working on a new document on organised crime."
"We are pleased to see the work carried out by Parliament."
"As in the case, moreover, of Parliament' s response to the 1997 action programme on organised crime, the Council fully intends to study your reports carefully during the implementation of its own strategy and to take the views expressed by Parliament into account."
"In this respect, the Council suggests that Parliament give its opinion on the level of priority to be given to the various recommendations made in its document."
"In accordance with the commitments made during the Portuguese Presidency, the Council will keep Parliament informed on a regular basis of the debates currently taking place in the field of justice and home affairs."
"It was indeed the Portuguese Presidency which demonstrated a clear intention, through its initiatives, to pay special attention within the European Union to the prevention of organised crime."
"In this respect, the Council confirms that it will strictly apply the Treaty when consulting the European Parliament on any action resulting from an initiative of the Member States or the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the French Presidency for its clear and unequivocal words and - I think I speak on behalf of the whole Parliament here - I welcome its concern on the matter, something that the Presidency-in-Office once again demonstrated today during the debate on terrorism."
"Mr President, there is in fact one thing that the people of Europe are unable to comprehend, and that is why criminals in Europe enjoy all the advantages of the freedom of movement, whereas those who legitimately fight crime are hindered by the issue of borders."
"This issue is also of concern to Parliament, as the representative of our citizens, which is why, ever since the start of this debate, Parliament has been acutely aware of the need to make progress in this area."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam marked the beginning of the so-called 'communitisation' of many policies, but not those relating to criminal matters in both procedural and substantive terms."
"The reasons behind this are not always immediately obvious to the people of Europe: they are rooted in our legal cultures and in the differences between our legal cultures."
"However, Mr President, over and above these deep-rooted differences lie the most deeply-rooted common principles which ultimately boil down to something as simple as the need for trust between Member States."
"The construction of Europe is based on the mutual trust that exists between Member States and the mutual recognition of similar levels of protection regarding fundamental rights, legislation and basic principles."
"This is why - and here I recall the ever enlightening and splendid words of Commissioner Vitorino who called for common definitions to be established in the field of organised crime and similar rules to be laid down regarding the sentences imposed and the time served - this is an issue that must be studied in the long term, as the idea of ""vérité en deçà des Pyrénées, erreur au delà"" [all that is truth this side of the Pyrenees, all that is falsehood beyond], cannot hold true."
"We cannot afford such luxuries in this area."
"In the meantime, Mr President, we are making progress in the area of trust and mutual recognition and the Council has submitted a proposal that is supported by the various Member States."
"As we are in the process of reaching this last stage of development, we must firmly ensure that an order or resolution pronounced by a judge in a Member State is automatically recognised and implemented by another Member State."
"In other words, an arrest warrant for a terrorist should take effect immediately without the need to go through the highly complex extradition process - which is still complicated between European States - so that the terrorist or criminal can be taken immediately to the State that wants them and where they have committed their crimes."
"This, Mr President, is what we urge you to do and what we hope will soon become a reality."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the French Presidency for its very clear statement."
"Our priority in criminal matters is combating crime, particularly money laundering."
"France' s request for a joint Council of Ministers for Justice, Home Affairs, Economic Affairs and Finance devoted to combating money laundering, was therefore extremely interesting."
"Let me also draw your attention, at this point, to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters to combat organised crime, tabled by the French Presidency in order to remove the obstructions affecting the work of judges."
"Studies indeed show that impressive amounts of criminal proceeds are amassed by organised crime and reinvested in the world economy."
"In this way, criminal organisations infiltrate the economic fabric of states and can, if they so wish, destabilise our economies by taking control of commercial companies."
"Legal and police cooperation is absolutely vital in the fight against organised crime, particularly the trafficking of human beings, the sexual exploitation of children, and money laundering."
"The Member States must define common penalties and adopt a consistent overall policy."
"We cannot, however, discuss penalties without discussing crime prevention, and clearly we must implement programmes for educational and information purposes, directed, in particular, at the citizens of our own States but also at the populations of third countries."
"Criminal organisations can find themselves in a position of strength thanks to the financial operations they carry out in order to launder criminal proceeds."
"The fight against organised crime is an important undertaking, where we must not fail."
"The victims expect a great deal of us and this is a challenge we must accept."
"The Europe we want to build is a Europe of rights."
"One of these rights is the right to security for all."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group believes - with all due respect to yourself, Minister - that the Council of Ministers is looking foolish once again."
"Perhaps not according to the letter of the Treaty but certainly according to its spirit, Parliament must be involved in any proposed policy measure."
"This is simply the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam and our rapporteur, Mr Pirker, was absolutely right to point this out."
"I can perhaps interpret the Minister' s response as a promise that this kind of procedure, whereby the Council of Ministers decides upon a policy document without involving this Parliament beforehand, will not occur in future."
"I understand why it is happening."
"The presidency' s term is only six months and every presidency is keen to flex its political muscles."
"This is how it goes."
"However, this Parliament cannot accept this as an excuse for being kept in the dark."
"I would now like to turn to European crime prevention. The Liberal Group believes that, in addition to all kinds of practical measures which are included in the document, it is, in particular, high time that criminal prosecution was improved by means of European cooperation."
"This does not appear to be happening."
"I would like to take this opportunity to argue once again in favour of setting up a European public prosecution office."
"Although this is required as a matter of urgency, it has not been provided for in this plan, nor has it been mentioned at Tampere or on the scoreboard."
"This is a missed opportunity."
"In fact, the scoreboard, in the field of crime prevention, refers far too often to documents which Commissioner Vitorino is to issue, studies which are being carried out, guidance documents and such like."
"Documents are not what we need to fight crime."
"Instead we need to tackle crime head-on."
"Mr President, it will take time to harmonise the penal systems."
"Therefore, all the Member States must immediately harmonise the concept of international organised crime and introduce penalties against it."
"Organised crime is more than terrorism, trafficking of dangerous drugs, abduction, arms trafficking, money laundering etc: now, more than ever, it includes the trafficking of human beings, who are sold and exploited like slaves, and the sexual exploitation of children."
"In our quest to develop legislation which is common to all the Member States, and lays down penalties for international organised crime, there is a particularly urgent need to find a way of regulating the Internet, in order to prevent an information tool, created to bring men and cultures closer together, becoming increasingly used by organised crime as a means of communication and expansion."
"In the face of the thousands of Internet sites with turnovers of millions of euros, which sell children and exploit them sexually, Parliament, the Commission and Council must think carefully."
"For genuine freedom to exist, it must be regulated, for otherwise it becomes an abuse of power, and, in this sense, the organised crime of the underworld is much more powerful than governments or our speeches, which flow forth in abundance in defence of the weaker members of society but which have hitherto proved completely incapable of containing evil."
"This is why we reiterate the need for the Member States to acknowledge the reality of international organised crime and to harmonise their penal codes in this specific field immediately."
"This matter must also be included on the Nice agenda, for it is a subject which closely affects the citizen and is also urgent, both because the situation in the Member States has reached dramatic proportions - witness even this morning' s events and the extent of the bloodshed on European territory in recent weeks - and because, with enlargement on the horizon, there is an urgent need for a solution to be found to the problem of organised crime."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Mr Pirker for this excellent initiative and to express my support for the positions that he has already adopted. I should also like to congratulate the French Presidency on their statement to us."
"I think that most of us recognise the need for greater coordination and closer cooperation between Member States on the issue of fighting the world of crime."
"This action is a common responsibility, given its international dimension, as such criminal organisations generally operate across national borders because of the high degree of mobility they have and even take advantage of restrictions on jurisdiction, loopholes in the law, and of the differences between national administrative and criminal justice systems, exploiting the anomalies of the various systems."
"Organised crime in the European Union has seen significant developments over the last decade, requiring action essentially in the areas of computer crime, crime involving trafficking in human beings, drugs and arms, terrorism, child pornography and money-laundering as well as corruption and fraud."
"It is crucial for the European Union to adopt a harmonised definition of organised crime that covers all of these areas. The fight against this type of crime therefore requires urgent action."
"This is a fight which must engage us all and which must be able, specifically, to count on the participation of the European Parliament in defining the strategies to adopt and the priorities to set."
"I would ask the honourable Members to sit down, because the debate has not yet finished; alternatively, if you wish to talk, please go outside, as it is actually quite difficult to hear what the speakers are saying."
"The respect we owe them requires certain minimum conditions to be met so that they can speak and be heard."
"Mr President, it is a matter of deep concern that, yet again, the European Parliament has not been consulted on the Council' s intended action plans for the prevention of and fight against organised crime."
"The European citizens, who, every day, live through the drama of all forms of petty and serious crime - from international drug trafficking to the sexual exploitation of children, from the trafficking and exploitation of human beings to illegal immigration - who live in towns which are unsafe or even dangerous, would like to be able to express their opinions and to lay claim, democratically, through their representatives at the European Parliament, to their rights and priorities of security and the fight against crime."
"Most importantly, Parliament should be able to give a voice to the defenceless, and I am referring to the many children who are victims of violence or sexual abuse and the many adolescents who are ensnared by drugs."
"Clearly, the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and that against drugs - to quote but two examples - are genuinely extremely difficult tasks, but they are priority issues, and it is certainly not acceptable, as the Council advocates, for priority to be dictated by feasibility rather than urgency,"
"I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, I would ask you to turn your attention briefly to a letter which we received from Mr Balfe, on behalf of the College of Quaestors, in which, referring to the car-free day tomorrow in Brussels, he has requested the Brussels authorities make an exception for the area around the European Parliament."
"He would like to ensure that a limited number of cars are able to drive from here to Zaventem and to the railway stations, for example."
"It is extremely easy to travel by rail from here to Zaventem, which is what we did last time with the Swedish delegation, or to travel to the station."
"No problem at all."
"I would ask you to raise this matter and find out whether others are agreed on this proposal."
"We, for our part, certainly are not."
"I am sure the Quaestors have noted the point you have made."
"Vote"
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say that I am astounded at the vote on Amendment No 16 because, as far as I was aware, it had been withdrawn, but, more especially, I should like to request that my report be referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 69(2)."
"Indeed, at the end of last night' s debate, the executive committee' s position seemed rather confused on many very specific points of our amendments."
"Yet these are important amendments."
"We are therefore anxious to see the committee improve its proposal taking more amendments into account, yet we do not, however, wish to hold up proceedings, as we would like to see a vote during the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"I am therefore requesting, Mr President, that my request for referral to committee be put to the vote."
"Mr President, I would like to support the rapporteur' s motion."
"We have given our utmost attention to this report in committee and feel that our proposed amendments substantially improve this regulation."
"So far, the Commission has not seen fit to adopt these improvements."
"I hope we will be able to reach an accommodation in the compromise negotiations, which we will then vote on in October, because no group wants a blockade."
"We want this regulation but we want it with our improvements."
"It is the old story: Article 37 provides the basis, we have no power of codecision and so we make sure that we influence the proceedings."
"I hope the honourable Members will recognise this and give us their backing."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"During the debate late last night there were at least ten speakers who all raised points very critical of the Commission."
"I felt very sorry for Commissioner Nielson who had to respond as duty Commissioner and who read out about half a page prepared by Commissioner Liikanen."
"Clearly this is very complex subject and Mr Nielson did not appear to really know what the Commission position was."
"That is why we are now in this situation of sending this back to committee."
"This a very unsatisfactory way of doing business."
"It was like a dialogue of the deaf last night."
"It is not a satisfactory way of proceeding for Members to be here late at night, making very critical points and receiving a non-response of this nature."
"(Parliament approved the request)"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0766/2000) by Baroness Ludford on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the European Union' s position at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism"
"On Amendment No 12"
"Mr President, I propose that the words 'which have not done so' should be inserted after the words 'the Member States' , in that Italy, for example, already has stringent legislation against racism in place, and I am sure that absolutely nobody in my country would consider that it needs to be changed."
"I do not feel that the request should be addressed to all the States in general: it should be addressed to those whose legislation falls short."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) On Amendment No 15"
"Mr President, to continue along the line of reasoning followed during the work on this draft resolution in committee, I would like to table an oral amendment."
"It is for Parliament to decide: either we insert the words 'and left-wing' between the words 'right-wing' and 'extremism' , or we remove the word 'right-wing' altogether, and simply refer to 'extremism' ."
"(More than twelve Members objected to the oral amendment; the President therefore declared it inadmissible)"
"Mr President, I requested the floor before just to say that Mrs Ludford has done a very good job as rapporteur for this report, which has been discussed in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in more than one meeting."
"I would ask, nevertheless, that we please stick to what has already been discussed and to the list of votes."
"Mr President, this protest from the left is unacceptable."
"We have just seen that the left is in favour of left-wing extremism, for it voted against an oral amendment against left-wing terrorism and left-wing extremism."
"Italy has the Red Brigades and Spain has ETA."
"Now we can see that, in Europe, the left supports left-wing racism and is in favour of left-wing anti-Semitism!"
"(Uproar)"
"These are all very interesting political games but the procedure is that we hold the debate and vote afterwards."
"We do not hold a debate during the vote."
"You are right to call these political games."
"If the people objecting now really cared about racism, they would have come to the committee meetings and put down amendments."
"On Amendment No 16"
"Mr President, I would like to make the same proposal for Amendment No 16 as for Amendment No 15: to mention both sides of extremism or not to mention either."
"Moreover, as I would not class myself as one of those who do not participate in committee work, I would like to remind the House that it was we who tabled the amendments and point out that we maintained a very balanced line in committee."
"You could have made that oral amendment but we have already voted on that amendment."
"I have asked for the floor on a point of order, Mr President, because I have been trying to request to be allowed to speak for half an hour now and, as usual, you only look at one side of Parliament and not the other at the expense of democracy."
"My point of order is this: you said that we have voted, but what was written down was an oral amendment tabled by Mr Fiori."
"If you or your officials do not follow the correct order you are an extremist - right-wing or left-wing, it does not matter - in any case nothing but an extremist!"
"And there is no democracy here!"
"You are all buffoons!"
"That is a very interesting point of view."
"Mr President, this is a plea for everyone to calm down a little on the subject of this debate on racism."
"I know it is a subject that arouses great passion, but we are not talking about extremism here. This is a debate about racism."
"Nowadays, the perpetuators of racist crimes and actions belong to the extreme right wing."
"It would be another matter if the debate were about extremism."
"So, for five minutes, let us calm down."
"We know what we are here to discuss, so let us keep our tempers and let us get on with the debate."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I voted for this report."
"It is a report which is intended to assist developing countries in preserving the environment."
"This is a fine aim which also concerns the less well-off and elderly people who live in developing countries."
"The entire world has been focusing on consideration for the elderly in the past few days, with the Jubilee of the Elderly celebrated by Pope John Paul II, which greatly encouraged the little Pensioners' Party as it was an example of genuine interest and commitment shown towards the elderly throughout the whole world, including, in particular, those in developing countries."
"While I wholeheartedly support Mr Wijkman' s report, particularly the budget allocation obtained through conciliation, I am concerned to see, firstly, that the significance of sustainable development has not been understood, and also that the environment need not necessarily be taken into account in all development projects for underprivileged countries."
"For how is it possible to plan development time limits or strategies without seeing them in the context of environmental protection?"
"How can we even dissociate development from the environment?"
"Moreover, the conditions valid for the development strategies of Third World countries should also apply to the growth strategies of developed countries."
"The advocates of untrammelled liberalism will surely not fail to see these environmental safeguards as further restrictions upon, or obstacles to, the difficult economic emergence of these underprivileged countries."
"What, though, would be the point of an economic take-off which would destroy the environment of a country, sacrificing its ecological potential?"
"The cure would be worse than the disease."
"The deceptive salve of a purely economic recovery would soon wear off, overtaken by the gangrene of spasms in the environmental arena, and thus the health arena, and ultimately, the social arena."
"After sacrificing their ecological potential in attempts to achieve an economic take-off, once the first flush of the positive benefits had faded, such countries would find themselves even poorer than before, with even more limited development prospects."
"The contradiction in terms, however, is patently obvious."
"Every day we can see examples illustrating the lesson that purely economic development could not possibly be sustainable."
"It would be a flash in the pan, destined to burn itself out."
"The very concept of development implies an extended period of time, the long term, and this concept of time implies the concept of the natural environment, the preservation of the human environment."
"If, today, it is respected by this kind of civilisation and way of thinking, then, tomorrow, it will safeguard that of future generations."
"Fernández Martín report (A5-0216/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Fernández Martín' s report because it is always a good thing when the European Union intervenes to assist the less-well off peoples of developing countries, although I would be happier if there were to be changes in European Union policy regarding aid in certain sectors to developing countries."
"For example, a pensioner friend of mine, a joiner by trade, asked me why, ""instead of giving all this money to those countries to preserve their tropical forests"" , we did not ""make people buy fewer bedrooms and less furniture made from wood the production of which entails cutting down tropical forests?"" I agree with him."
"In this way we might achieve more and spend less."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on whose behalf I am speaking, completely supports the report by Mr Fernández Martín on the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is pleased to see the increase in the budget allocated to protecting tropical forests."
"In view of the alarming, relentless way they are being devastated, this sudden interest on the part of the European Union looks like a good start, but it is still quite a modest one considering the actual restoration requirements."
"Until now, indeed, the only attention paid to tropical forests has been a mere selfish reflex on the part of Westerners anxious to safeguard the forests that are the lungs of our planet, in a last ditch attempt of our industrialised societies to bind the wounds, without considering the indigenous peoples living in and off these forest areas, who are condemned to be sacrificed to the profits of the industrial groups exploiting their resources."
"We have the appalling example of the gold mines in French Guiana, which are laying waste to vast swathes of forest, causing the death of the flora, fauna and the indigenous peoples, which are all suffering from the mercury contaminating their soil, their sap or their bloodstream."
"This is a phenomenon that is continuing on a daily basis."
"The argument of concentrating entirely on economics as a last, desperate springboard for the development of Third World countries, which are unable to afford the luxury of environmental safeguards, is mere pettifoggery."
"There is no sustainable development except in the context of the responsible use of the environment."
"Similarly, we must point out the fallacy of the assertion of commercial interests that their forestry clearance activities contribute to combating the greenhouse effect."
"While claiming the same noble motive of environmental conservation, all that such theories are seeking to safeguard are the interests of a few major industrial groups."
"In the Hague, the European Union must refuse to be drawn into this trap, which would make it possible for tropical forests to be treated like coal mines and shamelessly exploited and for States to be released from their obligations in terms of combating the greenhouse effect."
"Skinner report (A5-0222/2000)"
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I was very happy to vote for the Skinner report, which lays down safety measures to prevent occupational accidents."
"My friend and fellow party member, Mr Bushill-Matthews, called for the report to be rejected."
"In response, I would say to him, in his absence, that if the Member States had managed to curtail fatal and serious injuries then I would have agreed with him."
"However, the number of fatal occupational accidents has increased in recent years and an ever increasing number of people are being widowed or orphaned due to occupational accidents, particularly in the construction industry, where this directive is intended to reduce the number of accidents."
"I therefore feel that it is right and proper for the European Union to intervene in cases where the Member States are not managing to achieve sufficient success in important areas such as the reduction of occupational accidents."
"UK Conservatives voted today against the Skinner Report, for the reasons given in my speech to the House the day before."
"However, despite what I said in that speech, my comments were deliberately misrepresented by subsequent speakers from the UK Labour party, presumably for the same domestic party political reasons which dictate so much of their comments to the House."
"Stephen Hughes accused me of regarding Safety issues as a trivial matter: I have never said this nor thought this."
"Peter Skinner said that I had apparently complained to the British press that people were being told they needed to be trained to go up ladders, but the only reference to training was alleged to be an amendment from me."
"This was also untrue."
"My amendment followed on from existing wording about training, and merely added that workers should be made aware of their own responsibilities for safety together with those of their fellow workers."
"The Socialists asked for a split vote, which retained the training reference but removed my helpful amendment."
"It is important that untruths are rapidly rebutted."
"This explanation of vote is necessary in order to correct the record."
"We have abstained from voting on Mr Skinner' s report concerning minimum safety and health requirements for workers' use of work equipment at work."
"This is an area in which the EU ought not to have so much influence."
"We are basically well disposed towards the European Union."
"As Swedish Liberals, we view European integration as an opportunity for finding solutions to cross-border problems concerning the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management."
"On these issues, the European Union gives Europe' s democracies a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity."
"We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, according to which decisions are to be made as close as possible to the people they affect."
"That is why we are actively pushing the issue of a constitution for the European Union, through which the distribution of responsibilities would be clear to everyone."
"It must be made perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU should stick to the issues it knows best, namely cross-border issues."
"All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels."
"We are convinced that it is not at EU level that legislation on, for example, how ladders are to be used in jobs above ground- or floor-level is best enacted."
"How scaffolding is to be erected and jobs carried out must be decided in the light of national conditions."
"For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on a small number of areas in which it can really be of use."
"This is not one such area."
"In a common market and a cooperative European enterprise based upon common values that put people' s best interests first, it is only fair and right to require certain minimum standards for workers' safety and health."
"As Christian Democrats, we therefore support the principles behind Mr Skinner' s report, but we cannot accept the detailed regulation at EU level which is the result."
"Directives ought essentially to be aimed at establishing goals, not at regulating the details and describing the path to the goal."
"Requiring at European level that employers should take necessary measures to guarantee workers' safety is only reasonable."
"However, it is unreasonable to regulate in detail at EU level how such safety is to be achieved."
"It is high time we took the subsidiarity principle seriously and allowed detailed regulations to be adopted at the lowest effective level."
"Allow the Member States themselves to decide the best way of framing the rules so that the directive' s required objectives are met."
"In certain countries, this can be done by means of national laws. In others, agreements concluded between the two sides of industry can be envisaged."
"Against this background, we have chosen, as Swedish Christian Democrats, to vote against the report."
". This proposal typifies the belief of this assembly that, for every ill in society, the solution is a new law and - when that fails - to create another."
"The success or otherwise of a law depends on the nature of its enforcement, and the skill/experience of enforcement officers, which cannot be addressed by this directive."
"This was recognised in 1972, when the Robens Committee Inquiry on health and safety in the UK, addressing the dynamic of excessive resort to law-making and its effect on enforcement, observed: "". . . the sheer mass of this law, far from advancing the cause of safety and health, may well have reached the point where it becomes counter-productive."""
"The response by the government of the day was the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974, a highly effective legislative model reducing the law to a few simple principles and duties, spearheaded by a new enforcement agency."
"Although these developments were hailed as a major contribution to health and safety at work, the Commission has consistently undermined this Act."
"Ever since it began legislating in this area, it has confused the issue, making enforcement progressively more difficult."
"It should desist now, and this assembly should reject this directive."
"Hernández Mollar report (A5-0225/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Hernández Mollar report because pensioners and elderly people are extremely concerned by what might happen to them with modernisation and the development of electronic and computer science."
"The elderly are used to writing by hand - in beautiful script - wherever possible, and they are used to traditional filing systems and are afraid that the storing of all their personal data in public pensions institutions will one day lead to some electronic initiative being taken against them, resulting in the reduced protection of their specific civil rights."
"They therefore call upon the European Union to step up their interventions to protect personal data on citizens which the authorities manage to obtain one way or another."
"- (DE) Data protection is a typical example of one area where it makes real sense to create central control points."
"The existing juxtaposition of countless Community data protection regulations, which are called any number of different things to boot, is neither conducive to effective legal protection, nor does it make for a transparent legal situation."
"The continued existence of national control points is beyond doubt."
"Legal protection must be provided as close to the citizens as possible."
"Not only will the amalgamation of Community control points have a positive effect in terms of transparency and legal clarity, it will also help keep costs down."
"At long last, a constructive, truly expedient measure at Community level."
"Pirker report (A5-0219/2000)"
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I also voted for the Pirker report, particularly because of Amendment No 13 - which has been adopted - tabled by the rapporteur, which provides for permanent erasure from the central database of the names and electronic fingerprints of those who, having arrived in our States without refugee status as yet, are then recognised as persons who should be permitted to enter the country and are accorded refugee status."
"This is an example of consideration for the dignity of human beings and their rights, and pensioners, who suffer a great many injustices, know just how important that is."
"I shall begin my speech by reminding you that the Eurodac system for comparing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and certain other categories of alien was created in order to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention, a text which makes it possible to determine the State responsible for examining the asylum applications received in one of the European Union Member States."
"This Convention was signed on 15 June 1990."
"The report under discussion deals with this Eurodac system and the way it operates."
"The Council is proposing to alter this in a direction which is not at all acceptable to Parliament."
"Specifically, the Council has proposed to take the task of setting up the Eurodac system for the collection and comparison of asylum seekers' fingerprints (the Eurodac database is used to determine the country that was the asylum seeker' s entry point and whose task it therefore is to examine the asylum request) away from the Commission and entrust it to the Council itself in order to regain jurisdiction over it."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of course rejected this Council proposal."
"The rapporteur, quite rightly, pointed out that under the EC Treaty, the Council may, in principle, confer implementing powers on the European Commission, but only in ""specific cases"" can the Council reserve the right to exercise these powers itself and, clearly, this is not applicable in the case in point."
"Furthermore, Parliament would lose the right to be informed and would have to rely completely on the goodwill of the Council, and this is, of course, completely inadmissible!"
"The proposed revised wording for Articles 22 and 23 of the Eurodac regulation, which is what has currently been referred to Parliament, was therefore rejected by the committee which proposed, instead, an amendment endowing the Commission with the unconditional right to exercise implementing powers."
"I, of course, unreservedly support this position."
"Once again, the European Parliament finds itself dealing with Eurodac, i.e. the system intended to prevent multiple asylum applications."
"It will always be essential for a system of this kind to be subject to democratic control."
"Accordingly, it is incomprehensible as to why the Council should want to alter the procedure in such a way that will deprive Parliament of all its information rights."
"That being the case, we support Mr Pirker' s report."
"However, I would point out that this courtesy does not extend to the committee' s proposal to raise the age limit."
"The Danish Social Democratic delegation wishes to express its full support for setting up Eurodac for the purpose of comparing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and certain other foreigners."
"Eurodac will be an effective tool for ensuring that the Dublin Convention operates effectively."
"In compliance with the Danish opt out in the legal sphere, we have abstained from voting in the final vote in view of the chosen legal base for the regulation."
"We were very pleased to note that, at the Council meeting (legal affairs and the internal market) on 29 October 1999, the Danish Government stated that it wanted to participate fully in Eurodac cooperation on an intergovernmental basis."
"On 19 November 1999, the European Parliament adopted its position on the proposal for a Eurodac regulation."
"In the document that was approved by Parliament we called for several amendments, among others, that the minimum age for taking fingerprints be set at 18. We also expressed our concern regarding the extension of Eurodac' s scope to third-country nationals and illegal immigrants, whose situation, in our view, has nothing to do with the application of the Dublin Convention."
"The Socialist Group voted accordingly in that particular Parliament vote and hopes that the Commission and the Council will accept our proposals."
"The reason why Parliament is once again debating the matter today is because the Council has amended the original proposal regarding the conferring of competences for implementing Eurodac, so that such competences, as provided for in the Treaties, will no longer be conferred on the Commission but retained by the Council."
"Mr Pirker, the rapporteur, opted to comment only on the part of the report that had been amended."
"The Socialist Group accepted this proposal, which is why we, together with the Liberal Group, abstained from voting today on all of the amendments that do not refer to this new consultation."
"We welcome the outcome of the vote regarding the conferring of competences which, as we and the vast majority of Parliament understand it, should be given to the Commission."
"We should like to reiterate the fact that we hope that the Council and the Commission will take the two positions adopted by the European Parliament into account when it comes to making the final decision on the Eurodac regulation."
"Wallis report (A5-0253/2000)"
"Modernising the Brussels Convention is legally in order."
"However, we believe that, in the future too, it should have the legal status of an intergovernmental tool."
"Where consumer rights are concerned, we believe that consumers should be entitled to bring claims in their place of domicile in the event of disputes relating to electronic commerce."
"It is absolutely essential to the growth and functioning of e-commerce within the European Union, to strike a reasonable balance between the legitimate concerns of the consumer and those companies that want to use the Internet for e-commerce purposes."
"The compromise reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market does exactly that in our view."
"Providing the consumer with comprehensive information on the company' s terms of business particularly with regard to the legal aspects, safeguards the consumer against cheating, on the one hand, and protects the companies against unreasonable risks, on the other."
"E-commerce offers the Member States of the European Union hitherto undreamed-of possibilities in terms of creating jobs for the professionally qualified."
"This reform will undoubtedly help to achieve this goal in a way that is not to be underestimated."
"Out of respect for the Danish opt out in the legal sphere, the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have abstained from voting in the final vote on the proposal."
"Glase report (A5-0220/2000)"
"Mr President, 'illegal work' could also be referred to as 'underground work' ."
"When I told my pensioner friends that this matter was under debate, they urged me to do all in my power to ensure that they are not left underground for too long - they have trouble breathing - and to bring them up into the open air."
"'Why underground?' , you may ask, Mr President."
"Sadly, this is the situation."
"Some pensioners are forced to work 'underground' - i.e. illegally - because, in certain States, it is not possible to receive both a salary and a pension."
"If we want to combat illegal working practices we must also permit pensioners - who live on low, paltry, starvation-ration pensions - to receive a regular salary in addition to a pension, or else they will be forced to remain underground, where they could well end up suffocating."
"Mr President, the report claims to combat undeclared work, but the sole concern of the rapporteur is the conditions of competition between employers, not the situation of the workers forced to work in the black economy."
"The things that force workers increasingly to accept just any old job are this economy of yours, unemployment, and poverty."
"These workers are the first victims, the principal victims, of undeclared work, in personal and social terms, as they are grossly exploited, subjected to terrible working conditions and terrible wage conditions, and deprived of any legal sickness and accident insurance."
"So it is scandalous to attempt to blame them for their own misfortune, even in part."
"In the report' s explanatory statement, the author even has the temerity to wonder if some of the reasons for the black economy are not the excessively low retirement age, the excessively short working day or ""inflexible employment legislation"" , by way of suggesting that if legal working conditions were reduced to the level of those in the black economy, then bosses would have less reason not to declare workers."
"If Parliament truly wished to combat undeclared work, it would have to begin by proposing that any employer guilty of employing a non-declared worker should be forced to employ that person under an open-ended contract."
"We did not, of course, vote in favour of this report for, while pretending to protect victims, it in fact absolves the slave drivers, including a number of major firms which are completely unaffected by economic penalties."
"Everyone is united in condemning non-declared work, or the black economy, as it is commonly called."
"At the same time, however, many people resort to using this cheap workforce."
"The figures speak for themselves, as the 'black economy' is equivalent to between 7 and 16 percent of the figure of the GDP of the European Union."
"Quite obviously this is intolerable in our Member States which are facing persistently high unemployment rates which are still high despite a clear downturn in recent years."
"I further endorse the rapporteur' s insistence that combating the black economy is to a great extent a direct contribution towards combating unemployment."
"I am well aware that finding solutions is not an easy matter."
"It is clear, nonetheless, that the Member States would be well advised to coordinate their efforts in order to establish a proactive strategy to combat this scourge."
"The first requirement is for a list of the most affected sectors and the main categories concerned to be drawn up within each Member State."
"This survey must be followed up in a practical way by implementing measures appropriate to each situation."
"These measures are to be included in action programmes. These programmes must then be incorporated in national action plans related to the Employment Guidelines in order to establish mutual transparency and assess the effectiveness of the actions undertaken."
"There is, moreover, a clear link between the level of taxes and deductions, and the extent as well as the growth of the black economy."
"Member States must therefore devote some effort to reducing the taxes and deductions that weigh down on employment."
"The reduction in VAT rates for services that are highly labour intensive, a sector where undeclared work is particularly prevalent, a step that Member States are entitled to take under the Council Decision of 28 February 2000, will most certainly have beneficial effects on the fight against the black economy."
"Like the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to see the Member States that do not yet use this option review their decisions."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report, which represents a further step in achieving a social Europe."
"The spread of non-declared work is not down to workers opting to supplement their incomes but to the determination of firms to milk only the most profitable sectors."
"The other sectors, where profits are considered to be less extensive or less quick, are contracted out."
"Such sub-contracting effectively promotes the outsourcing of work."
"Bringing ""greater flexibility to the labour market"" (point 11 of the motion for a resolution), making ""efforts to reduce tax and contribution levels"" (point 11), and promoting ""flexible working hours"" (point 26) will not be sufficient to reduce the extent of undeclared work."
"It is not the workers who should be held responsible but rather the capitalist economic logic which must be fought for it continually endeavours to reduce labour costs, particularly by eliminating employers' social security contributions."
"Mrs Glase' s report does not live up to the expectations aroused by the explanatory statement, which, for once in this place, I found to be exceptionally perceptive."
"Indeed, we agree with the rapporteur that one of the causes of the black economy is the insane level of taxation on work, the bureaucratic formalities and red tape required of firms, the removal of checks at the internal borders of the European Union, and Lord knows what else."
"We do, however, deplore the fact that not once does this report mention the obvious link between the massive illegal immigration afflicting this continent and the explosion of undeclared work."
"Nor does it mention the very great extent to which the Europe run by Brussels is responsible for establishing and exacerbating the causes of the black economy."
"We therefore abstained on this report."
"Undeclared gainful employment is just a euphemism for illicit work."
"It is a problem all Member States face to a greater or lesser extent, and it exists for all sorts of reasons."
"And there are mountains of regulations for tackling illicit work."
"Of course these are only effective if they are implemented in conjunction with supervisory and punitive measures."
"But introducing new European regulations is no way to go about tackling the problem of illicit work."
"A new phase of Brussels-inspired regulating mania would be neither use nor ornament in the fight against illicit work in the Member States of the European Union."
"Illicit work must be tackled at the roots."
"Why, for example, are people prepared to do illicit work when it does not entitle them to social protection?"
"Why are employers prepared to take on illicit workers when they cannot offset the wage costs against tax?"
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Glase, rightly states in her report that the fight against illicit work is a task which cuts across a whole range of policy areas, such as finance, the economy, social issues, the labour market, and justice."
"Illegal immigrants are engaged in illicit work, but industrial law regulations are not the way to go about tackling this problem."
"Illegal immigration must be prevented, and many Member States are too lax on this front."
"It is pointed out in the report that a particularly high number of illicit workers are women, principally in the service industry."
"Particularly where domestic servants are concerned, employees are only too willing to pursue, and employers are only too willing to countenance, undeclared gainful employment; in the employer' s case because it cuts down on the administrative burden, and in the employee' s, because they can avoid paying tax and social contributions."
"The collective taxation of spouses is a fundamental reason as to why - in my country at any rate - domestic servants simply do not want to be registered."
"In addition, the amount of paperwork involved is a stumbling block to the lawful employment of domestic servants , particularly for elderly private individuals."
"We certainly did not solve the problem in Luxembourg, but under the terms of the employment plan, we have released employers of domestic servants from the administrative burden, and I believe that the payment of a net wage to personnel of this kind represents a substantial improvement."
"Naturally I voted in favour of the report, but I also wanted to point out that positive, tax-related and other measures are a more effective way of tackling illicit work than new, European prohibitive measures, particularly where women are concerned."
"I would like to start by assuring you that we support Mrs Glase' s work."
"It is, in effect, a clarion call for the Member States to combat a scourge which is, moreover, proliferating but increasingly being ignored, and which not only harms the economy and checks social policy but also hampers employment policy."
"However, three points are worth noting."
"Firstly, given precisely the different ways in which the Member States interpret the concept of undeclared work, the explanatory statement attached to the report would appear to shed more light on the subject than the text itself."
"The second point is the - by now constant - call for the two sides of industry to be flexible and responsible."
"'Emersion' contracts aside, in addition to the initiatives adopted by the Member States to combat undeclared work which are to be included in the national employment plans, as the rapporteur requested, it would be interesting to find out how many allegedly joint flexibility initiatives have indeed induced both sides of industry to be responsible and how many have, in practice, been successfully implemented to date."
"The third point concerns a type of working relationship which the rapporteur does not mention even in the explanatory statement, but which nevertheless, in Italy at least, is likely to become as common, if not more common than undeclared work."
"I refer to that type of relationship which appears on the surface to be completely legal and have impeccable recruitment procedures, but which, in reality, is characterised by abusive terms and conditions and protection and penalty clauses which are the product of what are termed 'pirate' work contracts concluded by colluding trade union associations."
"In this regard, we feel that the study into the situation for the different categories of work, requested by the rapporteur, must take this last factor into account as well, and that quality parameters should then be defined so that work relationships can be genuinely above-board."
". (EL) The plague of undeclared work is spreading through all the Member States of the Union at an alarming rate, especially in the less developed regions."
"This grim form of exploitation is afflicting ever larger social groups as the result of poverty, which is spreading like wildfire, and also as the result of the increasingly indifferent laws of the market and the unaccountability of big business, which provokes and exacerbates it."
"The anti-labour economic and social policy pursued by the European Union is a determining factor in the rise in undeclared work, which is growing much faster than the mainstream economy."
"The hidden economy is becoming more and more important in the Member States, allowing companies which evade tax and national insurance payments to rake in huge profits."
"The constant harping on at summits and in other Union institutions about the need to reduce the famous ""non-wage labour costs"" is encouraging companies to implement this reactionary approach on their own initiative, by generalising undeclared work and extending it to a surprisingly large number of workers."
"Intense efforts to make the market and terms of employment more flexible, the barrel of the gun of unemployment and poverty pointed at workers' heads, the huge influx of immigrant workers to whose illegal status the system turns a blind eye and which are the booty of exploitive capitalist mechanisms which plunder their labour in sweat shops in order to boost their profits, create the ""unhealthy"" social conditions which force workers to take employment with no social cover, exiled from any trade union activity or government protection."
"Health and safety conditions, terms of employment and working relations are dictated solely by employers, who take grossly unfair advantage of workers' needs and minimal negotiating skills and make a tidy profit from their long working hours."
"Immediate measures are needed in order to wipe out this plague - measures which include the strictest punishment for employers and companies using this form of employment and which do not put the sacrificer and the sacrificed on an equal footing."
"We need agencies and institutions to keep a close eye on companies."
"Special protection must be given to the groups which are easy prey to unaccountable employers: the young, women and, more importantly, immigrants."
"Undeclared work only has a positive impact on employers, or rather their profits; it has multiple negative repercussions for both workers and society as a whole."
"Less employment, lower national insurance revenues, lower tax revenues and, at the same time, increased social and public-sector spending."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament report under discussion goes in completely the wrong direction; it basically backs employers and calls for even more neo-liberal measures on the job market, ostensibly in order to wipe out undeclared work."
"It basically advocates legalising and generalising undeclared work, and hence completely upsetting employment relations, at the expense of all workers, which is why we are voting against it."
"Resolution on racism (B5-0766/2000)"
"I would like to express my disappointment and dismay at the PPE' s vote on the resolution on the World Conference Against Racism."
"Yesterday the PPE spokesman approached the Socialist Group to ask us to withdraw my Amendment No 1 because, if it were accepted, they would be unable to support the report."
"After much soul-searching in the Socialist Group we decided that we would withdraw that amendment in the interests of getting the largest majority possible in Parliament against the forces of racism, the extreme right and anti-Semitism."
"I have to say I do not know what conclusion to draw because it is clear from the vote that, in fact, after making that promise the vast majority of the PPE actually voted against the resolution."
"It is not clear whether they were lying or whether they were confused."
"I am not sure which is worse."
"What is clear is that some of those weeping crocodile tears yesterday for anti-Semitic attacks in Italy in order to get cheap publicity, today voted in a way that could only give aid and assistance to the racists, the anti-Semites and the extreme right in the European Union."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I should also like to express our disappointment at our failure to successfully conclude this matter, in spite of all of the efforts we all made so that the European Union could adopt a strong position, with the backing of Parliament, on something as important as the World Conference against Racism."
"We did all we could to achieve this as, in my view, did Mrs Ludford, the rapporteur."
"In addition to this, Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to say that I found the references one member of Parliament made to our support of radicalism and the extreme left, wholly unacceptable, as indeed was the reference made to the idea that the terrorist group ETA, which a few hours ago murdered someone in my home town, is an extreme left-wing group."
"These people have an exclusive and partisan vision of nationalism and have nothing to do with any of us, or any European socialists, or with any ideology that is not based on exclusion and racism."
"Mr President, what a heated debate this has been on racism!"
"We have seen the left stand up and then the right, then the left again, then the right again, both of them armed, luckily only with words."
"As representative of the Pensioners' Party, I abstained in the vote on this report."
"And why is that?"
"Is the Pensioners' Party on the left or the right?"
"I have always maintained that the Pensioners' Party is for justice, for fair measures and for fair actions, and that party political ideological formations should take a step back and be more practical."
"The Pensioners' Party is against all forms of racism, whoever the perpetrator, it is immaterial whether they come from the right or the left - but I urge both the right and the left to take a step backwards - for somebody has to - and to ensure that real social developments are made in our lives, whoever they are intended to benefit, and that ideologies are, at last, laid aside once and for all."
"- (DE) The amendments put forward by the honourable Members Ford, Ceyhun, Boumediene-Thiery, Sörensen, Schroedter and Lambert seek to perpetuate a notion which the Wise Men have unequivocally rejected."
"A desire to link the issue of racism with the situation in Austria represents an attempt to defame the country of Austria."
"Many of those who do more than propose amendments by way of voicing their criticism of the situation in Austria, come from countries in which hostels for asylum seekers have been set on fire, right-wing extremists are on the march and gaining in influence, problems to do with minorities and foreigners go unresolved, and a great deal more. You will not find anything of this kind in Austria."
"The report compiled by the Council of Wise Men has confirmed that standards in Austria are above the European average, even in the most sensitive of areas."
"Yet you seek to lay all the blame at Austria' s door, and turn a blind eye to the Balkans in your own backyard."
"Instead of apologising to the Austrians for the injustices they have suffered on account of sanctions, you just carry on fanning the flames of resentment."
"If that is your idea of a united Europe, then that in itself is of great concern to me."
"Incidentally, we intend to vote in favour of the resolution put forward by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with regard to the reference to the resolution of 16 March, but not only are we not prepared to vote in favour of the related resolution of 3 February this year, on the formation of the Austrian Government, we demand an apology from the European Parliament."
"This resolution is a fine declaration against racism."
"On the same day, the majority of MEPs voted in favour of the amended version of the fingerprinting system Eurodac, which further criminalises immigrants seeking to move to the European Union."
"There would have been a different outcome if the vote on Eurodac had been truly anti-racist."
"Therefore, all we can expect from this anti-racist resolution is fine words, and no change in the policy of criminalisation pursued by a Big Brother state."
"The Radical Members of the Bonino List have voted against the resolution on racism because we feel that the way the fight against racism is conducted in Europe jeopardises fundamental rights and freedoms such as freedom of expression, opinion, thought and information."
"These rights are currently being eroded away, and the very basis of democracy and the rule of law is under threat from the series of campaigns the States and the Union conduct every time there is an emergency, be it racism, terrorism, organised crime or the use of the Internet for criminal ends."
"In this respect, we should learn from the United States, which is the country which affords the greatest protection for this freedom."
"If we think that we can combat a phenomenon by banning it or restricting rights or fundamental freedoms or by ideological crusades, then we will achieve exactly the opposite effect: with regard to freedom of expression, with regard to drugs, prostitution and immigration, but also, as this Parliament well knows, with regard to Austria and to the rights of Members to band together to form a technical group."
"We Radicals consider that Parliament and Europe must also learn from their past, which lives on today through prohibitions, be they right-wing, left-wing, socialist or extreme right-wing."
"Resolution on organised crime (B5-0506/2000)"
"Organised crime in the European Union enjoys competitive advantages; in particular, the problems associated with mutual assistance in law enforcement and the procedural obstacles frustrate the process of criminal prosecution."
"The recently concluded agreement on mutual assistance in law enforcement constitutes a first step towards reducing the unfair edge certain countries have over others."
"In principle, we welcome the action plan put forward by the Council, but we also join the committee in criticising the Council over its consultation obligations."
"However, we reject a European-wide standardisation of criminal law provisions."
"Not only would an undertaking of this kind be almost impossible to achieve because of the way criminal law systems vary from Member State to Member State, our energies would also be better invested in preventive measures."
"That concludes the vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 21 September 2000."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday, 21 September have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I shall keep to the subject of the Minutes."
"For some strange reason, my name is missing from the register of attendance."
"I would ask you to correct this and would at the same time take the opportunity to point out that it has been possible today to come here to Strasbourg from Finland in just nine hours."
"That is almost a personal record for me this autumn!"
"Yes indeed, Mrs Thors, we shall amend the Minutes accordingly."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Presidency communication on the situation in the Middle East"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days, as you know, Jerusalem, other towns and the Palestinian territories have been thrown into a state of unrest, and there have already been many victims."
"Earlier today, helicopters bombed targets in Gaza, thereby making the situation worse."
"I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express my deepest outrage at this new outbreak of violence, and to express our heartfelt sympathy with the families of the victims in their sorrow and suffering."
"At a time when the peace process is at a crucial stage, making real but precarious progress, Ariel Sharon' s visit to the Dome of the Rock cannot be seen as anything other than provocation."
"As this sad state of affairs shows, the status of Jerusalem is one of the keys to peace in the Middle East."
"The city bears the weight of powerful symbols for all three monotheistic religions."
"Attacking such symbolism is tantamount to rejecting the will for peace and hindering the search for a solution that is acceptable to all parties."
"We do, however, know that, on both sides, there are men of peace who wish to forge ahead."
"The joint visit by Mr Ahmed Qurie and Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and Speaker of the Knesset respectively, in this House during our September part-session proved this once again."
"On the matter of Jerusalem, they displayed an open-mindedness and a willingness to listen that gave us hope."
"As this part-session of the European Parliament opens, I call on the international community to do all it can to piece together the threads of dialogue as soon as possible."
"The European Union has reacted already."
"I would like to see it increasing its efforts, and the European Parliament will play a full role in this."
"I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would first of all like to support your words and express our complete agreement with them."
"Please allow me to propose, on behalf of my group, that this very important issue, which involves the responsibilities of the European Union, as you have correctly pointed out, be included in the debate which we are going to hold tomorrow in connection with the Biarritz Summit."
"The situation in the Middle East will clearly be one of the issues dealt with at this summit, even though it is informal."
"I would also like to stress, as you have rightly pointed out, that there has been unacceptable provocation by a leader of the Israeli extreme right known for his extremist activities in the past."
"I also believe that we must address our Israeli friends in the frankest possible terms and tell them that a democratic and legitimate government, such as theirs, cannot use gunfire and tanks to fight children and youths throwing stones."
"This is absolutely disproportionate and in no way helps the peace process."
"Madam President, I believe that, after the visit - on your invitation - of the Presidents of the Israeli and Palestinian assemblies last month, we have sufficient moral legitimacy to address our partners in the Middle East in the strongest terms, while offering them our services."
"Madam President, I sent you a letter on behalf of my group requesting an amendment to the agenda on the issue which you have just addressed in a most dignified way."
"Since Mr Barón Crespo has raised the subject, let me make my point on the matter immediately."
"In my opinion, since Parliament issued a very timely joint invitation to the Speakers of the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council a month ago, specifically in order to indicate its willingness to become involved in promoting the peace process, we cannot, as Members of this Parliament, remain silent today."
"In words with which I identify completely, you described the tragic situation developing right now in Palestine and in Israel."
"I fully understand that, tomorrow, Mr Prodi, the Council, and ourselves, or some of us, will be speaking in the general debate."
"We cannot, however, possibly limit ourselves to dealing with this tragic matter alongside a number of other very important matters, thus making it possible for a first person to discuss the Charter, the next to discuss the French Presidency and the Biarritz Summit, a third to bring up the Danish 'no' vote in the referendum on EMU, and only then have a fourth, on the subject of the Middle East."
"This would not do justice to the matter."
"My group and I therefore suggest that, tomorrow if possible, or another day if necessary, we look into finding a way to devote an hour to this extremely important subject, and to adopt a resolution."
"It this were to prove impossible, I suggest that we should at least have a question on the subject in our topical and urgent debate."
"In any event, I would expressly ask that we make it impossible for anyone at the end of this part-session to claim that Parliament as such did not follow up your splendid statement and declare itself in favour of a return to peace in Israel and in the Middle East."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you agree, I shall introduce a sort of procedural motion."
"We have not yet moved on to the discussion of the agenda."
"I did receive the request you sent me."
"I suggest discussing whether or not we should enter this subject on the order of business for Tuesday when we move on to the agenda."
"In the meantime, I have to deal with a series of procedural motions, which we shall finish first."
"I have a few statements to make to you, after which we shall discuss the agenda."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in the Middle East are a real tragedy."
"I am very grateful to you for raising this subject."
"My group fully supports the substance of what you have said."
"As to how we should deal with this serious matter here in this Chamber, I think it would be appropriate if the problems in the Middle East were to be raised tomorrow in the debate with the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, either by individual Members or by political group chairmen or whoever speaks on behalf of the groups."
"I do not think that we can change the whole agenda, as we have a great many topics to consider this week."
"I also have last Thursday's events in Belgrade in mind, and would like to suggest that we should include the Middle East peace process in tomorrow's debate on the Biarritz Summit."
"That seems to be a very appropriate way of dealing with this problem."
"Madam President, my group is also, naturally, extremely shocked by the events that took place over the weekend in the Middle East."
"Of all the proposals that have been made, I would like to offer my support primarily for that of my colleague, Mr Wurtz, to find a suitable point in time when we can ask the Council - and possibly also the Commission - to propose a resolution."
"It would also suit our group if Parliament were to make its own statement regarding this issue."
"Everyone has certainly tried in all manner of ways to highlight the importance of this question; nevertheless, I think his proposal is this time the most valuable and the most appropriate one in this situation."
"Thank you, Mrs Hautala, but, as I explained to Mr Wurtz, you are anticipating our discussion on the agenda somewhat."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"Your words echoed the sentiments of everyone in the House and certainly of my group."
"It is important that we discuss the issue and that it should be treated as an issue in its own right and not as part of a longer list of issues, where we are trying to deal with so many points before Biarritz."
"If we could in some way find a way of looking at this item separately, my group would greatly appreciate that."
"Madam President, on 21 September last, a farmer of the town of De Panne, which is Belgium' s westernmost point near the French border, came across 45 refugees on his land one evening, 15 of whom were children."
"These people were received and cared for by that town, but quite remarkably, they claimed to have been dropped across the border by the French police."
"The police had picked them up in Calais, taken them from Calais to the Belgian border and had no qualms about subsequently dropping them off in Belgium."
"A very strange business, all the more so because, according to other witness statements, it appears that this is not the first time this has happened."
"Fortunately, this incident has been settled at the highest level between the French and Belgian authorities, and it appears that they found a way of discussing it."
"However, to my great surprise, I was informed by a Belgian that it is not just the French who get up to these tricks, but also the Dutch and Germans."
"When I asked him if the Belgians do the same thing, he confirmed this and said, now and again."
"This leads me to conclude that everyone still has the standard European reflex, namely to pass on their problems to their neighbours."
"In my opinion, it is high time that we, as European legislator and as European Parliament, at least pressed for a European reflex."
"Just as Europe did too little during the oil crisis, it is also making its presence felt insufficiently with regard to this disturbing problem."
"Thank you, Mr Sterckx, we take note of your statement."
"Madam President, I wish to speak on a completely different subject, but as this Parliament knows, the Convention entrusted with the task of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has just completed its work, and this is cause for satisfaction."
"Yet, while our own institution has done so much to ensure the successful completion of the work of the Convention, particularly by, on many occasions, making its premises available to the Convention, I am sorry that today, as our plenary part-session in Strasbourg is opening, it was not possible to organise the formal hand over of this Charter here in Strasbourg, in conditions worthy of it, now that the work of drafting it has been completed."
"In my view, this would have been a powerful, symbolic act for our institution, and I think it is a pity."
"Madam President, as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, transport and Tourism and as a Greek Member of Parliament, I wish to raise the subject of the sinking of the Express Samina last Tuesday."
"So far there are 79 dead and 2 unaccounted for."
"This was a truly dreadful and horrific accident in which the human factor - the negligence of the crew members - appears to have played a decisive part."
"Nonetheless, there are serious indications that Community law has been violated, especially as regards the registration of passengers and compliance with the safety standards set out in Community directives and I think we should therefore start by welcoming the reaction of the European Commission, which is already investigating whether or not Community law was complied with."
"We here in the European Parliament must undertake as quickly as possible to examine the Commission' s proposals on safety standards at sea, especially the so-called Erika package, which contains the Commission' s proposals on safety at sea following the accident last year involving this tanker."
"I also think that we and the Commission should look carefully to see if the timetable for Directive 98/18 on safety arrangements for ferry boat passengers can be reduced, given that some of the provisions in this directive last until 2009."
"In this context, there should be no derogations for Member States, such as the present derogation for Greece for ferry boats over 27 years old."
"I also consider that it is wrong for Greece to have a derogation as regards liberalising transport by 2004 because this erodes safety standards in Greece, in my own country, even further."
"I think that competition can help standards to improve."
"The European People' s Party has tabled a motion along these lines and I trust that all the political groups will agree to debate it, given that it concerns an extremely important matter."
"It concerns the death of 80 of our fellow human beings."
"Before giving Mr Watts the floor to speak on the same subject, I would just like to inform you that directly after this dreadful disaster I did of course write to the President of the Greek Parliament, Mr Kaklamanis, in order to express, on behalf of the House, my deep sadness and our solidarity with the families of the victims."
"Madam President, following the tragic events of last week in the Aegean, yesterday's suspension of over 60 Greek passenger ships which do not comply with EU laws is, I am sure, welcomed by the whole House."
"In addition to passing on our condolences - which I am glad to note you already have - and our gratitude to all those involved in the rescues in those tragic events, could the President ask next week's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to investigate why 79 people had to die before these ships were banned?"
"That committee needs to ask urgently why Member States are ignoring EU maritime safety laws - it is not just Greece."
"We need to ask that committee to review why certain Member States are granted lengthy opt-outs from those maritime safety laws."
"Madam President, thank you for the message of sympathy which you sent the speaker of the Greek parliament in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy in Greek waters."
"It is true that there are shortcomings in the application of regulations both, national and European, and the Greek government is addressing this matter with the utmost diligence."
"As far as the 65 ships which have been banned from sailing are concerned, we should, I think, clarify the fact that these ships would have been banned from sailing on 1 October anyway, even if 79 people had not died."
"These are two separate issues; the IMO regulations happened to expire on 1 October and, as a result, these ships were classified as unsuitable."
"That is why they have been banned from sailing, not because these people tragically lost their lives."
"I think, Madam President, that this is too serious an issue for the opposition to capitalise on and it is too serious to be addressed in an urgent debate followed by a simple vote, which is why the Socialist Group will vote against entering it for urgent debate."
"This does not, of course, mean that we were not shocked by the tragedy or that, as a government and as the Socialist Group, we shall not do everything humanly possible to increase the safety of ships in the Aegean, which has three and a half thousand islands and a huge number of ferries and, however serious this accident, compared with the number of voyages made in the Aegean every summer, it is one accident out of a huge number of successful sailings."
"Having said which, it is of course tragic, and the time has come to re-examine shipping conditions in Greece and in Europe in far greater detail; but this does not mean that Greek seas are any less safe than the seas of any other Member State."
"Madam President, in a comment on the Danish 'no' vote on the euro, you expressed the view that the 'no' side had appealed to an irrational fear."
"If you had been better informed, you would have known that your description applies to only approximately 20% of Danes who voted 'no' , and then only on a rough estimate."
"For the overwhelming majority of those who voted 'no' , the vote was about democratic legitimacy to make decisions concerning our economic policy."
"There was a specific desire to avoid a situation in which important decisions are taken on as uninformed a basis as that unfortunately underlying your own pronouncement."
"The Danish people want a far clearer demarcation line between what the EU is to concern itself with and what the national parliaments are to continue to decide on."
"As early as December in Nice, however, majority decision-making is to be introduced in the social and labour-market spheres, as referred to in Articles 42 and 137."
"If, subsequently - and with Article 42 as a basis - the circle of people covered by Regulation No 1408 is enlarged, and if majority voting is introduced under Article 137 on, for example, the criteria for granting unemployment benefit, this would have major consequences for both social and labour-market policy in Denmark."
"We are the only EU country which finances its social contributions through taxation, and we regulate our labour market through agreements."
"That is simply the basis for the way in which we have organised ourselves."
"One reason for the 'no' vote on the euro is that we want the Danish Parliament to retain the power of decision-making in these areas and that we also want it to continue to do so after Nice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to appeal to your understanding."
"We are all well aware that this was not a point of order."
"Let me remind you that points of order may not be used to present your arguments again after the fact."
"Madam President, thank you for the condolences which you sent on behalf of the European Parliament; you spoke for all of us."
"Unfortunately, these 79 or 80 victims fell foul of large, profit-seeking shipowners."
"However much some people are trying to blame the crew, the fact remains that the vessel was over 35 years old, that it should not, in fact, have been sailing and that it sank extremely quickly, preventing more people from being saved."
"The unaccountability of shipowners is and always has been defended by successive Greek governments."
"This is not the first time, it is the umpteenth time that victims have died and not one Greek government has taken steps to prevent further accidents."
"Finally, I should like to say that I was impressed by the Socialist Group' s refusal to discuss the matter in an urgent debate."
"Apart from the fact that we cannot go into the issue in depth in an urgent debate, this accident was too serious, 80 people lost their lives, and I think that the European Parliament in particular is obliged to take an immediate position."
"Madam President, I would like just briefly to return to the tragic situation, referred to by Mr Sterckx, experienced by refugees living at a number of borders in Europe today, and to inform you that about a week ago I paid a visit to the Sangatte centre opened by the French Government and run by the Red Cross."
"This centre accommodates refugees attempting to enter Great Britain, apparently attracted by more favourable reception conditions, and also because of the greater problems in entering at other borders."
"I should like to inform you that this centre processes an average of between 800 and 1000 refugees a day, from all over the world, particularly from Iran, Iraq and one region in Turkey, namely the Kurdish region, and the centre has received 16 000 refugees since opening eleven months ago."
"This is a direct result of the lack of harmonisation in the conditions for reception and the status of refugees in Europe."
"Admittedly, the French and Belgian case referred to earlier is an important one. This must not, however, be allowed to dull our determination."
"Instead, it should increase it."
"I have written to Commissioner Vitorino to this effect, in order to convey our determination to have a joint European policy on this, indeed our demand for this, before further tragedies have a chance to happen."
"Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak last, despite having been the first Member to request the floor."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your statement on the tragic events taking place in Jerusalem."
"I cannot say the same about your remarks to the Spanish press during your recent visit to Madrid, when you said that nationalism means war."
"Although that opinion was shared by the late Mr Mitterrand, I believe it to be narrow-minded and intolerant rather than open and democratic."
"To use the phrase from the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy: ""a nation is a group of people of the same origin who speak the same language, have a shared tradition, a shared territory and an awareness of the same destiny"", and the same dictionary defines nationalism as ""the devotion to a nation of the natives of that nation"", and there is nothing more natural, more human, and more keenly felt by the citizens than devotion to one' s nation."
"Madam President, I accept that there is aggravated nationalism, extremist nationalism and violent nationalism."
"However, we cannot put all forms of nationalism into one pigeonhole."
"There are more than a hundred historic peoples in Europe who can be classed as nations, and there are millions of people in Europe who are nationalists and are devoted to their nation."
"Nationalism is also the devotion to and the defence of the nation state."
"Madam President, I ask you to respect the nationalists in this House, who are moderate, peaceful and democratic."
"I ask you to respect the historic peoples of Europe and the hundreds of millions of Europeans who consider themselves democratic and peaceful nationalists."
"Madam President, I am happy to inform the House that, together with the other two Spanish Vice-Presidents of this Parliament, I had the honour and privilege of accompanying Mrs Fontaine on her visit to Spain and was moved to witness her brave and firm commitment which offered an example of the democracy and values which this House defends."
"When Mrs Fontaine used the words alluded to by Mr Ortuondo, she was talking about the exclusive, reductionist and xenophobic forms of nationalism which put race, territory or blood above the principle of democracy."
"That is what Mrs Fontaine was referring to, because, as I have said, I witnessed the whole of her visit."
"If Mr Ortuondo, as a nationalist, is not involved in that type of nationalism, then he has nothing to worry about."
"Madam President, I am most surprised by the Socialists' refusal to vote on the shipping tragedy which killed 80 people."
"I think that the European Parliament has a duty to hold this simple vote which says what?"
"Precisely that we are calling on the Commission to look at the larger picture, which is safety at sea in the European Union."
"Who can possibly be opposed to that?"
"That is what we are calling for, that is what the motion is calling for."
"Is that so bad?"
"I think we should all vote in favour and then get on with examining safety at sea in the European Union."
"That is the factor which we want quantified, Madam President."
"Mr Trakatellis, this is something the House is going to decide upon in a few moments, when we come to setting the agenda."
"Madam President, I have just come from the last meeting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Brussels."
"Those rights are very important, but one of the basic rights of the citizens of the EU is to have free movement for themselves and the goods which some of them may wish to carry."
"For the last few weeks many of them have been unable to enjoy these rights as a result of various disruptions at a number of border points, including the Channel ports, but inland as well."
"We were warned by DG II that there might well be difficulties today. Many of us, therefore, changed our travel arrangements."
"I saw members of the Commission this summer to ask them about compensation which is paid, where claimed and appropriate, to those who carry goods and are blocked from doing so."
"But under our regulations there is no provision whatsoever for citizens - either on tourism or business - to claim such compensation."
"I asked for an urgency this week."
"I appreciate that there are many other urgent matters to consider."
"The Conference of Presidents turned down my request for this urgency, but this matter continues day after day, week after week."
"I ask you, therefore, to press the Commission to bring forward regulations as quickly as possible to give citizens the same rights as those that carry goods, in the event of them being prevented from enjoying the free movement to which they are entitled."
"Thank you, Mr Kirkhope."
"I shall gladly take note of your request."
"Madam President, after listening to my Danish colleague, you can appreciate the fatuous level at which the debate was carried on in Denmark, a debate which led to a 'no' vote."
"However, a decision was made, and we must respect this."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to wish Mrs Ulla Sandbæk luck with her victory, for it is not of course only silly British Conservatives and Jürgen Haider who have seen this as a good result."
"Today, a working group of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights reports on the case of my constituent in the North-West of England, Mr James Mawdsley, a human-rights campaigner who is imprisoned in Burma, and it is widely expected that this United Nations group will conclude that the Burmese authorities have contravened international law in holding him."
"Within the last few days the British Consul has discovered that in reward for his protests against being kept in solitary confinement, prisons guards have subjected him to three days' worth of beating and left him with severe facial injuries."
"Tonight we will be debating the Asia-Europe summit, and I have no doubt that the resolution we eventually adopt will emphasise our commitment to human rights."
"Mr Mawdsley is just one amongst millions of people in Burma who suffer at the hands of the Burmese authorities."
"I ask you in communicating the eventual conclusions of this Parliament to bear in mind our concerns for this one individual whose treatment symbolises so much that is rotten in that country."
"I shall of course do so, Mr Davies."
"Madam President, the racist incidents in Germany since the last part-session sadly mean that I have to raise this issue again."
"A junior staff officer in the German Army has since then been dismissed because of racist comments, and three police officers in Cologne have been suspended from duty for swearing at a Tunisian taxi driver, knocking him to the ground and kicking him."
"Two children were slightly injured in an arson attack on a hostel providing temporary accommodation in Wuppertal in which a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the building."
"A racist motive is suspected and further inquiries are being made in that direction."
"A number of people suspected of having committed this attack have already been arrested."
"In Düsseldorf, a group of up to 20 people attacked and injured a black person who had spoken out against vulgar racist comments and was consequently beaten up."
"In view of all this, I can only repeat that these incidents are directly connected with racist policies."
"So there can no longer be any question of treating migrants or people whose appearance is different as criminals. Quite the opposite - it is precisely racist incidents of this kind that must be regarded as criminal acts."
"Thank you, Mrs Schröder."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the order of business. The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 28 September pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Relating to Tuesday:"
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left has approached me with a request to include Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East."
"If this request were to be adopted, these statements could be timetabled for Tuesday between 5 and 6 p.m."
"I shall give Mr Wurtz the floor in order to move the request on behalf of his group."
"Madam President, I am not going to repeat everything we said earlier."
"I shall simply refer to your statement, for the reasons you, yourself, clearly outlined."
"I think that it would be appropriate at this time for Parliament to express an opinion on this situation which is characterised by what you, yourself, rightly termed the initial 'provocation' and also by this military repression, of a quite unheard of violence, which has already led to the deaths of about 40 people, including children, in conditions which each of us has been able to observe on the television."
"Today, then, anything could happen, the hopes of a lasting peace are in danger of being dashed, and so an initiative from Parliament is urgently needed."
"I, in fact, initially proposed - and I continue to support this proposal in principle - that we interrupt our debate on enlargement, tomorrow, between 5 and 6 p.m., in order to take advantage of Mr Moscovici' s attendance on behalf of the Council, as he could make a statement which would be followed by a debate and a vote."
"If, after consultation, the various groups see this option as presenting major drawbacks, despite my personal preference for this alternative, then there are two other possibilities, either Thursday morning when Mrs Péry is present or even Thursday afternoon when Mr Solana is present."
"The most important thing, in my view, is that Parliament should be able to express its opinion, that we should hear what the Council has to say, and that we should be able to continue to be involved in the Middle East peace process."
"All other aspects are secondary."
"Mr Wurtz, we are currently talking about the Tuesday sitting."
"I would remind you that Mr Moscovici will still be in attendance between 5 and 6 p.m. on Tuesday."
"Would you like to withdraw your request and postpone it until Thursday?"
"Please clarify matters."
"Mr Barón Crespo, we are not going to go through the whole debate again. Many Members have already expressed their opinions in the form of procedural motions."
"If, however, Mr Wurtz wishes to maintain his request regarding Tuesday, then I shall ask for a speaker against the motion, and you are perfectly free to speak in this capacity."
"If Mr Wurtz proposes a compromise solution involving postponing his request until Thursday, then that will conclude matters for the Tuesday sitting."
"I think I am correct in saying that."
"I propose postponing my proposal until Thursday afternoon when Mr Solana is present."
"Thank you. I have no further requests relating to Tuesday."
"Relating to Thursday:"
"I therefore propose that we add the question of the Middle East peace process and the recent incidents to the debate with Mr Solana."
"(Parliament gave its assent) Concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, and more specifically item 4, 'Macedonia' , I have received two requests from the Confederal Group of the European United Left for this item to be replaced by an item entitled 'Prevention of the Paris-Baghdad solidarity flight' or, if this first proposal were not adopted, by an item on the 'Tragedy of the Greek ferry Samina' ."
"Madam President, the big problem is always that if you receive one proposal after the other, not everyone is aware of the other proposals."
"The aim of the PPE-DE' s proposal is to raise a major issue, such as item 5, which allows us to discuss the shipping disaster in Greece at length."
"I wanted to stress this point."
"Yes, this is an important point to make when the Members are voting."
"Having said that, I shall now put the request to replace the item on 'Macedonia' with an item on 'Prevention of the Paris-Baghdad solidarity flight' to the vote."
"Madam President, since my group' s position in relation to this painful issue has been mentioned on many occasions, I would like to say that I believe that this has simply been a question of voting on the timeliness of the debate, because Parliament is united in its solidarity with and condolences for the families of the victims."
"My group is in favour, as are all the others I suppose, of this issue - which is already included in relation to maritime safety in the relevant committee of Parliament - being examined with the greatest possible urgency."
"Still on the subject of Thursday, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have requested that Mrs Klass' s report on the vegetative propagation of the vine be postponed to a later part-session."
"I have received a request for a roll call vote on this."
"Madam President, I should just like to take a few seconds to explain why we are asking for this postponement."
"This is a controversial report which adds the issue of GMOs to a subject which the Commission did not cover."
"What is more, the report is scheduled for discussion on Thursday evening with a vote on Friday morning. We were under the impression that votes on controversial reports were not to be held on Friday mornings."
"Mrs Auroi, you have spoken in support of the motion, as is perfectly proper, and I now expect that Mr Poettering will want to oppose the motion."
"Madam President, I certainly would like to speak against that."
"This report has already been deferred on several occasions, and it is not often that the Council of Ministers and my group agree, but the French Presidency has specifically asked for this report to be considered and voted upon this week."
"If the Presidency is seeking to achieve something reasonable, as it is in this case, then we support that, and that is why I am requesting that it should remain on the agenda."
"(Parliament gave its assent) Relating to Friday:"
"Mr MacCormick, regarding the order of business for Friday, your request was not delivered within the stipulated time limit and as a result, I must inform you now that it could not be taken into consideration."
"There are not, therefore, any amendments to the agenda for Friday."
"Nonetheless, I am still willing to give you the floor on a point of order if that is what you really want."
"Madam President, I note on Friday that the oral question on language teachers which came on our agenda extremely late has got no attached motion for a resolution."
"I appreciate that the request I put in for that to be added arrived too late in the rather chaotic circumstances of this Monday."
"This is an important matter, and I would ask if after that debate closes a deadline can be fixed for motions for resolutions to be lodged on that topic."
"Unfortunately, Mr MacCormick, this is just not possible."
"I am sorry, but it would contravene the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, I should like to request that the following correction be made to Thursday' s agenda: under topical and urgent debate, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is correctly referred to in Greek as such, which has been the official name of this state, at least until now."
"However, in four languages which I have here, Italian, English, German and French - and there may be others - it is referred to as Macedonia."
"I think that errors such as this should not recur in our official documents and that we should use official names, at least those which still apply."
"I would therefore request that Thursday' s agenda be corrected and that this point be borne in mind for every document circulated officially here in the House."
"Mr Souladakis, you are quite right, we will make the amendment."
"It is true that it is not an accurate description."
"European system of national and regional accounts (taxes and social contributions)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0230/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation modifying the common principles of the European system of national and regional accounts in the community (ESA 95) as concerns taxes and social contributions and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 [8276/2/2000 - C5-0328/2000 - 1999/0200(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Knörr Borràs)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly express my satisfaction at the proposed regulation on the principles for registers of taxes and social contributions in accordance with the criteria of the European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 95)."
"I say 'satisfaction' because the approval of this regulation takes us closer to a transparent system which is comparable in the various Member States in relation to the calculation of the public deficit."
"I must say that, in general, the joint position of the Council largely includes the criteria of the European Parliament' s position."
"I say 'in general' because, even though, thanks to the notable absence of some MEPs on the left, the benches on the right managed to introduce an amendment on the possibility of the Council considering agreeing to an adaptation period for the application of the regulation, the Council interprets that the Member States will have the right to request this delay of the application of this transitional period but that, in all cases, the Commission will be able to reject that postponement if the request is not sufficiently well-founded."
"When we talk about a unified Europe in an economic and financial sense, this unification must clearly be carried out on the basis of honesty and transparency, because no other method is acceptable, and the regulation - which I hope will be approved - has precisely the virtue of eliminating those practices, which unfortunately are very wide-spread in certain Member States, which tend to disguise - so to speak - situations of deficit, by using various different accounting methods."
"Therefore, on the contrary, we will take the direction of seriousness in accounting in order to prevent behaviour - as I have said - which is less than transparent, if not fraudulent."
"I therefore repeat that the joint position of the Council must be supported, in my opinion, because this regulation introduces a mechanism for adapting to the European System of Accounts 95 which ensures, effectively, comparability and transparency in the public accounting of the Member States in areas as sensitive and important as those relating to the calculation of the public deficit."
"This approval also ensures that the right to request adaptation periods is counterbalanced by the right to reject such a period if it is not well founded."
"Finally, I must ask the Commissioner present today, because I have asked this repeatedly, to express, in this plenary session, an effective commitment to this Parliament for the presentation of an offprint to the regulation in relation to the registers and calculation of VAT own resources, because - I must remind you - the approval of the joint position was, in my view, linked to this commitment."
"I therefore repeat this request here in plenary session."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is an aspect of Mr Knörr' s report which is of particular interest to my group."
"As you know, Commissioner, in its part-session of April this year, Parliament approved, at first reading, an amendment on the transitional right in its application which said that the Member States could request a transitional period from the Commission of no more than two years to adapt their accounting systems to the provisions of this regulation."
"In its subsequent communication to Parliament, the Commission said that it accepted that amendment provided that it was interpreted as meaning that it had the capacity to reject, 'where necessary' , a request submitted by a Member State."
"Although it is doubtful that an explanatory statement of a Commission communication can repeal the text in question, the expression 'where necessary' , Commissioner, could be interpreted as a discretional power on the part of the Commission to reject a well-founded request from a Member State without the Commission having to justify its decision."
"Precisely to prevent such a situation, my group has tabled an amendment which says that the Commission will grant the said period provided that the Member State in question can demonstrate the existence of objective criteria which hinder the immediate application of the provisions of the regulation."
"Needless to say, Commissioner, this amendment has the sole purpose of dealing with this type of situation in an objective way and subjecting it to a regulated, and not discretional, procedure on the part of the Commission."
"Since this amendment, Mr President, is the only one to have been tabled, and in order to simplify the procedure and speed up the approval of this recommendation, my group would be prepared to withdraw this amendment if the Commission, Mr Solbes, makes a statement accepting the content of the amendment, which, I repeat, simply intends to ensure that this type of request is dealt with objectively and that it is subjected to a regulated procedure, preventing the possibility of discretionary behaviour on the part of the Commission."
"Mr President, as both a member of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and representative of the Pensioners' Party, I feel that this is a major, necessary measure and that it has come at the right time."
"Not only does it, obviously, deal with accounts and allow Parliament to keep abreast of the Member States' accounts - which is very important, as we know - but it also puts paid to the habitual practice of various States of the Union, especially the State which I represent in this Parliament, namely Italy, whose accounting system is wont to resemble a conjuring trick, particularly where taxes and social contributions are concerned - social contributions which are extremely important for pensioners."
"Conjuring tricks are performed: money appears and disappears at the drop of a hat."
"Very often this is untrue, and there must have been some real conjuring tricks going on if a State is able to tell workers who have worked all their lives and have finally reached the point where they are entitled to their hard-earned, longed for pensions that there is no money left to pay them."
"This is a lie: the accounts have been fiddled."
"So roll on the adoption of the Knörr Borràs report!"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank all the speakers for their comments."
"It is clear that the aim of this action, as Mr Fatuzzo has said, is to try to ensure that the figures correspond to reality as far as possible and that there is no underestimation of national public deficits."
"The work carried out by Parliament and the Council has been enormously useful."
"The Commission fully approves the joint position of the Council, which now includes the various amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading."
"However, two points have been raised which to a certain extent are still to be clarified."
"The first one refers to Article 7(2), that is, the possibility that the Commission may have a certain margin for discretion with regard to the granting of transitional periods."
"In this case, all the Commission requires is that those periods be genuinely justified."
"We are therefore perfectly able to accept that the Commission should commit itself to granting these requests provided that the Member States involved can objectively justify that it is difficult for them to immediately apply the provisions of the regulation."
"We believe that the game of clarity should apply on both sides."
"The Commission clearly must not deny these periods when there is objective justification for them, but it is essential that the objective justifications exist if a transitional period is to be granted."
"Otherwise, we would not be serving the objective of the regulation."
"The second point refers to the setting of VAT and the calculation of VAT own resources."
"With regard to the amendments which were presented at the time on this issue, the Commission is clearly committed to taking a different route, since we have no difficulty with the basic idea."
"On this specific point, I would like to point out that the Commission had committed itself on second reading to presenting another proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to deal with this specific issue, and today I can tell you that the Commission approved its proposal on 20 September and it has been forwarded to Parliament and the Council."
"I therefore hope that this issue will be resolved as soon as this new regulation is approved."
"It simply remains for me to express my satisfaction at Parliament' s support for the work of the Commission, and to thank the rapporteur, Mr Knörr, for his cooperation and his excellent work in relation to this text."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Risk capital"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0235/2000) by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Risk Capital: Implementation of the Action Plan - Proposals for moving forward [COM(1999) 493 - C5-0320/1999 - 1999/2208(COS)]"
"Mr President, risk capital is essential for job creation, since between 80% and 90% of funds raised from venture capital goes towards hiring people."
"SMEs account for 66% of total employment in the Community, SMEs and start-up businesses and venture capital therefore need to have easy access to each other."
"Although European venture capital has grown rapidly, we still remain considerably behind the US."
"With this in mind, I welcome the importance attached to the Lisbon Summit on venture capital."
"Although progress has been made, it is also less focused on the high growth and job creation sectors of information technology, biotechnology and healthcare."
"Coordinated action is needed and necessary at both EU and Member State levels in these areas."
"In order to achieve this, we need to create a regulatory environment conducive to risk capital. A number of regulatory measures need to be introduced."
"A directive on supplementary pension funds needs to be considered urgently and not put on the back burner; we also need an update on EU accountancy rules, a single prospectus for pan-European capital fundraising and the directive on late payment in commercial transactions needs to be implemented on time."
"Similarly, the reform of the European patent system seems absolutely essential in this area, as an early adoption of this directive is needed to create an online database to help SMEs check whether or not patents exist and how they can apply for them themselves."
"SMEs - foolishly perhaps - disregard the patenting system."
"We need to lighten the administrative burden on SMEs, and measures to reduce the stigma on bankruptcy are long overdue because, although there is a wide range of funding instruments available, SMEs and entrepreneurs seeking funding for their new ventures continue to face difficulties."
"A website could be created to help overcome this at European level."
"There needs to be a review and rationalisation of Community instruments supporting risk capital."
"This needs to be more coherent and better integrated between the Commission, the Member States, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund."
"The EIB, the EIF and the European Commission also need to broaden their support for risk capital investment to a wider range of institutions and more innovative instruments, for example, business angels."
"Evidence in the US suggests that informal venture capital provided by such people is up to five times as much as with formal procedures."
"Similarly a Community-up approach to risk capital is essential."
"Risk capital investment needs to go out to everyone, to all regions and to all communities."
"Public authorities here as in elsewhere also have a key role to play in providing risk capital and financial support in areas where the private sector will fear to tread."
"Initiatives such as mentoring have helped in these areas."
"I praise the Prince's Trust in the United Kingdom for the work they have done."
"Finally, the lack of entrepreneurial culture and insufficient human resources and training and the lack of high-tech SMEs are all factors which need to be addressed in order to develop risk capital."
"It is my belief that the EU has far more potential than is being realised at present."
"In order to unlock this potential we need to make changes, not only to the regulatory environment but also to the culture."
"It is essential that we realise the importance of risk capital to growth and employment and review the ways in which risk capital can be rationalised, simplified and made more accessible."
"Essentially, we need to take the measures which I have outlined and which have been outlined by the Commission and others in order to achieve a joined-up approach to raise the level of risk capital in the European Union and to extend the job-creating benefits to all parts of the European Union."
"As regards the new amendments which have been resubmitted after the committee vote, I am not in favour of Mr Tannock's Amendment No 1, but I approve Amendments Nos 2 to 9."
"Of Amendments Nos 10 to 20, I only approve Amendments Nos 14, 17 and part of Amendment No 18."
"I welcome the views of everyone in my committee and I believe we have a real consensus."
"I hope to maintain that by supporting the amendments I have just mentioned."
"Mr President, may I begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for the excellent work he has done in drafting this report."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the shadow rapporteur for the EPP-DE Group on this matter in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Skinner who has been very successful in collating the views of parliamentary committees and political groups and putting them on paper in a harmonious and balanced manner."
"In the communication on risk capital, the main political message was that risk capital is essential for job-creation, raising productivity and supporting growth in Europe."
"I would like to express this even more strongly than the Commission did."
"If we really want the European Union to achieve the ambitious goals of the Lisbon Summit, it is absolutely essential to improve the functioning of the single European risk capital market."
"Companies in the European Union, especially in growth industries like the hi-tech and bio-tech industries, cannot achieve their full potential without better access to risk capital."
"Efficient venture capital markets are also a precondition for the development of entrepreneurship in Europe."
"In that sense I fully agree with Mr Skinner when he says that it is of the utmost importance to give SMEs open and fair access to the new risk capital markets."
"According to a recent study mentioned in the Commission communication, this is also a very efficient tool for improving employment, since between 80 and 90% of funds raised from venture capital normally go towards hiring more people; in other words more risk capital allows us to use our human capital more efficiently."
"In fighting unemployment, concrete measures to alleviate the tax pressure on labour are also urgently needed."
"I also want to emphasise the importance of reducing the costs and administrative procedures involved in setting up a company and getting back business after bankruptcy."
"At the moment there are too many possible entrepreneurs outside the economy, just because of inadequate insolvency rules."
"The present communication shows that even if some progress has been made Europe still has some major weaknesses, particularly when compared with its main competitors."
"Mr Skinner said that both the amount and allocation of risk capital remains sub-optimal compared to the United States, and unfortunately this overall gap is widening all the time."
"That should make us a little worried about the timetable proposed by the Heads of State and Government in Lisbon."
"We should ask ourselves whether the deadline of 2003 is too late for Europe."
"I welcome the view put forward by Gordon Brown and others that we should think about accelerating the timetable, in both the risk capital action plan and the financial services action plan."
"We should at least make sure that some progress is made this year."
"I therefore totally support Parliament's view on point 23, calling on the Commission to keep us regularly informed about recent developments."
"The proposal for a directive on supplementary pension funds is essential for the growth of venture capital in Europe."
"The Employment and Social Committee wanted to make a reference to the findings of the recent report on supplementary pensions, particularly on the prudential rules."
"Institutional investors such as insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds play an increasingly predominant role in providing risk capital."
"Pension funds in particular have been gaining in importance in the last decade as the demographic changes increase the need for retirement products."
"The shift in favour of more performance-orientated instruments has also increased the need to reform the system."
"The developments over the last few days with the single currency have been unfortunate."
"The euro will never be strong or attractive enough if the European economy is not strong and attractive."
"The risk capital action plan is one of the political choices we have already decided to make."
"Now we only have to make sure that we make it fast enough to use the current window of opportunity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard, this is a very good report."
"It covers all the key points as regards promoting a risk capital culture in Europe."
"This is particularly necessary given that efficient risk capital markets play a very important role in creating jobs on the one hand, and on the other, in increasing productivity, in financing rapidly growing companies and in creating new businesses."
"The report indicates that 66% of all jobs in the Community are in SMEs and that 80% to 90% of funding secured through venture capital is used to hire staff."
"We therefore need more capital for investment in job-creating, growth-intensive SMEs, and also for research and development and for business start-ups. These are the key points."
"Precisely because we are way behind the United States in this field, we are also calling on the Member States and the Commission to support more money - that is more risk capital - to provide start-up capital and capital for the early part of a company's life.We want to cut down on red-tape: the one-stop shop model should be the rule in all countries, and we should take advantage of the new media here."
"We also want to see a tax system which at the same time promotes innovation and encourages private individuals to invest capital in businesses."
"I therefore also welcome the agreement reached in Lisbon to introduce a benchmarking system so as to promote the best of the many ways of encouraging risk capital and to make further progress in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his very prudent report, which comes just at a time when we need a fresh impetus in the risk capital sector within the European Union."
"The acceleration in the pace of company growth, start-ups by highly innovative businesses and the terrific speed of industrial change all require more efficient risk capital markets."
"More support is needed for growth."
"Although there has been rapid growth in venture capital here over the last five years, Europe is still way behind the United States in this area, especially in the high-growth areas of information and biotechnology, and also in the area of health care, including preventive health care, a totally new field that is constantly growing."
"In addition, venture capital can be used to create modern social services, an area that should not be overlooked. These services will be particularly needed in the future because of the growing numbers of older people."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs took a special interest in types of supplementary pension funds and the prudential rules these require."
"Because of increasing life expectancy, ever more new financial products are being created in the field of old-age pensions."
"This means that pension funds are playing an ever-greater role in providing risk capital."
"But social security systems, however they may be constructed, therefore particularly need special regulations and supervisory and codetermination bodies when it comes to funding, so as to strengthen confidence in these new systems and products."
"That is why it is also necessary for all interested parties - including the European Parliament, the social partners, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund - to participate in a continuing dialogue."
"It cannot be said often enough that the European Union involves pooling our strengths."
"We must use all the financial instruments at our disposal to rapidly develop the market and to increase the volume of risk capital investment in the EU, so that risk capital is put to use in a way that genuinely creates jobs, thus benefiting all stakeholders."
"Investing in new business start-ups will also create jobs."
"If these are to be successfully built up, employees will have a key role to play and will act as a driving force."
"Employee participation systems linked with codetermination mechanisms therefore need to be in place."
"This is of vital importance for a variety of reasons."
"To sum up, I would like to emphasise once again that the Commission communication, combined with the report, can potentially provide a strong impetus for combining forces in the risk capital sector."
"Mr President, as we all know, the European Parliament has, in successive reports and motions for many years now, expressed its interest in and sensitivity towards small and medium-sized enterprises and their problems."
"It has used various means to highlight the important role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating jobs and introducing technological innovations."
"However, this much-vaunted interest on the part of the Member States' governments and the Community institutions is pure hypocrisy since, to all intents and purposes, small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to access funding programmes, unable to take advantage of technological invention and technological modernisation programmes, unable to take advantage of staff education and training programmes and unable to do anything about their unfair treatment at the hands of the tax authorities."
"These problems could be addressed by revising the banks' humiliating lending criteria and by making full use of associations of enterprises and chambers which promote technological development programmes and school education programmes."
"The Commission' s action programmes have done little along these lines; and yet, in the Commission' s announcement and Parliament' s report, here we are promoting options which are mainly of interest to big lenders and, more to the point, we are doing so on in the name of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is a public outrage to propose promoting a single European capital market, ostensibly to serve the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The same applies to proposals for single European pension funds, to proposals that insurance fund reserves be channelled into high-risk financial investments and to tax cuts on profits."
"Certainly, solving problems in connection with the unfair treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises by the tax authorities, simplifying and modernising patents and reducing excessive administrative expenditure and start-up formalities for small and medium-sized enterprises are steps in the right direction."
"But we consider that satisfying the demands of big lenders in the name of small and medium-sized enterprises is provocative and we shall vote against it."
"Mr President, unemployment within the European Union is, at more than 9% of the population eligible for work, still relatively high."
"The development of the risk capital sector in Europe will mainly encourage small and medium-sized businesses to attract capital."
"This is a development to be welcomed as it is exactly this sector which has so much potential for creating employment."
"I would urge the European Commission to bring the process of adopting the directive on additional pensions to a conclusion."
"Subject to rules of prudence, institutions must have complete freedom of investment."
"In addition, Member States must ensure that paid pension contributions are exempt from tax so that a new source of private capital can be tapped."
"But the availability of capital is not the only threshold."
"Often, it is the infamous web of rules and regulations, red-tape and formalities which stop small businesses from taking on staff."
"Many Member States thus have the major task of setting structural reform in motion and taking down unnecessary barriers."
"With a view to the desired reform of the European patent system, I should like to bring the Commissioner' s attention to the European Patent Office' s trilingual system, which engenders distortion of competition."
"It should therefore be possible to submit an application in every official language of the Union."
"I believe that, without a doubt, the equal treatment of languages de jure is in the interests of small, innovative businesses and also complies with the EU Treaty."
"Another concern, expressed - rightly so, in my opinion - in Paragraph 22 of the motion for a resolution, relates to the possible patenting of natural materials, such as genes and plants."
"The principle that life is a gift of God and is not property acquired by people, should be respected at all times."
"Mr President, the Skinner report is to be welcomed."
"Who dares wins!"
"Unfortunately, there are far too many European companies to which this expression does not apply."
"We may be good in terms of inventiveness, but we are bad when it comes to successfully putting our inventions into commercial practice."
"All too often, rights of exploitation go to American or Asian companies before SMEs in Europe have the courage to exploit inventions themselves."
"Young entrepreneurs in particular often have no idea how to obtain equity capital."
"Our tax and administration systems create special problems."
"These systems are far too complicated and are often incomprehensible, so that companies of this kind face frustrating obstacles."
"We should therefore support all the calls for reform of tax systems and administrative structures."
"The present undesirable state of affairs needs to be changed as soon as possible, and the Austrian Government has already taken the initiative in this respect."
"Stamp duty on stock-exchange transactions has therefore been abolished with immediate effect and the tax allowance on employee share ownership has been doubled."
"It would be good if these measures could also be adopted by other governments instead of waiting until the EU requests them to do so."
"Mr President, the rapporteur and all the other Members who have spoken in this Chamber have quite rightly stressed that more efficient risk capital markets have an important role to play in supporting economic growth, creating new and long-lasting jobs and promoting a European knowledge society. This of course also applies to encouraging SMEs and promoting entrepreneurialism."
"These are objectives that are repeatedly highlighted as being cornerstones, not only of our economic policy guidelines, but also of our employment policy guidelines."
"The proposed implementation of the action plan is the right way to go and is part of the structural reforms still needed in Europe despite all the progress made in implementing structural reforms in the markets for products, capital and services."
"But there is more to be done here."
"It is a good thing that this clearly emerged at both the Lisbon Summit and the employment forum. Above all it has also become apparent that the European Investment Bank will play an additional positive role."
"Mr Skinner was right to draw attention to that."
"Furthermore, the Commission communication also indicates, and this was also quite rightly taken on board in the report, that we have still not made sufficient progress in building an integrated pan-European risk capital market, and that this is a weak area for the EU."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"Risk capital investment in Europe has more than doubled over the last four years, but only EUR 7 billion was invested in Europe, compared with EUR 12 billion in the USA."
"If we compare investment during the start-up period of companies, the picture is even clearer, with EUR 1.6 billion in Europe against EUR 4.5 billion in the USA."
"Europe's equity markets for high-growth companies may have grown significantly, but in comparison with the US NASDAQ we are just dwarfs."
"We are all aware of the problems involved, but we are faced with obstacles that seriously stand in the way of our taking a risk-based and entrepreneurial approach."
"I have in mind not only cultural barriers, but also red tape, approval and licensing procedures, difficulties for SMEs in simply filing patent applications and having patents granted, not to mention the cost of maintaining patents, and also uncoordinated tax systems."
"An entrepreneurial Europe needs rewards and opportunities which benefit everyone."
"So we must fully support the demands that have been made."
"There is also room for even more commitment."
"I would like to mention that expert networks also have an important and positive role to play."
"The provision of risk capital is an important area, but it is not the only issue in business start-ups and expansions: there is also the question of what working capital is available."
"Lastly, I would like to stress that this is an area where women entrepreneurs should benefit from special support, and I wish to emphasise that we, the European Parliament, should be calling on the Commission to monitor progress in this field by means of benchmarking and a scoreboard process."
"Mr President, I welcome this report on risk capital, because I agree that it represents an opportunity to obtain essential funding for research, development, production and market penetration for new products, which in turn can, of course, create more jobs."
"We agree on many points, such as the provision of public and private risk capital, ways of making it more accessible, prioritising the availability of risk capital for SMEs, favourable tax treatment for ploughing back profits into risk capital funds, and simplifying and minimising the cost of patent applications."
"However, the overall concept also gives rise to some criticisms."
"Firstly, if this is primarily about SMEs in underdeveloped regions, why is there such a sharp focus on innovative services?"
"I would also like to see investment in new products in innovative manufacturing sectors as a means of promoting regional development."
"Secondly, it is no use having genuinely good intentions as regards investing in new business start-ups and in research and development, and pumping risk capital into these areas, if the process of opening up new markets, which is highly costly for SMEs, is not included."
"I say this because that is where SMEs face the greatest difficulties once they have a product - penetrating the market."
"Thirdly, why should public risk capital only be applied in areas which the private sector is reluctant to finance?"
"It follows that this simply means keeping higher loss risks in the private sector and reserving high-profit areas for the private sector."
"This amounts to a distortion of competition which puts public risk capital at a disadvantage."
"Fourthly, how can you guarantee that the greater involvement by pension funds in risk capital called for in the report may not lead to pension contributions being lost, which would run counter to the contributors' objective of ensuring a secure retirement?"
"Fifthly, it remains unclear why mergers on the capital market should have a positive impact on the availability of risk capital."
"Experience suggests the opposite."
"The fewer suppliers there are, the less competition there is and the higher costs are."
"I too should like to congratulate Mr Skinner on his excellent report, which addresses an issue that I consider to be of the utmost importance."
"If the European Union wishes to establish itself as the most economically dynamic region in the world, as was decided at the Lisbon Summit, it must ensure that investments, particularly in SMEs, which create jobs and which support growth sectors, are given the necessary funding."
"We wish to promote a dynamic spirit of entrepreneurship in Europe, but there are still countless difficulties blocking the path of people wanting to become entrepreneurs and to carry out profitable projects."
"The problems requiring rapid resolution throughout the European Union range from the administrative aspects, such as the often pointless bureaucracy which wastes time, energy and money, to the provision of funding."
"Venture capital companies have a major role to play in this field and the European Union must make more rapid progress if it wishes to catch up, in particular with the United States, which is currently far ahead of us."
"We feel that the Commission' s proposal is a step in the right direction, although I also think that we must move ahead more quickly, as stated in the amendment requesting the Commission to submit an action plan for 2000 in the field of risk capital and to adopt an integrated approach that combines all the Community instruments in a coherent way."
"First and foremost, Europe needs to focus increasingly on the merit of projects rather than on the personal wealth of entrepreneurs, as still happens."
"If the banks' practice of requiring personal guarantees from individuals is highly debatable, it is quite unacceptable where venture capital businesses are concerned."
"There is still a need to give entrepreneurs easier access to venture capital, and this requires much more active and efficient provision of information on the way in which it is used."
"(start of speech inaudible) ... which will be of benefit only to that minority of the population which has capital to invest and move around."
"The package of proposals just provides one more illustration of the fact that the European Union has been built exclusively in order to favour the movement and investment of large amounts of capital and, as a corollary, small amounts."
"Yet this concerns the majority of the population, as it is their money that the European institutions count on using in order to fund the measures to facilitate private investment."
"The people who do not own capital but who pay the bulk of taxes, largely through indirect taxes such as VAT, will therefore have to fund the subsidies and tax deductions envisaged for investors and the tax advantages granted to stock options."
"The plan is to favour pension funds, but that inevitably means favouring pay-as-you-go schemes."
"The money which ought to be used to provide a decent retirement pension for all will then be used to enable a minority to make greater private profits."
"We consequently refute, in its entirety, an approach designed to take even more money out of the pockets of the working classes that form the majority of the population in order to siphon it off towards holders of capital."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that the Commission is pleased to have received the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I thank Mr Skinner and Mrs Kauppi for their comments."
"Both clearly support the Community strategy for the development of risk capital in the European Union."
"I believe there is a clear consensus on the important role to be played by risk capital as a driving force for economic growth and, consequently, for employment."
"As the honourable Members know - some speakers have mentioned it - the European Council at Lisbon paid particular attention to promoting our efforts to implement risk capital in such a way that the action plan will be finished in 2003."
"Some of you have referred to the possibility of speeding it up."
"There is no doubt that this speeding up will depend on the Member States' ability to implement certain measures."
"Remember though that the action plan for risk capital predates Lisbon, since it dates back to 1998."
"However, past circumstances do not matter as much as what we intend to do for the future."
"In this respect, I would like to inform you that the Commission will be sending a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the progress made with regard to risk capital in accordance with the Lisbon objective."
"The communication will include a mechanism for comparative monitoring and assessment to provide precise knowledge of what is happening in each of the Member States, and to allow us to draw relevant conclusions and to introduce, into those countries which consider it appropriate, the best practices which have been adopted in others."
"An important factor that has been mentioned is the growth in risk capital during 1999. This is clearly essential."
"If we analyse the figures in absolute terms, we should be very satisfied with this result."
"Nevertheless, and some of you have highlighted this, when we compare it with the figure in the United States, we have to acknowledge that the difference is significant. Our fundamental objective must be to reduce these differences which still exist in comparison with the United States."
"To this end, it is crucial that we carry out a range of concrete actions, and the first and most fundamental is the integration of the European Union' s risk capital market."
"Some of you have referred to two specific examples which I would like to highlight - pension funds and the possibility of a more effective Community patent - which allow risk capital to be better used."
"As for pension funds, I will tell you that, this week in principle, the Commission should approve a proposal for a directive which offers pension funds greater opportunities to invest in securities throughout the Union."
"We are clearly talking about supplementary pension funds and not about an obligation to invest in this way."
"We are talking about removing the current obstacles and, therefore, there should be none of the problems you have mentioned with regard to future risks."
"Clearly, the opening up to risk capital will require scrupulous behaviour on the part of managers so as to minimise any possible risks."
"With regard to the Community patent, I simply wish to say that, back in July, the Commission approved its proposal on this issue."
"We believe that it is a fundamental instrument for reducing costs and safeguarding and increasing legal certainty in those innovative companies operating within the Union."
"The Community patent will no doubt cause practical problems - some of you have mentioned such complex issues as the linguistic rules - but this is not, unfortunately, a problem which we can discuss at the moment."
"Nevertheless, these two specific issues must not lead us to forget other aspects which you have highlighted, such as the improvement of the economic, regulatory and legislative situation, which is essential if risk capital is to be as dynamic as it is in the United States."
"The regulatory, administrative and fiscal burdens of investments in risk capital are one of the obstacles in Europe and, in this respect, as in the field of cultural barriers, which certainly exist, the existence of that information, with a comparative situation in the various Member States, should give us more detailed knowledge of the good practices in each of the various Member States. We will thereby achieve better practical results which, in the end, will result in a speeding up of the use of risk capital in the countries of the Union."
"Some of you have mentioned the problem of public funding in the case of risk capital and we certainly have to clarify the compatibility of that public funding with all the legislation on competition."
"Some of you wondered why public funding had to be merely a supplement to private funding."
"This is not a desire to exclude anything, but simply a desire to use the available resources in the best way."
"It is not reasonable for public funding to compete with private funding when it comes to financing risk capital projects, and we should use that public funding for those types of project which are most difficult to finance through the private sector."
"From the point of view of the Union itself, we are considering the best way to use the available instruments, especially the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund."
"Around the middle of October, the Commission will also publish a second communication, which we will send to the Council and Parliament, in which we will analyse the various financial instruments managed by the Commission and the future outlook on the essential issue of risk capital."
"In conclusion, I would say that I consider the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to be an excellent and important contribution, and it is enormously constructive, in terms of the efforts to develop the risk capital market."
"It is satisfying to see that the recommendations of this committee largely coincide with our proposals for risk capital action plans, and I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the committee for participating in this debate."
"Mr President, it is customary to be able to respond to the Commission if at the end a question has been ignored or not fully answered."
"We believe that the European Union is a virtual desert as far as venture capital is concerned and that this needs to be addressed urgently."
"There are perhaps only one or two countries amongst the 15 where it really operates."
"The rest of them, I am afraid, are virtually asleep."
"Even in those countries where it does operate it operates in a different way from the system across the Atlantic."
"At the very least, issues like the pension fund can be introduced fairly quickly."
"These issues must not to be put on the back burner."
"Mr Skinner, this is not a point of order but a final comment which you have made outside the agenda."
"In any event, if the Commissioner wishes to make any comment at this point, he has the floor."
"Mr President, a very quick reply."
"I believe I have mentioned the two issues raised by Mr Skinner."
"With regard to speeding up the timetables, it falls to the Member States to take the necessary measures to implement the action plan."
"As for the Commission, we are now going to present the first report on what has been done, which will no doubt serve as an incentive for the Member States to act by comparing their actions with those of others."
"Given the Commission' s responsibilities, it is difficult for us to do any more than that."
"With regard to pension funds, and I shall say this again for the record, the Commission intends to approve a regulation on them next Wednesday."
"We are therefore already speeding up the process."
"Thank you very much, Mr Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Third Asia-Europe Meeting in Seoul, 20-21 October 2000 (ASEM III)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the third Asia-Europe Meeting in Seoul on 20 and 21 October (ASEM III)."
"Mr President, the third meeting of the ASEM process will take place in Seoul in three weeks."
"It is a fortunate coincidence that the meeting is taking place in Korea soon after the historic Korean summit, which opened the way to reconciliation and future reunification."
"This will clearly have significant positive effects for security, not only regionally but also globally."
"This meeting will mark the maturing of a process which began four years ago in Bangkok."
"This process complements our bilateral relations with our ten Asian partners, as well as our relations with ASEAN, and contributes to the process of integration in Asia and in Europe."
"The ASEM process is built on three pillars: the political, the economic and the cultural."
"The ASEM process has aided the ASEAN + 3 process, bringing North and South-East Asia even closer together."
"Its structure of meetings between Ministers for Finance, Economics and Foreign Affairs, as well as the summits, follow the ASEM model."
"In the Union we also had to, and still have to, learn how to efficiently manage a process which seeks to promote political dialogue in order to deepen the economic relationship between the two regions and increase personal and cultural contacts."
"The process is based on a relationship of equality."
"By stressing the original idea that this process of dialogue should be developed as a process between equal partners and kept as informal as possible, without an institutionalised secretariat, we have managed, despite certain difficulties, to convince our Asian partners that we wish to have equal relations with them, going beyond any donor-receiver relationship with them or any post-colonial standpoint."
"This approach is especially important in terms of our efforts to consolidate, deepen and broaden the political dialogue."
"While our Asian partners prefer to deal with questions which unite us, excluding all others, we have argued for a broader agenda, excluding nothing."
"Our partners have accepted this principle in return for a guarantee that wisdom and common sense will prevail when it comes to selecting the issues for discussion."
"Human rights are most problematic, of course, together with the rejection of intervention in internal affairs and other arguments which are familiar to us."
"Nevertheless, the statement by the presidency of the meeting and the framework for cooperation between Asia and Europe will clearly mention this problem."
"I would also like to add that, within the broader framework of the ASEM process, we are holding a constructive series of seminars on human rights organised jointly with the Asia-Europe Foundation."
"Security problems, which are of particular importance in the region, will play a considerable role in the process, and it is worth mentioning the publication of a separate declaration on the Korean peninsular as an example of this."
"The leaders will also deal with the fight against cross-border crime, especially in the light of the recent Dover tragedy."
"The exploitation of illegal immigrants, women and children, particularly in the virulent sex industry, will not only be a subject for debate, but also initiatives will be taken to combat this scourge of our times, which is linked to poverty and insecurity."
"In the field of the economy, 1993 was a significant year, since it was the critical moment when our exports to Asia exceeded our exports to the United States."
"The second ASEM meeting, which took place in London in 1998, successfully overcame the crisis."
"We supported our Asian partners and we adopted concrete measures, such as the significant commitment on trade and investments which reversed the earlier trend and led to a considerable commercial deficit with our partners."
"The creation of a trust fund, the establishment of a European financial network of experts and the adoption of two action plans to assist trade and promote investments are other concrete measures which show that Europe is concerned about Asia, not only in the good times but also in times of crisis."
"The coming meeting will allow us to assess the results of our efforts and confirm that we have made progress in the pursuit of greater operability and efficiency."
"Furthermore, the leaders will discuss the implications of the new economy, globalisation, the lessons learnt from the crisis, the creation of a trans-European-Asian superhighway to improve contacts between research institutes, and discuss the influence of the new technologies on economic life, including the measures to deal with the ever-greater knowledge gap."
"As a result of the current global situation, the availability of energy supply, including oil, has been added to the agenda."
"The need for a general, multilateral legal framework for the commercial system, such as the World Trade Organisation, and the need to keep it functioning in the era of globalisation, will also be a key issue in the leaders' discussions."
"This is part of our strategy to make progress on the consensus in favour of an immediate start to a new global round."
"It is important to fill the cultural vacuum between our two regions."
"The need to increase awareness, to spread knowledge with a view to stimulating understanding, and eliminating false ideas have been important objectives of the ASEM process since its beginnings."
"The Asia-Europe Foundation has contributed considerably to this objective."
"The leaders will therefore decide on other initiatives to increase the exchange of students between the regions, to modernise educational structures, to intensify cooperation in the development of human resources and exchange points of view on recent socio-political events."
"In this regard, we regret that our Asian partners are still not prepared to consider the creation of a social forum, within the ASEM process, which represents civil society in the same way that the Asia-Europe business forum represents the business community."
"This proposal originates from the organisers of the forum of the peoples."
"From an organisational and logistical point of view, the Korean Presidency will publish a Presidency statement which will address - together with the problems discussed by the leaders - issues such as the reform of the United Nations, disarmament, arms control, the fight against AIDS etc."
"The final text will reflect the discussions between the leaders, but good work has already been carried out."
"Therefore, the presidency will update it in accordance with its responsibilities during the meeting."
"The Seoul declaration on the Korean Peninsula, which I mentioned before, recognises the importance of recent progress and approves the policy of introducing North Korea into the international community with a view to the peaceful unification of the two Koreas."
"Finally, the 2000 framework for cooperation between Europe and Asia, an updated version of the first one, adopted at the last meeting in London, outlines the objectives and procedures which will govern the ASEM process over the next decade."
"In contrast to the last version, the importance of human rights and cooperation in safeguarding the environment have been added, to give just two examples."
"The only outstanding problem is the question of qualification for membership, with regard to which the European partners have so far been opposed to attempts to introduce certain limits which could be interpreted as excluding certain partners from future participation."
"In summary, please allow me to stress that the most important characteristic of the ASEM process - in my opinion - is the establishment of a regular dialogue at the highest level by means of six-monthly summits prepared at the periodic meetings of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Economics and Finance, not to mention the numerous meetings of high-level officials and experts which also accompany them."
"Dialogue with our Asian partners has become a normal event, which does not depend on economic euphoria or pessimism resulting from a crisis."
"The ASEM process is a clear expression of the Union' s absolute commitment to our Asian partners, on an equal footing, and does not only deal with economic matters but also with the important political and personal dimension."
"Given Asia' s importance to Europe, and vice versa, mutual learning and the dissemination of knowledge, the establishment of a network between leaders and peoples will help to put into practice the theme chosen for ASEM III, that is to say, working together for prosperity and stability in the new millennium."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Asia is one of the regions of the world where the European Union's potential in terms of political influence has not been fulfilled."
"This is not intended as a reproach, it is simply a statement of fact."
"This becomes apparent if you go to that part of the world as an EU representative, when you will find, for example, that no one is satisfied with a statement that you are representing the European Union - you will always be asked which Member State you come from."
"It is a way of judging how important you are."
"And where the European Union has not achieved its full potential it is also possible that it has not assumed its full responsibility either."
"That is why the ASEM process is so enormously important."
"I think I can say that the Commission largely has Parliament's support in promoting this process."
"The Commission can, to a very large extent, count on Parliament's support for its overall approach and for the agenda it has drawn up."
"So one of the most important things today is to make the European public aware of the ASEM process."
"However, our partners in Asia do not understand that, in practice, we are very inward-looking. The issues that most concern us are the Intergovernmental Conference, enlargement and, when the occasion arises, problems on our political doorstep, such as the Middle East."
"But they do not understand the fact that we are not fulfilling our potential when it comes to all those issues that are important for global welfare and peace."
"People's expectations of the European Union are enormous."
"They envisage a strategic European presence in Asia, yet we are certainly not in a position to provide that in the foreseeable future."
"It is obvious what lies behind this: an awareness of the constant presence of the United States of America and of the growing importance of China."
"They would like to see Europe providing a counterbalance."
"We must seize this opportunity and in fact this is a chance for us to win support for our principles there."
"This is something else that can be achieved through the ASEM process."
"Mr President, I believe that the question is now no longer whether this century or this millennium will be a European one or an Asian one - no, what matters is for both regions to join together in a new partnership."
"So it is right that the European and Asian Heads of Government should continue to meet through their informal multiple-theme dialogue, and it is particularly important for them to do that in Seoul this year against the historical new background of the possibility of reunification."
"There is still insufficient interest in mutual understanding between these two regions of the world, although economic and trade policy, and a shared interest in a security partnership, do exist."
"But these two major regions need to understand each other better and coordinate their affairs so that they can successfully focus on their shared priorities and make some real progress with regard to the reform of the United Nations and the WTO in relation to monetary and financial stability, and also concerning other important issues on the agenda of the International Labour Organisation."
"The successes of the last two summits in Bangkok and London cannot disguise the fact that the ASEM process is not sufficiently dynamic."
"Bangkok was all innovation and smiling faces, whereas London provided an initial response to the Asian crisis."
"Normality in EU-Asian relations is now needed, so that we can finally see some concrete cooperation meaningful to the public."
"Cooperation should range from the fight against money laundering to environmental commitment and confidence-building measures in security policy and to commitment to food and water supply safety. It should also embrace our successes in the fight against organised crime, and - you are quite right about this, Commissioner - in combating trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation of women and abuse of children."
"The exchanges between schools, universities and business people are most promising, and the Asia-Europe Foundation is doing sterling work."
"However, what is at stake now, in 2000, is what ASEM can really achieve and should be able to achieve, and what is best organised at ASEM level."
"The Vision Group has produced an excellent model here, and one that should be put into more concrete terms."
"ASEM has certainly done the right thing in focusing on the three pillars of political, economic and cultural cooperation."
"But we need more than that if we are to make progress in security policy under the OSCE process in Europe and also as regards territorial issues in Asia or human rights and democratic issues in Burma and elsewhere, with a view to stabilising the region."
"It is also vital for the increasingly important issues of company delocalisations, employment standards and other social issues to be discussed in a social forum which meets at a level comparable with the Business Forum and which facilitates the dialogue between politicians and the social partners on industrial relations and social standards."
"We really must create a forum of this kind."
"But we as Members of the European Parliament are also interested in reviving the Europe-Asia parliamentary dialogue."
"We have organised the first meeting between European and Asian Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg."
"Now that Europe has taken the first initiative, the ball is in our Asian colleagues' court."
"Why should Japan or China not run with this ball?"
"It is a pity that in Europe interest in developing closer links with Asia is not as strong as interest in cooperation with other regions of the world."
"So a parliamentary dialogue also means the public at large becoming involved in cooperation in civil society."
"We all need to see this as a task for the future, because both these regions of the world have a great deal to say and do."
"Mr President, the Europe-Asia Meeting is different to other kinds of dialogue, in that ASEM' s set-up is informal, which we appreciate in the case of this dialogue of eminent strategic importance."
"It also covers different dimensions and embraces politics, economic affairs and culture."
"How can we marry all of this together?"
"This is not straightforward, and we believe that the ideal starting point would be Commissioner Patten' s excellent speech on this subject back in July in Korea."
"I would like to outline three points at this stage."
"Firstly, we Liberals attach great importance to economic cooperation, an often undervalued factor, not only over there, but also here."
"If we learnt anything from the economic crisis in Asia, it is that liberalisation, with a greater level of economic transparency and sound protection of foreign investments, is effective."
"If there can now be joint initiatives within the WTO, then that is an extra bonus."
"The second point is cultural cooperation."
"The exchange of scientists and politicians, as Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned a moment ago, is extremely important in our view. This Parliament should play a role in this, too."
"In addition, I should like to underline the role of the Asian-Europe Foundation in Singapore."
"I am in favour of renewing their mandate provided this is attended by the necessary financial resources."
"The third point is political dialogue: ASEM is the ideal forum for raising issues, including disturbing ones."
"We will be at the negotiating table with the People' s Republic of China and discussing its ban on the Falun Gong, and its system of arbitrary administrative detention and imprisonment for political reasons which is still in existence."
"All matters of this kind should very definitely be raised."
"Mr President, ASEM' s enlargement to include India, among other countries, is under discussion."
"In any event, Burma cannot be considered for this enlargement scheme."
"The treatment of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, since we have just talked about the British human rights activist James Maudsley, is more than enough evidence that we cannot enter into a dialogue with this regime at this stage."
"We would rather go into partnership with Taiwan, and it would be nice if the People' s Republic of China and the Republic of China could take a leaf out of the book of North and South Korea in their attempts at conciliation."
"Mr President, the forthcoming Europe - Asia Summit in Seoul offers a valuable framework for dialogue and the strengthening of political, economic and cultural cooperation between the two participating regions."
"There are several countries in East Asia which would like to see Europe step up its presence in the region."
"This in itself offers a very favourable basis for the gradual development of cooperation between the two regions."
"I would, however, urge all participants to reach a consensus on incorporating clear commitments in the principal documents in Seoul to respect human rights in the region."
"Greater attention must also be paid to child labour to guarantee that this practice can be eliminated as soon as possible both within Asia and elsewhere."
"Europe and Asia must work together to intensify the battle against drug trafficking, money laundering, international crime, terrorism and the sexual exploitation of minors."
"It is very important that an agreement is struck during the next round of World Trade Organisation talks between our two collective regions."
"On this latter point, I would like to state that Asia's fragile economic recovery is complicated by the region's delicate political situation."
"It is sometimes forgotten that the unprecedented period of economic growth over a quarter of a century in Asia was predicated on a sustained period of political and strategic stability."
"Much of this stability does not exist in the region at this time."
"The Korean peninsula is a source of continuing strategic instability."
"The rebuilding of East Timor is still an ongoing process."
"More Asian countries could play a role in providing additional aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of East Timor as a matter or urgency."
"Certainly much discussion is going to be needed to stabilise relations between the new Taiwanese government and the People's Republic of China."
"All interested parties should note that political stability must be in place before key economic developments can take place, and I wish all the participants in the conference in Seoul this month every success."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath suggested that there should be greater focus and emphasis on the European-Asian parliamentary dialogue."
"As Chairman of this Parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia I would very much welcome that."
"It is not sufficient that we only meet once every five or six years for a Parliamentary dialogue between the representatives of this Parliament and the representatives of India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Butan - these are just countries covered by the particular delegation that I happen to be Chairman of."
"I would appeal to Mrs Randzio-Plath, who has a strong input in the Budgetary Committee, to help provide the finances to enable this delegation - and others where such a step would be meaningful - to increase the frequency of these meetings."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to tell Mr Nassauer that while we must regret the fact that the European Union has a low profile in the countries of Asia, we must also admit our own responsibility to a certain extent and acknowledge our missed opportunities."
"For example, a month ago we voted on Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report on diplomacy and foreign policy."
"This report does not in fact deal with diplomacy and foreign policy but instead confines itself to tackling the question of the postgraduate training, if you will, of European diplomats, or future diplomats."
"Another missed opportunity."
"On the matter of ASEAN, we ought to ask ourselves what type of relations the European Union has or ought to have with ASEAN."
"Firstly, we cannot ignore the very different concepts of integration in the European Union and within ASEAN."
"There is no political integration, not even the prospect of political integration, between the ASEAN countries, nor should we forget, as I feel some previous speakers seem to have done, that the governments within ASEAN are all very different: we have totalitarian or dictatorial regimes, even hardline dictatorships like China, alongside democratic countries."
"It is not, therefore, surprising that there is, in this context, no real integration or genuine political dialogue."
"The European Union should perhaps look into the problem and return to good, sound bilateral relations which could be appreciably different according to whether they involved a democracy or a dictatorial or totalitarian regime."
"I also think that the optimism shown regarding the Korean reunification process is somewhat excessive."
"The one swallow that you might see in the summit between the President of the Korean Republic and the leader of the dictatorial regime of North Korea does not definitely mean that winter is over for the citizens of North Korea."
"Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the course of the last five years, somewhere between two and four million people have died of starvation under this idyllic regime."
"Similarly, I find it intolerable that the European Union, in its dialogue with Asia, should avoid the question of India, which is a democracy, with a population in the order of that of its neighbour on the other side, China, but not the same type of government, and which does not have the same special relationship with the European Union."
"Like Mr Maaten, I feel we cannot carry on ignoring the question of Taiwan for much longer, not just in the process underway between Taiwan and the People' s Republic of China, but also within international cooperation schemes, even though I am not one of those people who think that these are very effective."
"I therefore feel that we cannot continue to disregard this Chinese monster, which is slowly changing into a Communist dictatorship, a new, national Communist dictatorship."
"We have had a forty-year Cold War between the Soviet Union and the democratic world, and I think there is an urgent need to avoid wasting opportunities like these summits to lift the lid on this major problem."
"Finally, Mrs Randzio-Plath, I should like to say that if we wish to step up parliamentary cooperation, we can only do so with the democratic countries in this region, i.e. with countries that actually have parliaments."
"If there is to be any parliamentary cooperation at all, then it must be with such countries and not with the officials of the Communist Party of China or other countries in the region."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his input in this debate and for his sound plans."
"I very much back the idea of strengthening economic, cultural and political ties with ASEAN and ASEM."
"I also believe in involving the NGOs, mainstream society and the citizens of those countries."
"However, I would like to focus on the political contacts and comment on two countries in that area, namely Burma and Indonesia."
"Burma is without a doubt ruled by one of the world' s cruellest dictatorships."
"Ten years ago, a military regime pushed the elected President, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, out of office, dissolved parliament, drove out, imprisoned and even killed numerous members of parliament, and subsequently applied extreme terror in its treatment of the population and minorities."
"The European Union has taken a number of measures with regard to Burma, but to no avail."
"Not so long ago, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was once again restricted in her freedom, a number of key fellow party members were rounded up and Western human rights representatives found themselves in hot water in Burma."
"Nothing appears to be working."
"This is why, in line with previous EP resolutions, I should once again like to argue in favour of adopting a harder line in conjunction with the ASEAN and ASEM countries."
"I would now like to turn my attention to Indonesia, which is having difficulty moving back towards being a democratic constitutional state."
"Wahid' s government is of good will and is genuinely trying to undo old-style practices in the short term."
"But there are hardened opponents."
"These include corrupt members of the old Suharto clique and disloyal sections of the army, as well as paramilitary militia and aggressive Muslim fundamentalists."
"Meanwhile, Indonesia is dealing with a total of one million refugees internally, 130 000 of whom are in Timor and 300 000 on the Moluccan Islands."
"Especially in the Moluccas, where aggressive Muslim groups are spreading death and destruction, the situation is plainly disastrous."
"With more than 5 000 killed, tens of thousands wounded and more than 300 000 refugees, the large Moluccan community in the Netherlands - 50 000 EU citizens - is worried out of its mind."
"The European Union must support the democratic forces in Indonesia but at the same time fathom out how it can help Indonesia to defy the negative forces in Indonesia - certainly in the Moluccas, because so many Moluccan European citizens are so terribly worried."
"Mr President, I thank Commissioner Solbes for his statement."
"I sometimes feel that Asia, ASEAN and ASEM are the Cinderellas of Europe's foreign relations, receiving far less attention than they deserve on issues of industrial economic, financial, political and security matters."
"I welcome the promise that we have here to change that situation."
"I am not sure about the proposal for exchanging politicians - who would we get in exchange for Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen?"
"There are three main points I would like to make."
"Firstly, events in Seattle and Prague show that it is no longer possible for many of the key global issues to be negotiated behind closed doors by small groups isolated from daily life."
"I welcome the parallel ASEM People's Summit 2000 and the proposal in the compromise text that this should be institutionalised for future ASEM meetings."
"I also welcome the proposal for the re-establishment of the joint parliamentary meetings of MPs from the ASEM member countries."
"Secondly, like Mrs Maij-Weggen, I want to talk about Burma."
"I am very pleased that, while Burma is a member of ASEAN, it is not a member of ASEM and in the past ASEM has called for the restoration of democracy in that sad country."
"We continue to hope that the military regime in Burma will eventually recognise that the only way forward is by dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi rather than by confrontation."
"We hope that the Member States will continue to monitor that."
"Thirdly, this summit is being held on the Korean peninsula in Seoul."
"We have seen a historic breakthrough as vital as the ones we have seen in the past in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East, with Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il having the political courage to hold the first summit in this sadly divided peninsula."
"Yet we have seen recently in both Northern Ireland and the Middle East how fragile these peace initiatives can be."
"We urge the Commission, the Council and the ASEM member states, both from Asia and from Europe, to do what they can economically and politically to aid and assist this process further."
"Europe can play an important role as honest broker."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to say a few words to emphasise our great concern about Timor and to urge that this issue be specifically tabled on the agenda of the forthcoming summit."
"I am sure that we all remember the tribute paid here almost a year ago to Xanana Gusmão, who received the Sakharov Prize in this House."
"We have an ongoing responsibility to Xanana Gusmão, to what he stands for and to the people of Timor."
"Recently, the situation there has grown worse and, therefore, the tough message that I wish to convey to the Commission, and which I would like to see conveyed most forcefully to the Indonesian authorities, is that any positive developments in our relations with their country are dependent on Indonesia being able to provide effective guarantees for peace and freedom in Timor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three short suggestions about open dialogue."
"Firstly, a proposal for political dialogue."
"We have already spoken about Indonesia, East Timor and Burma."
"I would like to mention the situation between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan."
"I believe we should make it clear that the election of the new Taiwanese President is a historical opportunity to overcome the differences on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and we should do this."
"As Europeans we should also, at long last, have the courage to open the EU liaison office in Taipei, because Taiwan is a major economic force with which we have very close relations."
"But there is the matter of political dialogue."
"My second point is that we should be economically open, and we also have to tackle difficult topics sometimes."
"We should take the opportunity of being in Seoul to stress once again that the subsidies Korea grants to its shipyards are unacceptable."
"They put jobs throughout the EU at risk."
"It is not acceptable that we assisted Korea during the ASEAN crisis by means of IMF loans and suchlike, only for Korea still to be subsidising its shipyards, which is creating unjustifiable problems for our own shipyards."
"My third point is one that affects not only us but also the countries of Asia."
"As has already been mentioned, we need an interparliamentary dialogue, a dialogue between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the 10 Asian states."
"You quite rightly mentioned that one of the key points at the Asia-Europe Summit will be the wide-ranging dialogue, that is to say the expression of various different interests on the part of Europe and Asia."
"It is not acceptable for these interests only to be the subject of exchanges between governments and officials, with academics and journalists generously being allowed to participate."
"Members of Parliament also need to take part in this process - this is no longer a question of pure foreign policy."
"These are all political issues which significantly affect the situation in individual countries, and so Members of Parliament must be involved in this."
"When the Japanese Members of Parliament come to see us in Strasbourg in November, Mr President, we will ask them to see if the next meeting between Members of the European Parliament and Members of Parliament from the Asian countries can, if at all possible, be organised in Japan."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to the debate and make some brief comments."
"In the economic field, I must remind you that we have two action plans in place, one to aid commerce and the other to promote investments, both of which are very active."
"With regard to the social aspects, we proposed a new body at the time - the social forum - which would represent civil society."
"As I pointed out earlier in my presentation, the countries of Asia have not unfortunately been in favour of that proposal, which is something we regret."
"With regard to parliamentary cooperation, I would like to remind you that there have been two meetings: one in the Philippines and the other in Portugal, on cooperation between young parliamentarians, in which European parliamentarians have also taken part."
"We will consider any additional interparliamentary relations to be enormously positive."
"With regard to the comments on certain specific countries, I would like to point out the following: first, with regard to Myanmar, it is clear that it is not a participating nation in the ASEM process and nor is there any intention to admit it into that process."
"This situation is discussed every time there is political dialogue, and the circumstances are clearly not conducive to moving in that direction."
"As for India, I would like to remind you that there was a first summit between India and the European Union last July, outside the framework of the ASEM."
"With regard to Indonesia, which has also been an issue of special interest, there is regular dialogue, within the ASEM, in which we always insist on the need to promote the democratic process and, to this end, President Prodi has already sent a message to the Indonesian President so that progress may be made on this point."
"Our political support for Timor is clear and we provide what we consider to be significant humanitarian assistance."
"Lastly, with regard to the very topical problem of our relations with Korea and, in particular, in relation to the shipyards and subsidies for ship building, I would like to remind you that this is an issue which is outside the framework of the ASEM but which, nevertheless, is not a forgotten question in our relations with Korea."
"It is the subject of constant and tough discussion."
"These debates continued last week and I agree that the subsidies currently being granted are completely unacceptable."
"Mr President, I have not had any feedback on my comments regarding the Moluccan Islands in Indonesia, where problems are more serious than in Timor at the moment."
"There are 300 000 refugees, probably 10 000 killed and tens of thousands wounded."
"Surely the Moluccas cannot be overlooked in the ASEM negotiations."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner once again how it is intended to tackle this problem."
"Mr President, I simply wish to say that, when I referred to the promotion of the democratic process in Indonesia, I clearly meant all the problems relating to human rights and, especially, the issue of the Moluccas, which is a subject of particular and constant concern."
"Thank you for clearing up that matter."
"That concludes the debate."
"I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday."
"Seaports and inland ports"
"The next item is the recommendation for a second reading (A5-0232/2000), from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision amending Decision No. 1692/96/EC as regards seaports and inland ports as well as project No. 8 in Annex III (6658/1/2000 - C5-0271/2000 - 1997/0358(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Piecyk)."
"Mr President, I would like to make a general comment about the procedural position here, as it seems to me a classic example of how codecision should not be conducted."
"Following the first reading in Parliament, it took a year before we received the Council's common position, which takes almost no account at all of Parliament's views. And now, because of the timescales involved, such as the intervening summer recess, the situation is that Parliament has virtually no alternative but to repeat its position at first reading, with the result that we will all be merrily wending our way to the conciliation procedure."
"This really is not how the codecision procedure should be conducted, at least not in my opinion."
"I am directing this comment to the Council: since Amsterdam there has been an ever increasing flow of legislative work on transport in particular."
"We would save time, money and energy procedurally speaking if the Council could appreciate and accept that a common position is not the end point of the decision-making process."
"It is an important stage in that process, but the process then continues and it must then come before Parliament."
"What is this all about?"
"During the first trans-European network round, the issue of ports remained unresolved."
"At that time, the Commission undertook to prepare an appropriate proposal on ports."
"It has done that and has also extended the proposal to include not only seaports, but also inland ports and intermodal terminals, including Project No 8 of the 14 major projects in Essen, which is to be modified."
"Parliament has welcomed the Commission's approach of bringing together seaports, inland ports and terminals, because these are interrelated interconnection points in the transport network."
"The Council has only accepted certain parts of Parliament's proposals and totally departs from Parliament's criteria for interconnection points."
"I wish to concentrate on the most important aspects."
"First, seaports. Parliament would like the criteria here to be a traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes and 200 000 passengers, and also, as a vital and key criterion, a connection with another trans-European network."
"The Council wants a maximum of 1 million tonnes without a connection to other trans-European networks."
"However, this means that in my own dearly beloved Schleswig-Holstein, the region I come from, a place like Langballigau, which has at most one bridge and two bollards where a ship can tie up, has overnight turned into a European seaport, which is pure nonsense."
"Parliament simply cannot allow something like this to go through."
"In the case of inland ports, Parliament would like the criterion to be an annual traffic volume of 500 000 tonnes, as against the Council's criterion of just 300 000."
"The result is that an additional 200 smaller ports would be included. There would be so many and they would be so small you would need a magnifying glass to find them."
"That is not acceptable."
"I believe that if we are talking about a trans-European network, the seaports and inland ports involved should meet minimum requirements for European transport functions."
"Parliament has endorsed the inclusion of intermodal terminals, whereas the Council completely disagreed with this, although terminals will of course have a far more significant part to play in future European transport policy than they perhaps do at present."
"Ports are in competition with each other, and that is a good thing."
"But in order to guarantee a level playing field Parliament requested that we should not be promoting superstructure investments but, at most, investment in infrastructure."
"The Council has so far not been able to accept this basic concern, and neither has the Commission, by the way."
"So we must work together to find solutions that will ensure a level playing field in terms of infrastructure."
"One point that I welcome here is that the Council has evidently accepted the modification of Project No 8."
"Parliament is in agreement with this."
"However, this also means that the Council has finally accepted that codecision should also apply to the 14 important Essen projects."
"Whatever we agree tomorrow will ultimately have to go into the conciliation procedure."
"I would specifically like to acknowledge the French Presidency's efforts to establish a common approach at this early stage."
"The Council is being somewhat obstructive here."
"My thanks also go to the Commission's officials, who have already been very helpful on this."
"Nevertheless, it would have been good if everything could have proceeded a little faster than it has in the event."
"And last but not least I would like to thank my fellow Members in the committee, who have all pulled in the same direction."
"I would like to comment on Amendment No 15."
"The peripheral areas have been omitted from the English translation again, it is the original German version that applies."
"I hope that the Sittings Service will put this right so that the peripheral areas are once again referred to in all versions."
"And I would once again like to sincerely thank my colleagues in the committee for their cooperation."
"I hope that after tomorrow's vote we will be able to move promptly on to the conciliation procedure and not drag things out for the full six weeks."
"Mr Piecyk, I took note of your opening remarks about conciliation."
"I hope you will be able to come along to the seminar on 6 and 7 November, when you might wish to make those points."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk."
"He has consistently re-presented what we jointly agreed upon at first reading."
"He has translated it into a clear and easily understandable report."
"The main theme of this report is that if we are looking at European ports as part of the trans-European network, then we need a policy which provides for ports relevant to Europe's needs to be incorporated into that network."
"And they can only be relevant to Europe's needs if they are connected to other transport systems in the trans-European network."
"Furthermore, the small amount of support that we give to trans-European networks must in that case, of course, also be directed to port infrastructure and not just towards port superstructure."
"This report is quite clear on that point."
"The corresponding amendments were also unanimously adopted in committee."
"I would like to comment on two additional points."
"If we do not concentrate on those ports that are really relevant to export and intra-Community trade, then we will face a situation in which all ports, including all yachting harbours, are classified as European ports. In that case the greatest danger would be a scattergun approach, not concentrating resources."
"This is also recognised in our regional policy, which Commissioner Barnier has referred to."
"We must point the way, but we can only do that if we support key projects in a truly consistent way instead of adopting a scattergun approach and subsidising all and sundry."
"My second point is about the competitive situation not only between ports, but also within a single port."
"So if we were all allowed to provide state aid for buildings, van carriers and so on, there would be unacceptable competition between private and state companies operating at the same port, and also between different ports."
"That is why we need a clear pan-European policy on ports which really does respect competition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, this report on the Council' s common position by our fellow Member Mr Piecyk, in its final version as adopted by the parliamentary committee, is indeed a very serious piece of work; it makes a number of fundamental proposals with a view to including intermodal terminals in the network, applying equal terms to all ports as regards the eligibility of investments, applying stricter criteria and conditions for including seaports in the trans-European network and supporting inland ports."
"There are, therefore, what would appear to be reasonable increases in freight and passenger traffic volume thresholds."
"Of course, putting each type of proposed measure on an equal footing will cause problems unless objective requirements are also put on an equal footing."
"For example, as regards the subject under discussion, an extensive hinterland which is currently served by a large number of ports could start channelling traffic to just a few of them in order to ensure that they meet the more stringent eligibility criteria."
"If, for example, there are two ports, one could be promoted over the other."
"However, if a relatively small or medium-sized island is currently served by just one port, how is it supposed to increase its traffic?"
"Objectively-speaking, it cannot do so; is it therefore right that a country with a lot of islands which necessarily has many such ports cannot benefit from the same advantages for its port infrastructure?"
"And what about the cohesion we are all fighting for?"
"And the provision in the Amsterdam Treaty for the special treatment which island regions obviously require?"
"My speaking time is running out, Mr President, and I shall finish there; but before I do, as we are debating shipping, I too should like to express my deep-felt sorrow at the loss of life of our fellow human beings who were travelling on one of the many ships needed to serve the many Greek islands, which obviously therefore require a great deal of specific interest on our part."
"This interest needs to be manifested constantly as there will always be numerous islands with natural features which we cannot change."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I wish to thank the rapporteur for some very thorough work with regard to this important issue."
"The purpose of the trans-European networks is to link up different regions of the EU, so that the common market may function effectively."
"The rapporteur, however, has viewed the matter mainly from the angle of large ports."
"The number of tonnes given for freight are important, but they do not always tell the whole truth."
"The kind of freight also has a decisive impact on volume."
"In the peripheral regions ports are particularly important, although the volume of freight and number of passengers are smaller than in central areas."
"For example, the proposal to raise the volume in tonnes of freight to 1.5 million in respect of seaports and to change the classification of ports will not, in the opinion of our group, serve the development of the trans-European networks."
"This would mean that the ports in the TENs would be concentrated on the densely populated central areas, and many sparsely populated peripheral regions would accordingly remain outside the TENs."
"The other travesty here is that only international traffic is included in passenger numbers for TEN ports."
"For example, ferry traffic between Scotland and Northern Ireland accounts for 1.8 million passengers a year, but these ports would remain outside the TEN if just international traffic were to be included."
"This service is not just important as a link between Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it is also important for the Irish Republic."
"Smaller, important ports and the Union' s internal passenger traffic must also be taken better account of. For that reason, our group opposes Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10, among others."
"In this respect the Council' s position would serve the development of trans-European networks more effectively."
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words, first of all thanks to Mr Piecyk, who had to finish this report in a very short space of time, and who burnt the midnight oil more than once in the process."
"The Green Group has a love-hate relationship with transport."
"After all, transport creates pollution but there are certain modes of transport which create more pollution than others."
"This means that we do not wholeheartedly endorse all elements of the TENs, but we do if they involve the development of the less polluting alternatives, for example the development of ports, the development and promotion of inland shipping and the use of intermodal terminals."
"With regard to that element of those ports, if you consider the Council' s viewpoint on ports - and this has been put in more than one way - the quantitative criterion used is, in my opinion, too sweeping and too vague, which results in a situation in which some ports in the German Wadden area and some in the Netherlands, such as the port of Scheveningen, which is a small fishing port, have now been elevated to the status of ports which would be required to play a role in the trans-European network."
"This is simply taking things too far, in my book."
"In this sense, I wholeheartedly support the rapporteur' s view, but I should add that, actually, if you look for something which is also lacking in the Council' s position, then I would say that the Council is underplaying the significance of intermodal terminals and, above all, the multimodal terminals, for they are much talked about in this Chamber."
"As a result, we are lacking the qualitatively sound arguments for incorporating ports, often located on the fringes - as was mentioned a moment ago - into this scheme."
"In addition to the quantitative criteria, a number of qualitative criteria will need to be developed."
"But we will soon be entering conciliation when we will need to consider this issue in depth."
"I am delighted that at least the rapporteur has put this intermodal transport - Mr Jarzembowski worded it very well - very much on the agenda."
"I believe that this will become one of the bones of contention which we will hopefully - with or without a conference - be able to bring to a successful conclusion."
"I am extremely pleased that, in addition to this, all of the reports on strategic effects have been included."
"I hope that they will not be the sacrificial lamb of the conciliation procedure."
"As for the superstructure and its funding, I can understand very well why we are not incorporating superstructure, the definition of which is, in fact, far from agreed, into a non-transparent and vague financing method for ports."
"The port structure and its correct definition is the first step, a superstructure the second."
"In my view, we should be looking at how we can add more detail in the meantime."
"Mr President, the European Union boasts great variety, yet we have a tendency to centralise everything and make it uniform."
"This is once again illustrated by Mr Piecyk' s report on seaports and inland ports."
"This report and these amendments, in fact, deal with a number of very different situations."
"As before, when we were discussing reports on marine pollution and air traffic, we need to draw a distinction between North and South, large and small, and policy which is driven by profit and that which is driven by environmental considerations."
"It is therefore not easy to use the same yardstick to assess all ports across the European Union."
"According to some, the report and its amendments enable small ports to strengthen their position, ports which are indispensable for the accessibility and survival of islands and remote coastal areas."
"Based on this viewpoint, every small port and every ferry port which handles a great deal of tourist traffic should feature on the European list."
"Port policy would then mainly focus on offering support to peripheral regions."
"However, in Europe' s most densely populated area around the North Sea and the Channel, there are major ports, including that of my home town, Rotterdam."
"They are caught up in a bitter competitive battle, partly brought on by the fact that they are offering as many facilities as possible to transport companies at the lowest possible rates."
"Rotterdam wants to remain the world' s largest port and competes with Le Havre, Dunkirk, Zeebrugge, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Bremen and Hamburg for the same cargo volumes."
"There is even a notion that Rotterdam should be a ""mainport"" where all goods reaching the European west coast from other continents must be transhipped to vessels which distribute them to the surrounding ports."
"Other large ports too are striving for growth and dominance."
"This competitive battle is at the expense of the environment and at the expense of the financial elbowroom of the large cities."
"European port policy should be able to do something about this and should be able to distribute the cargo volumes over a larger area."
"Unfortunately, I have not been able to find initiatives to this effect in any of the proposals."
"Mr President, the trans-European networks are intended to link the different regions of the European Union, not only as a means of transport, but also as a way of sharpening the competitive edge and hence of increasing employment in certain regions."
"The emphasis is on routes between different Member States."
"Logically, this means that attention will be focused on projects with cross-border implications."
"The transport situations within the different Member States are far from identical."
"Whereas in the southern Member States, road and rail are the key modes of continental transport, the more northerly countries prefer to rely mainly on water transport."
"Against this background, it goes without saying that the TENs mirror these modes of transport and the interaction between them."
"Moreover, those modalities which cause least harm in terms of space and the environment must be included in the TENs without fail."
"This is my frame of reference for Mr Piecyk' s report which deals with the position of ports in the TENs."
"Very often, seaports are the first and last ports of call for cargo in Europe."
"The link with the hinterland can be made in different ways."
"This means that virtually all goods which pass through those seaports must change mode of transport at least once."
"Transhipment and, along with this, transhipment terminals are what are needed."
"Ruling these terminals out in the TENs certainly does not benefit any mode of transport."
"I therefore subscribe to the rapporteur' s views in this respect without any hesitation."
"In order to ensure that TENs are used for what they were set up for and in order to maintain an overview of them all, it is impossible to include all EU ports in the network."
"A certain minimum number is therefore inevitable."
"In my opinion, the criteria formulated by the rapporteur in this respect fit in best within the framework requested by the EP."
"In summary, the rapporteur has made proposals which I hope the Council will take to heart."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his good report."
"I am not going to highlight the parts of the report on which we agree, but I would like to point out a couple of issues which worry me and also worry certain other Members."
"Firstly, I must say that I come from a group of islands in the Mediterranean - as the rapporteur well knows - and we have the impression that the large ports are being promoted, mainly the northern ports as opposed to the southern ports."
"The small ports, and mainly the ports in the outlying regions and the islands, are rather being left out of this promotion of marine transport."
"What I would like to see in this case is recognition for example, that it would be beneficial to apply to the ports the division which is carried out in the case of airports of different categories so that we can concentrate, not on the categories of ports, but on the specific projects."
"That is to say, the project that is being presented, its objectives and all the actions implemented within that project."
"I believe that would be the right approach."
"In our case, in the Balearic Islands - I come from Palma de Mallorca - the port of Palma would be included in the proposals in Mr Piecyk' s report, but other ports in the same islands would be left out and this would lend support to air transport."
"Air transport would become the best way to transport goods and passengers to certain islands and outlying regions."
"We are currently trying to promote marine transport as an alternative to air transport, and this is therefore an issue to be considered."
"Having made these points, which are differences of opinion rather than disagreements, it only remains for me to express our support for this report and to congratulate the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, on his rapid and wonderful work and I would like to point out that I have just received a report from Friends of the Earth which makes a comparative study which I consider to be of interest."
"The distance from the port of Pasajes, in the Basque Country, to Vlissingen, in Holland, is approximately the same whether one travels by sea, road or rail."
"A cargo of cars and caravans can easily be transported on a small ship of two thousand tonnes, instead of the 204 lorries or 7 trains with 102 wagons which would be required to transport the same load."
"The results of the three systems, with regard to total external costs, in terms of road congestion, accidents, noise, atmospheric pollution and climate change, vary considerably: EUR 74 000 for the ship, EUR 130 000 for the lorries and EUR 99 000 for the railway."
"I believe we should draw the conclusion that sea transport is the most appropriate solution and it should receive public resources as a priority. I also agree that we should select the most important ports - as Mr Piecyk points out - as well as those which conform to intermodality and, above all, the ports which allow us to make the greatest savings in terms of environmental costs."
"With regard to the other conclusions of the report, I agree with Mr Piecyk that the Council' s position is more restrictive."
"Some will consider it to be broader, but I believe that it is more restrictive in relation to the effective use of European funds intended for that purpose."
"I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has produced a major report in a short space of time."
"It has already been pointed out by almost all those who have spoken that, in effect, the situation with regard to transport - particularly sea transport - and seaports differs widely throughout our Union: the situation in northern countries differs from that in southern countries, in terms of dimensions and the volume of freight and passenger traffic."
"However, if we wish - and we do, for we consider it absolutely essential - sea and river ports to be included in the system of trans-European networks and to have their own system, then we must by necessity establish a hierarchy and a classification list for this system."
"Now, I come from a country which boasts 8 000 km of coastline and would therefore benefit greatly from having as many of its ports as possible included in the ""European port"" category."
"However, we have to be prepared to stick our necks out and take what could be difficult decisions for the very reason that, if the strategies selected do not genuinely identify areas and ports with these characteristics, we will be in danger, considering, amongst other things, the lack of funding - we shall have to talk about this in any case for only EUR 400 million are available - we will be in danger of undoing any good work, in danger, that is, of being ineffective."
"One issue remains to be resolved - which I consider important and which other Members have raised and should therefore be at the centre of the conciliation process - and that is the issue of the islands and the outermost regions: in other words, the issue of those situations in which, even where a port does not meet the volume criteria we have laid down, its activity cannot be allowed to suffer as a result."
"Mr President, since the trans-European networks came into existence, I have been championing waterways and shipping, so you will not be surprised if I now express a slightly different point of view."
"Where competition is concerned, the market plays the key role in the development of seaports."
"That much we are all agreed upon, and we should not interfere with that base."
"I therefore request as a matter of urgency, even if Georg Jarzembowski is sitting next to me, that Parliament should reconsider its decision of March last year."
"Parliament wants the criterion to be an annual freight traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes, but it is ridiculous to ignore the potential of ports with a volume of at least 1 million tonnes, especially if they meet the strategic requirements of the trans-European networks."
"We should therefore have faith in market forces and give smaller ports a chance too."
"We want to promote short sea shipping, but that means we also need smaller ports, which have a valuable role to play here."
"They act as interconnection points, small ones perhaps but important interconnection points."
"And are you telling me that you want to argue about half a million tonnes and exclude smaller ports?"
"What would a minimum traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes achieve?"
"According to the documents I have it would mean excluding 30 European ports, above all those in peripheral areas or coastal areas that are structurally weak."
"That cannot be in our interest."
"Investment in the trans-European network only makes sense if we create genuine networks covering wide areas and bringing advantages for the public throughout the European Union."
"A forward-looking maritime strategy should not be exclusive, it should be inclusive."
"I therefore ask the rapporteur and the others who have spoken to give this their learned support."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Piecyk for his work."
"The issue of inland ports and intermodal terminals is very complex and I would like to stress that a broad consensus has been achieved."
"We all agree that the trans-European network must be a multimodal network."
"We also believe that we all agree that it must include the main points of connection, and that we consider that the current provisions of the trans-European networks on ports are not satisfactory and that strengthening the role of ports within the network will also serve to consolidate the trans-European networks."
"I believe that Parliament and the Commission broadly agree on most of the areas under discussion."
"We agree that the inclusion of too many ports in the network may affect this concept of 'trans-European' and that, therefore, the most strategically important inland ports should be included."
"I also believe that Parliament and the Commission agree that inland terminals are an important part of the network and play a fundamental role in the whole process."
"We are not discussing economic aid today, but I would like to mention on this point that we believe that this economic support should be utilised correctly and not be directed towards superstructure projects which may, at the end of the day, have a negative effect on competition."
"Nevertheless, there are certain points on which it will be difficult to make progress, since, while we can make progress between Parliament and the Commission, we should not forget the fundamental role of the Council in this decision-making process."
"I shall make some comments about the main amendments."
"Amendment No 4: to increase the threshold for inland ports from 300 to 500 tonnes."
"This proposal is perfectly acceptable to the Commission."
"Mr Piecyk' s report justifies this idea by saying that the trans-European networks should not have to include an excessive number of installations."
"For the Commission, the ideal solution would be to only include ports which, as well as complying with these limits, are equipped with transhipment facilities."
"We believe that this point of view is not accepted by the Council, but we consider that the quantity is not sufficient in itself."
"We believe that we have to introduce both qualitative and quantitative elements."
"Seaports: Amendments Nos 5, 9 and 10."
"We could also accept the idea of increasing the threshold to one and a half million tonnes or two hundred thousand passengers and we could also agree to the removal of classifications by categories implemented by the Council."
"This point will certainly be the subject of further debate by the Council."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 7 reintroduce the map of inland terminals and are acceptable to the Commission."
"However, we believe that the most important issue is to highlight the fact that inland terminals are an integral part of the network, and it does not seem relevant to us whether they appear on a map or not."
"We consider that to be a problem of secondary importance."
"The important thing is clearly that they form part of the network."
"We feel that perhaps the intermediate solution could be to abandon the map of intermodal terminals and draw up more precisely, more thoroughly, if you like, the guidelines emphasising that intermodal terminals form part of the network, and not to enter into a debate on the map, which would make things more difficult."
"The problem of superstructures excluded from Community funding: Amendments Nos 8 and 10."
"The Commission can also support these amendments and it is true that, nevertheless, we believe that this debate may raise some difficulties."
"We support the aim of the amendments but, nevertheless, we cannot support their wording."
"On the one hand, because we believe it is inappropriate to talk about the funding of these guidelines and, secondly, because we do not believe it is necessary to make this reference."
"It is the case that the types of project which Parliament is referring to when it talks of superstructures are not included in the projects of common interest and do not therefore have funding."
"This is therefore, to a certain extent, an unnecessary debate."
"A comment on Amendment No 15: as an objective, this amendment is acceptable to the Commission."
"We believe that the idea is correct, although we believe that here also we should analyse the wording with a little more care in order to prevent problems."
"Lastly, with regard to Community spending and public aid and the issue involving competences, we believe that it is also important, that it should be debated in the future and, to this end, we believe that we should work to reach a solution on this and the other remaining problems, taking account of the interests of all parties, and we believe that agreement is possible on the basis of Parliament' s excellent work."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"National and international road traffic"
"The next item is the report by Mr Hatzidakis (A5-0231/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic [COM(2000) 137 - C5-0164/2000 - 2000/0060(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is a highly technical subject, aspects of which affect the daily life of European citizens, not to mention the single market itself."
"In the current situation, the legal limits for the maximum authorised length of passenger vehicles are very different in the EU Member States."
"In 7 countries, the limit is 12 metres, in one country it is 13.7 metres, in two other countries it is 14.5 metres and in 5 others, it is 15 metres."
"This legal limit has not explicitly been harmonised at a European level since it was not included in Directive 96/53."
"Up to now, only 12-metre buses can circulate freely in the whole EU territory."
"On a request from the Council of Ministers, the Commission has worked on a proposal to include passenger vehicles in Directive 96/53, not only in order to harmonise the length of rigid buses but also to create a clearer situation regarding removable attachments on buses and trailers."
"This work resulted in the present proposal."
"I should point out that, even in countries in which 15-metre buses are officially allowed, in practice they are refused entry or are sent back at the border."
"In this sense, we can say that this proposal is an attempt to resolve the problem by introducing single market rules for the whole of the European Union."
"Obviously, the length of buses is dictated by commercial considerations."
"A 15-metre bus can take about 67 passengers, i.e. 16 more than a 12-metre bus."
"Obviously, competitive considerations push some operators in the direction of longer buses."
"In cases where full-loaded buses can circulate, it is preferable, for environmental reasons, to use longer buses."
"Finally, this proposal creates a clearer situation as to the removable attachments on buses, mostly ski boxes, which have to be included in the total authorised length."
"I personally agree with the compulsory three axles on buses longer than 12 metres, which are likely to exceed the maximum permissible weight per axle."
"Three axles give better circulating conditions and cause less wear on roads."
"Other proposed measures, like considering the maximum length of a bus and trailer as the same as a truck and trailer, are also satisfactory."
"The total of all of these is a maximum of 18.75 metres."
"It should be noted that, from 1 January 2000, the maximum width of buses was increased from 2.50m to 2.55m."
"Adaptations of the maximum length of rigid buses will very probably bring about a demand for a similar change in legislation for rigid trucks designed to transport goods, although there may be not an overwhelming demand for such vehicles."
"Key criteria to ensure manoeuvrability of buses are the turning circle and the outswing."
"These criteria are set out in Directive 97/27/EC relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers."
"Although this directive allows derogation by the Member States, it is important to stick, at the European level, to these criteria, which should apply also to the longer rigid buses as proposed in this directive."
"The reason is that buses - both inner-city buses and coaches - often have to operate in narrow streets in city centres during the rush hours, when many other vehicles, motorbikes, bikes, and pedestrians are on the road."
"If there are problems for 15-metre buses to circulate in some places, such as historic town centres, narrow streets etc., local or national authorities should indicate the restrictions, which have to be observed;"
"I think this is a satisfactory arrangement."
"I should like to refer to three amendments adopted in committee."
"The first makes provision for a transitional period during which the use within national territory of buses which are currently permitted but do not comply with the new requirements of the directive will be allowed."
"If this period were to end on 31 December 2009, it would be very short, given that it would severely limit the service life of buses longer than 12 metres which are already licensed."
"The effect would be to impose unacceptable financial burdens on businesses which had registered or introduced vehicles in good faith before the entry into force of the new directive."
"The second amendment states that it ought to be made clear that these provisions apply to rigid buses, not articulated buses."
"Increasing the maximum authorised length of buses with two axles is intended to make it possible to use removable attachments such as ski boxes on 12-metre buses."
"This increase will also challenge bus manufacturers to use alternative materials and designs to reduce the weight of the vehicle, so that buses which are longer than 12 metres but well under 15 metres can also be manufactured and registered as two-axle vehicles."
"The third amendment concerns removable attachments, such as ski boxes, and cornering."
"It sets different requirements from the directive because it considers that application of the proposal submitted by the working group for transport to amend the Directive 96/53 with regard to the measuring method and the limit values for outswing would result in the maximum length of buses being limited to 14.6 metres."
"This is contrary to the length of buses with at least three axles set in Article 1 of the directive."
"Buses would be 40 centimetres shorter."
"As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I cannot agree with Amendment No 4 by the Liberals because, as I said to the Commission, it is not in keeping with the spirit of the directive."
"As far as Amendment No 6 proposed by the Socialists is concerned, I can consent to this straight away."
"As regards the other two amendments proposed by the Socialists, Amendments Nos 5 and 7, calling for derogations of up to two years, I consider the transitional period to be excessive."
"I would appreciate clarification from the Socialists and from the Commission before taking a stance, but a two-year transitional period seems excessive to me."
"I might perhaps be able to discuss a shorter period of time if, of course, the Commission agrees."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by offering my thanks to bus manufacturers, operators and drivers."
"When it comes to road safety and environmental sustainability, they are first-rate."
"Two and a half years ago the European Commission published a report on the use of 15-metre buses and coaches, in which it referred not only to distortions in competition between transport companies in various EU Member States, but also, I am pleased to say, offered prospects of greater safety and improved comfort."
"Today, we finally have before us a directive to this effect, one that I have been calling for on an almost monthly basis since then."
"Particularly in view of the present heightening of distortions in competition because of unilateral decisions by many Member States on energy pricing, as a result of which Europe has lost credibility in the eyes of a large section of the public, we urgently need to point the way here."
"Let us give some positive signals: first by harmonising permissible maximum lengths for rigid buses and rigid bus-trailer combinations, secondly, by clarifying the situation as regards removable attachments such as luggage trailers and skiboxes, and thirdly, by bringing the cornering test in line with scientific and technical progress and also with the current version of the ECE Regulation, which has been tried and tested since 1996."
"Furthermore, it is totally in the spirit of subsidiarity that Member States are to be granted a long transitional period, up to 2015 to be precise, during which the use within national territory of buses which are currently permitted but do not yet comply with the new requirements of the directive will be allowed."
"And of course local and regional authorities remain at liberty to impose restrictions on 15-metre buses in places where there are traffic management problems, such as narrow streets in historical town centres."
"However, national protectionist measures going beyond this are not acceptable."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and to congratulate him, and I ask you to vote for Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 6."
"Mr President, I broadly welcome this proposal because it completes the former directive, it helps to avoid unfair competition and it takes account of safety issues."
"But we are concerned because we would prefer to be making progress on more environmentally-friendly forms of transport, such as railways, rather than continuing to increase road capacity."
"As far as the amendments are concerned, we support the transitional periods for buses still running, that is, Amendment No 1, and also for industry, to enable industry to comply with the new conditions."
"I would say to Mr Hatzidakis that the 24 months for industry is less than was allowed in the original 1996 directive when the transitional period was four years."
"This time, industry is happy with two years."
"They do not have to take it up, it is there in case they require that amount of time."
"In addition, we are in favour of the proposal to keep buses of more than 12, but less than 15, metres with two axles, still serving public transport in some Member States, since this does not, as far as we are concerned, jeopardise safety."
"Finally, we strongly support the Commission's position on Article 1.3b which corresponds to Annex 1.1, 1.4 and 1.5 of the 1996 directive."
"We believe this is the best guarantee for safety."
"The PSE Group does not support Amendment No 3, as the proposed new test does not ensure proper manoeuvrability and does not therefore fully meet acceptable safety requirements."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the objective of the directive before us is to ensure that, in future, buses can circulate freely in the whole EU territory; this is a sound initiative which is backed by my group."
"The ELDR Group also welcomes the principle that longer buses which have a maximum length of 15 metres and which also have to meet the same safety and weight standards should now be allowed in all Member States."
"For the free movement of goods and services, it is necessary for matters of this kind to be harmonised in the transport sector too and for industry to be able to rely on there being a level playing field."
"In our eyes, the opportunity created by this directive of introducing longer buses on international routes is efficient."
"It is also profitable."
"More capacity makes transport more efficient in the operational sphere, and this means that both transport company and consumer stand to gain from this."
"Longer buses also make a more efficient use of roads possible and this means that the environment benefits."
"Despite this, my group also has reservations about the proposal, namely with regard to Article 1(3a)."
"There is also the risk of over-regulation, which is the case, in our view, with the obligation for all buses longer than 12 metres to be fitted with three axles, irrespective of the use made of those buses."
"In our opinion, this constitutes an infringement of the freedom of the manufacturer who must be able to decide, in consultation with the customer, how many axles are required to meet the safety standards and demands in terms of weight, because by no means do all buses and coaches carry the same load; think of VIP coaches, for example."
"This means, in practice, that the running costs must not be compromised unnecessarily by fitting a third axle, which is not necessary, strictly speaking."
"As many seemed in agreement with this during the committee meeting, I have, on behalf of my group, re-tabled the amendment to this effect."
"Mr President, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur who managed to add more definition to the directive and give it more practical relevance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are debating the subject of buses and the fact that different practices were applied in a number of European countries with permitted lengths ranging from 12 metres to even 15 metres."
"Apart from anything else, it is useful to harmonise this area as far as possible."
"The previous speaker mentioned a few beneficial effects this may have in terms of efficiency, safety and the environment."
"This is exactly where there is room for improvement."
"Environmental standards are of course being applied to certain modes of transport, in this case road transport."
"The European standards for trucks spring to mind, which can bring about a shift in the relationship between road and, for example, rail in terms of environmental benefits."
"It is not always the case, however, not by a long chalk, that these standards are applied."
"If we consider for a moment the subject of longer buses and the environment, then a situation can arise, as depicted by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, of cheaper and more efficient transport where small businesses may have greater earnings in this field and make more profit. However, prices drop which inevitably means that buses are used as an extremely cheap mode of transport, as is very much in evidence at the moment."
"In other words, I can condone the lengthening of buses based on environmental and other considerations, but there are also a number of side-effects which are being overlooked, in fact, by this directive and which cannot be dealt with here either, but to which we would like draw attention."
"Giving industry some space to catch up seems justified in my opinion."
"Three axles, as Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte indicated, are not always necessary, but what is necessary is to draft a sound directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly credit must go to Mr Hatzidakis for his proactive approach in his report."
"European bus measurements may seem a trivial matter, but it is no such thing."
"Our objective of a dynamic single market can only come about if all players comply with the same regulations."
"Competition, which is a prime mover in the arena of real development, will begin when transport companies can offer cross-border services."
"There are no Greek bus companies in our country, Finland, but the Scots have already got a firm foothold."
"Stinginess pays off."
"In order to continue the positive spread of competition we must harmonise bus standards."
"Uniform measurements will also mean cost saving for manufacturers, which will be reflected in fares and the pockets of EU citizens."
"The present directive is inadequate because it leads to too much diversity with regard to buses in the various Member States, which will make the drafting of safety standards difficult."
"The tragic news from Greece recently unquestionably obliges us to address the matter of creating and complying with safety regulations."
"The Commission is right in its proposal to allow 15-metre buses."
"The more people there are on the bus, the cheaper it will be to travel, to say nothing of the atmosphere that increases exponentially as the number of passengers grows."
"The use of long buses is furthermore recommended for environmental reasons."
"If we support group travel it will reduce congestion in built-up areas. A few half-empty cars take up the space of one bus carrying sixty people."
"The rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, is right that it would be unfair to call for the transition period with regard to buses already in operation in domestic traffic to end by 2009."
"People will not feel favourably disposed towards the EU if we start scrapping buses that are still in perfectly good condition, before their time."
"At the same time we would easily destroy the belief the entrepreneur and the man in the street have in the common sense of EU decision-makers."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Hatzidakis for the excellent work he has carried out on this proposal of great technical complexity."
"The Commission is pleased that the report points out the need to seek a balance between the commercial aspects and those linked to competition and, at the same time, guarantees technical progress on the one hand and safety on the other."
"We share these objectives, of course."
"The aim of the text is clear and has already been mentioned here: to establish a uniform regulation for the dimension of rigid buses in transport services."
"The current legislation is very varied, very disparate, and there seems to be a clear need for harmonisation."
"In order to fully understand what I am going to say with regard to the Commission' s reaction to the various amendments, it should be made clear that the proposal, in our view, aims to authorise a maximum length of 15 metres throughout the European Union, provided that two requirements are complied with: firstly, that buses of between 12 and 15 metres have three axles - an important issue which I will discuss later and which has led to some debate - and, secondly, that buses are manoeuvrable, that is to say, that their manoeuvrability is in accordance with Community legislation."
"Let us start with the first requirement: the three axles."
"The problem of the three axles, in the Commission' s view, is fundamental if we wish to guarantee that, despite the size of these buses, the weight is distributed evenly and does not create problems for the road infrastructures."
"This is the fundamental point."
"We can understand that there may be a debate on whether all buses are the same or not, but we believe that excess detail in relation to specific solutions would, at the end of the day, be the worst formula."
"We believe that the three axles for buses of over 12 metres represent the simplest formula, which will best resolve the problems."
"That is the reason why Amendments Nos 2 and 4, which seek to reduce that requirement by establishing that the third axle is only obligatory in the case of buses of more than thirteen and a half or even 15 metres, are not acceptable to the Commission."
"We believe that that would have negative effects - as we have said previously - on the infrastructures."
"The second requirement of our proposal is that the buses pass a specific manoeuvrability test."
"What manoeuvrability test?"
"Well, the same conditions that are currently laid down in Directive 97/27, which also link this test to manufacturing standards."
"We believe that this is a key point and it is also the reason why the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3, since it seeks to establish different standards of manoeuvrability, which are less rigorous that those that currently exist."
"They would clearly be easier to comply with, but they would introduce risks from the point of view of the safety of this type of vehicle."
"Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are not acceptable to the Commission either."
"In both cases, they seek to have the directive enter into force at a later date."
"This clearly presents practical problems in the sense that, if we want to accelerate the construction of the internal market, anything which speeds up the process is positive, while delays, on the other hand, would create serious difficulties."
"Accepting Amendment No 6 would also cause certain problems, since we do not consider that it has sufficient technical justification."
"Nevertheless, it does seem reasonable that buses of 15 metres, which are already authorised and which do not conform to the above-mentioned requirements, that is to say, the three axles and manoeuvrability, nevertheless should benefit from a transitional period and that that transitional period should be longer than the one initially laid down. The original proposal was a period lasting until 2009."
"The Commission considers that that exemption is perhaps excessively restrictive and we could accept the idea that the directive would allow them to stay in use until 2015."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Germany today celebrates the tenth anniversary of its reunification."
"Something that had seemed impossible just a few years previously has become reality."
"This reunification, made possible by the fall of the Berlin Wall the year before, was not only of great significance to the Germans, but also, to the whole of Europe as it symbolised reconciliation between the East and the West after 40 years of cold war."
"I would like to express, on behalf of Parliament, our shared pleasure with our friends in Germany in celebrating this anniversary."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, yesterday we decided - and this is also recorded in the Minutes - to hold a debate on Thursday on developments in the Middle East."
"However, we did not set a deadline for tabling motions for resolutions."
"I would request that we set such a deadline, both for the actual motions - this could be today at 6 p.m. and for amendments, where we should try to set the deadline for as late as possible tomorrow, so that we can take into account any results from the meeting between Ehud Barak and Yassir Arafat tomorrow in Paris."
"I would ask that we set this deadline and that it be as late as possible."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has requested that the debate on the situation regarding the Middle East Peace Process, that was timetabled for Thursday afternoon, be closed with a motion for a resolution."
"I will now put this request to the vote."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Preparation for the informal European Council in Biarritz of 13/14 October/Charter of Fundamental Rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparations for the informal Biarritz European Council (IGC) of 13 and 14 October 2000, and the following oral questions:"
"B5-0538/2000, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to the Council, and"
"B5-0539/2000, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to the Commission,"
"on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you expressed the wish that we should devote our efforts today to the forthcoming European Council meeting in Biarritz, and this will indeed be an important milestone in this half-year Presidency of the Council."
"You will all be aware that the European Council is now in the habit of meeting, or rather of almost always meeting, twice every six months, and this arrangement would seem to meet a real need, even if - or perhaps I should say especially if - this additional meeting is an informal one, as will be the case in Biarritz."
"In fact, the informal nature of these summits, far from limiting their scope, actually enables delicate issues to be openly discussed at the very highest level."
"The agenda at Biarritz will, as such, comprise two major questions which I know are of concern to the European Parliament: the Intergovernmental Conference on Institutional Reform and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"With regard to the date, this too has been chosen with a view to guaranteeing that this Summit is as productive as possible."
"The Biarritz Council of 13 and 14 October will come roughly halfway through our presidency; so work will already be well underway, without any compromises having been reached, and the time will have come to take stock and put down a marker with a view to the Nice European Council."
"As you can see, the aim will therefore not be to discuss every issue, which would not have made a great deal of sense."
"However, the French Presidency seems to have attained cruising speed, and would appear to have made completely satisfactory progress on the matters in hand;"
"I am aware that certain observers have been critical, but they doubtless expected too much from us - and this is flattering, but at the same time does not suit us, since a presidency is always too short - only totalling four productive months, I would remind you - and have forgotten that this presidency, just like any other, is subject to many serious constraints."
"Certain events which have received ample coverage in the press have thus overshadowed the work done in recent weeks."
"I refer in particular to the surge in oil prices - and would point out that the members of the European Council will also be discussing this issue - and to the fluctuations in the value of the euro and the referendum in Denmark."
"I can nevertheless assure you that we will continue in our efforts on the basis of the timetable set and I feel that the required results have been achieved."
"I take, by way of example, the latest General Affairs Council, with an initial agreement on MEDA II, the continuing debate on increasing the effectiveness of the Union' s external aid, the message to the Serbian people, which can be seen to have carried weight in the current situation, and the first progress report ever on the enlargement process, which we will be discussing again this afternoon, in this Chamber."
"Progress has also been made at the latest Justice and Home Affairs Council, which saw the adoption of the Regulation on the European Refugee Fund, the extension of Europol' s powers in the field of money laundering and, lastly, a policy agreement with a view to setting up Eurojust, following a decision taken at the Tampere Summit."
"Likewise, the informal Council of Defence Ministers held on 22 September gave reason to hope that completely satisfactory results will be obtained by the end of the presidency as concerns the commitment of capabilities."
"Not to mention the priorities which we have described as citizens' priorities, since they lie at the heart of the concerns of all the citizens of Europe: growth and employment, their children' s education - this question was discussed at the Education Council held this weekend - the future of social protection and transport safety amid new circumstances marked by the surge in oil prices."
"Here too, the wheels have been set in motion, and the Presidency, in concert with the Commission and Parliament, is getting down to work."
"I will now turn to the actual agenda of the Biarritz European Council, which is to say straight to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As I pointed out during the debate held on 11 July at the invitation of Mr Napolitano, our concern, right from the outset, has been to restart discussions on a more open basis in order to give ourselves every chance of reaching a satisfactory agreement in Nice."
"We have therefore been keen, on the one hand, to emphasise the link between the three issues that were left unresolved in Amsterdam, which in our mind form a whole, a package, and, on the other hand, to take a long look at the major issue of closer cooperation, within the context of an enlarged Europe."
"These are very thorny questions, and this is why we initially felt, I have to admit, that we were not able to move forward as quickly as we would have liked."
"You must surely have noticed this too, inside this Chamber, and your President has not failed to point it out whenever she has had the opportunity to do so at the opening of the monthly ministerial sessions of the IGC."
"Your participation is always very important. You have not failed to point out how vital it was to mobilise efforts in order for these negotiations to progress and a successful conclusion to be reached within the deadlines set."
"The presidency, just like the Commission, also firmly emphasised, back at the Evian 'Gymnich' , the informal meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers, in early September, that there was a real risk of failure at Nice, and that France, as the country holding the presidency, would prefer to take responsibility for a failure such as this than for a flawed agreement."
"I must stress that no one should interpret this as tactical manoeuvring on our part."
"We would prefer there to be no treaty at Nice rather than a flawed Treaty of Nice."
"This message seems to have got through, but I seemed to detect, at the General Affairs Council of 18 September and at the mini-meeting I chaired that evening in Brussels, real signs of realisation setting in."
"What stage has actually been reached in these negotiations?"
"As concerns the Commission, we strongly feel that the difficulty arises from the fact that the majority of the Member States are reluctant both to put a ceiling limit on the number of Commissioners and to undertake genuine long-term restructuring of the Commission, despite the fact that we all agree on the need for a strong and effective Commission."
"This would seem to be a paradox that we must escape."
"It is fundamental to the future of the Union, since the Commission truly is, and I cannot stress this too strongly, the lynchpin of the Community system."
"Everyone has been able to put forward their arguments with precision, but at some point we will have to find a way around certain contradictions."
"In any case, it would seem impossible for a Union with twenty, twenty-five or thirty Member States to carry on with the current system without it being reformed."
"As concerns the question of the reweighting of votes, a potential solution would seem to be emerging, and many Member States can see the advantage of this formula, of the stringent reweighting of votes, over that of the double majority, regardless of the form that it takes."
"However, the issue of reweighting is closely linked with the previous issue I talked about, and it is clear that it can only be resolved once negotiations are complete."
"You may rest assured that we will not wait until Biarritz, and still less until Nice, to address that issue."
"The essential preparatory work is under way."
"I nevertheless believe - and this is my personal feeling - that substantial progress will take a little longer."
"But it is important for the Heads of State and Government meeting at the Biarritz European Council to talk about it."
"As concerns qualified majority voting, on the other hand, the considerable work carried out is beginning to bear fruit."
"The Commission has put forward highly constructive proposals that will enable us to move forward in a manner which addresses the problems raised by each delegation, and I am very grateful to it."
"The list of items to which qualified majority voting could be applied is growing significantly."
"I believe that the results will live up to expectations as this is an issue of capital importance, as we all know, and even, perhaps, the main issue for this IGC, just as the question of the concomitant extension of our codecision procedures is for Parliament."
"In this case too, I feel that discussions are progressing well within the IGC and that the principle of concordance between codecision and the legislative act is beginning to gain ground, if not widespread acceptance."
"Lastly, as concerns closer cooperation, you will be aware that the problem was, and still is to some extent, that many Member States saw in this, a priori, a risk of creating a two-speed Europe, or even of it being used as a substitute for real progress involving all 15 Member States in the field of qualified majority voting."
"I must stress that closer cooperation is neither a means of moving towards a stable and definitive hard core, nor a substitute for progress on qualified majority voting."
"We have held several in-depth exchanges of views on this issue at ministerial level, and I believe that these have enabled us to clarify the concept of closer cooperation and to dispel the misgivings of those most sceptical."
"The parallel debate on the future of an enlarged Europe has in its own way made a both positive, and perhaps occasionally negative, contribution to this."
"Indeed, since a majority of Member States would not seem to be contemplating a radical switch towards any other type of, let us say, much more federal institutional model, one cannot but acknowledge that closer cooperation is a fine tool which provides a response to the realistic observation that, in an enlarged Europe, not all the Member States will always be able, or want, to move forward at the same rate."
"A degree of flexibility, of latitude, is thus essential so that those who want to press ahead more quickly can do so, while still allowing others the chance to catch up with those who have moved ahead, since it is clear that closer cooperation makes no sense unless it always remains an option."
"There is, of course, still work to be done, particularly as concerns defining the conditions in which principles could be simplified and the conditions for triggering this mechanism made more flexible, while still preserving a number of guarantees."
"It will also be necessary to examine the specific measures that must be taken in the field of the CFSP."
"Lastly, the Presidency will examine, in agreement with the Member States, the possibility of supplementing Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, notably on the basis of the proposals already put forward by the Member States and by the Commission."
"Indeed, it is clear that in order to provide a more effective guarantee for the values of the Union and fundamental rights, a prevention, vigilance and warning system will be required."
"And, on that subject, let me turn to the second fundamental issue on the Biarritz agenda, namely the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"As you will be aware, the draft Charter was formally adopted by the Convention yesterday, on 2 October, with the invaluable and highly effective support of Parliament' s representatives."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, represented by its chairman, Giorgio Napolitano, has nevertheless voiced concern over the future of this draft Charter and the possibility of incorporating it into the Treaties at the Nice European Council."
"I therefore deduce from this question that Parliament, or at least its Committee on Constitutional Affairs, endorses the text produced by the Convention, with certain reservations of course, at which I can only express pleasure."
"We will doubtless have the chance to discuss that text again in greater depth in the debate on its proclamation by the three institutions scheduled to be take place in this Chamber in November."
"But, before giving a precise answer to the question from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would like to explain why it is that the work done by the Convention would seem to constitute a twofold success."
"Firstly, it is a success that we should consider in terms of the procedure selected, involving a body, the Convention, made up of Members of the European Parliament, national parliaments, the European Commission, and the personal representatives of the Heads of State and Government."
"This has seen us breaking with the traditional method of diplomatic conferences or intergovernmental conferences, which is now proving somewhat complex, it has to be said."
"I would add that the quality and diversity of the members appointed has, due to their training, their background and their political beliefs, indisputably provided a rich resource."
"Similarly, it is quite remarkable that the Convention has worked both in a manner that is completely transparent, and completely interactively with the citizens via the Internet."
"With the intention of opening out the debate, it therefore consulted, in the course of its work, the major non-governmental organisations, the social partners and candidate countries."
"This transparency, this openness, played an active part in the gradual improvement of the various versions of the draft Charter, some 48 or 49 of them, as you will be aware."
"I am convinced, for my part, that the Convention experiment clearly shows us, if not the way, then at least one of the paths that Europe can now follow with a view to being more transparent and more receptive to the opinions of its citizens."
"The second major success, without which the first success would, it must be said, have had little meaning, is of course the result achieved by the Convention."
"From this point of view, the Charter is firstly, and this is a sufficiently rare thing in our texts for it to warrant a mention, a clear and well-structured document."
"It contains around fifty articles - which is not a vast amount - spread over six chapters with forceful headings - dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship and justice - and undeniably meets our requirements for conciseness and clarity and thus, at the same time, I feel, lives up to the expectations of our fellow citizens."
"The Charter is also cogent."
"The people responsible for drafting it have managed to respond to the twin requirement of not creating a text automatically and ex nihilo, but of taking a precise and yet fluid snapshot of the gamut of fundamental rights that are in force or evolving within the Union."
"But it is primarily as a result of the potency of its content that I believe the Charter will become a milestone."
"First and foremost, it unambiguously reaffirms the fundamental civil rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and, on this account, those who drafted the Charter took great care to avoid any possibility of a regrettable divergence in judicial practice between the European Court of Human Rights, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Convention, and the Court of Justice of the European Communities, particularly by incorporating the wording of the Council of Europe' s Convention every time that this appeared to be the most well-rounded and pertinent option."
"As we know, of course, the Charter does not stop at reaffirming existing rights."
"It enshrines many new rights that correspond to the necessary development in our societies, be they the development of technologies, the appearance of new dependencies, or the complexity of our administrative systems."
"Lastly, I am sure you will understand my delight at the importance that this text accorded to economic and social rights."
"Putting on my second, my national, hat, I would say that France has argued strongly for this section to be a substantial one, but I have seen that many other Member States desired the same thing, which this Presidency can only welcome."
"The same applies to the innovative and driving force of the Charter and the consolidation of the European Social Model, which everyone here, I am sure, values highly."
"The Charter guarantees the right to a free education, the right of workers to be informed and consulted, and the right to collective bargaining and action, including the right to strike, the right of protection against any form of unjustified dismissal, the right to social protection, and the ban on child employment."
"It is my overall conviction that the Charter constitutes the greatest collective advance in affirming social rights since European integration began and, as a result, is worthy of praise."
"You will therefore ask me, and I fully expect to be questioned on this, why such success should not be crowned by incorporating the Charter into the Treaties."
"First of all, and in direct response to the question raised by Mr Napolitano, I must remind you of the actual text of the conclusions of the Cologne European Council, which launched the process, ""The European Council will propose to the European Parliament and the Commission that, together with the Council, they should solemnly proclaim a European Charter of Fundamental Rights."""
"The Council itself must also come to a political agreement on the draft Charter, as I hope and believe it will do, informally, at the Biarritz European Council, and then allow the other institutions, the Commission, Parliament and, why not, certain national parliaments, time to reach a conclusion on the substance, which is to say on the contents of this document."
"It is therefore clear, as concerns timescales, that it will not be possible to make the proclamation, which will be the first step towards something bigger, until the Nice European Council."
"Furthermore, the conclusions of the Cologne Council consistently specified that the issue of incorporation into the Treaties could only be examined after the Charter had been proclaimed, which is to say at Nice."
"Moreover, the Council is yet to address this matter."
"I must nevertheless confirm - at least this is my feeling - that a large majority, if not a very large majority, of Member States would still seem to oppose its prompt incorporation, which is, of course, a factor that this Presidency has to take into account."
"I am thus tempted to answer your question with one of my own: should one take the risk of this text - which as I have said is set to become a milestone - being rejected at Biarritz, or should one trust in the potency of this Charter, which I am sure will establish itself as a reference for values in the European Union and a source of inspiration to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg?"
"One must give these things time."
"Discussions on the future of the Charter are, to my mind, closely akin to discussions on the future of Europe."
"In the same way, there are those who have outlined the need to equip the European Union with a European Constitution."
"Personally speaking, that would seem like a good, if not an excellent idea, provided that prior agreement is reached on its content, which is to say on a possible clarification of competencies, on the role of each institution within the Union, and on the balance between them."
"One could then imagine, and I at any rate would support this entirely, the Charter taking its place in a type of 'Constitutional Treaty' , in the form of a preamble."
"However, there is still a lot of work to be done before embarking on this new phase."
"It would seem to be premature to want to outline a timetable for this at the present juncture, and this could also have adverse effects on the negotiations of the IGC."
"We must wait until Nice, when we have the results of the IGC, before spelling out what we can reasonably look forward to seeing at a later date."
"Any discussions on the 'post-Nice' scenario will therefore cover a range of themes, some of which are presented in a simplified manner."
"First of all there is the question of improving institutional administration in a Union which has 30 Member States."
"We are already addressing this issue in the context of the current Intergovernmental Conference, but we are also clearly aware that we will have to go further, a good deal further, in adapting the Community method if we are to preserve its essential features."
"I touched on this in connection with closer cooperation."
"This would appear to constitute the prime tool for promoting the pragmatic development of a Community Europe which will in the future - and I stress this - extend much further and be far more diverse."
"I need say no more."
"Next there is the question of translating the Treaties into a constitution, to respond to the twin requirement of clarifying the texts, which we must render more cogent and more accessible to our fellow citizens, and of interlinking competencies more smoothly."
"These are not new issues and, above all, we are well aware of how difficult they are."
"Then there is a third focus for discussion which we should not lose sight of, and which concerns improving the administration of the European Union."
"By this I am alluding to reform of the operation of the institutions, independently even of the reform of the Treaties, in response to a need, which public opinion senses quite strongly, for Europe to have a clearer direction, for measures to be handled more expertly, in brief for there to be a firmer hand on the rudder."
"This presupposes our being able to raise the profile of each of the institutions, in political terms, and consequently enhance the balance between them."
"In this respect the proposals that Mr Prodi is preparing for next year will be of great practical value, and I feel, for that matter, that it is time for me to give him the floor."
"I am sure he, as the president of that pivotal institution, will share the Commission' s initial thoughts on the matter with us."
"However, I repeat, and I will end on this note for now, and allow the President-in-Office to speak, let us concentrate on the tasks allocated to us, let us strive to see them through together and if, at Biarritz, headway is being made both on the Intergovernmental Conference and on the Charter, then we will be able to prepare a successful Nice European Council and, of course, a better situation 'post-Nice' ."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Biarritz Summit will be decisive for we will have to tackle issues of fundamental importance to enlargement and the institutional reforms."
"However, while we are attempting to resolve our own problems we must spare a thought for our friends and neighbours who are facing decisive challenges."
"In Serbia, thanks to the determination of the Serbian people, democracy is on the point of asserting itself."
"Therefore, let us support Serbia in its endeavour to, at last, turn the page and to take its place in the international community once again."
"The Middle East, on the other hand, seems to be moving ever further away from peace due to irresponsible actions which reopen old wounds and which we condemn."
"The Commission will work alongside Parliament and the Council to ensure that the European Union produces political action which will enable us to remain protagonists in humanitarian and financial matters."
"We have embarked on an enlargement process with the inspiring goal of restoring unity to Europe."
"The Commission intends to pursue this goal right through to its conclusion in full adherence to its mandate, conducting the negotiations objectively and rigorously, country by country."
"Rigour and objectivity are essential if we are to secure the public support which is vital both in the candidate countries and in those countries which are already Members of the Union."
"The time has therefore come for some extra impetus over and above the efforts of the negotiators: we need to explain and persuade."
"There is an urgent need in the Member States of the Union for a debate which will allow the citizens to grasp the full significance of the remarkable episode of history which is unfolding with the rebuilding of a united Europe and, at the same time, to become fully aware of the potential benefits to be gained from creating a market of 500 million consumers."
"For their part, the new democracies are currently making huge, unprecedented efforts across the board to adapt their political and economic systems to Community requirements. However, there are equally clear signs in the candidate countries of growing concern over the lack of a clear, binding timetable for accession."
"We must respond to their efforts and their concerns."
"Before enlargement can go ahead, we must make the necessary reforms to the Community institutions."
"Without the requisite institutional changes, the prospect of almost doubling the number of Member States would pose insurmountable problems in terms of decision-making capacity."
"Failure to introduce these changes would throw the Union into an interminable crisis."
"This is the task facing the Biarritz and Nice Summits."
"If a Treaty of Nice implementing all the above projects were to be adopted in December, allowing due time for national ratification procedures, the Union could be ready for enlargement at the beginning of 2003."
"There is no secret about what is at stake - you have heard Mr Moscovici - and the Commission's position is clear."
"We need to simplify the mechanism for closer cooperation, leaving the door constantly open to those Member States that wish to participate."
"The consistency of the acquis communautaire and the uniformity of the judicial framework must be preserved."
"Closer cooperation must be an inclusive, not exclusive instrument, but no-one must be allowed to prevent a group of States from achieving that close union which is expressly provided for in the Treaties and which must be properly regulated within the framework of the Union's institutions."
"We need to cushion the institutions against the impact of enlarging the Union, to ensure that we have a Commission which is able to continue to operate as a genuine College, and a Council which is able to adopt decisions by a vote which represents the will both of the majority of the States and the majority of their combined populations."
"We need to reform the legal structure of the Union and, lastly - and this, in my opinion, is crucial if Nice is to be a success - to limit the scope for using the veto and restrict the decisions requiring unanimity to the absolute minimum."
"These reforms are the minimum changes necessary - and I repeat, the very minimum necessary - before enlargement takes place, to ensure that enlargement does not irreversibly impair the Union's ability to act."
"Equally important for the future of Europe - at Biarritz and later at Nice - will be the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"According to Mr Moscovici, this represents a great political step forward."
"The Charter will, in fact, become the reference point both for those countries which are already Members of the Union and those which are preparing for accession."
"The quality of the proposed draft and the balance it achieves are truly exemplary and I would therefore like to congratulate the Members of the Convention and President Herzog on their work."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the lesson for us all today, the tenth anniversary of German unification, is that Europe is capable of rising to the great challenges that history throws in its path."
"Looking immediately ahead, beyond Biarritz and Nice, we have a duty to consider our future."
"My aim today is not to present a complete blueprint for tomorrow's Europe. I simply want to set down some markers for the debate."
"The future of a newly reunited Europe is not carved in stone."
"The outcome of the current political debate will depend upon our determination: either we maintain the status quo, which would, in effect, mean a step backwards for Europe, or we allow a partial but deceptive increase in intergovernmental cooperation, or, alternatively, we continue to build on the institutional architecture of the Union in a way that is consistent with the principles of democracy, the balance of powers and subsidiarity."
"I am heartened by the fact that there now seems to be more of a consensus on the need to address these issues than there was when I first raised them in this very Chamber this time last year."
"If we are to make constructive plans for the future, we will have to take as our starting point our current situation, our past history and the recent debate inspired by many authoritative contributions."
"All the lasting achievements of the Union, from the single market to the euro including four successive enlargements, have been the product of our completely unique system, based on the fine balance between the Union's institutions."
"Revolving around the institutional triangle of Council, Parliament and Commission, this system has proved remarkably successful."
"Its originality lies without doubt in the Commission and its right of initiative."
"The Commission is the melting pot into which the various national interests and tensions are poured, and from which emerge proposals that seek to reconcile these often conflicting interests."
"In this way, it provides not only an analysis and synthesis of the issues under consideration but also a starting point for negotiations in which, once national differences have been expressed, the common European interest can be identified."
"This executive body, which combines independence with a sensitivity to the balance of powers and interests of all the Member States, both large and small, is crucial for the pooling of sovereignty in the Community."
"However, the role of the Commission is necessary for the integration of Europe but is not sufficient on its own."
"The value of Europe derives from an institutional system in which Parliament, Council and the Court of Justice play a role which is equally decisive."
"It is from this system, the combination of all these institutions, that the synthesis emerges."
"There are, however, those who would regard any confrontation between the Council and the Commission as positive, as if this might somehow be to Parliament's advantage."
"Nothing could be further from the truth: a strong Council strengthens the action of the Commission, and this is equally true with regard to Parliament."
"The European system is a system of balances in which the smooth running of each institution serves the common interest."
"Any weakening of one of these institutions weakens the whole."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I do detect a worrying tendency to think that further European integration can be achieved through the use of methods which are based primarily on direct cooperation between governments."
"(Applause)This is extremely disturbing because adopting the intergovernmental model can only have two possible outcomes, both of them undesirable: either it will turn the Community into a mere international debating forum which is incapable of producing genuine pooling of sovereignty around the common interest, or - what it worse - it will deceive the citizens by constantly creating new bodies which are exempt from any democratic scrutiny."
"Then we will have a real government of bureaucrats!"
"(Applause)Giving new powers to a committee of ministers served by an unaccountable secretariat would not represent any sort of progress either for democracy or for effective decision-making."
"To claim, as some do, that the individual legitimacy of the participating governments somehow constitutes, on its own, sufficient guarantee of democratic accountability for the intergovernmental model, is misguided."
"The European process can only derive its democratic validity from a dual legitimation: the direct legitimation of the European people, as represented by you, the Members of the European Parliament, and the legitimation of the Member States which, in turn, is based on national democratic elections."
"It is you, the European Parliament, as the direct expression of Europe-wide universal suffrage, who are the institution specifically dedicated to representing the union of the peoples of Europe."
"And it is from your endorsement that the Commission derives its democratic legitimacy."
"This then complements the other source of legitimacy, namely the Member States represented in the Council."
"Enhancing the intergovernmental model at the expense not only of the Commission, but also, ultimately, of the Council, would therefore undermine the democratic nature of the whole European structure and represent a considerable step backwards."
"(Applause)We will run serious risks if we call into question the principle of a Community based on the rule of law, respect for which is guaranteed by the Court of Justice, to which any European citizen has the right to appeal."
"We must put an end, once and for all, to the current paradoxical situation in which even the deliberations of the fifteen Justice Ministers on such sensitive areas as criminal law and police cooperation escape the scrutiny of Parliament and the Court of Justice."
"(Applause)In the recent controversy surrounding the events in Austria, the compulsion to resist any racist or authoritarian tendencies - a reaction with which I fully sympathise - ended up creating an artificial distinction between the bilateral action of the Member States and the action of the Union as a whole."
"Democracy was therefore made to look as if it were reserved for the individual States alone."
"However, I firmly believe that democracy cannot be a matter for subsidiarity: it must thrive at all levels."
"(Applause)Furthermore, I cannot help thinking that, when a serious problem arises at Union level, it should first be debated before this House, which is the centre and expression of our democracy."
"It is, moreover, indisputably right that, when it comes to tangible government, there should be a debate on what should and should not be done at European and national levels."
"Clearly, it is then up to each individual States to decide what needs to be done at regional and at local levels."
"I therefore agree that the time has come to open the debate on the distribution of powers between the Union and the Member States."
"The Commission will launch this debate with a White Paper on forms of government, which we are already preparing."
"We will be trying to define a form of interaction between the existing levels of decision-making that is transparent and democratic and, at the same time, capable of ensuring cohesive and effective action."
"Any trend towards an intergovernmental approach, by contrast, would create conflicting power structures within the European structure, resulting in fragmentation where what is needed is unity."
"There is no need for me to remind this House of our tragic inability to act in the Balkan war, precisely because of the fragmentation of our decision-making processes."
"It is not because of our actions that we have lost credibility but because of our inability to act."
"I would like to give two further examples of this fragmentation: firstly, the creation of the High Representatives."
"In the area of foreign and security policy, the Treaty of Amsterdam only provided a temporary response to a lasting need."
"While I can assure Javier Solana of the wholehearted support of the Commission - and I admire the extraordinary personal commitment which has enabled him to achieve major, unhoped-for results - I have to stress that the present organisational model is not sustainable in the long term."
"(Applause)This model confuses the roles of the Council and the Commission in a way that could jeopardise both struts of the institutional system and exclude Parliament from any effective power."
"The current situation should be seen as a transitional phase, useful for launching European action in a new area but destined to be reabsorbed into the conventional institutional structure, as happened in similar cases such as Schengen."
"That is why I firmly believe that the function of High Representative should be integrated into the Commission, with a special status tailored to security and defence needs."
"(Applause)"
"We should draw the same conclusions when considering the solutions to be adopted for other sectors, such as economic policy and the euro."
"The current management of economic policy projects an image of Europe as indecisive and muddled."
"The Central Bank is independent, but, unlike every other protagonist on the world economic stage, it is not flanked by a stable economic policy body representing an overall view of the economic strategies of the Union and its Members and capable of taking decisions with the necessary speed."
"(Applause)The search for such an essential point of reference for any monetary policy must not lead to the creation of another High Representative, this time for economic policy."
"The simple, natural, effective solution is there, under our noses: the Commission, acting on a mandate from the Council, should be the voice of the Union's economic policy."
"In fact, you only have to read the Treaty to realise that, while the Central Bank is the lynchpin of monetary policy, the body responsible for the overall assessment of the European Union's economic policy can only be the Commission."
"Thus, the Commission has to be the interlocutor for the Central Bank."
"My second example of the risk of fragmentation is the desire expressed by some Member States in the Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaty to facilitate the creation of agencies upon which the Commission can then confer executive powers."
"Let us be clear on this point: there is a real danger that this will result in conflicting centres of power."
"Agencies may indeed be needed to give the Union bodies and authorities of the kind that exist in all systems today, and to allow the Commission to perform its role as an executive body more effectively, without excessive bureaucratic burdens. But this must be done by maintaining the logic of the Community system."
"Those agencies must therefore operate under the authority of the Commission, which is answerable to you for its actions."
"We cannot, on the one hand, deplore the lack of effective and united European action and, on the other, be content with the weakness of the instruments available to the Community for carrying out such action."
"The recent petrol crisis is, from this point of view, a perfect illustration: the need for a unified response was clear - as was our inability to deliver one."
"In the history of European integration, the President of the Commission has often stood before this House and said that we find ourselves at a crossroads."
"If I say it once again, it is because I genuinely believe that it has never been more true."
"The debate about the future of Europe in the perspective of enlargement is a healthy and vital one."
"This was true of the recent referendum in Denmark, although I regret the outcome."
"However, it goes to show, once again, that not everyone in the Union feels equally strongly that they are a part of the European project."
"We have achieved a great deal over the past 50 years, but we must not be so complacent as to believe that these achievements are irreversible."
"If we are not careful to preserve the key elements of the constitutional architecture designed and executed by the founding fathers, we will reverse some of the achievements that we take for granted today such as democratic accountability, legitimacy and the rule of law."
"We have built a unique system in which the guarantees of the democratic state governed by the rule of law on which our societies are founded also form the basis for the Community."
"They must continue to guide any further advances in common action at European level."
"Many people in the world look, full of hope, to our European model and its successes for inspiration."
"Many look to our original 'union of minorities', as I like to call our Union, as the only instrument capable of reconciling the demands of globalisation with the reassertion of the rights of the citizen."
"I am not so naïve as to believe that the Community system is perfect."
"This is precisely why we have set in motion, and will carry through, an in-depth reform of the Commission. A reform not only of the way it operates but also of its administrative procedures."
"It is now legitimate to expect a similar effort from all the other institutions."
"However, I still passionately believe that the Community system, with its checks and balances, offers the best possible guarantee for the future of the fundamental values we cherish."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we attempt to develop the Union while weakening the political role of the Commission, if our capacity for executive action is eroded, if the extension of the intergovernmental model corrupts the judicial and institutional mechanisms of the Community, if the democratic legitimacy of the system, guaranteed by this House, is undermined, if all this is allowed to happen, then the achievements of the single market, the common policies, the solidarity mechanisms, and the weight Europe carries by speaking with a single voice in international negotiations, will certainly be at risk, and, similarly, any attempt to equip Europe to act more effectively by continuing to develop a Union based on shared values, democratic principles and the rule of law will be in vain."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community system has been an unprecedented success, and we have only just begun to explore its potential."
"Our peoples pin their hopes on the European Union and look to it to ensure that the future is one of peace."
"The achievements of the past equip us well to meet the challenges of the future."
"What we need now is wisdom and foresight to preserve what we have inherited so that we can bequeath something even better and greater to future generations."
"(Sustained applause)"
"You can tell from the applause, Mr President, just how much your intervention was appreciated."
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, I would like to start by saying how moved I was by the response to President Prodi's important speech and that I fully support the consensus expressed by Parliament. Mr Prodi dealt thoroughly with issues which are very important to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, of which I have the honour of being the Chairman."
"I would also like to thank Mr Moscovici for his careful, thorough response to the oral question which I tabled on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Therefore, since Mr Moscovici has already provided an excellent description of the question, I will not go back over the same ground now but focus on his response and on the questions which he, in his turn, has posed to Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I cannot conceal my satisfaction, which, I feel, is shared by the great majority of Parliament, at the results achieved by the Convention entrusted with drawing up the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I would like to express my wholehearted appreciation of the work put in by all the members of the Convention, especially the European Parliament delegation and its outstanding Chairman, Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"I agree with Mr Moscovici's detailed, well-substantiated evaluation of what he defined a twofold success, une double réussite, referring to both procedure and text."
"The European Parliament will express its opinion regarding the proclamation of the Charter at the appropriate time, but I have reason to believe that its opinion will be completely favourable."
"Turning to Mr Moscovici's questions: firstly, Mr President-in-Office, we are certainly not advocating running the risk of the Charter being rejected in Biarritz just because we are calling for it to be incorporated into the Treaties; however, in all honesty, I cannot imagine that responsible heads of government will reject the Charter, given the high quality of its content."
"Secondly, due consideration must certainly be given to the argument of timing - I am familiar with it, Minister, and it is a very strong argument - namely the fact that there has not yet been enough time for the issue to be fully explored and that the majority of the Member States are currently opposed to the idea."
"It is also true that we must have faith - and many of us do - in the power of the Charter as such and in its capacity to inspire the decisions of the Luxembourg Court, but what we are trying to say, Mr Moscovici, is that the issue of whether and how to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties cannot be avoided."
"It must be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference and a solution will have to be found in Nice, for it is important both to guarantee the full legal effectiveness of the Charter and to ensure that it is the first stone laid in a process of constitutionalisation."
"I am mentioning this because I was particularly struck by what you had to say on the matter, Minister."
"Rather than waiting for a Constitutional Charter to be established - to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights could become the preamble - to incorporate this Charter into the Treaties, it could serve as the basis for drawing up, over a longer period of time of course, a European Constitution."
"To sum up, what we want is to open a discussion on the matter in Biarritz and to continue until Nice, so that, at Nice and even after Nice, we will then be able to outline the practical steps to be taken once the Intergovernmental Conference is over."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, today we are looking into the future of the European Union and we are therefore debating the future of Europe."
"However, we also look - particularly at this time - towards Belgrade and Serbia."
"We marvel at the desire of the people there for freedom, we encourage them to continue along the path towards the European Community of values."
"We declare our solidarity with the elected President Vojislav Kostunica and all democrats in Serbia."
"We shout to Slobodan Milosevic: ""Do your people a service."
"Step down so that your compatriots can live in peace and freedom."""
"Ten years ago today on 3 October German unity in freedom became a reality."
"It was the work of millions of people who in a peaceful revolution brought the wall down, cleared the minefields and swept away communism with its contempt of humankind."
"German unity was only possible because of Solidarnosc in Poland, because of the desire for freedom of the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and other peoples in central Europe."
"And they have the right to join the Community of values of the European Union."
"On the initiative of our colleague, Alain Lamassoure, our group will be tabling a motion declaring that we will proceed with enlargement in such a way as to enable the first peoples from central Europe to take part in the next European elections in 2004."
"(Applause)"
"A few days ago in Budapest, the freeman of Europe, the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, spoke passionately in favour of the central European States becoming Members of the European Union."
"Today we say thank you to Helmut Kohl and salute him for understanding German unity as a duty to bring about the unification of our European continent with courage and determination."
"(Applause)"
"Now we look towards Biarritz - and I see that the President-in-Office is leafing through and reading a book."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would ask you to follow this debate now as Mr Prodi is doing, to put your book to one side and take this Parliament seriously!"
"(Applause)"
"We are looking towards Biarritz and I can agree with nearly all of your comments."
"I should like to thank you very much, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, for the great speech which you have given here today."
"Parliament - in any case my group - will stand resolutely at your side if you continue to defend these principles in the future."
"(Applause)"
"And now we look towards Biarritz."
"We support what you said about majority voting, Mr President-in-Office."
"Of course we need to apply the principle of democracy in practice."
"This means that the majority of the population must be reflected in a majority vote."
"I would also ask, however, that we respect the rights of small countries in the European Union and avoid any arrogance on the part of large countries in the European Union."
"The small countries have their dignity too, and perhaps the outcome of the vote in Denmark would have been different if we had behaved differently in connection with one quite specific issue in recent weeks and months."
"(Applause)"
"We say yes to closer cooperation."
"But this closer cooperation must not exclude anyone."
"We can support what you said."
"But I would also ask you to take us beyond Nice in Biarritz, and to ensure that there is also a decision in Nice to set in train the next steps in the reform process, and then - as you rightly said - we will have to consider the issue of a procedure for forming a constitution."
"The Institute in Florence has said that we need to split the Treaties into a basic treaty and a second treaty."
"We need to give this further consideration."
"As we do to the point which the President of the Commission rightly raised, that of mandating the next Conference in Nice to settle who does what in Europe: what the European Union does and what the nation states do."
"And it is then for the nation states to determine what should be decided at regional or district level."
"We wholeheartedly support what you said in this regard, Mr President of the Commission."
"We have now had the Convention on Fundamental Rights."
"Our group should like to thank Roman Herzog and for our Parliament Iñigo Méndez de Vigo, as well as all colleagues from all the groups who have participated in this."
"A magnificent job has been done and of course we have to ensure that, little by little, this also becomes part of Community law."
"Mr President-in-Office, you are right."
"We must not jeopardise the project; that is why we need a little patience."
"But I expect and hope that you will also find the right way gradually to make these fundamental rights European Union law."
"I now come to the really decisive point and the reason why we are so grateful to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for his speech today."
"A great speech, Mr President of the Commission, in which you declared that we are acting within the framework of the Community of the European Union, that we are not working within bilateral or multilateral structures under secretariats which are outside the Community framework, but secretariats within the Community framework."
"We will resolutely oppose intergovernmentalism or secretariats, should any of our leaders have these in mind."
"We wish to act within the framework of the European Union."
"The greatest achievement of the European Union is our shared law, and we must obey this law."
"Anyone who starts to bend the rules for opportunistic reasons challenges the foundations of the European Community."
"This law is the foundation stone for peace in Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office, in conclusion I would make a request of you."
"Like the majority of the Council, you belong to the political family of François Mitterrand."
"I wish you the courage and strength to remain true to the European ideals of François Mitterrand in the coming weeks, months and years."
"And if you do then our family of parties - which was founded on the legacy of Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and Robert Schuman - will also be at your side when it comes to building a common Europe."
"That is the common task which now lies before us."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, ten years after German reunification, which marked the end of the cold war and to which our institution actively contributed, we find ourselves at a new crossroads."
"This phrase is no platitude: we now have to find a solution which definitively unifies Europe and confronts globalisation."
"We have listened attentively to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council and also the excellent speech of the President of the Commission, who is today returning from his summer break, and I believe that this should, to a certain extent, set the pace for our institutions, because a year ago the investiture of the Commission took place and now we have to hold a debate on the crossroads we are facing and the future of Europe."
"I would say that the issue can be summed up as having to reform in order to enlarge, and also so that our institutions might function properly. Nor must we forget that we also have to govern jointly in order to deal with the problems and aspirations of the European citizens."
"The Biarritz Summit is about to take place and I must say, on behalf of my Group and of my political family, the Party of European Socialists, that we consider the work carried out by the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a success in terms of what it has achieved and also in terms of the method it has used."
"I wish publicly to express my gratitude for the work carried out not only by our fellow Members in the Convention, presided over by Mr Méndez de Vigo, but also by all those who have participated, even during the summer, in this work, which has had a good gestation period, since it has lasted nine months."
"On the eve of the Biarritz Summit, it is important that the Charter is approved by the Council."
"Why?"
"Because we must give substance to European citizenship."
"We need to ensure that the demands we made in the Treaty on European Union ten years ago are translated into clear and concrete action."
"Furthermore - and this has been the important work in the final stage of the Charter - to ensure that its content is progressive and that it extends not only to personal freedoms but also to economic and social rights. This content has been achieved at the end of the work on the Charter."
"Madam President, I believe that the Charter currently sends an important message to our citizens and also to the candidate countries."
"In relation to the debate on enlargement to follow, my Group believes that it is important for us to send a positive message to these countries."
"When producing a resolution of 120 sections, the first thing we have to say is that we want the whole of the enlargement process to be carried out in a clear and transparent way, dealing with its needs, but at a sustained pace."
"It is important that this Parliament sends the message that it is essential to set the timetable at the European Council in Nice, which needs to be successful."
"Secondly, the Charter is also important given the dangerous tendencies which are emerging in the Union, leading to populism, a lack of solidarity and xenophobia."
"I really do not understand - I am now addressing the President-in-Office of the Council - why, when for once we have done something really good and which we are all pleased with, we are going to put the Charter on the back burner after Nice."
"I am not asking for it to be included directly in the Treaties but, while we are discussing Articles 6 and 7, we must affirm our community of values."
"It is very difficult to explain to our voters that we have done a good job, which we are all very pleased about, but that we are going to put it off until a later date. I believe that the Council and the governments must give serious consideration to what must be the frontispiece to our Union."
"Secondly, with regard to the method, we have not discovered the philosopher' s stone, but we have realised that this method is democratic, because it is public, transparent, and is allowing the citizens and civil society to follow what we are doing in real time."
"The truth is that, after listening to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council on the development of the Intergovernmental Conference - he has said it with the discretion and elegance worthy of the Presidency, especially if it is French, but he has said that we are in a situation of total stalemate, and has used the term 'paradox' - I ask myself: could we not apply the Convention method to the Intergovernmental Conferences?"
"(Applause)"
"That is a very fundamental question which would resolve many of our problems."
"Because in the Intergovernmental Conferences - and we all know this from what they tell us and we have two representatives who are showing great patience - the representatives are limited to following instructions so that the leaders, at the end, simply negotiate during the last five minutes, which produces the type of Treaties which we have, which are completely incomprehensible, even to the initiated."
"(Applause)"
"I therefore believe that there is a second message which we must direct at our governments when they meet in Biarritz and in Nice, and that is that the next Intergovernmental Conference, even this one, could be replaced with the Convention method."
"Thirdly, in relation to the President of the Commission' s comments on the future, I agree on one basic idea: at a time when, unfortunately, there is a debate in which there is talk of a constitution, of federalism, in which we have our Heads of State - tomorrow we will have President Ciampi - making grandiose claims for the future of Europe, I must say that the Heads of State and Government say many things in favour of Europe in public which they appear to resolve in private."
"Well, at least they say them, I suppose."
"Mr President of the Commission, it is true that we have to construct for the future on the basis of the present."
"And at present we have an interinstitutional triangle."
"We completely agree on this and also on the fact that we have to try to take advantage of that triangle."
"I believe that President Prodi has understood this, because, if I am not mistaken, he was at the Amsterdam Summit where the High Representative for external policy was created."
"We learn from our mistakes."
"Now I see that he is arguing for a progressive integration of something which Parliament, at that time, argued for before Amsterdam."
"With regard to the second example he has given - economic policy - he said something very important. In the Treaties there is a very clear definition of the competence of the Commission in this field."
"I tell you this, on behalf of my Group: President Prodi, you must act, because it is essential that, as well as the European Central Bank, there is economic leadership in the Union and that does not mean that the Treaties need to be amended."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I must end."
"We are surely heading for a creative crisis in the Union."
"I believe that, if there is a clear will to resolve the problems, while thinking of our citizens, transparently and publicly, according to Community methods, we will finally end up doing something which was asked of us in this very House by a leader with enormous moral authority: President Havel told us that we needed a clear constitution which we could explain to our children."
"I believe that that can finally help us to guide the future of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, this morning has been your finest hour since you took over the leadership of the European Commission."
"I believe that you have chosen an appropriate moment, that you have spelled out a coherent and significant vision and that you have formulated a challenge with great personal conviction."
"I say to you as a parliamentarian that I note with great respect that it was on the floor of this Chamber that you chose to deliver this important, strategic vision."
"In listening to the debates of recent months - the creeping intergovernmentalism in the wider European debate and the debate in Denmark about almost everything but the euro - I was reminded of the words of a very famous Nobel laureate and Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, when he talked in the context of another political struggle in the following terms: ""The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity"""
"Today, President Prodi, you have shown conviction and passionate intensity."
"I say to you, stay on this path."
"Mobilise this House with you."
"As you know, we will go with you."
"Mobilise your Commission to deliver this message; bring this message to Ecofin; bring this message to the General Affairs Council; bring this message to the capital cities; bring your message to the media; bring your message to the people of Europe."
"We are now having a debate about the heart and soul of the kind of Union we want to build."
"What you have spelled out today in respecting what I call the ""traditional Community method"" - which has been getting a rough ride in recent debates - is an approach which cares about balance and balancing out the differences and the interests of the large and small; which cares about bringing to the European project a capacity to get things done."
"Even in the past when we have chosen the path of intergovernmentalism, in the Schengen agreement for instance, we have discovered that the very lack of instruments which surrounded it has obliged it to start moving back to the Community method."
"In relation to your remarks on Mr Solana there is a very important vision there."
"You saw from the way the House responded that you will have great support in the long term."
"But in the short term, my group deplores the technocrats' coup this summer who in adopting a code of secrecy rather than a code of transparency shut down our right to know, let alone our right to be consulted."
"We will do battle on that."
"We ask you to join us in the name of transparency."
"(Applause)"
"To conclude, on behalf of my group, Mr Prodi has today spelled out what we believe in."
"In another battle in another place Winston Churchill once said that his nation would never surrender and talked about fighting on the beaches, fighting on the landing grounds and fighting in the fields and the streets."
"We have to become street fighters for Europe."
"You have to keep that passionate intensity and get that message across because we are fighting for the heart and soul of what we believe in."
"Madam President, just for once I would like to begin by thanking the two speakers, both the President-in-office of the Council and the President of the Commission, for the quality of their interventions."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Moscovici for the clarity and precision of his words and, in more political terms, for taking up a position in favour of a constitutional process."
"As concerns Mr Prodi, I believe that we must be grateful to him for having courageously pointed out a number of instances of poor administration in our institutions and, above all, for having very clearly called the intergovernmental method into question."
"Having said that, we must not let ourselves be overcome by euphoria."
"Other speakers have already made the point that we must be mindful of the fact that throughout the European Union there is a crisis of confidence in the European Institutions."
"This crisis of confidence has made itself felt itself in Denmark in particular and, even if the result of the vote there can be interpreted in different ways, there can be no doubt that a section of the Danish electorate wanted to indicate a certain lack of confidence in the European Union, not least in its ineffectiveness and lack of political will in terms of social matters, environmental protection and democratic transparency."
"We now find ourselves three months away from the deadline of the Nice Summit, and I believe that the issue at stake is that of restoring this confidence."
"We have to provide a response that is visionary - there would now seem to be room for hope in this regard - and potent."
"We have to jettison something that, sadly, has dominated discussions for too long, a kind of overcautious realism that commonly resembles an inability to act."
"(Applause)"
"A few words on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a subject on which I must beg to differ with the previous speakers."
"This is clearly an exhilarating project."
"The setting up of the Convention represented a major step towards a more democratic Europe, insofar as the process breaks with the intergovernmental approach."
"On this point I agree."
"I would, however, be more critical as concerns the results."
"Indeed, a detailed analysis of the final text reveals a certain imbalance between economic rights and property rights on the one hand, and social rights and environmental rights on the other."
"We find ourselves faced with a paradox with, on one side, a Charter which is relatively weak in political terms and, on the other, a desire not to grant this Charter the essential binding status that would make it a citizens' tool that enabled any European citizen to bring a case before the Court of Justice to uphold their rights."
"As regards the IGC, I now see a glimmer of hope following the sluggish rate of progress in recent months, but it is certain that if, as Mr Moscovici quite clearly stated, the IGC does not relieve the deadlock by next December, particularly regarding the extension of qualified majority voting, which entails abandoning the right of veto and applying codecision in a more widespread way, this would constitute a setback and we would have to carry on."
"I believe that deferring the issue would be the worst possible option, both for the citizens of Europe and for the citizens of the candidate countries."
"As regards enlargement, I do not have time to go into detail but I would like to conclude, Madam President, by stressing the importance of another aspect of enlargement."
"We expect candidate countries to adapt their institutions, economies and legislative systems, but we must also adapt our own policies."
"The main challenge before us is that of preventing the European Union from becoming nothing more than one large market place with 500 million consumers and with major structural imbalances."
"I believe that if we are to meet this challenge, we must launch, at Nice, a constitutional process that will enable this radical reform of the institutions, this restructuring of the hierarchy of values, and which will finally place free trade somewhere other than at the top of the agenda."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I am with you completely, Mr Prodi, when you highlight the limitations of the current intergovernmental model, and I would go even further in my criticism than you."
"It is, in many ways, a timeworn, if not fossilised system that we must leave behind."
"But the way forward certainly does not lie in the centralisation of powers in the hands of the Commission."
"In my view, it is the institutional system as a whole, including the Commission, that should be transformed, and the new factor that must lie at the heart of these changes are the operators that form part of the social movement, the citizens, those people who were notably absent from your speech."
"I would urge you to listen very closely to what I say next."
"""Ordinary people have realised that a certain model of public administration ... has reached its limits."""
"""This crisis of governance has hit the Union head-on."""
"""The Union was founded and is still being constructed behind closed doors rather than in the open."""
"But ""Europeans are less and less willing to be presented with a fait accompli."""
"""What has to become democratic is the whole process, from pinpointing the basic problem to implementing and assessing the solution."""
"""A case of ... letting the key players and interests play a greater part."""
"This is ""the political challenge confronting Europe today"" ."
"These are not my own words."
"They are taken from a document that was commissioned by your predecessor, President Santer, almost two years ago from the Commission' s own Forward Studies Unit, before being shelved."
"I nevertheless find it extremely clear-sighted."
"Our ambition should be to convince the people of Europe to join together in their diversity and thus become masters of their common destiny."
"It is my belief that if we are to succeed we need a participatory democracy, social advances, bonds of solidarity, designs for civilisation and ethical inspiration."
"I have heard no mention of these this morning."
"In short, we need politics in the true sense of the word, since it is on this that the future of Europe hinges."
"Madam President, the decision of the Danish people on 28 September on participation in the European currency regime will undoubtedly figure at the Biarritz European Council meeting."
"EU Member State governments must now seriously reflect on what has happened in Denmark."
"The Danish decision comes two months before EU leaders are to meet in Nice to reform existing EU treaties and policies."
"I support the enlargement of the European Union."
"It will help consolidate democratic and civil structures in eastern and central Europe, expand market economies and help build a European continent at peace with itself."
"However, EU Member State governments face difficult choices."
"We cannot deny that the Danish people used the recent referendum as a test of confidence in the structures of the European Union."
"The referendum in Denmark had more to do with the direction of the European Union and future political integration than actually participating in the Euro currency itself."
"Serious concern was expressed among Danish voters that the elimination of tax vetoes within the European Union would dissipate future social security benefits."
"I do not necessarily support this."
"However, the point remains the same: namely that the European Member State governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament have a serious battle on their hands to persuade the 370 million citizens of the European Union that greater political and economic integration is the way forward for the European Union."
"This is the core issue."
"If Member State governments push the issue of political integration too far in Nice, we will have real difficulties in securing approval in the referendums which will have to be held in various European Union countries."
"Any reform of European Union treaties must be fair and balanced."
"It must protect the interests of the smaller Member States, and we must not help build a two-tier Europe where larger Member States run the European Union at the expense of the smaller Member States."
"We must also protect national cultural and linguistic diversity."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, Mr Moscovici, it is precisely the Charter of Fundamental Rights that will, at Biarritz, provide the solutions to institutional problems."
"Granted, this text may seem commonplace at first sight, but it takes on great meaning in the light of topical events."
"The protection of human dignity and liberty, cited in the preamble, would resonate loudly in Palestine, for example."
"And in Article 21, it may seem like verbiage, especially in our 15 Member States, to worry about discrimination on the grounds of religion or ethnic origin, when elsewhere twelve-year-old boys are being shot like so much vermin precisely because of their religion."
"It could even be seen as insulting to these adolescents, who actually face discrimination and death."
"We need a sense of perspective, a sense of the proportionality set out in Article 48 of the Charter, before voicing off from our own standpoint as relatively well off in human rights terms."
"It is, moreover, this sense of perspective that will provide the solutions at Nice, since it will at last be possible to enlarge the Union to include, for example, the Poland of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II or, at a later date, orthodox Russia, the eastern sentinel of the Christian world, and it will be possible to do so without disrupting operating procedures."
"All we need do is apply the philosophical principles set out in the Charter."
"Therefore, in the name of the respect for national identities set out in the preamble, there must be a Council of Ministers which unanimously agrees with the fundamental freedom of nations."
"In the name of respect for the equality of all men, living together as a State, there must be at least one Commissioner per Member State and, lastly, in the name of prohibiting the types of discrimination set out in Article 21 of the Charter, there must be no two- or three-speed Union, because all the members of the same family living in the house called Europe must move into the future together without leaving anyone behind."
"That is what the Charter stipulates."
"Let us not violate it before it is even applied."
"Mr President, judging by what I have heard recently, one could be forgiven for believing that nothing of any great importance happened on 28 September."
"It nevertheless seems to me that Denmark has just given us a lesson in democracy."
"The Danish people seized this opportunity to send us an unequivocal message, and we should be thankful for it."
"In saying no, the Danes have shown that Europe cannot be built without, or against the wishes of, those for whom it is a day-to-day reality."
"They have shown that Europe is currently on the wrong track."
"Indeed, rather than being an inclusive Europe, it seems to be becoming a Europe for the few."
"Let us not, for all this, slip into caricature."
"Rejecting one type of European model does not make one anti-European."
"It would be a crass mistake to think that it did."
"It is essential, on the eve of the Biarritz Summit, for the European Heads of State and Government to fully grasp the message addressed to them."
"Beyond the Danish 'no' vote, it is a call for a genuine Europe of differences, based on respect for peoples and for their diversity. This is what constitutes the real wealth of Europe."
"This right to difference and to respect is what must underpin any debate on institutional affairs, particularly at Biarritz."
"This is vital if we are to stop Europe drifting off course as it is now, seeking an identity somewhere between harmonisation and standardisation, which Europeans, quite justifiably, find so difficult to accept."
"Unfortunately, this would seem to be the path that the Intergovernmental Conference wants to follow, by focusing on the extension of qualified majority voting."
"The environment, for example, will not be protected more efficiently as a result of our wanting to impose a policy that ignores economic realities and peoples' needs."
"Let us therefore take advantage of the current discussions within the IGC to redefine, at last, a system that has reached its limits."
"The current desire to extend qualified majority voting will not bring Europe closer to the citizens."
"On the contrary, it will leave those who do not accept the single mindset by the wayside."
"These internal tensions will not strengthen Europe' s hand in international negotiations."
"Just how many different speeds will there be in the Europe towards which you want to lead us?"
"Here are just a few of the many avenues which could be explored."
"We need, for example, to agree to and facilitate subsidiarity."
"Europe must limit its responsibilities to those that the States cannot effectively assume alone."
"The principle of the free movement of goods and persons should promote trade and exposure to other cultures and other ways of life, rather than standardising everything."
"We need to hand the initiative back to the political arena and restore the initiative to the people."
"We must, in conclusion, listen to the people more closely, respect their opinions, and seek to understand why it is they are turning their backs on Europe as it is now."
"Then we will all be able to move forward together."
"Mr President, ""nel decimo anniversario dell'unificazione tedesca"", as you said, Mr Prodi, the European Union Summit will be held in the Basque country, a country torn to pieces."
"The southern part under Spanish rule is split into two autonomous regions: Navarre and the so-called Euskadi."
"The northern part under French rule has no official recognition whatsoever, despite the clear will of two thirds of the citizens and elected representatives to have a Basque département of its own."
"How can the European Union meet in Biarritz to announce a new declaration of fundamental rights for European citizens whilst the most elementary rights of the Basque people, namely language and self-administration, are thoroughly denied?"
"Mr Prodi, can we, the Basques, live in Europe without our internal iron curtain?"
"Mr President, I wish firstly, as other previous speakers have done, to congratulate President Prodi on his speech."
"The applause that rounded it off clearly demonstrates that when there is a specific political objective, this Parliament can be relied upon to support it."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Moscovici."
"Mr Moscovici brilliantly presented the issue which I am going to focus on, and nobody will be surprised that I am going to focus on the question of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"His intervention was wonderful up until the final minute when I did not understand what he was saying."
"Why do I say that he gave an extraordinary speech?"
"Because he acknowledged something which we are all satisfied with. The Convention method has worked and the truth is that it has been something of a miracle."
"I am not so surprised, but some of you will say that a Christian Democrat who does not believe in miracles is not a good Christian Democrat."
"Therefore, I do believe in miracles and the convention has been a miracle."
"Personal representatives of the governments, MEPs and national MPs, together with the Commission, reaching an agreement on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in ten months, seemed an impossible objective."
"We have done so, however, and I believe this is wonderful news for the European Union."
"It is wonderful that today we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of German unification and it is wonderful that we are today just a few years away from a great enlargement of the Union."
"The method has therefore worked, and so has the content of the Charter."
"Mr Moscovici has said so very expressively."
"The content of the Charter is good."
"At the Feira European Council, President Guterres told us: ""Do not worry about the legal value."
"Create a good Charter ""."
"We have done so. I have not read any criticisms of the content of the Charter."
"Previous speakers have spoken well of the Charter because it is a good Charter which brings together the classic rights of the nineteenth Century and the modern rights of the twenty-first century."
"It is a Charter for the citizens, who have participated actively in its creation."
"It has been said here that this has been a virtual reality Charter."
"We now have a situation where, having created a Charter with good content and by means of an original method - and here I am reaching the last part of Mr Moscovici' s speech - we are now told that we are going to announce it and then wait and see what happens in the future."
"The argument of the President-in-Office of the Council is that there is a risk that the Charter will not be accepted by all the Member States as legally binding."
"That is a risk, it is true."
"But I believe things are changing, Mr Moscovici."
"I believe that at the beginning many governments had serious doubts, but now they have changed their minds."
"There are some - the Spanish Government has said this very clearly recently - who are in favour of incorporating the Charter into the Treaties."
"However, even if what you say is true, and there are some governments who do not want it incorporated into the Treaties, I must say very clearly that the citizens of Europe and the Members of this Parliament have the right to know who those governments are."
"We have the right to know. We must be told who does not want the Charter in the Treaties."
"Mr President of the Council, I therefore encourage you to continue the aims of a predecessor of yours in another convention and the French Presidency should have de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace [boldness, again boldness and ever boldness]."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission has just told us that in matters of democracy there is no room for subsidiarity."
"Well I would like to say that there is no room for subsidiarity in matters of human rights either."
"Until yesterday, the Union was somewhat deprived in this respect."
"For, before the value of human rights, which is a European Union value, could be ours, we needed a text, a Charter, to establish its characteristics."
"This Charter is primarily a charter for the inhabitants of the European Union, and I believe that it is also a charter for all those who want to join that Union."
"It is an extremely powerful political message, the importance of which must be emphasised, for when we talk about the Copenhagen criteria, these can sometimes prove a little limited when it comes to the rights of the individual."
"I believe that a solution has now been found to this problem."
"This Charter should form part of the acquis communautaire."
"We have been told that things are not going well in Europe."
"Yet how can we answer the question of what we wish to achieve together if we do not have, as the very least, a Charter of this quality?"
"I believe that we are at an important juncture."
"The fact that 62 people, from different and sometimes conflicting backgrounds, have managed to reach a consensus and draw up a single document in the space of nine months, under the unrelenting gaze of civil society, would in fact seem to be a sign of the political health of our Union, and something that we cannot but welcome."
"The mandate given at Cologne was, as has been said, a limited mandate."
"The Heads of State and Government did not make our task any easier."
"It was a mandate under which we were unable to create new rights or develop any of the Union's responsibilities, and which some parties sought to interpret as a straightforward licence to transcribe certain articles from the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I believe that, as faithful servants of this Parliament, we used the mandate, all the mandate but not just the mandate, and I cannot but welcome this."
"The Charter is now accessible to everyone, it is easy to interpret and it is clear."
"I also feel, however, that it includes some major advances, and that also means in relation to current texts."
"We cannot but welcome this text, and take pride in speaking in favour of it today."
"Concerning the content, and while I am aware that we will have a chance to return to this matter during our debate in November, I would immediately like to highlight certain points."
"This is the first international-level document to recognise the indivisibility of rights."
"We now have proof that this is possible, and this is taking place at European level."
"I believe, once again, that we can be proud of this."
"Moreover, for the first time, we have a gender-neutral text."
"This gives me, as a French speaking woman, great cause for satisfaction, although I am sure that this satisfaction will not solely be felt by French speakers."
"As I have just said, this Charter recognises new rights."
"From this point of view it is a modern text, which acknowledges rights in the fields of biotechnology, data protection, the environment and good administration."
"Furthermore, I believe that the very structure of our text, as you yourself have stressed, Mr Moscovici, is an original one."
"The rights of the individual will never again be discussed in the same light, because now the prime right, the founding right, is the right to dignity."
